			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Chernyak: "Finances: National Economy </F> in the Throes of Foreign Debt"]    [Text] Sharp discussions in Ukraine have recently  focused on currency control, particularly currency policy and  disposition of income. Primary concerns deal with the rational  use of a fixed currency exchange rate.    In an inflationary situation a fixed rate of currency  exchange rapidly loses meaning, especially when inflation is  prolonged. The results are an increase in imports and a decrease  in exports, the need to support the currency abroad, and  transformation of Ukraine into a supplier of capital for other  countries, especially Russia. In fact, Russia regards a fixed  rate of exchange in Ukraine as a source of income in their  economic plans for 1994.    The IMF calculated that in 1993 Ukraine lost 1.3 billion  U.S.  dollars because of state of affairs.    The negative balance of payment is destroying Ukrainian  potential as an exporter and further exacerbates Ukrainian  foreign debt, which in 1993 reached 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.  This spells total economic ruin.    The obvious solution is to institute a market-controlled  floating exchange rate for the karbovanets vis-a-vis the U.S.  dollar and the ruble. Many experts agree on this course of  action, including the IMF and V. Yushchenko, head of the  Ukrainian National Bank (UNB). With certain economic  adjustments, this approach makes sense theoretically and  conceptually.    The best alternative for Ukraine at present is a controlled  exchange rate, i.e., a free-floating rate during a transitional  period until Ukraine develops a stable monetary system to  support all financial transactions.    An absolute prerequisite for a floating exchange rate is the  creation of a stabilizing fund to control the supply and demand  for currency and alleviate the loss of millions of dollars at  the UNB used to cover billions in foreign debts.    How did Russia manage to introduce a floating rate of  exchange without a stabilizing fund? For one thing, Russia has a  positive balance of trade thanks to its exports of fuel, raw  products and armanents, all of which raises the value of the  ruble with respect to the coupon-karbovanets. For another,  unlike Ukraine, Russia can also intervene in the monetary  market, while the contrived high ruble-to-karbovanets ratio  assures a positive balance of trade with Ukraine by charging a  lot for goods exported to Ukraine and paying little for goods  imported from Ukraine. This is neocolonialism in the finest  sense of the word and makes it possible for Russia to agree to a  disproportionately low ruble-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate.    The UNB advocates a 100 percent mandatory regulation of  currency in relation to market conditions, based on the  theoretical arguments that this will ensure a more realistic and  accurate exchange rate.    While theoretically true, such a course may screen subsidies  at the UNB unless mandatory--but liberal--taxation is introduced  to stimulate exports and increase flow of capital into the  country. The current national deficit is due precisely to the  lack of such taxes.    Money for the national monetary fund would come from taxes  on  exports, the selling of exported goods at the prevalent global  prices, and recovery of export subsidies.    The Ukrainian foreign debt is an artificial creation of the  accord signed between Ukraine and Russia in Moscow in October  1992. In it, Ukraine assumed responsibility for the debts of its  industry, while Russia did incur an analogous obligation for its  industry. Furthermore, Ukraine agreed to sell its goods at below  market value and to charge virtually nothing for the transit of  Russian goods and those of other CIS countries across Ukrainian  territory. Finally, Ukraine agreed to ineffective import-export,  tariff, and monetary policies which make our products  uncompetitive on the CIS market. Consequently, without drastic  reforms in our foreign trade policies it will be impossible to  eliminate Ukraine's foreign debt.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Bank of Scotland Bank of Scotland has seen some erosion in its premium over the rest of the sector over the past year. But a running yield of little more than 5 per cent still suggests the market is expecting above average growth. In that context, an increase of only 3 per cent in first-half profits before provisions is disappointing news. It compares, for example, with a first-half increase of 16 per cent at Barclays and 11 per cent at National Westminster. Although the measure is crude, profits before provisions were only 16 per cent of shareholders funds at the halfway stage compared with 21 per cent for both Barclays and NatWest. Arguably a smaller return is justified by Bank of Scotland's sound lending record and low provision rate compared with its peers. It could also be sensible to expand lending at the bottom of the cycle when competition is thin and collateral values have already fallen. Yet, the nagging worry remains that the return is too low. Part of the problem is a rapid rise in operating costs. Part is almost certainly the bank's relatively heavy dependence on expensive wholesale funding. Its reluctance to develop an extensive branch network south of the border makes it harder to attract retail deposits. By concentrating on these issues as well as volume, the bank could enhance its earnings. That might slow the fall in its tier 1 capital ratio. At 6.1 per cent the figure is perfectly comfortable, but it is still 0.7 points lower than a year ago.</p>

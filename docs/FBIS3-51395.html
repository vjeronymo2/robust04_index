			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Frantz Robert Monde, new president of the  Chamber of Deputies and a member of the Socialist bloc presented  himself on 17 January as an arbiter between the various  political sensitivities of this institution and as a democrat.  Mr. Monde, who addressed a news conference, pointedly refuted  the label of extremist. Recalling his past as a Duvalierist  militant and his current democratic commitment, he stated that  only God and idiots do not change. The Haitian democracy must  be a struggle of ideas but not of men, he added, while coming  out in favor of a national conference to get out of the crisis.  We, Haitians, must sit around a table to work out a strategy to  get out of the crisis, a strategy that would honor the country,  he stated. [passage omitted]    Monde said he is against reducing the Haitian Army as  requested by some political sectors, but he does wish to create  a police force to solve the problem of repression in Haiti.  [passage omitted]    Furthermore, he pointed out that he had warned the officials  of the Revolutionary Front Haitian Advancement and Progress,  FRAPH, the main neo-Duvalier party, that he would not tolerate a  deputy being manhandled or persecuted by this group. He met with  the leader of this group, Mr. Louis Jodel Chamblain. Any deputy  must be able to go to his district, he pointed out, while saying  he is ready, if necessary, to accompany some parliamentarians.  He also assured the press of his support, asserting that he  will firmly intervene every time a journalist has problems in  fulfilling his duty. [passage omitted]</p>

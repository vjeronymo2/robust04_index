			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Krayukhin, St. Petersburg] </F>   [Text] A center for treating children infected with AIDS  opened in the hospital in the village of Ust-Izhora near St.  Petersburg.    Children have gathered there together with their parents  from  Russia's various regions, primarily from the Russian  hinterlands. The reputation of the Ust-Izhora oblast hospital is  already quite high, and not only in medical circles. Sufficient  experience and professional skills of center employees are  magnified here by their rare good will and responsiveness to  each patient. The high level of laboratory diagnostics, modern  treatment procedures augmented by total anonymity of  treatment--all this is very important for the parents who are  trying to protect their children from today's and tomorrow's  psychological traumas.    The work of this unique children's center became possible  due  to the assistance of labor leaders from the Norwegian city of  Tronheim.</p>

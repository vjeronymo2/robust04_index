			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Yoweri Museveni has called upon the  seventh Pan-African congress to analyze the internal weaknesses  in Africa which make the continent vulnerable to foreign  domination so that solutions can be designed. The president,  who was opening the seventh Pan-African congress at the  conference center in Kampala today, told the congress  participants that in order to emancipate ourselves from foreign  domination we as Africans must know what to do. He described  the Kampala congress as a good moment to make a correct  diagnosis so that Africa gets an answer.    Mr. Museveni attributed Africa's problem to internal African  weaknesses both now and in the past and to external greed by  outside powers. He identified the main internal weaknesses of  Africa as lack of technology and poor organization but stressed  the question of poor organization as having played the most  crucial role. He said that countries such as China, Ethiopia,  and Japan, although inferior in technology, were able to defend  their sovereignty due to a high level of organization.    Mr. Museveni also attributed Africa's problems to Africa's  self- inflicted damage. He explained that one of the most  important factors to be independent is production, and yet  African governments have continuously interfered with production  by imposing various obstacles such as roadblocks, visas, and  marketing monopolies. He said African governments have  themselves interfered with sovereignty in Africa. He therefore  called upon the seventh Pan-African congress to examine their  self-inflicted damages and come up with solutions.    On the question of reparations to Africa by Europe and  America, Mr. Museveni said that these countries have a moral  responsibility to pay for the damage inflicted on Africa by  their ancestors. He stressed that Africa will emancipate  herself with or without the sympathy of her former oppressors.  However he was of the view that compensation for the past  injustices is likely to come when Africa demands it from a  position of strength not from one of weakness. He therefore  commended the seventh Pan-African congress slogan of Organize  But Do Not Agonize, saying that it is definitely within our  means to end domination.    Mr. Museveni elaborated that he personally had been fighting  to end domination for the last 29 years and, although he has not  ended domination completely, he has pushed it back. Elaborating  on who are the members of the Pan-African movement, Mr. Museveni  categorized these as the black Africans on the African  Continent, the Africans in the Arab region, the Africans in the  Diaspora, and whites in South Africa whom he referred to as a  new African tribe. He appealed to all Pan-Africanists not to  draw ideology into the movement but to accept all  Pan-Africanists, both radical and reactionaries, as members of  the movement. [passage omitted]</p>

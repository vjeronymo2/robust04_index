			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by DEN Analytical Center: "Baturin Is Against </F> Counterintelligence"]    [Text] From the report "Political Technologists in a  Systems Crisis" prepared by the DEN Analytical Center.    The events of the first half of March 1994, and most of all  the subject of the so-called "state coup" and the "introduction  of a state of emergency," are indicative of the severe  exacerbation of contradictions in the present political  establishment and the beginning of practical preparations by  various groups for the post-Yeltsin period...    Despite his degradation as a political figure (for reasons  of  personal health and intellectual incompetence), Yeltsin  nevertheless continues to play an important role in the existing  political structure: He is a deterrent to influential political  groups, preventing them from starting a ruthless "showdown"  among themselves.    ...The main principle of such a game consists of the  following: The weakest groups (or group) must persistently try  to clash with key political forces in order to weaken them as  much as possible. The increase in confrontation between the main  opponents makes it possible for "weaklings" to intensify their  influence by playing one against the other. The game becomes  especially effective if the president himself is involved  (directly or indirectly).    Taking Yeltsin's maniacal mistrustfulness into account, it  would be rather simple to use him to play out such a maneuver...    ...Yuriy Baturin-- assistant to the president for  national security. Adequate knowledge and experience in problems  of national security lacking. Main characteristics as an  individual: tenacious and good memory, manipulator ("Physical  and Technology Institute"--self-determination) type of  mentality, pragmatic cynicism, and political immorality.  Extremely ambitious, but is able to conceal this. A sanguine  introvert. Has a high indicator on the F-scale. Presence of  complexes that are characteristic of a schizophrenic type of  personality.    ...Baturin has a different status in the Kremlin structure  that distinguishes him from Ilyushin and Sukhanov (Yeltsin's  traditional inner circle), as well as from Filatov (who has  support in the democratic environment). At the same time, Yu.  Baturin uses the rivalry of Ilyushin and Filatov rather  effectively.    Yu. Baturin's "brilliant" resourcefulness, which enabled him  to acquire colossal influence over Yeltsin, who is becoming  decrepit, was in linking the concept of "national security" with  the concept of Yeltsin's "security."    Yu. Baturin took active part in preparation of the state  coup  in December 1992, worked on documents for the March coup (1993),  and perfected the grievously known Edict No. 1400. He  simultaneously reinforced his bureaucratic status. At the same  time, Baturin, as a representative of an independent team, as  before, is one of the weakest figures of the Russian political  establishment.    Considering Yeltsin's traditional hatred for and fear of the  KGB, Yu. Baturin prepared an edict on reformation of the FCS  [Federal Counterintelligence Service], which was already on the  president's desk in the Kremlin on 2 March. Nevertheless,  Yeltsin signed a document on the assignment of S. Stepashin  instead of N. Galushko as director of the FCS (according to some  information, Filatov lobbied for Stepashin).    Literally on the second day, Baturin informed Yeltsin of the  unsatisfactory work of the FCS, the lack of information from it  that Yeltsin needs (although the last eight analytical documents  from counterintelligence were held up on Baturin's desk).  Simultaneously, he mentioned the negative attitude toward  Yeltsin of a majority of FCS employees and reported on a speech  being prepared by Skokov against Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin.    On 5 March, Yeltsin arranged a dressing down of Stepashin  and  refused to meet with him personally in the future (!), and  demanded that Stepashin report to him every day at 0900 by  telephone.    It was on Baturin's advice that Yeltsin congratulated women  on 7 March in order to demonstrate to the whole country that he  was healthy and able to function.    Later, new rumors were also started, in particular about the  possibility of a coup d'etat on 17 March; a "version 1" appeared  that was absolutely absurd in its internal contradictions, etc.    All serious observers realize that in the current situation  neither the armed forces nor the MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs) will resort to the use of force. Grachev, encountering  the formation of at least four rival groups among the armed  forces leadership, once again turned to the formula "the armed  forces are outside politics." Even "hero of Russia" Yerin  replied to a direct question from the president that he will  carry out only a written order (but in his own circle he  expressed doubt even about this). The "irreconcilable  opposition" is significantly weaker today than before the  October events, and therefore it will not be able to undertake  anything serious.    But what did Baturin achieve? First, nervousness and  uncertainty among the politically active part of society have  increased. Second, it seems the ground is being prepared for  unexpected personnel changes "at the top," whose initiator very  likely will be the "diffident" Yu. Baturin. Third, as a result  of "the March games," Baturin's ties with some "young" leaders  have been strengthened. It is not accidental that G. Burbulis  cooperated with him actively during these weeks (in recent weeks  G.E. finally realized that he can be transformed from a  secondary to a tertiary political figure).    ...Sixth, the action taken in March has hindered the  objective process of forming coalition ties inside the ruling  establishment itself, and it has made the leaders of different  groups even more cautious.    ...So, Baturin has remained a "weakling," but today he is  already a much more influential "weakling."</p>

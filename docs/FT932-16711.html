			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Books: Preserved in ash THE MOST spectacular finds from the exciting excavations over the last quarter-century at Akrotiri on Thera (Santorini) in the Aegean have been the 3,500-year-old wall paintings. Preserved by the ash when the volcanic island erupted in the Late Bronze Age, they reveal an undreamt of sophistication in the life of the rich island town coupled with a keen eye for nature. Restoration is continuing of the pictures of marine scenes, rites of passage for the young men, swallows in spring, monkeys, antelopes, and women gathering saffron. The smart woman above has still to be fitted into a larger composition. She appears in The Wall-paintings of Thera by Christos Doumas (The Thera Foundation, Pounds 39, 191 pages), which illustrates all the fabulous pictures recovered to date with a wealth of stunning photographs - a treat of a book.</p>

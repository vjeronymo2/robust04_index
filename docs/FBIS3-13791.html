In the wake of the Palestinian worshippers' massacre by a  radical Zionist and his collaborators, last 27 February, and the  martyrdom of more than 60 Palestinians and wounding of many  others, the world public opinion once again observed the  criminal and inhuman character of the Zionist regime.    The dimensions of the Zionist crime in al-Khalil went to the  extent that the Security Council, in its capacity as an  international institution, was expected to quickly and properly  react to it. But, similar to earlier predictions, U.S.  pressures, and the excuse that the Security Council's posturing  should not jeopardize the peace process, diverted the Council  from its main course, which was required to be taken in the wake  of the al-Khalil crime.    Political circles have described the delay in the issuance  of  the Security Council resolution as the result of harmony between  the U.S. and Israel over encouraging and also compelling the  Palestinians and the Arabs to attend the peace talks.    Under such conditions, Security Council Resolution 904,  which  was unanimously approved paragraph-wise and without any voting,  yesterday, gave America the opportunity to cast a vote of  abstention. Thus the vote of abstention came in case of  paragraphs two and six of the instruction to the resolution,  that expressed concern over the consequences of the  Palestinians' deaths in the occupied lands and the need for  maintaining security of the Palestinian nation, and also  stressed the necessity for enforcing the fourth Geneva  Convention in the territories under Israeli occupation.    Political experts, despite the stress that has been laid in  resolution 904 on the need for Israel to provide the Palestinian  safety and security in the occupied lands, and also Tel Aviv's  ban on the Zionist settlers' illegal and violent acts, and a  request to America and Russia to extend necessary support to  implementation of the resolution, have expressed pessimism over  any change in the current situation of the occupied lands. They  believe that the record of the Zionist regime, in its capacity  as a regime fully backed by America, will bring forth nothing  but aggression, breach of human rights, and suppression in the  occupied territories.</p>

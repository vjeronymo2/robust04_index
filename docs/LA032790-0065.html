			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Lucille Gathers, mother of the late Loyola Marymount player, Hank Gathers, said  she rooted for Loyola against Nevada Las Vegas Sunday despite misgivings about  how officials handled the situation when her son collapsed during a game and  died March 4.  </P> <P> "I don't think they did all they could have done," she told the Philadelphia  Inquirer.  </P> <P> "They were just standing around, and nobody was doing anything.  </P> <P> "My sister got to the floor a couple of minutes before I did, when he went  down, and when I got there, she was screaming, 'Do something! Somebody do  something!' And when I got there, I started screaming too. It just seemed like  nobody was doing anything. Just standing around."  </P> <P> Of Loyola's 131-101 loss in the NCAA West Regional final, she said: "This  wouldn't have happened if Hank had been there. He always gave 200%. Him and Bo  (Kimble). It was the Hank and Bo Show."  </P></p>

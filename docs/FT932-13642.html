			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Littlewoods forms US-style warehouse club joint venture LITTLEWOODS, the privately-owned retailing and football pools organisation, has formed a joint venture with Price Club Canada and aims to open at least one US-style warehouse club in the UK before the end of the year. The announcement ends several months of speculation in the retail trade about Price Club's plans in the UK. Warehouse clubs - forecast to have a significant impact on UK retailing - sell a limited range of food and non-food goods at low prices from industrial-style premises to members who pay a small annual fee. Costco, the third-largest US warehouse operator, has taken two sites in the UK, and Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the UK cash-and-carry operator, said this month that it would open two warehouse outlets. Littlewoods yesterday reported unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 97m for 1992, on turnover up from Pounds 2.59bn to Pounds 2.71bn. The company said trading had been difficult, with turnover for its retail businesses, which include the department store chain, mail order division and Index catalogue stores, up only 1.6 per cent to Pounds 1.9bn (Pounds 1.87bn). However, total profits from retail operations increased 4.3 per cent to Pounds 79.7m (Pounds 76.4m), thanks partly to interest received of Pounds 4.9m, com-pared with a Pounds 6.2m charge in 1991. That reflected the group's success in reducing borrowings from Pounds 50.8m to Pounds 6.1m, through reductions in stock levels and bad debts. Littlewoods chain stores saw sales fall from Pounds 704m to Pounds 696m, in spite of opening two new stores. Profits fell 8 per cent to Pounds 28m (Pounds 30.3m). The home shopping division increased sales by Pounds 8m to Pounds 974m , but profits were static at Pounds 55.9m. A 12 per cent increase in sales at the Index catalogue stores to Pounds 228m, largely the result of 10 new openings, could not stop losses increasing from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 9.1m. Littlewoods said this was due to the cost of developing Index and pressure on mar-gins from severe price competition. The contribution from the football pools interests rose from Pounds 19.9m to Pounds 21.6m. Mr Barry Dale, chief executive, said he hoped the venture with Price Club would 'herald the beginning of a new wholesale concept for the UK.' Price Club is a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of The Price Company, the second-largest US operator of warehouse clubs with 94 warehouses in the US and Canada, and turnover of Dollars 6.6bn (Pounds 4.37bn) in 1991. Littlewoods said its club would be restricted to wholesale customers, and was likely to be sited in north-west England.</p>

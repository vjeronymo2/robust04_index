			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "L.C."] </F>   [Text] The Ninth National Assembly Standing Committee  recently decided that the Fifth National Assembly Session will  open on 25 May and that its planned closing date will be 23  June.    According to the schedule, the session will examine and pass  six draft laws, including the draft labor code, the draft law on  domestic investment promotion, the draft law on taxes on the  transfer of land ownership, the draft of the (revised) law on  military service, the draft of the revised law on people's  council and people's committee organizations, and the draft of  the revised law on people's council elections. The session will  also consider a draft civil code.    With the draft law on the state budget in particular, the  committee initially planned to present this legislation for  passage at the Fifth National Assembly Session. Later the  committee was requested by the government to ask the National  Assembly to postpone consideration until the Sixth National  Assembly Session, as this draft law is very important and may  affect socioeconomic development.    The session will hear a government report and consider  implementation of the resolution on practicing thrift, fighting  wasteful spending, corruption, and smuggling.    The session will also include reports on the National  Assembly Standing Committee, the Supreme People's Court, the  Supreme People's Organ of Control, the Nationalities Council,  and other National Assembly committees during the first six  months of 1994.</p>

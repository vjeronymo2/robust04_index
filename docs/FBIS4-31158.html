			<p>BFN     [Text] The Press and Information Department of the Slovak  Government Office has published its stance on statements made by  Vladimir Meciar, the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia]  chairman, about the coalition government. The department's  statement says that Meciar's repeated statements about the  existence of secret agreements within the current government  coalition -- according to which the Jozef Moravcik cabinet is  alleged to have assumed the obligation to fulfill the demands  outlined in eight points by the political entities representing  the Hungarian national minority -- have revealed that the HZDS  is completely under the influence of demagogic lies.    In its statement, the Press and Information Department of  the  Slovak Government Office once again stresses that there are no  secret agreements obliging the current government to fulfill the  above-mentioned number of demands. What does exist is the  government program statement adopted by the National Council.    The statement goes on to stress that the HZDS chairman's  criticism of the course of privatization is equally self-serving  and demagogic, as it was his cabinet that slowed down the  transformation of the economy -- something that resulted in last  year's results of the Slovak economy being worse than those of  the Czech economy.    The Press and Information Department of the Government  Office  concludes its statement reacting to some statements by Vladimir  Meciar by pointing out that his statements are creating  preconditions for a radicalization of our society.</p>

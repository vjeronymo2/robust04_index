			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Books: In at the death THE MAN WITH NIGHT SWEATS Thom Gunn Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 11.99/Pounds 5.99, 88 pages THE THOM Gunn 'thing' is a kind of sudden but smoothly achieved emphasis on an abstract state ('Nothing moves / at the edges of the mind', from the 1967 volume, Touch), an exploration of wilful, restless states; ('One is always nearer by not keeping still', from the earlier Sense of Movement), or a delineation of impersonal force - that 'disinterested hard energy' with which 'My Sad Captains' turn 'like the stars'. It is a poetic voice responding variously to post-war Sartrean existentialism, the aesthetic tough-mindedness of Gunn's temporary mentor Yvor Winters, and Gunn's personal experience as a homosexual. Though I suppose Gunn has been 'out' as a homosexual for most of his life (he moved to San Francisco in 1960 when he was 31), he only came out in verse with the 1982 volume lubriciously entitled The Passages of Joy; but reading his earlier work with hindsight one cannot fail to be aware of a mode of perception and sensibility that is quite specifically 'gay': perhaps one could describe it as an enchanted critique of the imperatives of toughness. In Passages there were poems actually about gay sex; and in its successor, Gunn's latest verse collection, The Man with Night Sweats, that sensibility and perception are as distinct as ever, but the sex act has been largely supplanted by the death act, and in the tragedy of AIDS Gunn has found his natural unnatural subject. The last of the book's four sections is devoted to AIDS pieces, which Gunn wishes to stand as memorials to the friends whose miseries and braveries inspired them (their names are listed in an afterword), and which amount to a significant expansion of the scope of poetry. Loss and death have always been lyric poetry's proper domain, but hardly ever before have the discomfort, bewilderment and sheer existential fact of dying been taken over so decisively by verse. Not even Douglas Dunn's superb book of Elegies (1985) for his wife who died from cancer gives quite so sharp a focus to the subjective experience of dying: the poet's concern is primarily his own bereavement. But in Gunn's title-poem and pieces like 'Lament', 'Sacred Heart' and 'Courtesies of the Interregnum', he penetrates with dazzling empathy into the inward agony of dying, is somehow able, though not directly threatened by death himself, to render its appalling lonely specificity. Gunn has risen to his inescapable new subject with verse of quiddity and depth and terrible truthfulness. Among the book's other sections are equally fine pieces such as 'Nasturtium' and the AIDS-related 'All Do Not All Things Well' and some acute vignettes of low life (''Well Dennis O'Grady', 'Old Meg') which recall Gunn's manner in the delightful 1966 collection of his poems and his brother's photographs, Positives, a title that would seem harshly ironic now.</p>

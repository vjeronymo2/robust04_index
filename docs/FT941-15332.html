			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Objections to Robb's job at Wellcome Institutional investors in Wellcome have voiced their objections to the appointment yesterday of Mr John Robb as both chairman and chief executive of the drugs company. Mr Robb conceded that 'of the 10 or so institutional investors consulted over the decision . . . one voiced serious object-ions.' But another institutional shareholder pointed to part of the company's annual report last year which affirmed its commitment to the principle of splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive between two people. 'It seems unfortunate that (the Wellcome board) combed the length and breadth of Britain and have not been able to find a suitable candidate', he said. The company's choice for chairman, Sir Anthony Tennant, chairman of Christies International, the auctioneer, and former chairman of Guinness, the drinks group, was yesterday appointed deputy chairman. 'He allowed it to be known that he would not accept the post of chairman', said Mr Clive Thompson, a non-executive director of Wellcome and chief executive of Rentokil, the services group. Mr Robb, who has been acting chairman of Wellcome since the summer, defended his appointment against criticisms that it was contrary to the recommendations of the 1992 Cadbury report on corporate governance, which also recommended that the roles be split. 'There is too much emphasis on splitting the roles rather than getting the right people at the top.' Mr Thompson backed Mr Robb saying that 'the chemistry of the board members is more important than the structure of the board'.</p>

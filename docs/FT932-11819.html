			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (2): Important strategic moves - The Germans / Porsche, Audi, Volkswagen and BMW As a marketing wheeze, the joint-venture project under which Porsche will help Audi develop a new sporty car to pad out its range has much to recommend it. Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, the new man in charge of Volkswagen's classiest marque, was enlisted from Mercedes-Benz last year to polish up the marketing of a technologically advanced and virtually all-new range of quality motors. His job description, drafted by his predecessor, Mr Ferdinand Piech, now clearing up the mess at Volkswagen group headquarters, involves him in closing the gap between Audi and BMW and Mercedes-Benz, market leaders in the German quality league. The prestige of Porsche, which will build the vehicle and help market it, can hardly fail to help. But the joint venture, which aims to unveil the new model in just six months and launch it next year, is also an important strategic move. It spells the end of an extravagant project for Audi to develop and build its own Spyder sports car. Audi is sticking to its knitting. A recession is no time for gambling or diversions into expensive prestige projects. Accordingly, the new car, although 'very sporty' according to Mr Kortum, will be based on an existing Audi model. It will fill out rather than extend the company's range. The project should offer some assistance to Porsche (majority owned by Mr Piech's family) through an exceptionally lean spell. 'Substantial' losses are expected this year after a DM120m deficit in the first half. But the deal will also help Audi contain development costs and forge a relationship which could conceivably lead to even closer links in the future. Porsche insists that it will remain independent, but with losses running at the current rate and the motor industry down-turn expected to continue into next year and beyond, its renowned cash reserves of DM600m are not going to last long. Recent renewed speculation suggests that once Audi is fully established as an able competitor in the big league, it may be floated off from the VW group as a potential future parent for the fragile Porsche. The venture also highlights an emerging trend, especially noticeable among Germany's top-quality carmakers, towards greater co-operation. BMW and Mercedes, for example, are planning their first collaboration in components. The big three manufacturers - and classy little Porsche  - have clearly accepted that the job of speedily reducing their cost disadvantages vis-a-vis the Japanese competition (estimated at 30 per cent upwards) will be made all the harder if they try to do all the work alone. Although BMW has so far had a less-than-catastrophic ride through recession, Mercedes and Audi are both running losses. Audi's deliveries to customers were more than 30 per cent down at the three-month mark. BMW, meanwhile, is still enjoying some of the benefits of the launch last year of its new 3-Series which helped it for the first time in its history to overhaul Mercedes in terms of unit sales, and to deliver a total 595,000 cars. It did especially well in the US, raising deliveries last year by 20 per cent. But it could not escape the effects of currency turbulence which cut net profits to DM726m from DM783m. And now it is feeling some of the pressures which have driven its competitors into the red. First-quarter sales in the new year have fallen more than 6 per cent. Later this year its 3-Series is likely to feel the squeeze when Mercedes comes to market with its new entry-level C-class model which will be competitively priced at about the same level as the outgoing 'baby-Benz'. According to Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, some 150,000 of the new model will be made this year, rising to about 200,000 in 1994 and 250,000 in 1995. The stage, clouded with grim forecasts of nose-diving domestic demand and only sluggish (if any) recovery in export markets, is set for lively competition as manufacturers bid to catch the executive buyer's eye. The action is likely to be all the more interesting because all the main actors are new and, apart from Mr Helmut Werner, the former commercial vehicles boss assuming control at Mercedes, virtually unknown quantities. Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, who built up BMW into a world-ranking brand during his 23-year tenure as chairman, recently appointed Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, 45, his youngest board member and production chief, to take over his role. Audi's Mr Kortum, 42, was brought in from a Mercedes sales outpost in North Rhine Westphalia to head an almost entirely new management board. Porsche recently replaced Mr Arno Bohn with Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, 40, who was formerly production director. It is no coincidence that BMW and Porsche both chose production men to take over at a time of what Mr Piech calls the worst crisis since the war. The name of the game for the foreseeable future will be squeezing manufacturing costs at every level, manufacturing in-house only those parts which cannot be made more cheaply by outside suppliers.</p>

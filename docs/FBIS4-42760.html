			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["for"-attributed report: "SPD's 20-Item Concept for Growth </F> and Employment"]    [Text] Bonn -- In the view of the Social Democratic Party  of Germany [SPD], there will be no leeway for distribution  without a significant economic recovery and higher tax yields.  On presenting a 20-item program for "more ecological growth and  more employment," Deputy Chairman Oskar Lafontaine said that all  cost-intensive projects envisaged by the SPD if it wins the  Bundestag elections will be subject to strict ecological  standards. However, the SPD wants to strengthen the dynamics of  growth by improving economic framework conditions.    According to the 20-item concept that was presented by the  SPD's economic experts, overcoming unemployment and a major  growth in employment are among the priorities of the future  government. One of the SPD's proposals is to support the  creation of part-time jobs by means of special premiums.  Employees sharing their jobs with someone who is unemployed  should be rewarded by being exempted from paying unemployment  contributions in an unbureaucratic way. These subsidies could  be funded by the expired unemployment benefits,  Baden-Wuerttemberg Economics Minister Dieter Spoeri (SPD) said.    Lafontaine said that the 1.5-percent growth rate indicated  by  the Federal Government is not sufficient to stop the wave of  layoffs in Germany. Relying on a higher demand from abroad is  not enough either. What is necessary are better framework  conditions for investment and the strengthening of domestic  demand. But it is also necessary to support the opening up of  new foreign markets by an active foreign-trade policy. The SPD  rejects a specific economic policy program. Economic  development in the new laender has to be given a wide scope.    The SPD expressly advocates an improvement in framework  conditions for medium-size companies and newly established  firms. It is necessary to improve access to private risk capital  through a "medium-size company offensive" and to strengthen  joint industrial research in medium-size companies. An  investment facilitation law is to provide more favorable  depreciation conditions and investment subsidies as of January  1995. The SPD wants to promote future investment by tax  incentives, and the tax reliefs granted for research and  development to small and medium-size firms and to freelance  inventors, which were abolished by the government coalition,  shall be reintroduced.    Special emphasis is put on a market-economy-oriented  technology transfer, the marketing of new communication  technologies, and the introduction of new media-oriented  services as sectors with the greatest future job potential.  Ecological modernization of industry and increased efforts in  environment protection will also create hundreds of thousands of  new jobs, Lafontaine said.    The SPD politician confirmed his party's intention not to  increase the tax burden, to cut the state's new indebtedness in  the medium term, and to make all new projects subject to strict  financing clauses. To stabilize public funds, all public  services, including social benefits, will have to be checked  regularly. The high indebtedness of the state and the interest  burden that has increased to 100 million German marks [DM] per  year is a huge burden on the future government's work. An SPD  government will, however, conduct a consolidation policy that is  socially balanced. In abolishing taxation of the minimum  subsistence level, the SPD will only be able to ease the burdens  of the taxpayers concerned step by step, due to the high costs  of DM40 billion involved.</p>

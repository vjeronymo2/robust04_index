			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 5 PAKISTANIS DIE IN ANTI-AMERICAN RIOT  </P> <P> Five demonstrators were shot and killed Sunday and 80 people were seriously  injured when Pakistani riot police opened fire on thousands of protesters  attacking the U.S. cultural center here after a demonstration against the  British novel "The Satanic Verses" turned into a rock-throwing anti-American  melee.  </P> <P> None of the three Americans or 15 Pakistani employees inside the center at the  time were hurt, but thousands of dollars in damage was done to the building,  which houses an American library and sponsors cultural events designed to  reinforce U.S.-Pakistani ties.  </P> <P> "It was a peaceful demonstration that went wrong," said Kent Obee, head of the  U.S. Information Service in Pakistan. Obee was inside the building waiting to  receive a petition from the protesters when the riot erupted.  </P> <P> "Some kids started throwing rocks, and it got ugly. . . . They just began  stoning the building, and the police responded."  </P> <P> The march was initiated by fundamentalists demanding that the United States ban  the novel, outlawed here, as blasphemous. They say it offends Muslims by  suggesting that the Prophet Mohammed was fallible.  </P> <P> Officials said police opened fire only after trying to control the  demonstration with tear gas, an effort they said failed because the wind was  blowing the wrong way. But journalists and witnesses described the police  riot-control operation as incompetent.  </P> <P> The demonstrators picked up tear-gas canisters and threw them back at police  and several times outflanked the police, who ultimately opened fire in panic,  witnesses said. After firing shots into the air, the police lowered their guns,  and the shooting went on intermittently for nearly 90 minutes, according to the  witnesses. Twenty of the injured were police.  </P> <P> Shouting "American dogs!" and "God is great!" the demonstrators also smashed  their way into the center and set two small fires, but U.S. officials said the  fervor of the mob did not match the attack of a decade ago on U.S. facilities  here.  </P> <P> "It wasn't another 1979," Obee said. "It was just an unfortunate event that  everyone wishes had never happened."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Burned to the Ground  </P> <P> Ten years ago, a mob of thousands attacked the American Embassy here and burned  it to the ground, killing an American Marine and forcing more than a dozen  embassy employees to lock themselves inside a vault for hours before police  responded to calls for help.  </P> <P> That protest was triggered by erroneous reports that the United States was  responsible for fatal shootings at the holiest mosque of the Islamic religion  in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> Originally published in England, Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses," the  object of Sunday's protest, was recently released in the United States. Twice  recently, the book has touched off protests at the American center in Lahore,  Pakistan, but both demonstrations ended peacefully.  </P> <P> "This thing has been simmering for a couple of months," Obee said, adding, "I  feel a little bit bemused, though, why they went after us rather than the  British."  </P> <P> Although the United States and Pakistan remain close allies, there has long  been an undercurrent of anti-Americanism among this country's fundamentalist  political parties, which are variously aligned with Iran and other nations  hostile to the United States.  </P> <P> Sunday's protest was planned by those fundamentalist groups and religious  scholars, and the U.S. Embassy had warned all Americans in Islamabad to stay  off the streets during the hours of the scheduled protest.  </P></p>

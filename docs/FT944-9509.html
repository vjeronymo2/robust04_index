			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Suzuki Motor lifts forecast to Y23.5bn Suzuki Motor, Japan's largest producer of minicars and the world's third-largest manufacturer of motorcycles, expects parent operating profit to reach Y23.5bn (Dollars 24.1m) in the year to March 1995, up from its May forecast of Y21.50bn, the company's vice-president, Mr Yoshio Saito, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Operating profit totalled Y21.84bn in 1993-94. The revision was based on higher-than-expected sales of the minivan-type 660cc Wagon R, and cost-cutting efforts in the first six months to September. Suzuki, which is 3.4 per cent owned by US carmaker General Motors, announced first-half parent operating profit of Y14.76bn, up 21.8 per cent from a year earlier. The six-month operating profit was a record for Suzuki, surpassing the previous high of Y13.79bn in the first half of 1992-93. However, projected full-year operating profit would not match the record of Y24.61bn in 1990-91, Mr Saito said. Suzuki revised its forecast for 1994-95 depreciation costs to Y47bn from a May prediction of Y45.30bn, compared with Y51.80bn in 1993-94. It left its forecast of capital investment unchanged from a May forecast of Y30bn, against Y34.20bn a year earlier.</p>

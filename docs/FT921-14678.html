			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Arts: Silver and swords come to the salerooms' rescue Jaime Ortiz-Patino, grandson of the Bolivian tin king, Simon, is moving from Geneva to London to act as European adviser to the Bolivian Government. His new home is smaller so Mr Ortiz-Patino is having a clear out from his art collection. The resulting auction at Sotheby's New York on May 21 and 22 should bring in over Dollars 25m, providing just the kind of tonic the art market needs. Some of the objects on offer are quite exceptional, most notably a collection of English 'chinoiserie'-style silver, all the rage in the 1680s. It includes the Brownlow Tankards which sold for Pounds 56,000 when last at auction in 1968, setting a record for English silver. They now carry an estimate of up to Dollars 1.5m, which is around Dollars 500,000 below the current record, but competitive bidding could push them near a new high. Among the French silver there is a group from the 3,000 piece service that Catherine the Great ordered from the Parisian silversmith Jacques-Nicholas Roettiers in 1770 as a present for her lover, Count Gregory Orloff. One item, a soup tureen, cover and stand, carries a top estimate of Dollars 1.8m. Mr Ortiz-Patino is also selling off French furniture and Old Master paintings, including eight Venetian scenes by Guardi. But he will continue to collect Paul de Lamerie silver, Dutch and Spanish Old Masters, and rare French manuscripts. Sotheby's arch rival Christie's can just about match the Ortiz-Patino sale. On March 31 in New York it starts the dispersal of the finest collection of Japanese swords to be assembled in the past fifty years. It was brought together by the late Walter A. Compton and should realise Dollars 20m . There are over 1,000 lots in the collection, ranging from warriors' swords to art swords, carefully crafted blades which the samurai valued higher than land or gold and presented as offerings to Shinto shrines. A blade made by Kunitoki around 1300 and ranked by the Preservation of Japanese Art Swords as 'Especially Important Sword,' should make the top price of over Dollars 100,000. These two auctions are just what the auction houses need - celebrated collections of important works of art appealing to connoisseurs rather than investors - to restore confidence to their battered market.</p>

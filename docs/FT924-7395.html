			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / High earners shun holidays in Britain BRITONS WITH higher incomes are cutting back on holidays in the UK so that they can continue going abroad, the English Tourist Board said yesterday. Mr Mike Richardson, marketing director of the tourist board, said yesterday that weekend breaks in the UK were down between 5 per cent and 10 per cent in the first eight months of this year. Many higher earners appeared to have rejected the idea of taking a cheaper overseas trip so that they could continue to take holidays in the UK, he said. 'The higher-income groups tend to take more than one holiday a year and the greater proportion take their main holiday overseas. English holidays account for the greater proportion of second holidays. Now that the recession has hit, people are holding on to their overseas holiday,' he said. The fall in the pound would help to make holidays in the UK cheaper and trips abroad more expensive, he added. But the board would find it difficult to market UK holidays following the government's decision, announced last week, to cut its grant from Pounds 15.6m this year to Pounds 9.1m in 1995. Mr Richardson said: 'It's all very well having a competitively priced product, but it doesn't help if you can't tell people about it. Devaluation has created a better climate for promotion of UK holidays but it is not a panacea.' Other countries would be able to spend more on their marketing effort in the UK as a result of devaluation, he explained.</p>

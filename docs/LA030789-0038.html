			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> A CHALLENGE TO THE POWER OF REASON  </P> <P> The Pasteurization of France by Bruno Latour, translated from French by Alan  Sheridan and John Law (Harvard University Press: $30; 273 pages)  </P> <P> Have you heard the one about crossing the Godfather with a deconstructionist?  The offspring makes you an offer you can't understand.  </P> <P> Cheap joke.  </P> <P> Deconstructionism, you may recall, is the school of radical literary criticism  which holds that nothing has intrinsic meaning and that texts may be massaged  to say just about anything the reader wants.  </P> <P> This enterprise, which got its start in literature, has now reverberated  through many academic disciplines, where its nuggets of truth have proved a  fruitful, if somewhat dense, way of looking at things.  </P> <P> Today's book, "The Pasteurization of France" by Bruno Latour, brings the  deconstructionist point of view to the history and sociology of science.  Latour's first goal here is to debunk the image of Louis Pasteur as the man who  single-handedly brought the world the germ theory of disease, a solitary hero  who fought enormous odds to improve public health, the man Paul Muni played in  the movie.  </P> <P> "A crowd may move a mountain; a single man cannot," Latour writes. "If,  therefore, we say of a man that he has moved a mountain, it is because he has  been credited with (or has appropriated) the work of the crowd that he claimed  to command but that he also followed."  </P> <P> Latour, who is a French sociologist of science, does not stop there. His book  is not simply a revisionist history. He uses the Pasteur story to make a  broader argument, namely, that the idea that science is something inherently  different from politics is a myth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arguing With Science  </P> <P> "There is no essential difference between the human or social sciences and the  exact or natural sciences, because there is no more science than there is  society," he says.  </P> <P> And this leads him to a still-broader argument, namely, that there is no  distinction between reason and power and those who treat the two as separate  and distinct are making a basic mistake. Science, the epitome of reason, is no  different from any social enterprise.  </P> <P> "I quickly unearthed what appeared to me to be a fundamental presupposition of  those who reject 'social' explanations of science," Latour writes. "This is the  assumption that force is different in kind to reason; right can never be  reduced to might. . . . I decided to see how knowledge and power would look if  no distinction were made between force and reason. Would the sky fall on our  heads? Would we find ourselves unable to do justice to science?"  </P> <P> And this leads Latour to a still-broader argument, presented in the form of  numbered aphoristic paragraphs, which I cannot begin to summarize except to say  that he contends that reason itself is a myth.  </P> <P> "The thread of argument is never straight," he says. "Those who talk of 'logic'  have never looked how something is spun, plaited, ranked, woven, or deduced. A  butterfly flies in a straighter line than a mind that reasons."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Matter of Taste'  </P> <P> Reason, he writes, "is a matter of taste and feeling, know-how and  connoisseurship, class and status. We insult, frown, pout, clench our fists,  enthuse, spit, sigh, and dream. Who reasons?"  </P> <P> To go back: Whether Latour's argument about Pasteur is right or wrong I haven't  a clue. He says that a variety of powerful social forces were all heading in  the same direction in late-19th-Century France and that Pasteur simply put  himself at the head of the column. Hero worship has done the rest, so that now  every town and village in France has a street named "Pasteur."  </P> <P> Whether right or wrong, Latour's view of Pasteur's contribution is certainly  iconoclastic, as is each of the succeeding arguments in this seminal though  difficult book.  </P> <P> Knowledge and power are inseparable. Science is a social activity whose basic  rules, terms and methods are socially agreed on and have no independent status  outside of that agreement. We accept the givens so implicitly that we hardly  ever think of them as givens.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reasons for Questioning  </P> <P> Latour's questioning of the power of reason is particularly strong. We pay lip  service to reason, but few of us are ever persuaded by it. In general, people  decide what they believe first and make up the appropriate reasons second.  There are always plenty of reasons to go around.  </P> <P> The effort to explain necessarily distorts, Latour argues. He shows that  science itself resists explanation, though there is great reluctance to believe  it.  </P> <P> "Few people still believe in the advent of the Enlightenment, but nobody has  yet recovered from this loss of faith," Latour writes. "Not to believe in it is  to feel that we have been thrown back into the Dark Ages."  </P> <P> And that is where contemporary thought has put us. A loss of faith, with  nothing to replace it. Nothing to believe in.  </P></p>

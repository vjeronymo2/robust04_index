			<p>941022 FT  22 OCT 94 / Mates may sue Mr Michael Mates - the former Northern Ireland minister who left the government over his links with fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir - is considering suing some newspapers for libel. Solicitors Denton Hall, for Mr Mates, said yesterday that a number of articles had contained allegations of parliamentary or financial irregularity or moral impropriety by MPs and some had referred to Mr Mates in this context. 'Mr Mates takes the greatest exception to such inferences since at the time of his resignation both the prime minister and the attorney-general specifically stated that he had acted with complete propriety,' Denton Hall said.</p>

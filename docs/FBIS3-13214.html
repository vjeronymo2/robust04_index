This was stated  by the foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, during a news  conference in Islamabad a short while ago. The foreign minister  said China and Iran have requested Pakistan at the highest level  not to press for voting on the resolution. He said they are our  great friends, and we have to give due consideration to their  proposals. The commission is still in session, and a decision  to the Chinese and Iranian proposal will be taken after  consultation. He said the objective of the resolution has been  achieved to a great extent as Kashmir has become a front-line  issue, and the world community has stressed on India to improve  the human rights situation in Kashmir. He said although most of  the countries have decided to abstain, almost all of them have  deplored the human rights violations in Kashmir on the floor.  The foreign minister said this is the first time during last 29  years that Pakistan has crossed the barriers and has put a  resolution on Kashmir on the agenda of a world forum.    Speaking on the occasion, the information minister, Mr.  Khalid Ahmad Khan Kharal, said the purpose of this resolution  was to send fact-finding missions to Kashmir to review the human  rights conditions. This purpose has been achieved as India has  opened Kashmir. One mission had already visited, and another  11-member mission is still in occupied Kashmir. He said  naturally if this resolution would have been carried, there  would not have been any change in the ground realities in  occupied valley. The very fact that fact-finding missions are  visiting India proves that we have made substantial gains. The  world community, he added, which had forgotten the plight of  Kashmiris in the occupied valley is now fully alive of the  situation and the matter is on their agenda. Almost every world  capital has sent a strong signal of its displeasure to the  Indian Government for the human rights violations in occupied  Kashmir.</p>

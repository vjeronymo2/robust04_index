			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ute Emig: "DM175 Billion for the East"] </F>   [Text] Minister in the Chancellor's Office Friedrich Bohl  on Tuesday [15 March] in Berlin drew up a positive balance sheet  of the Federal Government's reconstruction work in the new  laender. "Not always, but more and more often" he can see  "flourishing landscapes" there. The harmonization of the living  conditions in east and west is making good progress. Economic  growth in the former GDR increased by 7 percent last year, and a  similarly high increase is expected for 1994, while in the old  laender only 1 percent is expected.    These favorable developments were primarily achieved by the  people in the five eastern laender, Bohl said. Under completely  new conditions, they have made decisive achievements. The  atmosphere in talks with individual people is even often better  than the assessment of the situation in general.    Bohl described the many and various measures taken by the  Federal Government that have promoted this process in the past  few years:     -  The financial transfer to the new laender  amounted to some 177 billion German marks [DM] (gross), while  1994 plans involve DM175 billion in gross transfer payments.    -  For  the transport investment in the new laender DM13.8 billion were  provided in 1992 and DM13.2 billion in 1993. For the further  extension of federal highways DM4.2 billion will be spent this  year alone. Until the year 2002 the Federal Government will  invest some DM33 billion into the former German Reichsbahn  railroads.    -  A total of 2.2 million new telephone lines have been  installed since reunification, and 95 percent of all households  should be connected by 1997. The investment volume of Telekom  for this modernization amounts to DM60 billion, which makes it  the third largest individual investor and secures more than  90,000 jobs in the new laender.    -  Every other new business that  was set up in the new laender was promoted with public funds.  Some 213,500 credits for the establishment of new businesses  have been granted since 1990 involving a total investment sum of  DM86 billion. Some 450,000 businesses now employ 3 million  employees.    The chancellory minister also sees a significant upswing in  the sphere of housing construction. While in the first half  year of 1993 some 27,500 apartments were licensed, it was as  many as 47,500 in the second six-month period. The development  of pensions was also positive. The monthly pension payments at  the end of the GDR era were 450 marks, while now the average is  DM1,406, or some 75 percent of Western levels.</p>

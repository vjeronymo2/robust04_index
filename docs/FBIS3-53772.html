The  Afghan official is currently here for the international seminar  on the process of development in Central Asia and the Caucasus.  He told IRNA that incompetency of jihad groups in establishing  order and security and improving economic and administrative  condition had added to the people's dissatisfaction.    The Afghan official further noted that warring sides should  declare ceasefire and search for solutions to their differences  through negotiation. Otherwise, he stressed, the Afghan people  would suffer heavy financial and human losses. He dismissed  some analysis that the recent war had an ethnic nture and said  it was merely a struggle for gaining power. Shams stressed the  need for international assistance to reconstruct his  war-devastated country.</p>

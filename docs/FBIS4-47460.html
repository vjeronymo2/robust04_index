Burinskiy, Textiles and Light Industry  Institute, St. Petersburg; UDC546.91:541.183]    [Abstract] The need for treating electroplating effluents  for highly toxic chromium (VI) ions is brought about by the high  PDK (maximum allowable concentration) of this substance in the  water system. Thus, the PDK for chromium is set at 0.1 mg per  liter, while its actual content in the effluents is as much as  13-100 mg per liter. The widely used electro-coagulating  reagents used for this purpose fail to provide a high enough  degree of chromium ion elimination. Ion exchange methods appear  to be the most effective means of providing a high degree of  water purification, especially that of fiber ionites which are  characterized as having higher rates of adsorption and greater  ease of regeneration, in comparison with resin forms. In the  present work PAN-AN-1 and PAN-AS-1 are recommended as fiber  sorbents for leaching out chromium (VI). These are analogs of  anionite exchange resins AN-18 and AV-17, used for the same  purpose. PAN-AN-1 is diethylamine modification of an  epoxy-containing grafted copolymer of polyacrylonitrile fiber,  and has a static exchange capacity for low basicity tertiary  amines of 3 mmoles per gram. PAN-AS-1 is obtained by treating  the above copolymer with trimethylamine. It contains high  basicity trimethyloxypropylammonium groups in amounts to 1.3  mmoles per gram. Anion exchange capacity of the ionites  comprises 2 mmoles per gram. Tests show that these sorbents are  effective in eliminating chromium (VI) from electroplating  effluents.

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The UK Economy: PSBR exceeds forecasts by Pounds 1bn GOVERNMENT borrowing last month came to Pounds 4bn, roughly Pounds 1bn higher than expected, as the recession cut tax income and pushed up spending in areas such as social security payments. The public sector borrowing requirement for the first six months of the current financial year came to Pounds 18.4bn compared with Pounds 10.8bn in the corresponding period last year. Excluding privatisation proceeds of Pounds 1.4bn, the PSBR for the month came to Pounds 5.4bn, one of the biggest monthly totals on record. The privatisation receipts came from part-payment investors who have taken a stake in the regional electricity companies. News of the worsening state of public finances underlines the probability that the 1992-93 PSBR will exceed the Treasury's forecast of Pounds 28bn. Many City economists think the figure will turn out at between Pounds 32bn and Pounds 35bn. Total cash outlays by central government departments last month totalled Pounds 19.5bn, compared with Pounds 19.3bn in August and Pounds 17.9bn in September 1991. Over the first six months of the financial year which started in April, the spending total came to Pounds 114.3bn. This figure, which is arrived at after subtracting privatisation payments, is 8 per cent more than the Pounds 105.5bn total for the corresponding period last year.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / US and Japan settle tariff cuts The US and Japan yesterday said they would deliver to Gatt by nightfall their final tariff schedules under the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, ten days after the official deadline of February 15, writes Frances Williams from Geneva. The two other members of the Quad group of leading trading nations - the European Union and Canada - submitted their tariff schedules this week. Though US officials have blamed Washington's delay on technical problems in compiling the 1,000 page long schedule, it follows a row with Japan over US withdrawal of tariff offers on some industrial electronics items. Tokyo disputes US claims that these offers were conditional on further Japanese tariff concessions on wood, white spirits and non-ferrous metals, but now says it will not retaliate by adjusting its own offer. This has raised hopes that the dispute may be quietly laid to rest. Other Gatt members who have not already submitted tariff schedules are expected to do so shortly. Ministers meet in Marrakesh in April to sign the Uruguay Round accords.</p>

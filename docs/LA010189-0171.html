			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGES;  </P> <P> AZTECS TAKE LOW-KEY ROAD, BUT GET BY VERMONT  </P> <P> Vermont certainly is not North Carolina. The first clue came midway through the  first half of Saturday's Vermont-San Diego State basketball game, when a  Catamount pass on a fast-break attempt catapulted out of bounds off a Catamount  head.  </P> <P> The second clue came early in the second half. SDSU was leading by five with  17:47 left when Aztec Coach Jim Brandenburg called a timeout. Shawn Bell -- in  the midst of his best game at San Diego State -- walked to the bench and looked  at the scoreboard. Then he yawned.  </P> <P> The Aztecs won, 83-76, but the atmosphere in the San Diego Sports Arena wasn't  exactly as festive as Thursday's 103-92 loss to North Carolina.  </P> <P> "I would have rather been in a dental chair with no novocaine than endure that  for 40 minutes," was the way Brandenburg explained it.  </P> <P> A total of 1,529, the fewest to attend an Aztec home game since 836 watched  SDSU play Hawaii in the final game of the 1986-1987 season, watched SDSU  improve to 6-4. Against North Carolina, the Aztecs had set a home attendance  record of 13,106.  </P> <P> The fallout from the empty arena reached the court, where it was so quiet you  could hear the ball drop. SDSU had 21 turnovers and Vermont 18. Both teams shot  48% from the field.  </P> <P> "And my New Year's resolution was to not take another drink all year long,"  Brandenburg said. "But I think (the letdown) was very evident -- and  predictable. We were tremendously emotionally high Thursday, and when you get  that high, you valley out. We valleyed out really bad."  </P> <P> One of the spectators at the North Carolina game was on the Vermont bench  Saturday, and Tom Brennan, the Catamount coach, got exactly what he had hoped  for.  </P> <P> "We caught them at the right time," said Brennan, whose team is 1-5 and has  lost 10 consecutive road games. "After playing in front of 13,000 rockin' and  rollin' fans Thursday, and then to play in front of (something like) 13 . . . I  kept saying 'stay ahead, stay ahead' (to the Aztecs) Thursday because I knew  there had to be an emotional letdown."  </P> <P> Bell, a transfer from Chicago State, finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds --  both personal bests at SDSU. Guard Tony Ross had a season-high 23 points, and  his four second-half 3-pointers (he had five total) sparked the listless Aztecs  enough to stop a handful of Vermont comebacks.  </P> <P> The Aztecs built a 12-point halftime lead, 38-26, as Bell surpassed his  9.8-point scoring average with 15. Vermont whittled it down to five, 40-35,  just 2 minutes into the second half and eventually cut it to three, 52-49, with  12:09 remaining.  </P> <P> It was 55-51 with 10:38 left, but Ross made three 3-pointers in the next 3:24  to give SDSU some room to breathe.  </P> <P> "Shawn and Tony came through for us when everyone else was really struggling,"  Brandenburg said.  </P> <P> Said Brennan: "Ross and Bell were great tonight."  </P> <P> SDSU guard Bryan Williams wasn't bad, either. He had 9 assists, giving him 19  for the last two games.  </P> <P> "We tried to get up for this game, but a lot of people were tired," Williams  said.  </P> <P> Said Aztec center Mitch McMullen: "It was a win. You've got to take every one  you can get."  </P> <P> McMullen, who had career highs of 29 points and 12 rebounds against North  Carolina, managed just 10 points and 5 rebounds before fouling out with 2:41 to  play. Joe Calavita led Vermont with 20 points.  </P></p>

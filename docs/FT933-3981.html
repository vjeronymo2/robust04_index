			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Biotech company in Pounds 5m placing SHIELD Diagnostics, the Dundee-based biotechnology company, yesterday raised more than Pounds 5m through a placing of about 30 per cent of its shares with institutions and private investors. Allied Provincial Securities, which handled the issue, said 5.5m ordinary shares had been placed at 112p. After the placing 18.6m shares are in issue, giving the company a market capitalisation of Pounds 20.82m. About half the shares were placed with nine institutions, with the remainder going to private investors. They begin trading on the London Stock Exchange on September 23. In addition, 358,690 ordinary shares were placed on behalf of some directors and employees to raise Pounds 401,734 before expenses. No other existing shareholders have realised their investment. A group of venture capitalists, including Apax Partners, Summa and Cygnus Ventures, held 90 per cent of the stock before the flotation and now hold 57 per cent. The net proceeds of Pounds 5.24m will be used to clear the group's borrowings of about Pounds 500,000, and to provide working capital to allow further product acquisition and development. Shield, which makes 65 per cent of its sales outside the UK, specialises in developing, making and marketing in vitro tests for human disease. It is rare among biotechnology companies that have come to the market recently in that it already has 23 products for sale. The company made no profits forecast and gave no notional dividend in its prospectus. In the year to the end of March it had a total turnover of Pounds 1.68m, compared with a previous Pounds 445,000. Gross profits were Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 305,000). After net operating expenses of Pounds 1.74m (Pounds 1.69m) and interest payments, the pre-tax loss was Pounds 653,000, cut from Pounds 1.43m in the previous year. Mr Gordon Hall, the chief executive who was recruited from Abbot Diagnostics of the US, insisted that Shield was different from other UK biotechnology groups as it already has commercial products and established marketing and licensing agreements.</p>

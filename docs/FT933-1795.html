			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Tarmac That Tarmac needed a rights issue was the City's worst kept secret. Write-offs and the strain of paying an uncovered dividend for the last two years - and probably again this year - have reduced shareholders' funds by one-third from the peak reached in 1990. The auction market preferred shares which are now to be redeemed are an expensive and unreliable form of funding. Replacing them with real equity makes sense, although the Pounds 20m cost of unwinding related interest rate swaps underlines what a poor decision it was to issue in the first place. The worry is that the Pounds 75m earmarked for investment in land is barely enough to sustain Tarmac's momentum in house building. At an average plot cost of Pounds 13,500, an annual investment of Pounds 100m will be required to maintain the land bank given the planned level of house sales. Having run down land stocks to release cash during recession, Tarmac could no longer afford to sit back and wait. But other housebuilders are already well advanced in the process of replenishing stocks. Land prices are rising faster than house prices. Tarmac may need all its expertise as a low-cost builder in order to maintain margins. Where the cash for investment in house building will come from thereafter is also unclear. The disposals programme is coming to an end. On the basis of yesterday's figures, contracting cannot be relied upon to generate much by way of cash before the middle of the decade. Aggregates offer more immediate hope if prices recover and capital expenditure remains low. But buying Tarmac for the prospect of dividend growth looks a forlorn hope.</p>

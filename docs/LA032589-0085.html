			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP, RABBI SHARE JOURNEY OF MUTUAL DISCOVERY  </P> <P> Editor's Note: The following article is excerpted from a chapter in the "Twenty  Years of Jewish-Catholic Relations," published in 1986 by Paulist Press and  edited by Eugene J. Fisher, A. James Rudin and Marc H. Tanenbaum. The  co-authors also have written "A Journey of Discovery, A Resource Manual for  Jewish-Catholic Dialogue," soon to be published by Tabor Publishing Co.,  Valencia.  </P> <P>  There has been a rich and extensive history of contacts between the Catholic  and Jewish communities.  </P> <P> As early as the 1920s friendships developed between Archbishop John J. Cantwell  and Rabbi Edgar F. Magnin and they established contacts between their flocks to  the extent then possible. The involvement of Jewish leaders in such Roman  Catholic social welfare institutions as St. Anne's Maternity Hospital and Holy  Family Adoption Service gave early promise of things to come.  </P> <P> In the '50s and '60s, Loyola University -- now Loyola-Marymount -- became an  effective point of contact. Its president, (Father) Charles Casassa, introduced  a course on Judaism taught by a rabbi and, together with Neil Sandberg of the  American Jewish Committee, developed a rich program on intercultural education.  These efforts prepared a number of key persons for leadership in the  post-Vatican II era.  </P> <P> While, during this period, Catholic-Jewish relations were largely limited to  especially motivated individuals, the (Second Vatican Council's 1965)  proclamation of Nostra Aetate (urging cordial relations with non-Christian  religions) opened the door to official institutional contacts. With the  accession of Cardinal Timothy Manning as Los Angeles archbishop, the  Archdiocesan Commission on Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs established a  working relationship with the Interreligious Activities Committee of the  Southern California Board of Rabbis.  </P> <P> The great expectations stimulated by Vatican II were not fulfilled by these  cordial but still superficial encounters. Difficulties of which we had been  unaware now needed to be addressed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Call to Dialogue  </P> <P> The first tentative steps in the early seventies included the inception of the  Interreligious Council of Southern California as a tri-faith body incorporating  the archdiocese, the board of rabbis and two area-wide church councils  representing the mainline Protestant judicatories. This umbrella organization  was later to expand, embracing most of the major world religions. In the same  time frame, a priest-rabbi dialogue was initiated by Archbishop Manning.  </P> <P> Planning the tenth anniversary observance of Nostra Aetate, an interreligious  leadership group from the American Jewish Committee, the archdiocese and the  board of rabbis evaluated what had taken place and what would be needed to  sustain the exchange. Two clear requirements were structure -- an organization  able to assume responsibility -- and continuity -- not "one-night-stands" for  the exchange of shallow pleasantries.  </P> <P> The remaining question was the group's agenda. Four agenda items (were  proposed): Israel, Church-State Relations, Anti-Semitism, and Respect for Life.  </P> <P> While each prompted lively discussion, Respect for Life provoked the most  intense response. We hesitated. Concentrating on this controversial and  emotion-charged issue might endanger our entire relationship. We came to  realize, however, that little would be gained by tackling topics of easy  consensus. Wrestling with gut issues, confronting our differences and hammering  out our difficulties would help us to grow.  </P> <P> Thus, the three organizations jointly announced the formation of a Los Angeles  Catholic-Jewish Respect Life Committee. No specific directives or limits were  given to the committee, other than to venture and create, respecting the basic  principles of interreligious dialogue and the dignity of human life.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Balance Sought  </P> <P> We intended our committee to be as representative as possible and therefore  attempted to balance its membership between Catholics and Jews -- the latter to  include Conservative, Orthodox and Reform -- between clergy and lay people, men  and women. We looked for members of relevant professions, such as medicine and  law. We wanted people who were recognized in the community for their dedication  to life values. Subsequent experience showed that our care in selecting  committee members was well worth the effort.  </P> <P> Now we had to select one of the many topics under the umbrella, "Respect Life,"  such as care for the young, the aged, the single parent, the incurably ill, and  the dying. In the climate of 1976, abortion was clearly the life issue of most  intent concern. We took the risk of starting with it.  </P> <P> Inasmuch as there was a clear divergence (on abortion) between the two faith  traditions, we knew that there was no possibility for our committee to reach a  consensus statement. We could agree, however, that our conclusions should  reflect both pluralism and harmony.  </P> <P> All participants shared a dawning sense of mutual discovery: Roman Catholics  discovered an ancient and continuing Jewish body of legal reflections on pre-  and post-natal life and, at the same time, the allowance for differences of  opinion in both Talmudic and modern Judaism. Jewish participants discovered the  very rich, ancient, highly structured and all-inclusive Catholic ethic, along  with its vital interest in contemporary legal and scientific studies.  </P> <P> The committee's final product, "Jewish and Roman Catholic Reflections on  Abortion and Related Issues," published in September 1977, began with a joint  preface and an opening section entitled "Respect Life Reflections."  </P> <P> There followed two major and totally distinct statements: "Jewish View on  Abortion" and "Catholic view on Abortion." Neither claimed to be the Jewish or  the Catholic view, but a Jewish and a Catholic view. Each community felt  comfortable in articulating its position with clear perspective and without  compromise.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Commitment to Life Issues  </P> <P> With the success of a completed statement behind us, we agreed to move from  pre-birth to near-death by selecting as our topic, "Caring for the Dying  Person." We replaced committee members whose interest was limited to one issue  with people possessing expertise in the new area. The director of a major  hospice and the physician in charge of a major burn center were most helpful in  our exploration.  </P> <P> This selection process was repeated as we turned to our next topic, "The Single  Parent Family." Our "experts" included three single parents, one Jewish, one  Hispanic Catholic and one black Catholic.  </P> <P> While we had developed helpful techniques, we never allowed the committee  process to become routine. Intensive argument arose over the next topic, "The  Nuclear Reality," which focused primarily on the peaceful use of nuclear power.  We found that individual differences of opinion were far more pronounced than  the differences between the two faith traditions.  </P> <P> In our dialogue process, we learned a few things:  </P> <P> First, that quantitative information alone does not pave the way out of moral  dilemmas. Regardless of the massive input we had from highly respected experts  -- as in the nuclear area -- ultimately we had to voice opinions based on our  respective ethical commitments.  </P> <P> Second, that we were challenged to speak on behalf of our religious communities  and to do so in clear, intelligible terms. More than writing skill was required  of us, namely clear vision of the moral challenges offered by our religious  traditions and precision in applying them to present-day realities.  </P> <P> Third, that the interreligious dialogue demands commitment as well as  flexibility, determination as well as patience. It may be necessary to discuss  the same subject again and again to gain the necessary insight where agreement  can be reached, where compromise is possible and where firm but friendly  disagreement must be recorded.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Ripple Effect  </P> <P> The tremendous size of Los Angeles notwithstanding, we can demonstrate that our  efforts at dialogue have produced a substantial ripple effect. While the  Respect Life Committee was motivated, at least in part, by earlier interfaith  successes, it inspired other programs and projects in turn.  </P> <P> The Interreligious Council of Southern California, an ongoing forum for the  major religions, has sponsored numerous events for the metropolitan area,  including religious services to the 1984 Olympics, and has fostered friendships  between individual religious leaders.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Leadership Day  </P> <P> Other activities include:  </P> <P>  -- The annual Catholic-Jewish Women's Leadership Day, planned and executed by  a growing core group of women actively involved in their respective religious  communities.  </P> <P>  -- Lectures by Jewish scholars at the annual Religious Education Conferences  sponsored by the Dioceses of Los Angeles and Orange and attended by more than  18,000 professional and lay religious educators. Speakers have included Marc  Tanenbaum, Samuel Sandmel and Elie Wiesel.  </P> <P>  -- Catholic dialogues with Episcopalians, Lutherans, Muslims and Buddhists as  well as Jewish dialogues with Muslims and Protestants, and with black and  Korean churches.  </P> <P>  -- INTERSEM, an annual two-day conference for students and faculty of  Catholic, Jewish and Protestant seminaries in Southern California and the San  Francisco Bay area, enabling future ministers, priests and rabbis to meet their  counterparts and to understand their neighbors' religions.  </P> <P>  -- The Seminary Exchange, an intensive sharing of faculty between St. John's  Roman Catholic Seminary and the Los Angeles campus of Hebrew Union College.  </P> <P>  -- The annual Model Passover Seder, hosted by the Wilshire Boulevard Temple.  With a minimum of pulpit rearrangement and a maximum of imagination, the  synagogue's spacious sanctuary becomes the Passover dining room for a "Jewish  family" consisting of 800 to 1000 Catholic High School students with faculty  members and priests.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Project Discovery  </P> <P> The growing complexity of our Catholic-Jewish program led us to search for a  method of more effective coordination for all our projects. In 1982, a grant  from the Wilshire Boulevard Temple Interreligious Fund enabled us to establish  Project Discovery, with the authors serving as co-directors.  </P> <P> In addition to serving as an umbrella for existing exchanges, Project Discovery  opened the door for an exciting new venture: the authentic and personalized  teaching of Judaism in Catholic high schools. While the annual model seder  provides a one-time encounter with Judaism for approximately 1,000 students a  year, we felt that a more intensive experience was needed. In cooperation with  the Hebrew Union College, we developed an intern program beginning with two  Catholic high schools.  </P> <P> The intern is on campus for an entire morning during each week of the school  year, is readily available to answer questions about Jews and Judaism, and  becomes a familiar figure to faculty and students. More important, the school  now has a ready resource for a variety of situations: instructing a religion  class that deals intensively with Judaism in the intertestamental period or  briefly explaining the roots of Easter in the Jewish liturgical year;  responding to a social studies teacher's request for information on Nazi  concentration camps or a literature instructor's need for information on Jews  in the American novel. Students in this type of experience not only get to know  facts about Judaism but encounter a person modeling Judaism as a living faith.  </P> <P> The interns themselves are getting an education about the Catholic Church, its  institutions, its leaders and its people which is bound to enrich their  personal and professional lives.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Summary of Observations  </P> <P> We know that it takes far more than cosmetic treatments and public relations  programs to achieve our goal, which is nothing less than changing perceptions  and attitudes.  </P> <P> This goal can not be reached by merely correcting mutual misinformation. It  requires thinking and feeling with "the other." The wisdom of the Plain Indians  advises walking in "the other fellow's moccasins." The Jewish Ethics of the  Fathers urges not to judge the other person "until you have stood in his  place."  </P> <P> Meeting, therefore, is what the varied aspects of our "Los Angeles Story" have  in common: representatives of the major world religions meeting monthly in each  other's places of worship as the Interreligious Council; members of the  Priest-Rabbi Dialogue and of the Respect Life Committee meeting year after  year; Catholic, Jewish and Protestant seminarians, Catholic and Jewish women,  meeting for solid blocks of time.  </P> <P> What is destroyed is more than misinformation -- it is stereotypes. What is  conveyed is more than facts -- it is understanding.  </P></p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Voices raised against Frankfurt revival Global equity markets were peppered with big gains last week. In Europe, Germany outstripped France after being left sadly behind seven days before. In the previous week, the lack of a discount rate cut left Frankfurt down while Paris climbed on the prospect of an effective franc devaluation. However, an unexpected cut in the Buba repo rate followed last Tuesday, and Germany extended its 1993 gains to an above-average 20.7 per cent. Voices continue to be raised against this trend. Nikko Securities, a longstanding bear of the Frankfurt market, said that it expected the German economy to be very weak for the next two years: ' . . . on that basis,' it maintained, that 'the equity market is fundamentally overvalued at over 24 times earnings.' Lehman Brothers said that evidence since the mid-1950s would suggest that French equities are more responsive to easier money than those in Germany. 'In the past 30 years,' it said, 'there have been four general periods when German equities have been overvalued relative to French equities, and we are in the fourth phase at present.' On the Pacific Rim, New Zealand had another good week, particularly last Thursday after a cut in taxes on foreign portfolio investors. Hong Kong did even better after better than expected results from HSBC's Midland Bank. Last week's global equity charts illustrate just how heavily the biggest markets, in the US and in Japan, weigh upon the world. There were some big gains in continental Europe, and bigger yet in a number of Asian countries, taking the FT-Actuaries Europe ex UK, and Pacific ex Japan indices to rises of 2.5, and 3.2 per cent respectively in local currency terms; but the World Index managed a gain of only 0.5 per cent. Unfortunately, Wall Street was subdued again, first in advance of the House of Representatives vote on President Bill Clinton's deficit reduction package on Thursday night, and then on Friday's late vote to ensure that Mr Clinton's budget bill would pass through Congress. US equities rose by only 0.1 per cent on the week, maintaining a fairly flat trajectory; Japan, on the other hand, registered a 0.3 per cent decline after an ebullient month, and quarter, as investors waited for political haggling to end in Tokyo. The US, to a degree, was affected by the drop in the gold price after first, bullion hit Dollars 400 and, secondly, the ERM crisis appeared to be resolved. Australia and Canada were also pulled back, but the obvious loser was South Africa which showed falls on the week of 4.2 per cent in local currency terms, and 7.7 per cent in terms of the dollar. Specialist brokers in London said that big selling of gold from China, through Hong Kong put the first bite on the market, which weakened further on a massive reduction in long gold positions on the Comex market; they added that there was related pressure on the financial rand.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change    % change                 % change in local currency*      sterling* in US Dlrs*             ------------------------------------------------------------              1 Week  4 Weeks    1 Year  Start of  Start of    Start of                                             1993      1993        1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +3.26    +9.98    +26.25    +23.94    +18.35      +17.10 Belgium       +0.87    +2.88    +19.21    +21.16    +12.79      +11.59 Denmark       +2.50    +4.74     +9.96    +26.13    +17.29      +16.05 Finland       +3.59    +8.39   +109.34    +69.53    +55.11      +53.48 France        +3.28    +8.25    +20.94    +18.15    +11.21      +10.03 Germany       +3.72    +3.86    +14.72    +20.73    +16.41      +15.19 Ireland       +3.16    +6.32    +35.80    +41.63    +22.59      +21.29 Italy         +3.55    +8.79    +57.66    +44.29    +33.82      +32.40 Netherlands   -0.23    +1.76    +21.14    +19.21    +14.76      +13.55 Norway        +1.53    +5.24    +29.83    +26.94    +20.62      +19.34 Spain         +0.78    +5.42    +28.05    +27.16     +5.28       +4.17 Sweden        +3.57   +10.66    +44.57    +25.75    +12.97      +11.77 Switzerland   +1.38    +0.95    +31.69    +18.53    +17.00      +15.75 UK            +1.73    +4.70    +28.62     +6.44     +6.44       +5.31 EUROPE        +2.19    +4.97    +26.63    +15.77    +11.82      +10.64  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     +0.29    +3.00    +11.14    +14.64    +14.61      +13.40 Hong Kong     +5.31    +3.64    +21.42    +33.37    +34.58      +33.16 Japan         -0.32    +3.02    +37.18    +25.53    +51.58      +49.98 Malaysia      +2.77    +8.26    +53.53    +35.14    +40.06      +38.59 New Zealand   +4.39    +9.73    +24.34    +26.02    +36.33      +34.88 Singapore     +4.49    +4.52    +30.84    +20.75    +24.04      +22.73  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        -0.31    -0.28     +7.19    +10.11     +9.56       +8.41 USA           +0.12    +0.02     +7.07     +3.03     +4.13       +3.03 Mexico        +2.14    +7.57    +19.43     -0.58     +0.72       -0.34  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  -4.21    -2.45    +19.52    +28.79    +35.61      +34.17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +0.54    +2.28    +20.07    +13.32    +19.28      +18.03  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on August 6th 1993.

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Hungary alters view on BZW THE Hungarian authorities yesterday withdrew their criticism of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK merchant bank which was sacked on Wednesday as adviser on the privatisation of Kobanyai Sorgyar, Hungary's largest brewery. The State Property Agency's managing director, Mr Lajos Csepi, yesterday met Mr Charles Kovacs, head of BZW's Hungarian office. Afterwards, the SPA issued a statement that 'due to miscommunication, the true intention of the SPA board was not clearly communicated to BZW which led to steps taken by BZW which were found objectionable by the SPA'. BZW had sent out prospectuses for Kobanyai to international brewers, which the Hungarian authorities wanted excluded for competition reasons.</p>

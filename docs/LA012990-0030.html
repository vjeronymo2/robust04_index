			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : BAD ENGLISH IN CONCERT PROVES WORTH THE WAITE  </P> <P> Just when the rock world seemed safe from the cloying pretensions of such  former mainstream heroes as Journey, the new Bad English band -- boasting  ex-Journeymen Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain -- shows up.  </P> <P> In some ways, this group, which performed Friday at the Hollywood Palladium, is  Journey reincarnated with its slick, safe, romantic pop-rock.  </P> <P> Based on the album "Bad English," which has only a few quality songs and not  much energy, you'd expect a snoozer of a concert. But surprise: Bad English  wasn't bad live, infusing much of the material -- including "When I See You  Smile" and other songs that seem lame on record -- with a metal-like energy.  </P> <P> This robust, pounding edge helped offset some of the group's tiresome solos and  general aloofness.  </P> <P> Lead singer John Waite, from the Babys, deserves much of the credit. Normally a  wimpy vocalist, he sang with unexpected power and convincing emotion. DENNIS  HUNT  </P></p>

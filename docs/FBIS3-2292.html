About 9,830 investment projects were approved during the  period, with 9,329 of those investments made in 1993, the  commission said. Investment value in 1993 alone also hit  US$3.168 billion, the statistics showed.    In 1990 and 1991, the government approved a total of 237 and  264 investment projects, worth US$174 million and US$247 million  respectively.    Most of the approved investments went to Guangdong, Jiangsu,  Hebei, Zhejiang, and Shandong Provinces in that order, the  commission said.    Approved Taiwan investors focused their attention on  manufacturing industries in the mainland, including the  production of electronic and electric, precision machinery,  plastic, food and beverage, basic metal, and chemical products.    Meanwhile, unofficial tallies put Taiwan's total investment  in the mainland at more than US$11 billion during the three-year  period, with large amounts invested in Fujian Province.    The great difference reveals the large amount of unofficial  Cross-Taiwan Strait investment and indicates that the majority  of Taiwan investors in the mainland fail to register their  investments with government authorities.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (9): The five crucial questions - How pension plans work, and what to look for Personal pensions are designed for employees without access to a company scheme and for the self-employed. You can also use a plan to opt out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps). If you fall into one of these categories, you are part of the 'target market' for life offices and those who sell their products, and are likely to find yourself at the end of a very persuasive sales process. Since their introduction in July 1988, personal pension plans have been sold to more than 5m people, many of whom would have been better off in their company pension schemes. With more than 100 providers in the market, clearly some will offer good value, while others will offer an unholy combination of high charges and abysmal performance. To help you through the selection process we set out five basic issues to discuss with your adviser. What are the charges, and are they competitive? Is the contract flexible? Can you reduce and stop contributions, transfer the fund or take early retirement without penalty? Is the performance consistently good over the long term? Is the provider financially sound? Will it still be there when your investment matures? How much does the advice cost? Should I pay this as commission or fees? As you examine the tables on the two previous pages, it is useful to understand how these plans work. There are two different types of personal pension, although, for the sake of convenience, providers tend to sell a single contract. The 'appropriate' personal pension is used to contract out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps), while a top-up personal pension is used to invest extra contributions above the contracted out rebate. Like all pension arrangements approved by the Inland Revenue, the personal plan is tax-efficient. Contributions qualify for full tax relief, the pension fund grows free of income tax and capital gains tax, and up to 25 per cent of the top-up pension fund at retirement can be taken as tax-free cash. The rest of the fund must be used to purchase an annuity from a life office to provide the regular (taxed) pension income. You can buy the annuity at any age between 50 and 75. The amount of income secured by the annuity will depend on several factors, including the fund performance, the charges and the current annuity rates (these are determined largely by the yield on long dated gilts). Appropriate personal pensions allow you to contract out of Serps and, in return, the Department of Social Security sends a partial rebate of your national insurance contributions to your personal pension provider. Rebate plans are designed primarily for two categories of employee: Employees who do not have access to an occupational scheme; and Employees whose company scheme is 'contracted in' to Serps, where the scheme benefits are paid in addition to the Serps pension. If you earn less than Pounds 8,500 a year, it is almost certainly better to stay in Serps, because the rebate is so small that most of it will disappear in charges. However, if you are in one of the above categories, and earning at least this amount, an appropriate plan might be right for you, because the value of the rebate is likely to be higher than the value of the Serps benefits given up. (Serps benefits increase as you get older. From April 1997, the government will increase the rebate for older employees to discourage them from returning to Serps.) To build up an adequate pension, employees should pay extra contributions to a top-up personal plan out of their 'net relevant earnings'. Net relevant earnings are roughly equivalent to annual earnings from any self-employed activities (after deducting losses and certain business charges on income) or from employment where you are not already paying into a company pension scheme. Employers can contribute to an individual employee's plan, although this is not a legal requirement, and in practice few do. The annual contribution limits are: Age % of net relevant earnings *Up to 35 17.5 36-45 20 46-50 25 51-55 30 56-60 35 61-74 40 Notes*: All personal pension contributions are subject to the earnings cap, which limits the amount of salary that can be used for pension purposes to Pounds 76,800 for the 1994-95 tax year. You can pay up to 5 per cent of your contribution to a life assurance plan. It is possible to run more than one top-up personal pension plan, provided total contributions fall within the above limits. However, an employee can only have one appropriate plan for each tax year. Those who are still paying premiums to a retirement annuity contract - the precursor to personal pensions - should note that the contribution and benefit rules differ slightly. If you want to take out a personal pension as well, seek advice on how best to structure contributions. Finally, make sure that you are paying in a sensible amount each year. As a rough guide, you should pay total contributions of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of salary each year, depending on your age, how much pension you need and whether you have other sources of income.</p>

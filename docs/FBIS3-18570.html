			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Reaction to Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur's recent television appearance and comments on his  standing in the polls have appeared in the French press.  <H5>  Television Appearance </H5>   Balladur's appearance on the "Heure de Verite" [Hour of  Truth] television program gave rise to a variety of reactions on  the Left and the Right, notes "N.G." in the 16 February Paris  daily LIBERATION. "Most vehement" of all was Robert Hue's, the  newly appointed leader of the Communist Party (PC), who called  Balladur's performance "revolting" and "particularly shocking"  and cynical toward the thousands who suffer from his policies.  Hue was seconded by Socialist Party (PS) luminary Henri  EmmanuelIi, who said that "in light of the social regression  using the fight against unemployment as a pretext, workers must  mobilize before it is too late." Other socialists chose to  stress what they perceive to be Balladur's presidential  ambitions. Laurent Fabius scored the prime minister's "energy  in not saying he wishes to be a presidential candidate."  Jean-Paul Huchon, the "lieutenant" of PS leader Michel Rocard,  accused Balladur of "passivity." "What is not acceptable is to  give the impression one is resigned to the unacceptable, because  French society is living a major social breakdown," he said.  Former Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement affirmed that  Balladur is only following "what his predecessors condemned."    On the Right, National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen  claimed that Balladur's talk was "profoundly soporific." He  likened it to a situation in which Balladur "is not sure you  will not die, but he promises you that everything will still be  all right." Within the parliamentary majority, reactions were  varied. Philippe Vasseur, secretary general of the Republican  Party, noted that Balladur was "the same as always, pragmatic  and clear," a reaction "N.G." terms "neither a compliment nor a  criticism." Similarly, UDF spokesman Jean-Pierre Raffarin noted  that while Balladur's "clarifications" were "useful," the "best  criteria are results." RPR deputy secretary general Jean-Louis  Debre said in a communique that while the Gaullist movement  "reiterates its full support for the government's recovery  policy," the RPR will be a "force for proposals within the  governmental majority, as the prime minister himself has wished."    Balladur's interview was greeted with "skepticism" by trade  union organizations, "N.G." continues. The French Democratic  Confederation of Labor (CFDT) denounced the government's "crying  insufficiencies" in the fight against unemployment, noting that  "financial orthodoxy and lower labor costs remain the prime  minister's alpha and omega." According to Marc Blondel,  secretary general of the Workers' Force (FO), Balladur's policy  "offers little hope for an effective reduction of unemployment."  Finally, Louis Viannet, secretary general of the General  Confederation of Labor (CGT), scored Balladur for trumpeting the  end of the recession in France.  <H5>  Balladur V. Chirac </H5>   "Chirac-ians are regaining hope and delighting in the  decreased popularity of Edouard Balladur," notes Eric Dupin in  the 12-13 February LIBERATION. This means that the presidential  chances of Jacques Chirac are not "as desperate as it seems," he  continues. The RPR leader's determination to run regardless of  Balladur's intentions could deprive the prime minister of a  "major trump card," for Balladur would no longer be considered a  guarantor against divisions in the Right--such as the "duel"  between Chirac and UDF leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing--if his  ambition "created a fatal explosion in the RPR." Even an  internal primary on the Right between Chirac and Balladur would  be "risky" for the latter, Dupin contends, for the test would  be, not to gather a majority of the French, but how to convince  the conservative camp. Be that as it may, Dupin continues, the  "moderate and pragmatic" Balladur possesses rather significant  trump cards to resist Chirac's pressure, the principal being his  position at the electorate's ideological center of gravity. By  contrast, Chirac's image is "much more vague," for he cannot  decide whether he should speak for a hard Right that accuses the  pirme minister of "excessive prudence," or for a social Right  that denounces his "economic conformism." It is obvious that  Chirac is betting more on future Balladur errors than on the  efficiency of a policy he is still seeking, Dupin concludes.  <H5>  Balladur's Popularity </H5>   Despite his recent drop in the polls, Balladur's popularity  remains high, Jacques Julliard writes in the 10-16 February  Paris weekly LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. It is the "quasi-mechanical"  result of the conjunction of four specific political  circumstances, he contends.    1. The victory of the Right last March, which became even  more significant because the opposition, still "licking its  wounds," is incapable of "returning blow for blow." While PS  leader Michel Rocard is rebuilding his party with "astonishing  mastery," he has not defined his position toward Balladur,  "alternating an extremely soft discourse with sometimes  excessive imprecations."    2. The end of an internecine crisis. Balladur has freed the  Right and the Center of the anxiety of losing the presidential  elections despite their majority because of the Giscard-Chirac  rivalry. According to Julliard, Balladur is liked more because  "he is not them" than for himself. It should be noted that it  is not in the prime minister's interest to have Giscard  disappear from the scene too early, he adds, for Balladur would  lose his position of arbiter, thus dividing his own party.    3. The alibi of powerlessness. The French no longer expect  much from politicians on unemployment, the subject that  interests them most, Julliard contends. They do not think  Balladur is more efficient than others. Instead, they are  resigned to his presence as "more presentable" and "least  affected by the scandals of previous years." Polls do not  measure his popularity, but his "persistent nonimpopularity,"  Julliard affirms.    4. The prime minister's early presidentialization. The  French have understood that a sitting president, affected by his  party's defeat last March and no longer a candidate, has lost  his essential powers. As a result, the prime minister is now  seen as a "veritable president" or a "viceroy," and is hence  "credited with the success of power and exonerated of its  failures."    From the above, it is clear that Balladur's popularity  depends neither on his qualities nor on his personal defects.  Therefore, today's favorable circumstances may well turn to his  detriment tomorrow, Julliard concludes.  <H3>  Balladur's  Popularity Loss </H3>   The root cause of Balladur's recent difficulties, for which  he is already paying in the polls, is that he did not take  sufficiently into account the contradictions in the French  people's state of mind, "J.P." contends in the 15 February LE  QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS. In fact, he continues, while the French do  not like their governments to create upheavals, they do expect  them to produce rapid and consequent results. The prime  minister has not efficiently responded to the concerns and  impatience of the French, "J.P." writes. It is possible that  Balladur would be no more successful even if he adopted a more  activist course. However, those within the majority who contest  him could express their differences by criticizing the prime  minister's method and not the man himself, thus "saving face,"  "J.P." counsels. In addition, Balladur's simple reforms have  provided Chirac with a strong argument, he continues. The RPR  leader can explain--and has not failed to do so--that real  change will only occur after next year's presidential elections,  since Mitterrand's presence mandates that only "reforms" be  carried out at this time. Thus the very "modesty" of the term  plays against him, "J.P." contends.</p>

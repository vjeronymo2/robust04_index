			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 23, BNS -- The CSCE High Commissioner  for Ethnic Minorities, Max van der Stoel, for a long time  already has been directly interfering with the internal affairs  of Estonia, said Tiit Made, member of the Estonian parliament's  Foreign Affairs Commission.    "Last year, when the local elections law and the law on  foreigners were discussed in Estonia, Stoel visited Narva as a  political tourist and met there mainly with the leader of the  League of Russian Citizens, Yuri Mishin, and former City Council  chairman Vladimir Chuikin. Stoel then conveyed their opinions  on to the West," the MP [member of parliament] said in an  interview with BNS.    Made said it was inadmissible that the CSCE ethnic  minorities  high commissioner again met with Mishin and Chuikin during his  Tuesday's [22 February] trip to Narva.    "Now when Chuikin is a departmental head at Narva Furniture  Factory there is no need for Stoel to meet with him officially  and discuss Russian affairs. Stoel can do this in his private  capacity if he so wishes," Made said.    Van der Stoel himself said his meetings with Mishin and  Chuikin were "aimed at getting information from all  representatives of the Russian-speaking population." "This is my  task," he said in a press conference.    Made in his comments said Van der Stoel had been "simply  unable to say anything else in justification."    Made says the Estonian Government must give up "bending to  Max van der Stoel and responding to his wishes." He said the  government should "restrict interference by the High  Commissioner into the internal life of Estonia and his  representing the interests of Russian residents in the CSCE."</p>

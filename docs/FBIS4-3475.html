			<p>BFN     [Text] Various quarters in Guangdong have launched a major  joint operation to crack down on pirated compact discs [CD] in  several big cities in the province and have seized over 100,000  pirated CD's. Au Ka-lun reports.    [Begin recording] [Au] This is the largest-ever crackdown on  pirated CD's in Guangdong. Various quarters at the provincial  and city levels have launched joint operations and raids in  Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou. In six shops in  Guangzhou alone, they seized more than 70 boxes containing over  10,000 pirated CD's. In Zhuhai, the operations involved over 500  people, who raided shops in the vicinity of Gongbei and seized  30,000 pirated audio-visual products. In Shenzhen, the  operations are still continuing today. Inspection personnel  inspected the shops near the railway station and seized nearly  30,000 pirated CD's and nearly 20,000 video tapes. What  deterrent effect are the large-scale operations having? We find  that, despite the inspections which have just ended, some shops  are still selling their stuff.    [Au] It is still possible to buy these two pirated CD's  featuring Hong Kong singers for 15 yuan a piece in Shenzhen  today. The shopkeeper admits that the CD's are pirated.    [First unidentified shopkeeper] I don't think I am going to  sell this stuff any more after all the CD's have been sold.    [Au] Why?    [First shopkeeper] If the pirated stuff is banned, I am not  going to sell it.    [Au] Near the railway station, we find the racks at some  shops frequented by Hong Kong customers almost empty. But a  shopkeeper is placing pirated CD's on them and says he will  continue to sell all that he has in stock.    [Second unidentified shopkeeper] No, I am not going to start  selling again. Almost all the CD's have been seized. How can  anyone sell them?    [Au] With the recent operations on pirated CD's, some shops  have switched to selling genuine CD's, which cost 100 yuan or  more each. Shenzhen Vice Mayor (Li Ronggen) has said that  Shenzhen will continue to crack down on pirated audio-visual  products and will protect the interests of legitimate  businessmen. Au Ka-lun, TVB.

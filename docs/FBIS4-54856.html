			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Strikes in the Silesia region are spreading.  The Solidarity Slasko-Dabrowski regional chairman said today  that railway workers have joined the strike. Strikes began this  morning at Bytom, Radzionkow, Brynow, Lisow, Kochanowice, Herby  Stare, and Krupski Mlyn stations. Railway workers from  Lubliniec joined the strike at 0700. The strikers have stopped  servicing cargo trains and train engines, a communique says.  The length of the strike depends on a decision of the  Solidarity national strike headquarters. Railway workers have  presented a list of demands that are similar to the trade  union's national demands. [passage omitted]    Miners are also on strike. According to trade unionists, the  strike continues in 22 hard-coal mines. The State Hard Coal  Agency in Katowice confirmed that coal is not being mined in 20  collieries. Miners from three zinc and lead mines are also on  strike.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (9): Lack of foreign investment More American companies are based in the Bristol area than any other foreign-owned businesses, writes Roland Adburgham. An analysis of companies with a Bristol postcode and a turnover of more than Pounds 1m shows there are 20 from the US and five from Canada. There are 10 Swedish-owned companies and five Australian, but only four French, three Irish and two German. The analysis was carried out for the FT by Jordan and Sons, the Bristol-based company information group. It shows the relative lack of inward investment from abroad in the area. Out of the 664 parent and subsidiary companies with a turnover of more than Pounds 1m, only 61 are foreign-owned. Neighbouring south Wales, with the benefit of its government grants, has been far more successful in attracting overseas companies. The paucity of quoted companies headquartered in the Bristol area is also revealed by the analysis. Of leading parent companies, there are only 16 with a full stock exchange listing and another four on the unlisted securities market. But in this category, there are 219 privately-owned businesses. Leading quoted companies, in terms of net tangible assets, include Wessex Water, South Western Electricity and Bristol Water. Of the Pounds 1m-plus companies, there are far more engaged in wholesale and retail distribution than in any other activity. The figure of 27 per cent of the total compares with 13 per cent in banking, finance and business services, 12.5 per cent in engineering and 10 per cent in construction. Chemicals, metals, mining or plastics companies account for another 8.5 per cent. Jordans also analysed the overall performance of nearly 500 of the largest companies (in terms of turnover) in the Bristol area . According to the latest filings at Companies House, sales year-on-year were up by only 1.6 per cent but pre-tax profits jumped 26.1 per cent. Companies were helped by a big decline in interest payments of 16.6 per cent and a reduction in total borrowings of 5.5 per cent. Average gearing fell steeply from 70 per cent to 39 per cent. Profit margins improved by 1.1 percentage points to 5.6 per cent and return on net assets rose slightly by 1.2 percentage points to 11.8 per cent. The wage bill was up by 3.5 per cent, but numbers employed showed a slight decline of 0.4 per cent. Bristol's economic significance in south-west England is shown by the fact that, out of 5,514 company formations in the south-west in the first eight months of this year, the city's postcode area accounted for 2,491, or nearly half. The peak month for Bristol was March with 405 formations, but this had fallen to 232 in August - or 2.3 per cent of all company formations in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>

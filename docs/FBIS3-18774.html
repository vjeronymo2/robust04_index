			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed LVE: "Fishing and Balance of Power in </F> Council Threaten Enlargement"; as released by Brussels BELGA  Database]    [Text] Brussels, 9 Mar (Belga) -- Negotiations between the  foreign ministers of the Twelve and Norway with a view to Norway  joining the European Union (EU) again ended in stalemate at the  end of Tuesday [8 March] evening due to dissension among the  Twelve on the issues of fishing rights and the modification of  the institutions with the arrival of four new Member States.    Greek European Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos could  not  hide his vexation as he told the press: "The result was not  positive this evening, I am sorry to say, and I do not  understand why." He could only draw a favorable conclusion from  talks in other areas still outstanding, such as agriculture, the  budget, and regional policy.    Since no compromise solution seems possible in the immediate  future, Mr. Pangalos, whose country currently has the EU  presidency, decided to reconvene the ministers in Brussels next  Tuesday, with the firm intention of settling the bones of  contention that separate the United Kingdom and Spain from their  10 partners.    Between now and then, he hopes that the contacts that  ministers are sure to have with their respective heads of state  and government will make it possible to smooth out the  differences that are still preventing the formal conclusion of  the membership negotiations for the four candidate countries  (Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway).    This is already the second time that the talks have been  postponed, with the Twelve and Norway being forced to separate  last Tuesday on a note of disagreement. Since then, Oslo has  made overtures to Spain and Portugal by giving their trawlers a  little more access to its rich fishing grounds.    According to Piet Dankert, Netherlands state secretary for  foreign affairs, Portugal seems ready to reconsider its  position, but Spain remains unconvinced and has a problem with  the respect of its "historic rights" to fish in the Norwegian  waters, abolished by Oslo in 1981 because of the depletion of  fish stocks.    The president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors,  intervened in the debate to try and get the EU out of this rut,  in particular by proposing the purchase of fishing quotas in the  waters of third countries such as Canada and Russia and the  termination in 1996 of the transition period decided when Spain  and Portugal joined the Community in 1986, this condition  initially restricted both these countries to 300 trawlers  authorized to fish in Community waters until the year 2003.    However, a number of countries, including France refused  bluntly to accept this proposal: "We were unable to obtain a  mandate for the renegotiation of the membership treaty for Spain  and Portugal," explained Mr. Lamassoure.    Added to this is the problem of adapting the minority veto  in  the Council of Ministers with the arrival of the four new  members. The United Kingdom and Spain, and to a lesser extent  Italy, demanded that this minority remain at 23 votes, which  would make it easier to block Council decisions. The nine other  delegations wanted it increased to 27 votes by simple  mathematical extrapolation, in accordance with the mandate of  the European Council summit of Lisbon in June 1992.    Italy finally agreed to a compromise proposal presented by  the Greek presidency which suggested a minority veto of 27 votes  but with the political undertaking that a consensus would be  sought if there was a minority veto of 23 votes. Spain and the  United Kingdom, however, remained unbending.    Hope now lies in calming the concerns being expressed by the  governments. However, Mr. Dankert stated that "while last  Tuesday it seemed that the foreign ministers could not reach an  agreement on the Council voting balance, it is possible that the  debate could be switched in the very short term to the level of  the European Council."    Several delegations had harsh words for the stance being  taken by the United Kingdom and Spain.    Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, speaking on BRTN  [Dutch- language Belgian Radio and Television]: "Certain Member  States want to transform the EU into a fish shop. Too much, it  is too much."    Alain Lamassoure, the French minister for European affairs,  stated: "Now the moment of truth has come, we are seeing who  really does and does not want enlargement (...). For certain  countries, the EU enlargement is being seen as the opportunity  to complicate or even paralyze Community life."    This second breakdown in negotiations directly poses the  question of the attitude of the European Parliament (EU), which  wanted to have a membership treaty fully drawn up and ready for  10 March, that is Thursday, at the latest, so that a decision  could be taken at May's session which is the last one before  June's European elections.    The European commissioner charged with the enlargement  issue,  the Netherlander Hans Van den Broek, was expected to address the  EP on Wednesday where he is to ask the European deputies to  grant a "period of grace" of five days for submitting these  documents.</p>

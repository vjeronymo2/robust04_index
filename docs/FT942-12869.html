			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (6): Peg is likely to stay - The exchange rate Maybe it is simply because eight is a lucky number in Chinese, but Hong Kong's decision in 1983 to peg its currency to the US dollar at a rate of 7.8 has proved to be a successful one for the territory, helping to pave the way for steady and consistent economic growth, Richard Lapper writes. Despite opposition from some in the private sector, where the policy is blamed for Hong Kong's relatively high levels of inflation, it looks as if the peg will be maintained beyond 1997. The peg was introduced by the British government to depress speculation against the local dollar following a sharp downturn in the property market and amid growing concern about Hong Kong's constitutional status. Mr Michael Cartland, secretary for financial services, admits the policy was not well thought out. The reform amounted to devaluation - the Hong Kong dollar had been floating at a rate of HKDollars 5.80-5.90 to the US dollar in the months preceding - and helped to boost exports significantly. By maintaining its value within a narrow band - last year it fluctuated between HKDollars 7.72 and HKDollars 7.76 - the policy has helped to provide a stable and predictable framework for both local and overseas investors. To obtain these benefits, however, the Hong Kong authorities have sacrificed a measure of control over the local economy. Interest rates must generally follow those set in New York by the Federal Reserve, otherwise Hong Kong would see funds flowing out of the country. Overall, this means that monetary policy cannot be used as a tool to tackle inflation, restricting policy in this area to fiscal and supply-side measures. This has limited the government's ability to control inflation at a time when prices have risen at a faster rate than both the international and regional average. Consumer price inflation amounted to 7.5 per cent in 1988, rising to a peak of 12 per cent in 1991 before falling to 8.5 per cent in 1993. Worse still, it has contributed to significant distortions in the savings market. With Hong Kong's prime rate shadowing US rates, real interest rates have been negative. Add to that equation the substantial margins obtained by local banks on their savings deposits - deposit rates have typically been several points lower than prime lending since 1991 - and there is little incentive for people to put their savings in bank accounts. As a result, savings have been directed elsewhere. Some of the slack has been taken up by foreign currency accounts and life insurance policies - the life industry offers policies which pay annual cash dividends as well as a lump sum at maturity. The biggest impact has been on the local property and equity markets. Last year, speculative fever pushed stock prices up by more than 100 per cent, a level which has proved to be unsustainable with the Hang Seng Index down by about a quarter so far this year. Property prices have soared. On average, prices rose by at least 50 per cent last year, but in some sectors of the market - such as luxury flats - prices doubled, producing some of the highest property prices in the world. Mr David Li, chairman of the Bank of East Asia, one of Hong Kong's biggest banks, is the most well-known critic of the policy. In a speech last year Mr Li said that 'while the peg served its purpose when it was introduced, it has outlived its usefulness and now threatens Hong Kong's competitiveness and growth.' Mr Ian Perkin, chief economist at the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, agrees. He says the policy has 'distorted resource allocation' with speculative pressures rewarding borrowers more than lenders. He argues that the main success of the policy has been due to 'an incredible dose of luck'. With the US dollar falling against the yen and D-Mark over the period, the competitiveness of the local currency has been maintained, helping exports to grow steadily. In addition, commodity prices have weakened, reducing the cost of imports and increasing the territory's ability to achieve a positive trade balance. However, increasingly these appear to be minority views. According to Mr Kwok Kwok-Chuen, chief economist at Standard Chartered, 'people in the financial services industry accept the economic costs. Overall, it is an affordable price for exchange rate stability.' 'The virtues are obvious,' says Mr Kwok-Chuen, especially in the run-up to 1997, when political uncertainties will be reflected in sharp and unsettling movements of the dollar. Mr Anthony Bellingan, regional research director with Peregrine Securities, a local securities house, says the removal of the peg would leave the economy 'totally at the mercy of capital flows'. In present conditions, change would effectively lead to the revaluation of the Hong Kong currency, which he describes as 'a fairly appalling prospect' since it could spur even faster asset price inflation. There are signs that Hong Kong's inflation is falling as a result of structural factors. Especially important here is the shift of as much as 70 per cent of Hong Kong's manufacturing sector to mainland China, where it can benefit from wage rates that are less than a fifth of those available in the colony. And in Hong Kong itself, although the labour market remains tight, there has been a recent relaxation of pressures as thousands of emigrants who left Hong Kong in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 return. Hong Kong's government is also beginning to tackle another supply-side constraint which has contributed to asset price inflation - the shortage of land. Even Mr Perkin accepts that there is very little chance of the policy being changed. 'Even if you came up with the strongest case in the world the government would not do anything about it,' he says. 'We've got to keep Hong Kong stable and happy until 1997. They don't want anything that will upset the apple cart.' Mr Cartland, financial services secretary, adds: 'They're getting used to the idea. We definitely mean it when we say we have no intention of changing.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, April 27 (CNS) -- The Qiandao Lake  incident in which a group of Taiwan tourists died will be dealt  with by the Hangzhou Intermediate People's Court and the  Zhejiang Higher People's Court, the Director of the Zhejiang  branch of the Taiwan Affairs Office Mr. Ma Guangwu said in an  interview with the Taiwan news media. He stressed that the case  would go to court as scheduled no matter when the  representatives of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) of  Taiwan came. The three suspects will stand trial at a time the  official has not yet disclosed, simply noting that the start of  the trial would not be deferred for too long a period.    Mr. Ma said that as the case involved Taiwan compatriots as  well as Mainland persons, the trial would in no way be conducted  to appease the anger shown by the Taiwan side. He added that  whether the SEF representatives came was not a factor and the  case would go ahead as scheduled.    He revealed that the Zhejiang authorities had learned a  lesson from the incident and they called departments of travel,  transport and public security to a meeting on improvement of  travel safety. A conference held in the province on tourist  safety will make public its results following the arrival of the  SEF personnel.    In another development, Chairman of the "Mainland Affairs  Council" of the "Executive Yuan" of Taiwan Mr. Huang Kum-huei  and the Secretary General of SEF Mr. Chiao Jen-ho, in response  to a letter by the Mainland Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Strait (ARATS) inviting SEF to send personnel to Hangzhou  to look into the case, said that the Taiwan side accepted in  principle the invitation. The council has asked SEF to reply to  the proposal by ARATS and held consultations today for a final  decision on the invitation.    The "Minister of Economic Affairs" of Taiwan Mr. Chiang  Pin-kung said yesterday that following the announcement  regarding dealing with the case by the Mainland side, the true  picture of the incident was tending to become clearer. He  stressed that cross-strait economic exchange and trade should  return to normal step by step.</p>

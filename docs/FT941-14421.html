			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Massey Ferguson in Japanese link Massey Ferguson, the US-owned farm equipment group, and Iseki of Japan have agreed to co-operate in the UK and Irish markets for turf and grass equipment. MF's grass equipment division has been appointed exclusive distributor for Iseki products from February 1. Iseki is one of the world's biggest manufacturers of compact tractors. The move has been prompted by the largely complementary nature of the two companies' grass machinery ranges, and builds on existing co-operation between them elsewhere.</p>

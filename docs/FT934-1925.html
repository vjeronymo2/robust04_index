			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Government gives BNF go-ahead for Thorp The government finally gave the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant the go-ahead yesterday, ending nearly a year of controversy about the project. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, told the House of Commons that 'there is a sufficient balance of advantage in favour of the operation of Thorp'. The decision was immediately condemned by environmental groups and opposition MPs. It now faces a final threat of judicial review from Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, which has dedicated much of its campaigning energy this year to attacking Thorp. Rejecting calls for a public inquiry, Mr Gummer said he was satisfied that there were 'no issues raised which would cause us to believe that further consultation or debate is necessary'. Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, said: 'Giving the go-ahead to Thorp without an independent public inquiry is dangerously wrong, undemocratic, and possibly illegal.' Mr Gordon MacKerron, an energy economist at Sussex University who has criticised British Nuclear Fuel's profitability claims, said: 'The economic case is extremely fragile. The history of the nuclear business is that costs tend to escalate beyond the levels budgeted.' Thorp go-ahead, Page 12 Observer, Page 19</p>

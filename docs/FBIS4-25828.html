			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Yuan] </F>   [Text] Beijing is to relax its stringent credit controls to  help solve the so-called "triangular debts" or cash flow  problems of selected money-losing industries, according to a  senior Central Bank official.    The vice-governor of the People's Bank of China, Zhou  Zhengqing, revealed that plans to save the industries were being  discussed by various central ministries. The departments  included the State Economic and Trade Commission and the  People's Bank of China, the two power bases of Executive  Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji.    According to Mr Zhou, industries which will benefit from the  new credit facilities are coal, metallurgy and electricity.    It was not clear how much money would be available and when  the operation would begin. But the vice-governor said the extra  credit did not mean Beijing would relax its grip on fixed assets  investment by industries which he described as a "root cause" of  the cash flow problem.    According to original estimates, the Government's ceiling  for  fixed assets investment for the country this year was set at  1,300 billion yuan (HK$1,154 billion [Hong Kong dollars]) -- an  amount bound to be exceeded.    Mr Zhou said the triangular debts problem had arisen,  because  industries were unable to obtain a smooth cash flow by selling  their products on the market. Despite poor sales, many of the  industries aggravated problems by diverting their working  capital into fixed assets investment, Mr Zhou said. The bank  chief said industries must therefore strive to improve sales of  their products and stop investment in fixed assets while  triangular debts remained a problem. In addition, the state  would provide financial assistance to individual industries, he  said.    Informed sources in Beijing said the top leadership was  worried that, despite years of effort, the triangular debts  problem continued to hang over enterprises, especially those  heavy industries in the northeast provinces of Heilongjiang and  Liaoning.    They said senior leaders were worried that many of these  factories belonged to key national industries and their  financial situations had apparently not improved while the  economy boomed.    Nevertheless, decisionmakers in Beijing were unable to come  up with any "breakthrough" measures to rescue these enterprises  and had to relax credit.    Chinese analysts said the Communist Party would hoid a  plenum  this year where the viability of state industries would be a top  priority.    The analysts claimed Mr Zhu, highly unpopular for his  economic retrenchment measures introduced last year, was eager  to befriend regional governors by promising to relax credit for  selected industries although the extra money could fuel the  inflation crisis.    "They [the credits] are more a temporary measure than a  long-term cure," an analyst said.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF may report loss of up to FFr2.2bn Thomson-CSF, the French state electronics group, said it could report a loss of up to FFr2.2bn (Dollars 380m) for 1993 because of its 21.6 per cent stake in Credit Lyonnais. In March, the French bank announced a loss of FFr6.9bn for 1993 and a FFr44.9bn government-backed rescue package including the transfer of FFr40bn of non-performing property loans to a new shell company. Without Credit Lyonnais, Thomson-CSF would have made a FFr1bn profit last year.</p>

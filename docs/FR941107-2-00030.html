			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Best Information Available (BIA) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted in the ``Case History'' section of this notice, Paulista withdrew from the investigation after completion of the COP/CV verification and requested that all of its proprietary data be removed from the record. Section 776(c) of the Act provides that whenever a party refuses or is unable to produce information requested in a timely manner and in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation, the Department shall use BIA as a basis for its determination. Consequently, we have based this determination on BIA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining what rate to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse assumptions to those respondents found to be uncooperative in an investigation. The Department's two-tiered methodology for assigning BIA has been upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Allied Signal v. United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (June 22, 1993)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When a company refuses to cooperate or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation, the Department normally uses as BIA the highest of: (1) the highest margin in the petition; (2) the highest margin calculated for any other respondent within the same country for the same class or kind of merchandise; or (3) the estimated margin found for the affected firm in the preliminary determination. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings (other than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 54 FR 18992, 19033 (1989)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As detailed in the DOC position in Comment 1 below, we consider Paulista to have been uncooperative. Under our standard practice, we would have selected as the most adverse BIA for this investigation the estimated margin found for Paulista in the preliminary determination. However, because Paulista withdrew all of its proprietary data from the record, we cannot rely on the preliminary determination.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Smith Corona Corp. v. United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  796 F.Supp. 1532 (CIT 1992) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Smith Corona <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). It would be inappropriate to allow Paulista to thwart proper administration of the law and reward its uncooperative behavior by selecting as BIA the highest rate in the amended petition, which is less adverse than the preliminary rate. Therefore, we assigned to Paulista a BIA margin by comparing United States price (USP) to CV, based on information in the record. (For a discussion of this BIA calculation see the ``Fair Value Comparisons'' section of this notice and Comment 2 below). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In calculating the ``All Others'' rate, the Department normally weight averages all positive margins found in the investigation, including BIA rates. As discussed above, as an uncooperative respondent, Paulista will receive an adverse BIA margin. Because Paulista's margin is the only margin found in the investigation, under our normal practice, its margin would become the ``All Others'' rate. The Department notes, however, that in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Smith Corona,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the Court of International Trade (CIT) held that the Department may assign a rate lower than the highest available rate to nonparticipants in an investigation, when those parties (1) had no control over the sole respondent's withdrawal of documentation, (2) had no reason to believe that an adverse rate would be selected for the respondent as a result of the withdrawal of information, and (3) had no opportunity to offer their own data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

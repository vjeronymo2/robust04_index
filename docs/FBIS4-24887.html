			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Notes on a Northern Journey" by staff reporter Lo Ping </F> (5012 0393): "CPC Discovers Prodemocracy Movement Undercurrent  With Alarm"]    [Text] Five years have passed since the outbreak of the  prodemocracy movement in 1989. Will another high tide appear  after the ebb?    There are various signs that aftershocks have continued  after  the initial quake.    Certain shocks have come from the masses' demands for  democracy, and some have come from the people's disenchantment  with their current living conditions. Some shocks have come  from the popular indignation aroused by the worsening corruption  of officialdom. All this has represented a crisis, a serious  crisis, for the Jiang-Li regime.    The crisis is similar to that of five years ago, and is more  complicated and of greater shock potential. We may note the  following facts:    --Waves of labor unrest have arisen one after another in all  parts of the country and have swept across 19 cities. In Inner  Mongolia, thousands of party and government cadres in the  institutions of the autonomous region were also involved in a  "disturbance."    --The authorities discovered "organized illegal hostile  activities of underground sedition, collaboration, and  subversion against the current social system and the People's  Government" in 33 cities of 17 provinces.    --The CPC authorities intensified merciless crackdowns by  arresting and jailing political prisoners and prisoners of  conscience. At present, more than 1,700  "counterrevolutionaries" are in jail. This may be an incomplete  figure.    All this shows that sparks of the prodemocracy movement are  still spreading, and the CPC authorities are upset by the hidden  dangers everywhere.    Recently, the CPC leaders openly called for employing the  method used in handling the 4 June incident against the  prodemocracy movement, and this more directly shows that the  prodemocracy movement is threatening the Jiang-Li regime and  that the CPC leaders are on tenterhooks.    On 10 May, Jiang Zemin spoke at an enlarged meeting of the  CPC Central Political Bureau, and the speech laid bare both his  fears and his merciless nature.    Jiang said: The resolute action taken by the central  leadership against the political turmoil in spring and summer of  1989 was completely correct. If things had not been handled in  that way, China would have been thrown into chaos, and external  political forces would have taken advantage of the opportunity  to make more extensive inroads into China to subvert the  government. We would then have had to pay even greater costs.  Comrade Xiaoping recently said that, if it had not been for  Zhao Ziyang's double-dealing within the party, the incident  would have been settled much sooner. In the future, if similar  events of turmoil occur, we must take resolute and timely  actions without any delay.    Jiang added: Facts over the past five years have educated  and enlightened our people and cadres and have made them aware  that a very small number of hostile elements at home are always  trying to stir up trouble and overthrow the socialist system,  that the hegemonists in the world are also always trying to  interfere in China's internal affairs, and that the hostile  political forces outside the mainland and in overseas areas are  always trying to join hands with the domestic hostile elements  in carrying out subversive activities. We have no other option  but to adopt resolute measures against the undermining and  subversive activities of the hostile forces.    Jiang Zemin did not express even a bit of repentance for the  inhumane massacre of five years ago; instead, he even stressed  the rationality and necessity of using tanks and troops to kill  the innocent people who were peacefully demanding democracy.  This utterly exposes the antipeople nature of the Jiang-Li  regime and also reflects their fear when facing the prodemocracy  undercurrent among the people.    An informed analyst has said: The CPC authorities long ago  laid down the verdict on the 4 June incident, and Deng Xiaoping  has long ordered other people not to mention the incident any  longer so that it might be buried in history. However, the  first topic discussed at the Political Bureau meeting on 10 May  was the 4 June incident. Jiang Zemin brought up this matter from  the past. This showed that Deng Xiaoping may not have been in  good health recently, and some people within the CPC have tried  to take this opportunity to reverse the verdict on the incident.  Jiang's speech was aimed at warning them against reserving the  verdict.    The analyst's conclusions are worth considering.    Many people pay close attention to the attitude expressed by  the military in China. According to information from internal  channels, Zhang Wannian, member of the CPC Central Military  Commission and chief of the general staff of the Armed Forces,  has been singing the same tune as Jiang Zemin. At a recent  national meeting of the party committee leaders of the armed  police forces, Zhang Wannian said that, under the current  international and domestic circumstances, the People's  Liberation Army should fulfill "four sacred duties." One of the  "four sacred duties" is related to suppressing the prodemocracy  movement.    "We should, according to the party's calls and orders,  mercilessly crack down on and smash the organized and  premeditated activities of the hostile forces against the party  central leadership, the People's Government, the Constitution,  and the current socialist system. We should crack down on and  smash undermining and subversive activities and events of  turmoil and rebellions created by the hostile elements attached  to the external anti-China and anticommunist forces."    According to the CPC authorities' slanderous remarks against  the prodemocracy movement in 1989, it was clear that the fourth  task of "merciless crackdown and smashing" was aimed at the  prodemocracy movement and the demonstrating masses who called  for eliminating corruption and effecting democracy. In fact,  the terms "turmoil" and "rebellion" have long been used by the  CPC authorities to describe peaceful prodemocracy movements like  that in Tiananmen Square in 1989. The "merciless crackdown and  smashing" obviously referred to the use of force in suppressing  such prodemocracy movements.    The remarks later uttered by Zhang Wannian explicitly  expressed this idea. He said: China's development and the  drastic changes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe  have shown that the actions and measures taken by the central  authorities against the political turmoil in 1989 were  completely correct and necessary, because the turmoil was  supported by some foreign political forces and was aimed at  overthrowing socialist China led by the Communist Party. The  economic sanctions imposed by the hegemonists and their  followers failed to daunt the CPC, the Chinese Government, and  the Chinese people and failed to stop China's continuing  development and growth; on the contrary, this practice only laid  bare the fact that the hegemonists had not changed their basic  strategy against China and that the hostile political forces had  never stopped their sinister anti-China and anticommunist  activities of subversion, infiltration, and sabotage. The  hostile elements will never change their nature and will never  stop their undermining and disruptive activities of creating  turmoil and rebellions.    Such remarks uttered by Zhang Wannian explicitly indicated  that the CPC authorities would continue to use the methods of  the 4 June massacre to suppress prodemocracy movements.    At the national meeting of party committees in the armed  police force, Tao Siju, first political commissar of the armed  police force, also spoke. He repeated the main points of Zhang  Wannian's speech and made some additions. He said: Firm and  timely crackdowns must be carried out on the organized and  premeditated activities of the hostile forces aimed at  subverting and overthrowing the leadership of the Communist  Party and opposing the socialist system, and their plots and  undermining activities must be smashed. The undermining  activities of the hostile forces supported and abetted by the  external anti-China and anticommunist political forces must be  firmly and ruthlessly exposed, sternly counterattacked, and  thoroughly smashed. This is a basic principle of the party and  the state. The turmoil in the summer of 1989 was turned into a  rebellion against the Communist Party, the socialist system, and  the people's democratic dictatorship, and we took the necessary  measures. Only thus could we achieve today's stable political  situation. However, we must soberly note that the hostile  forces at home and abroad, including a small handful of  ultra-rightists in Hong Kong who have attached themselves to  foreign powers and oppose everything China adopts, will never be  willing to give in. They will inevitably use every opportunity  to carry out activities of subversion, infiltration, and  sabotage. We must resolutely crack down on their undermining  activities against China, against the Communist Party, and  against the socialist system without any lenience.    The party committees in the armed police force, the public  security organs, and the judicial organs rapidly relayed the  speeches by Zhang Wannian and Tao Siju and arranged study  sessions. The armed police units and public security departments  in all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities sent  telegrams one after another to the State Council, the Ministry  of Public Security, and the Headquarters of the Armed Police  Force to express their firm support.    It seems that the CPC authorities will not hesitate to  repeat  the tragedy in order to maintain their one-party dictatorship.  This does not show that they are strong; on the contrary, this  only shows their weakness and demonstrates that the Jiang-Li  regime is being upset by the incessant crises.    However, I was also told by other sources that some people  among the CPC high-ranking officials are opposed to methods of  suppression like those used in the 4 June massacre. They  maintain that, if more student unrest like the 4 June incident  occurs, and if the students only stage peaceful demonstrations,  then peaceful political methods should be used to settle the  trouble and violence must be prevented.    I asked: "Would this be the mainstream opinion within the  party?"    "I hope so. However, it seems that Jiang, Li, and other  diehards will insist on the option of relying on military force."</p>

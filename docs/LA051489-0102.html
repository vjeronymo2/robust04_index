			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> MOURNING A LOVED ONE, AND THE LOVED ONES LEFT TO STRUGGLE ALONE  </P> <P> I stared up at the billboard, my eyes frozen on the words, my heart numb.  </P> <P> High above Santa Monica Boulevard, the numbers screamed: 281,859 dead because  of lung cancer in 1988.  </P> <P> The date was Nov. 11, and, less than 2 miles away, my mother was in a Century  City hospital. She had just been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer.  </P> <P> Every day the numbers would creep up on that billboard. As I drove by, I  wondered at what point in the tally my mom would become just another number.  </P> <P> Would she make it to Thanksgiving? Hanukkah? Christmas? New Year's? Mother's  Day?  </P> <P> She died Jan. 9. The billboard had been zeroed out, its annual count begun  anew.  </P> <P> Now there's Mother's Day, but no mother.  </P> <P> Darlene was her name. I don't want to make this a maudlin tale of how I miss  her, although I do miss her. Terribly.  </P> <P> But, after four months, I'm pretty much resigned that she's gone. And the urge  to call her every time I want to chat is subsiding, much to my chagrin.  </P> <P> But there still isn't a day that goes by that I don't think of her a dozen  times. And as Mother's Day approached, my anxiety grew.  </P> <P> My family is going to gather this morning, and there will be plenty of mothers  in our clan to celebrate. But my best friend, my big booster, the woman who  turned my second-place finishes into world championships -- she won't be there.  </P> <P> Those thoughts swirling in my head -- and my heart -- the past few weeks were  not sparked only by Mother's Day, however. I spent much of April with senior  citizens, mostly in nursing homes and board-and-care facilities, working on a  weeklong series for KNSD-TV about life in nursing homes and cases of abuse and  neglect of the elderly.  </P> <P> The research took me into a world where I was confronted with the vision of  what my mother might have become.  </P> <P> Her death had come quickly, although at the time, as I watched this beautiful  61-year-old woman being consumed by an aggressive cancer, the two months  between her diagnosis and demise seemed an eternity.  </P> <P> We hoped that she would stabilize. But that meant tackling the question of how  to care for her.  </P> <P> Do we hire a nurse? Should she be in a nursing home? Wouldn't she be happier in  her own home, surrounded by things familiar?  </P> <P> We never had to answer those questions. She died, at home, in her own bed.  </P> <P> But as I wandered the halls of the nursing homes last month, as I walked past  the closet-like rooms with two single beds jammed in, as I watched seniors  wheeled to their tables in crowded dining halls, I thought of my mother. And I  thought about visiting her in a place like that -- not as a reporter, detached  and taking notes, but as her son.  </P> <P> It was a jarring, gut-wrenching experience. Because, much as I didn't like to  admit it, my honest response was that I was glad she had died if this were the  alternative.  </P> <P> What a horrible reaction! Here I was surrounded by seniors -- some in terrible  physical condition -- who were struggling just to survive, sometimes barely  holding on.  </P> <P> How could I favor death when so many were fighting so hard to stay alive?  </P> <P> I hated myself for thinking it, and yet it was what I felt.  </P> <P> I thought about what the mothers in the nursing homes would be doing today.  More than any other complaint, the seniors we talked to yearned for visitors,  especially their children. Sometimes the patients would talk about how their  kids were due to show up anytime. But the truth was, it had been some time  since their children had seen them.  </P> <P> My anger rose.  </P> <P> But how could I be grateful that my mother had avoided institutional life, and  yet also be angry at the children whose parents weren't as lucky?  </P> <P> I had no answers at the time. I still don't. I don't think I ever will.  </P> <P> "People are so busy with their own thing, whatever that may be," Wylie Haywood  had told me. Wylie had lived in a nursing home for five months, after he was  run over by a car while he was crossing a street. He suffered two broken legs  and a skull fracture, but gained an insight into a life he hopes to soon leave.  </P> <P> "They don't have time for the old folks," he said of his fellow residents'  children. "That's regrettable, very regrettable."  </P> <P> Yes, I am glad my mother isn't living in some nursing home.  </P> <P> But I wish she were alive so I could visit her there.  </P></p>

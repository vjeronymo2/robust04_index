			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Loss and dividend cut forecast by RPS After allowing for exceptional reorganisation costs, RPS Group is expected to incur a significant loss for 1991, and the dividend is to be cut. The final will be 0.6p for a total of 2p, against 3.2p in 1990 when the group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.74m. RPS, engaged in environmental consultancy work, is reorganising its operations in England from 10 local offices into four regional centres. The Scottish and Irish operations already have regional centres. It will cost Pounds 800,000, principally relating to disposal of leases and staff relocation, which will be phased over 18 months. Management accounts showed the group traded at about break-even in July-November, after producing a pre-tax profit of Pounds 302,000 (Pounds 907,000) in the first half. The reorganisation will produce immediate and sustainable operating cost savings, the company said. The proposed dividend reflected the group's future prospects.</p>

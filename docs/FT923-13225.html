			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Management: Industrial power house in Guangdong In less than a decade, Guangdong has changed from a mainly agricultural economy to an industrial power house to rival Shanghai as China's premier location for manufacturing. Hong Kong's transformation has been equally rapid. It has switched from a significant manufacturing-based economy to one which is daily becoming more service-based. 'What Hong Kong has is management, research and development, engineering and marketing. The major decisions will continue to be taken here,' says Alan Wong, chairman of Vtech. Chinese figures show that Hong Kong dominates foreign investment in southern China. At the end of 1990, there were 22,500 enterprises in Guangdong in which Hong Kong and Macao businessmen had invested - accounting for some 77 per cent of foreign-funded businesses. These companies have invested Dollars 11bn (Pounds 5.7bn) - some 56 per cent of total investment in the region - and employ directly, or indirectly, an estimated 3m workers. However, as a recent survey by the Federation of Hong Kong Industries underlines, the investment by Hong Kong companies in southern China is relatively small-scale. The federation reckons that more than 60 per cent of Hong Kong companies in the Pearl River region have invested less than HKDollars 10m, (Pounds 670,000) and for many, the investment is as little as HKDollars 1m to HKDollars 5m.</p>

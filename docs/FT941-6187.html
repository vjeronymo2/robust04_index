			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Poland wants to join Eurocorps Polish Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk yesterday said he had discussed the possibility of Poland joining the Franco-German-Belgian Eurocorps fighting force with his French counterpart, Reuter reports from Paris. Poland would initially prepare observer groups before analysing the possibility of joining the Eurocorps, he said, after talks with French Defence Minister Francois Leotard. Mr Leotard said the talks were preliminary and it was more timely to speak of Polish officers serving as observers with the Strasbourg-based corps than of Poland becoming a full member in the near future. The Eurocorps, seen as the future land-based defence arm of the Western European Union (WEU), the EU's defence pillar, will become operational later this year with one French and one German division plus a Belgian brigade.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In that same response, we also stated our belief that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the adjustment for IME and to the prospective payment rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is currently higher than the additional cost of serving a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare beneficiary at a teaching hospital. The policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advocated by ProPAC in this recommendation would have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of increasing outlier payments to teaching hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Relative to the costs associated with teaching activity, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are concerned that the teaching adjustment may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overcompensate teaching hospitals for their Medicare cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this reason, we believe it would be inappropriate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement ProPAC's recommendation without making a reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the level of the IME adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We concur with ProPAC's second recommendation regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raising the marginal cost factor for cost outliers to 80  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent from its current level of 75 percent. We currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pay 75 percent of the difference between the cost of a case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the cost outlier threshold. Paying 75 percent of costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond a threshold protects hospitals against inordinate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> losses resulting from the costliest Medicare cases. As we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describe in section IV.D. of this proposed rule, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13501(c) of Public Law 103&hyph;66 requires that we phase-out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments for day outliers, while simultaneously increasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments for cost outliers. We believe the change mandated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the statute improves Medicare's outlier policy by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> focusing outlier payments on the costliest cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with focusing Medicare's outlier payments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases with the greatest losses, we are raising the marginal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost factor to 80 percent. We note that raising the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marginal cost factor to 80 percent necessitates an increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the fixed loss cost outlier threshold in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain outlier payments at 5.1 percent of estimated total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Level of the Indirect Medical Education Adjustment to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PPS Operating Payments (Recommendation 19)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Recommendation: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission recommends that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indirect medical education adjustment to prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments for hospital inpatient operating costs be reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from its current level of 7.7 percent to 7.0 percent for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fiscal year 1995. This reduction should be implemented with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the anticipated decrease in indirect medical education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments returned to all hospitals through a proportionate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in the standardized payment amounts. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission also recommends continuation of the indirect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical education adjustment to operating payments until an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative system of compensating appropriately for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher costs of patient care in teaching institutions is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fully operational.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The first part of this recommendation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identical to ProPAC's recommendation on the level of the IME  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment for FY 1994, to which we responded in the May 26,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993 proposed rule (58 FR 30255) and September 1, 1993 final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule (58 FR 46326) containing the changes to the prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment systems for FY 1994. We agree that the IME  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment should be reduced. Although we have disagreed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with ProPAC in the past over the degree of reduction, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have proposed reductions as part of the President's budgets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the last several years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to ProPAC's methodology for estimating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indirect cost effect of teaching without accounting for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DSH adjustment, we explained our opposition to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestion in the September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 46328). To reiterate, our analysis indicates that there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence of significantly higher costs related to DSH among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urban hospitals with 100 or more beds (see O'Dougherty et  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> al.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Health Care Financing Review <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Winter 1992, p. 31).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since these hospitals receive over 96 percent of all DSH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments, we believe ProPAC's claim that ``DSH payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally do not reflect differences in costs'' is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overstated. We do agree, however, that the current level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DSH payments exceeds the measured cost effect of DSH even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among urban hospitals with 100 or more beds. In that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regard, we point out that in the regression model used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate the teaching effect, we did not specify the DSH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variable as the level of DSH payments, but instead set it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equal to the DSH percentage for urban hospitals with 100 or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more beds and zero for all other hospitals. (For a complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> description of our estimating model, see the August 30, 1991  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule implementing the capital prospective payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system, 56 FR 43370.) As ProPAC alludes to in its report,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not controlling for DSH leads to its higher IME cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate relative to our IME cost estimate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The remainder of ProPAC's recommendation raises policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues related to the appropriate level of IME funding as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the transition is made from the current system to the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health care system. Since these transition issues are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently being addressed as part of the health care reform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debate, we are not responding in this document to this part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ProPAC's recommendation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Prospective Payment Method for Outpatient Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Recommendation 20)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Recommendation: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission believes a prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment system for hospital outpatient services should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented. Outpatient payment reform should result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent policies across all sites and providers. Payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be based on a prospective price per unit of service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until other methods can be developed that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriately control the volume of services. The payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate should be adjusted to reflect justifiable cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differences across settings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We appreciate ProPAC's support for efforts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to develop a prospective payment system for hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outpatient services. We share the Commission's view that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital outpatient prospective payment system can provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaningful incentives for controlling costs. We also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that such a system could have the potential to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adapted for other outpatient settings, resulting in more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent policies across varying sites of service. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> look forward to the Commission's comments when our report on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a hospital outpatient prospective payment system is issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Revision of Payment Formula for Outpatient Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Recommendation 21)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Recommendation: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Until prospective payment systems can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be implemented for hospital outpatient services, the blend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formula used to calculate hospital payments for ambulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surgery center-approved procedures, radiology services, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnostic services should be revised. The formula should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtract beneficiary copayment after the total payment has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been calculated. The resulting reduction in Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program payments to hospitals should be used to partially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offset increases in program expenditures due to reducing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficiary liability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

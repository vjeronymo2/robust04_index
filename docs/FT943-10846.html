			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Whitewater focus shifts to diaries The private diaries of a young US Treasury official emerged yesterday morning as the principal focus of Senate questioning on Madison Guaranty, the failed Arkansas savings and loan institution implicated in the Whitewater affair. Mr Josh Steiner, chief of staff to Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, said his diaries had over-estimated the amount of pressure put on Mr Roger Altman, the deputy Treasury secretary, not to excuse himself from supervising investigations into Madison. He also told the Senate banking committee that Mr Altman had not deliberately misled the panel in February about the extent of White House and Treasury contacts over the status of possible criminal actions involving Madison, the company owned by Mr James McDougal, partner of the Clinton family in the Whitewater land development. The committee's session came between the brutal Monday night questioning of Ms Jean Hanson, the Treasury legal counsel, and the eagerly awaited appearance of Mr Altman later yesterday. Mr Altman has asserted both his innocence of any misrepresentation to Congress and his disinclination to resign. Mr Steiner's diaries, however, provided a rich lode for interrogation. Most interest centred on his note late in February that Mr Altman had 'gracefully ducked' questions from the committee on the issue of whether he should 'recuse' (excuse) himself from regulatory responsibility in his capacity as acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation. Senator Lauch Faircloth, the Republican from North Carolina, wanted to know the difference between 'graceful ducking' and lying. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, again quoting from the subpoenaed diaries, wanted to know why Mr Steiner found it 'amazing' that the recusal issue had not come up and why it had not been volunteered to the committee. Mr Steiner, who is 28, said he had kept his diaries for personal reasons as a way of measuring the impact on himself of being at the heart of policy-making. Entries were not made daily but often several weeks after the event. Thus, he said, his notation about the 'fateful' February 2 meeting in which Mr Bernard Nussbaum, then White House counsel, had urged Mr Altman not to recuse himself prematurely was made after the press had already started reporting the issue in depth. In any case, he argued, the question by then was 'moot' because Mr Altman had decided to disqualify himself and because the administration had decided to extend the statute of limitations covering any civil Madison action beyond the February 28 expiration. Other past and present Treasury officials also testified to their limited knowledge of the Madison case. Mr Dennis Foreman, Treasury ethics counsel, asserted that there was 'a legitimate government purpose' in the Treasury appraising the White House of pending investigations.</p>

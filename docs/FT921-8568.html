			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / A world of mad plumbing: Europe Some years ago, my family and I, together with another family of close friends, spent a summer holiday in a rented villa in southern Italy. It was a wonderful place - right at the top of a steep hill, quite private, very slightly breezy and much cooler than the baking beaches far below. There was just one drawback. Since the month was August, there was too little water, and almost none of that little reached the top of our hill. Down below, near the baking beaches, the Neapolitan masses splashed themselves and even their cars with reckless abandon; whereas we, in our superior eyrie, remained hot, bothered and dirty. A desperate situation called for desperate efforts. So when the womenfolk set off down the hill with the children to enjoy the baking beaches and the company of the Neapolitan masses, we menfolk climbed to the attic with lengths of plastic piping in the hope of improving the water supply. We laboured at this task for several days, but of course we did not make any difference at all. Nothing has reminded me so much of those long and fruitless sessions with the hosepipe as the strange spectacle of the general election campaign now on view in Britain. The deadlock in the opinion polls suggests an electorate divided between black cynicism and weary incredulity. But the politicians, enclosed in their world of mad electoral plumbing, continue to tout their frenzied schemes for tinkering with the structures of state. This one proposes to insert a pipe at the higher tax bracket and connect it to the family allowances lower down. That one promises to disconnect the filter on National Insurance contributions and lay a pipeline across to the National Health Service. A third, with a T-join at the petrol tax, would make a diversion into road building. All this, of course, in the belief that a few lengths of electoral piping will turn a trickle of votes into a flood. The performance is absurd and, worse, dated. Some will cringe at the manifest intention to bribe the electorate. The day Mr John Major's office promised there would be no electioneering Budget was also the day it spoke about a cut in income tax. We may regret that politicians make their way by siphoning money out of the pockets of their adversaries into the pockets of their friends, but that is their trade. But it is the intellectual self-deception which is most discouraging, as if the politicians' mad plumbing could increase the total flow of economic resources. Everybody knows that Britain's macro-economic policy is now largely defined by the objectives of the European Monetary System. This should mean the beginning of a greater political consensus. Yet British politicians continue to offer their patent economic nostrums, like throwbacks to a Keynesian time-warp of 30 years ago. In this respect, as in so many others, Britain and France seem to exist in different periods of history. In 1984, France moved over to an anti-inflation policy of monetary and budgetary restraint, in explicit acceptance of the logic of the EMS, and since then there has been no serious argument over macro-economic policy by the mainstream parties on either the left or the right. The most controversial issue used to be the debate over whether to privatise state-owned companies; but even this ideological argument has lost its excitement, since the Socialists now admit the principle of partial privatisation. Naturally, the Socialists are unhappy about the level of unemployment; as well they might be, because it will lose them the next election. But no mainstream politician of any weight promises to perform a macro-economic conjuring trick with a couple of yards of electoral tubing. Nor do they propose a significantly different macro-economic policy, to get faster economic growth and lower unemployment, because they all accept the over-riding logic of the EMS. Perhaps they are wrong. Perhaps politicians have a public duty to challenge the logic of the EMS as it is currently operating - that is to say, as a machine for low growth and high unemployment. To be sure, the international environment is going through a recessive phase, with a corresponding knock-on in Europe; but the passive logic of the evolving EMS, as it is run by the Bundesbank, has a recessionary effect of its own. In the final phase of European Monetary Union, the management of a single monetary policy can be set in a broad European fiscal context, which member governments can influence through Community institutions. By acting collectively, governments will recover a degree of control over their economies, which they have lost at the national level. During the preparatory transition, by contrast, they are fiscal prisoners of a foreign central bank whose independence can also be described, literally, as irresponsibility. The phasing of Emu, as fixed in the Treaty of Maastricht, means that the transition to a single currency will take at least another five years. Well before then, there may be some spontaneous recovery in Europe; but there seems no prospect of the kind of growth which would bring a steady fall in unemployment. The problem facing Europe's politicians is this: are they prepared to accept for another five years the consequences of a machine that produces high unemployment? The French Socialist party is about to pay a heavy price for eight years of conservative, pro-European economic policy. The big winners in next month's regional elections will not be the conservatives, but the protest parties: the National Front, the ecologists and the Communists, who will probably share 35-40 per cent of the total vote. There are only three logical choices: to opt out of Emu, to accelerate the process, or to grin and bear it. The one option which is self-delusion is mad electioneering plumbing.</p>

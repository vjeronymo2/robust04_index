			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Dec. 31 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam,  in his New Year's Day message, urged the people on Saturday to  make a brave leap forward to the world and the future in 1994  while consolidating the reform and change that they achieved in  the last year.    "Let us usher in the new year with an open mind, shedding  old  things as we have just bidden farewell to the past," Kim said.    "Let us also shed selfishness, deceit, indolence, vanity and  wastefulness in the New Year and be reborn as a new people. We  have to make 1994 a new year in which we have to wipe out the  remaining corruption and irregularities and make ours a new and  clean society."    The president said he wished that everyone would live for  their community rather than for themselves in the coming year.    "We have to demolish all kinds of obstacles within ourselves  and remold a just society that we can be proud of," the  president said. "There lies the reason why we cannot delay nor  stop our reform."    1994 must be the year during which "we have to open narrow  minds and closed doors and take the steps toward the  competitive, wide world with the confidence born of  cooperation," he said.    He said the coming year has to be the period in which Korea  not only survives in the new world order of competition but  raises its status as a nation still further.    "A chance never comes twice," Kim declared. "And it is said  that chance and crisis come together."    The president urged the people to grab the opportunity that,  he said, was being created as a challenge through  internationalization and openness, referring, among other  things, to the successful conclusion of the uruguay round of  trade negotiations under which Korea will open its farm market.    "We cannot afford to miss the best opportunity that has come  our way in a long while," he said.    Everyone will have to take up the challenge of competition,  at work, on the street, at home and in school, Kim said.    "None of us should ever forget that we are the main player  in  international competition. And we have to win, at any cost," he  declared.    "We cannot afford to waste our precious time by engaging in  wasteful dissension and enmity," he said.    "In order to win the unrestrained competition in  international arenas, let us concentrate our creativity and  ability to boost our national strength and organization. We  have to make 1994 the starting point for reform and progress  toward the world and the future. We should not cling to  unproductive arguments but find the right answers in practical  work."    The people had to sort out what was good and beneficial for  them. Through such practical reform, Kim said, the country can  solve the problems of farmers and fishermen, who face a severe  challenge as a result of the market opening for farm imports.    "Let us gather our wisdom and strength in order to give hope  and courage to our farmers," he said.    Lastly, the president said, he prayed for genuine peace to  befall the still divided Korean peninsula through a resolution  of the North Korean nuclear question this year.    "Let us work together to make 1994 a year in which Koreans  living in the North can take part in the worldwide trend of  reform and openness as well as in our people's historical  mission to create a new Korea," he said.</p>

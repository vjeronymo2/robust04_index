			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: TWA loss deepens to Dollars 57m as interest payments rise Net losses at Trans World Airlines, the struggling US carrier, deepened to Dollars 57m from Dollars 52.3m in the second quarter to June. The airline also ended the period with net cash down from Dollars 135m at the end of the first quarter to just Dollars 116.5m. The company said total revenues rose by 11.7 per cent to Dollars 885.8m and operating losses fell from Dollars 31m a year earlier to Dollars 17.4m. Interest payments, however, rose by Dollars 19.7m because of new debt issued in connection with its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November last year. TWA, which is 45 per cent owned by its employees, has not made a profit since emerging from bankruptcy. All its credit facilities are drawn, virtually all its assets are pledged, and it has insufficient cash to repay Dollars 190m worth of debt falling due for repayment in January. Earlier this month it announced plans to cut costs by shedding up to 3,000 jobs, or 12 per cent of its workforce. It also announced the closure of its operations in Geneva and Zurich, Switzerland, and the suspension of polar flights between Los Angeles and Paris for the winter. TWA said losses at its Atlanta hub were a substantial contributor to the latest operating loss. At the end of May, TWA reduced its presence at Atlanta, cutting daily flights from 57 to 11 and transferring them to its profitable St Louis hub in Missouri. Mr Jeffrey Erickson, promoted last week from chief operating officer to chief executive, said the latest results added urgency to the need for management and employees to unite in their efforts to 're-invent' TWA. 'We are moving forward quickly to finalise a new business plan and complete historic negotiations with our unions to improve productivity,' he said. TWA does not expect its financial position to improve substantially and it may be forced to sell assets or seek outside financing to stay aloft, according to papers filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Reuter adds from New York. The airline also said it was uncertain whether restructuring plans can be implemented quickly enough to stabilise its precarious footing. TWA said it may sell its Midcoast Aviation Inc subsidiary, which maintains, services and owns small aircraft, and its International Aviation Security unit, which provides airport security to TWA and other carriers. Potential asset sales could generate Dollars 38m by the end of the year, the filing said.</p>

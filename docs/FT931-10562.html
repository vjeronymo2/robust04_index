			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / France returns to Indochina stage: Mitterrand's visit is aimed at restarting and opening up the Vietnamese economy - It will be the first visit by a western head of state to a united Vietnam PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand plans to combine business in Vietnam and diplomacy in Cambodia during a five-day trip which will, according to his spokesman, mark France's 'return to the Indochina stage.' Mr Mitterrand will tomorrow arrive in Hanoi for the first visit by a French president, and the first by a western head of state, to a united Vietnam. Perhaps the most eye-catching occasion of his trip will be Wednesday's visit to Dien Bien Phu, where French forces - now back to help the United Nations keep peace in neighbouring Cambodia - surrendered to the Vietnamese after a long battle in 1954. The visit to Dien Bien Phu threatened to raise tricky protocol issues when it appeared that Mr Mitterrand's hosts envisaged the French president paying homage to a Vietnamese war memorial there. Such an action would have raised hackles in France, and the Elysee has since made clear that Mr Mitterrand's motive in visiting the battlefield is historical and apolitical. In any case, the president is unveiling a memorial to the French veterans of Indochina in France a week later. His main aim in Vietnam will be to help 'restart and open up the economy', according to his spokesman, Mr Jean Musitelli. France is already the third largest investor in Vietnam after Taiwan and Hong Kong. Paris' intention to increase economic links will be underlined by the presence of Mr Serge Tchuruk, president of the Total oil company, and other French businessmen and bankers. Last week EMC, a French mining and chemical company, said it had won permission to build a Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.2m) cargo terminal on the Thi Vai river near Ho Chi Minh City. France rapidly increased bilateral grants to Vietnam to FFr185m (Pounds 22.8m) last year, according to Mr Musitelli, who also stressed Paris' support for Vietnam's re-entry into the IMF. France would continue to press the US to be 'more realistic' and lift its veto on Vietnam's IMF application. Vietnam's communist government, cast adrift by Moscow after the collapse of the Soviet Union, is anxious to win new allies in Europe and the US to counterbalance the commercial power of Japan and to help restrain Chinese expansionism. The Vietnamese and Cambodians, with no illusions about France's international influence, are much less sentimental about the legacy of French colonialism in Indochina. Baguettes are still served in Hanoi and Phnom Penh cafes, but English rather than French is the language of choice for businessmen and politicians. The focus of Mr Mitterrand's trip to Cambodia, which begins on Thursday, will be to support the peace process both by visiting the 2,800 French army contingent in the UN force and by attempting to sort out the confusion over a French-backed plan to have Prince Norodom Sihanouk elected president. Prince Sihanouk, supported by France and Russia, wanted to become president before a UN-organised general election in May, ostensibly so that he could bring stability to Cambodia and mediate between the rival factions while a new constitution was prepared. The US, Britain and Australia at first opposed a presidential election, arguing it was not mentioned in the comprehensive Paris peace accords of 1991 and could give Prince Sihanouk too much power; when they reluctantly agreed, Prince Sihanouk suggested he might not want to stand after all. French officials, accusing their western colleagues of lacking the necessary subtlety to deal with the complexities of Cambodian politics, are still backing the prince. 'For France, Prince Sihanouk is the best (presidential) candidate, the man most likely to unite Cambodians and prepare a future coalition government,' the Elysee official said. France co-chairs with Japan an international committee to mobilise aid to Cambodia, and on a bilateral basis gave FFr63m (Pounds 7.8m) in aid last year.</p>

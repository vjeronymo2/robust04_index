			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  THE BUTCHER: BASIC MEAT SAUCE: NOW YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN CONVENIENCE FOODS  </P> <P> In my opinion we spend an unnecessary fortune on foods we perceive to be  convenient.  </P> <P> In the market where I do much of my shopping, the three-tiered self-service  meat case and the frozen food case are on either side of the same aisle. It is  easy and -- for the seriously frugal shopper -- almost impossible not to  compare the prices of frozen convenience entrees with the price of the fresh  meat from which they are made.  </P> <P> On a recent trip to the market to pick up lean ground beef for 99 cents a  pound, I stepped across the aisle to check on the prices of the stuff I would  make with it: chili con carne, 8 3/4-ounce single serving, $1.95; spaghetti  with meat sauce, 12 7/8-ounce single serving, $2.25; lasagna, 10 1/2-ounce  single serving, $2.25. In my opinion, those prices border on the ridiculous  when compared to my ground-beef buy.  </P> <P> What follows is a recipe for a simple Basic Meat Sauce that can be prepared  ahead -- frozen in appropriate-sized portions and used to make all kinds of  delicious dishes quickly. It's like making your own convenience foods. It takes  a bit of time, but considering the savings to be made, it's well worth the time  spent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BASIC MEAT SAUCE  </P> <P> 6 or 8 onions, chopped  </P> <P> 3 or 4 carrots, chopped  </P> <P> 1/4 cup olive or salad oil  </P> <P> 2 or 3 tablespoons parsley or 1 fresh bunch, chopped  </P> <P> 5 pounds lean ground beef  </P> <P> 1 (15-ounce) can tomato puree  </P> <P> 1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups strong chicken stock (if stock is weak, add 1 to 2 chicken bouillon  cubes)  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Cook onions and carrots in oil in 8-quart stock pot until tender, but not  browned. Stir in parsley and cook until tender. Remove vegetables from pan to  large bowl and set aside.  </P> <P> Brown ground beef in same pot in 1 1/2-pound batches. As each batch is cooked,  add to vegetables.  </P> <P> After all beef is browned and removed, add tomato puree, tomato sauce and  chicken broth and stir to loosen bits on bottom of pot. Return beef and  vegetables to pot and simmer, uncovered, about 30 minutes. Allow sauce to cool,  package into 2- or 3-cup packages and freeze. Makes about 2 1/2 quarts.  </P> <P> Now what are you going to do with all that stuff?

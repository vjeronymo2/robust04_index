			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item; by Borislav Lalic] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, May 27 (TANJUG) -- The United States for  the first time on Thursday forced itself to admit that all  Bosnian warring sides were responsible for the war in the former  Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry on Thursday  said  that the U.S. Government did not single out anyone as  responsible for the setback in the Bosnian peace talks.  Washington has, on all earlier occasions, laid the blame for the  Bosnian civil war on the Serbs, increasingly often referring to  them as the aggressors. It is probably premature to interpret  McCurry's statement as an about-face in Washington's policy  towards the Bosnian conflict and it the way it can be resolved.  However, Washington has come up with new signals and a change  of tone.    This can also be concluded from Wednesday's statement by  U.S.  President Bill Clinton, who said that the United States would  not unilaterally exempt the Bosnian Moslems from the U.N. arms  sales embargo, imposed in 1991 on all of the former Yugoslavia.    This came as a cold shower for Bosnian Moslem leader Alija  Izetbegovic, who, in an interview to the WASHINGTON POST, has  said that the Moslems would beat the Serbs, if not by knocking  them out, then by scoring points. This the more so since  Izetbegovic made the statement on the eve of the opening of the  Talloires peace talks on Bosnia.    McCurry's statement also implied the State Department's turn  about, as he resolutely dismissed speculations that the U.S.  would support the Moslem-Croat federation's demand to be given  58 per cent of Bosnian territory.    McCurry argued that Izetbegovic was familiar with the U.S.  position on the territorial division of Bosnia-Herzegovina based  on the European Union [EU] plan, which envisages 49 per cent of  the territory for the Bosnian Serbs and 51 for the Moslem-Croat  federation.    Washington has thus stressed its commitment to the E.U.  peace  plan in seeking a political solution to the Bosnian crisis.    What is the most important is that the U.S. has turned  towards Europe's realistic orientation, which should imply that  a peaceful settlement will be sought in negotiations rather in  NATO military actions.    Washington's volte face could also imply that the  belligerence of the Bosnian Moslems might subside.    However, it is a different matter altogether if Washington's  new frame of mind would be enough for peace to prevail.</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Arts: A board-game of sex and death - Film DAMAGE (18)Louis Malle THE PUBLIC EYE (15) Howard Franklin THE END OF THE GOLDEN WEATHER (PG) Ian Mune HONEY I BLEW UP THE KID (U)Randal Kleiser FOLKS] (PG) Ted Kotcheff In Louis Malle's Damage the main characters could be refugees from a game of Cluedo. Married British MP Jeremy Irons  - let us call him Mr Grey  - falls dangerously in love with ambassador's daughter Juliette Binoche, let us call her Miss Black. (The hair, high-heel shoes and knock-em-dead stockings are all in midnight monochrome.) Since Miss Black is Mr Grey's son's girlfriend and prospective bride, neither son (Rupert Graves) nor mother (Miranda Richardson) must know. All goes well  - or as well as rough sex between an ageing Minister and beautiful Anglo-French girl can go  - until Madame Marigold-Yellow (Leslie Caron) blows in. She is Miss Black's mother, come from South America to pour trouble on oiled waters. A few reels later: death. Weapon, a bunch of keys. Place, a house in West London. Victim and culprit  - for me to know and you to learn. Damage is scripted by David Hare from the novel by Josephine Hart and has the screaming orderliness of Hare's best film Wetherby. At first the sense of neat board-game melodramatics seems constricting. We have seen these moves before, haven't we? Not least in Losey-Pinter's 1967 Accident: perm Irons and Graves into Dirk Bogarde and Michael York and then add an interchangeable French-accented homewrecker. But Hare and Malle make a more brutalist, 1990s partnership and an ultimately brilliant film. In Accident the Britain burst open by romantic apocalypse was the old cricket-and-dreaming-spires one. Damage gives us an older, greyer Euro-Britain already raddled by geo-political anxieties. Here a French film-maker and English writer can find common ground in a tale of sex, death and Brussels agriculture initiatives. With tariff barriers crumbling, not even passion now bothers to stop at borders. In mid-movie Irons is seen nervously woolgathering at an EC conference, before dashing off to Paris to disturb the bedsheets of his weekending son and mistress. Elsewhere in the film the language of sex - that gymnastic gobbledegook that unites co-linguists and excludes all foreigners  - is treated at once frankly and scientifically. As Irons and Binoche grapple on carpets, on tables or in stand-up French alleyways, we recognise a human phenomenon at once stirringly visceral and arcanely, forbiddingly ritualistic. Damage is a psychosexual board-game, blending real emotion with a postmodern fondness for heraldic tropes. Though Miss Binoche's nymphomania is humanised by a back-history about a brother who killed himself, we know that she is really the Angel of Love and Death: a belle dame sans merci for the mid-life Minister. He in turn is pluperfect Mr Grey, the very model of a modern Major generalist, though Jeremy Irons gives him so many sad and witty shadings that the particular grows from the prototypical. Malle, with cameraman Peter Biziou and designer Brian Morris, creates a visual style that sets off the movie's ever more telling ambivalences. Hints of hyperbole  - in the stately piles of Irons's social circle, in the stark angles and colours of Binoche's neo-Art Deco flat  - are softened by humanist lighting. And even the character who seems most unbendingly iconic, Miranda Richardson pale and enamelled-of-feature as Irons's wife, is allowed a scarifying scene at the close: a breakdown played as if all the wellbehaved misery of Britain had at last been allowed its voice and revenge. 'Why are you doing this?' someone asks The Public Eye's news-photographer hero on catching him in flagrante depicto. 'It's what I do, that's all' comes back shutterbug Leon Bernstein (Joe Pesci). The movie's 'Bernzy' is based on real-life 1940s photographer 'Weegee', who earned his name from his ouija-like powers of getting to murder scenes before the police and almost before the murderers. Exchanges like this  - terse, hardboiled, pseudo-profound  - proliferate in this solo directing debut by Howard Franklin, who co-directed the Bill Murray comedy Quick Change and scripted the Ridley Scott thriller Someone To Watch Over Me. The Public Eye is like a daft compote of both. There are bits of film noir romance/suspense, as lumpen-paparazzo Pesci courts glistening nightclub owner Barbara Hershey. (Plot: she is being blackmailed by the Mafia). And there are bits  - better bits  - of caustic knockabout as Pesci performs his quick-change routines in order to hi-jack moments of criminal history. Student photo-journalists, please note the skill with which he cuts out a 'dog-collar' from an old shirtsleeve, turning into a priest to crash a wounded crook's ambulance. Wit, though, is slowly pushed aside by portentous wisdom. As well as likable clown our Bernzy must be a misunderstood artist: his snaps of poverty or urban violence dismissed as 'too sensational' by publishers he approaches to print them in book form. So sent back into the streets, he decides to show them how sensational life really is. Following a Mafia black-market intrigue all the way to a showdown between families, he is there to catch the bloodbath on camera. It sounds schematic and, oh dear, it is. Through the retro-noir visuals move the plot pawns. Poor Miss Hershey looks as if her daily call-sheet read 'Come dressed as Gene Tierney or Barbara Stanwyck' and only Pesci, resembling an overfed penguin in a mac, crackles out lines with some of the animist venom he found for GoodFellas. Franklin directs like a man divided: it is as if he is holding up a photo of what a 'stylish' film should be like with one hand, cranking the camera with the other, and nervously glancing between the two as dramatic life drains away. According to cinema from the Antipodes  - see My Brilliant Career, The Getting Of Wisdom, Celia, Flirting etc. etc.  - growing up is a fulltime occupation. Adults are those oversize eccentrics who loom in from side of screen, wielding a Bible or cane or rolling pin. Children are those holy truants who forever wander the gilded beach or outback seeking and finding lost Edens. The End Of The Golden Weather is the recipe as before. But as directed by Ian Mune from a stage play by Bruce Mason, it has such charm you tuck in eagerly. We are on a stretch of New Zealand coast with cliffs like layer cake. The usual grown-ups hover round the side of the narrative banquet table  - fierce Dad, dimpling Mum, dotty aunts and uncles  - while 12-year-old Geoff (Stephen Fulford) sits in the middle. Also jockeying for space are Geoff's mentally defective pal Firpo (Stephen Papps), who wants to be an Olympic runner, and the real Olympic runners who interrupt their beach training to rag Firpo something rotten. Nothing and everything happens. Indeed the film is best when pursuing the sublimely marginal: like the night of disastrous Christmas theatricals by Geoff and his young sister and brother. Despite moments of here-we-go-again Antipodean archness  - need there be quite so many shots of gorgeous beach and sunset-golden rollers?  - this is a film about feeling good to be alive which makes us feel good to be alive. Honey, I Blew Up The Kid makes us feel there are worse things than a swift and painless demise. Suburban boffin Rick Moranis, last seen shrinking his spawn at great special-effects cost to Disney, here goes the other way. Two-and-a-half year old, 112-foot Adam becomes the Baby That Terrorised Las Vegas. But wit and true inventiveness are left behind in miniature state, along with Moranis and his struggling co-stars (Marcia Strassman, John Shea, Lloyd Bridges). Folks] is worse: a long, questionably tasteful, unquestionably mirthless comedy about Alzheimer's disease. Directed by Ted Kotcheff, it has Tom Selleck coping with senile dementia in father Don Ameche. The title plus exclamation mark says all. Next up, no doubt, if they make a sequel: Oldies], Wrinklies] or Loonies]</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft scheme approved Shareholders in Metallgesellschaft approved the second phase of a rescue package for the beleaguered German metals group after a stormy annual meeting which focused mainly on alleged shortcomings of the supervisory board. Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chief executive, called on shareholders to approve the issue of profit-sharing certificates with a value of up to DM111m (Dollars 66m), after they had voted through a DM3.4bn rescue package at an extraordinary meeting in February. Mr Neukirchen, one of Germany's best-known company doctors, was appointed when the group almost collapsed in December, after its US operation lost DM2.3bn in oil futures trading. Many shareholders lambasted Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, chairman of the supervisory board, for failing to safeguard against the huge exposure the group had in oil futures, an activity Mr Schmitz said he did not know about. Meanwhile, Metallgesellschaft said this week that the pressing need to cut costs meant it was withdrawing its 49 per cent stake in South East Asia Metals Company, a joint venture with the Thai group Padaeng Industry to build a smelting works.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Haiti faction attacked US forces in Haiti yesterday stormed the headquarters of Fraph, the nationalist paramilitary faction loyal to the army government, as the US took the initiative on Haiti's political stability, reports James Harding in Washington. The attempt to neutralise the Fraph, which killed at least five people at a pro-democracy march last Friday, was the first instance of the more aggressive US policy to disarm those Haitians thought to be trying to stop the restoration of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. After US soldiers had raided the offices of Fraph in downtown Port-au-Prince and put a tank outside the building, a crowd of Aristide supporters gathered outside. The raid will be seen as a response to criticisms that the US forces were failing to guarantee free political expression.</p>

Another three economic agreements were signed by heads of  Ukrainian and Lithuanian ministries and departments.    Kravchuk and Brazauskas praised the documents at a news  conference and described them as "historic and upgrading the  Lithuanian-Ukrainian relations."    Asked whether the Ukrainian striving to join the Partnership  for Peace program will influence its relations and negotiations  with Russia, Kravchuk said it won't happen since Russia may also  join the program.    As for the Black Sea Fleet, the Ukrainian president noted  "it  is a vitally important problem for Ukraine, and it should be  settled on a mutually beneficial basis, which is being done.  Russia is a Ukrainian foreign political priority. One should  distinguish the state policy from the policy of the opposition.  We stand for good-neighbourly peaceful relations with Russia."    Both presidents called for the expansion of  Ukrainian-Lithuanian economic relations, which have not reached  a worthy level.    Kravchuk suggested Ukrainian use of the Klaipeda port to  "give Ukrainian goods way to northern Europe via the Baltic Sea  and Lithuanian goods -- to the south via Ukrainian Black Sea  ports".</p>

			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Whale sanctuary plan shelved A SCHEME to make the Antarctic Ocean a sanctuary free of whaling suffered a reverse yesterday at the International Whaling Commission when France, proposer of the idea, asked for its consideration to be deferred to next year. France took the decision at the annual meeting of the IWC in Glasgow because of the strength of opposition from whaling nations. It was greeted with dismay by conservation bodies, which had seen the proposal as a further step to preserve remaining whale stocks. At the week-long IWC meeting, nations with whaling industries are seeking a resumption of commercial whaling through the adoption of a scheme known as the revised management procedure (RMP). A moratorium on commercial whaling came into effect in 1985-86 but IWC research suggests that numbers of the small minke whale have since recovered. Norway has already said it will resume commercial whaling next year whatever the IWC decides. Iceland this week left the IWC altogether. France faced opposition to its sanctuary plan from Japan, Norway, Mexico and China. Japan also had the backing of four Caribbean states, St Vincent, St Lucia, Dominica and St Kitts. With these countries opposed the proposal would not have commanded the required 75 per cent majority of the 29 states attending the meeting of the 37-member IWC. Even had it been supported in principle, the proposal, which would have outlawed whaling beyond the 40 degree south latitude, would not have come into effect for some years, and it is said to have been poorly prepared. Greenpeace, the environmental group, early yesterday called off a protest that on Tuesday blocked the departure from Glasgow of the Elin Toril, a Norwegian whaling boat, which had sailed to Scotland to support Norway's case for resumed whaling. Instead it called on Britain to use its European Community presidency to block any application by Norway to join the EC while it carried out whaling.</p>

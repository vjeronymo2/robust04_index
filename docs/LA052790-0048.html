			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UES MOVE CALLED AN EXCELLENT IDEA  </P> <P> In my opinion, the move of University Elementary School to Ocean Park is an  excellent idea.  </P> <P> Our family has researched UES for our children to attend. The possibility of  attending UES at its present location is slim to none, and the proposed move  would bring UES to our neighborhood as a public school. This quality school  could benefit many families like ours without the worry of financial burden.  </P> <P> The proposed site is a superior location for the students, as well as the  surrounding community. The present public school (John Muir) is located on a  very busy intersection, and UES needs to be relocated from its current  privileged isolated location into a neighborhood setting.  </P> <P> BOB MOORE  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

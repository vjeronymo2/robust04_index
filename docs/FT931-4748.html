			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / India to end tough stance in Kashmir NEW DELHI is rethinking its hard line on Moslem militants in India's Kashmir region and is working on a political settlement to end three years of bloody rebellion there, a government spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from New Delhi. The spokesman said Mr Rajesh Pilot, junior home (interior) minister, had a meeting with the militants during a visit last month to high-security detention centres in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The state governor, Mr Girish Saxena, was behind the talks. He was quoted as telling New Delhi: 'The time has come when politicians should become more active in the state.' The spokesman said Mr Saxena endorsed New Delhi's softer line, which involves a shake-up of the local administration and more patrolling on the border with Pakistan. He did not rule out talks with Moslem militants. Until now India has refused to hold talks with militants until they surrender arms and agree not to discuss secession. Mr Saxena strongly favoured moves on the political front which would lead to the resumption of a political process in the Kashmir valley, the spokesman said. India has ruled the Himalayan state directly from New Delhi since Moslem rebels started fighting in earnest for secession from Hindu-majority India in 1990, forcing the suspension of the elected state assembly. About 8,500 people have been killed in the quest for independence or merger with Pakistan, which controls a third of Kashmir. India and Pakistan have gone to war twice over Kashmir since they became independent from Britain in 1947. New Delhi accuses Islamabad of supporting the rebels, a charge Pakistan denies. But Mr Pilot, who came to the home ministry in a cabinet reshuffle last month, is known for what he calls a pragmatic view of the conflict.</p>

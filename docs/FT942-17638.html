			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / All Change - Your guide to the new British Rail: The 'train set' costs Pounds 10m, for starters - Want to move from a miniature railway to the real thing? Charles Batchelor explains what you will pay The closest most rail enthusiasts get to running a railway is a miniature lay-out in the attic or the garage. A small minority achieves the greater reality of operating one of Britain's growing number of preserved steam railways. The privatisation of British Rail provides the opportunity for the real enthusiast to run his or her own proper railway. Most of the private rail companies are expected to be run by management buy-out teams or companies already in other fields of transport but there should be opportunities for smaller operators to run trains under 'open access' agreements. These are intended to increase competition. But how affordable would it be to own and run a modern day railway train? Take one of the stalwarts of BR's fleet, its InterCity 125 High Speed Trains. These are diesel-powered trains which run on lines such as London Paddington to Wales and the West Country route. Now 18 years in service, after initial problems these trains are now running better and more reliably than ever, according to Mr John Cronin, BR's area fleet manager in Bristol. A complete train set - railway jargon for a locomotive and coaches - would set you back Pounds 10m new - about Pounds 3m for the twin locos, one at the front, another at the back, and eight coaches at about Pounds 750,000 each. But buying a new train is not as simple as acquiring a new car. They are built to order and then only in production runs which make manufacturing economic. British railway manufacturing has been dogged by relatively short-run orders which do not allow for the continuous modification and improvement of successful designs, Mr Cronin says. The High Speed Trains are powered by a marine engine, chosen because it was relatively light, thus causing less wear and tear on the track. But marine engines are designed to run for long periods at the same speed, unlike trains which accelerate and decelerate rapidly, so modifications had to be made in the first few years. It is more likely that you will lease second-hand BR rolling stock. Comparisons with cars are difficult because leasing rates depend on mileage and depreciation usually over two to three years, while a typical train set will last for 30 years or more. In addition the Treasury has still to agree the details of the leasing regime with the train-operating companies. So leave the leasing costs out of your calculations for the moment. Before you can take a car on on the road you need to pay road tax, or in the case of a train, your access charge to Railtrack, which took over BR's track and signalling on April 1. Track charges vary but the Great Western Railway is expected to pay Pounds 120m a year. Spread that over its 36 high speed trains and you are paying Pounds 3.3m for each one. Fuel costs are a significant charge to the motorist and the HSTs have a 1,100 gallon tank in each power unit. A large tank is needed because each train set only does half a mile to the gallon. Great Western declines to reveal what it pays for its diesel, but at the average rate charged to the private motorist a full tank will cost you just over Pounds 2,500. Maintenance, inevitably, is costly. You can expect your locomotives to go in for a big overhaul every 2 1/2 to three years at a cost of Pounds 180,000 including Pounds 120,000 for the diesel engines. The two-yearly overhaul of your carriages, mainly replacing the bogies - sets of twin axles - will cost another Pounds 100,000. But you will also be replacing the standard components which wear out on any vehicle at regular smaller services. Brake pads will cost you Pounds 62 a pair plus labour to replace. This may not appear a big item but your train set will have 160 wheels. Great Western reckons to replace nearly 26,000 brake pads a year on its fleet of 36 high speed trains. You might think that a vehicle with metal wheels would be spared the inconvenience of punctures, but train wheels do suffer 'flats'. These result when a train skids, a common occurence when leaves fall on the line. This flattens a small section of the wheel causing a bumpy ride. The introduction of an anti-skid mechanism on the trains, akin to the anti-brake locking systems on cars, has cut the incidence of 'flats' but they do still occur. Regrinding wheels will cost you Pounds 200 a time. Few motorists respray their cars completely, but trains require a regular repaint - by hand because the large number of windows make spraying uneconomic - to retain their looks. Expect to shell out Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 3,000 per coach once every four years and Pounds 4,000 for a locomotive or power car. Keeping your paintwork looking smart between resprays is also costly. Reckon on Pounds 250 and 1,000 gallons of water each time you stop off at the trainwash. You might think that the opportunity for minor 'shunts' with a vehicle which runs on a fixed line would be very small. But collisions with animals, suicides and debris on the line are not uncommon. Apart from a dent in the bonnet you are likely to suffer considerable damage to the pipework and other bits of machinery under the train. Set aside Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 10,000 for a 'nose end' replacement. Insurance is another significant item for the car driver though you can reduce the charges by accepting a larger 'excess.' At present BR has catastrophe insurance which starts at Pounds 15m, meeting its own costs for claims below that level. You would have to shop around for insurance for your train since this is not an established sector. The private companies considering taking over BR's operations are apparently working on catastrophe insurance starting at Pounds 5m. With the proper training you should be able to drive your own train, but if you go above 110mph you must have a second driver. Drivers' basic rates start at Pounds 210 a week but the average earnings are more than Pounds 300 a week. BR calculates that the cost of operating an InterCity train was Pounds 16 a mile in 1992-93. Compare this with the 45p per mile paid by the average private motorist and 18p to 20p per mile which Fleet Car magazine calculates for the typical business motorist driving a mid-size car. One consolation is that the government will help you to meet your bills. It has promised to maintain subsidies after privatisation - though the managers considering buy-outs wonder how long the Treasury will keep up its support. Sailing has been described as the closest thing to standing in a cold shower tearing up Pounds 10 notes. Running a train is rather similar though the modern enclosed cabs will at least keep you dry.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1  TRAIN OPERATING COMPANIES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Passenger trains will be run by 25 train operating companies. These    will ultimately be franchised to the private sector for periods    expected to range from five to 20 years. They will employ train    drivers, inspectors and ticket office staff. They will not own many    assets, renting the track they use and leasing both their trains and    stations. Some companies, such as Gatwick Express, will run a single    line; others such as ScotRail will operate a complete network.    Employees on April 1: 49,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 2  RAILTRACK  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Takes over responsibility for track, signalling and its stations. It    will charge the passenger train operators depending on how many    trains they run. It will maintain track, bridges and stations and    co-ordinate the timetables of operating companies. Responsible for    the safety of the network under the eye of the Health and Safety    Executive. Employees April 1: 12,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 3  STATIONS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Railtrack will own all of the nearly 2,500 stations but will lease    most to train operating companies. They will take over routine    maintenance such as fixing the station clock but Railtrack will    remain responsible for structural repairs. About 13 of the larger    stations, including Birmingham New Street, Londons Kings Cross and    Manchester Piccadilly, where there are greater development    opportunities, will be let on long leases to private companies,    probably property developers. Whoever acquired the lease would let    the retail outlets and provide day-to-day maintenance.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 4  ROLLING STOCK LEASING COMPANIES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Three rolling stock leasing companies will take over ownership of    11,000 locomotives, carriages and freight wagons. They will lease    them out to the companies operating passenger and freight services.    At first they will only have second-hand BR rolling stock but as    train operating companies renew their fleets they are expected to    order new rolling stock. The rolling stock companies will ultimately    be privatised, probably by sale to existing leasing companies or    financial institutions. Employees on April 1: 150.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 5  INFRASTRUCTURE COMPANIES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Railtrack will contract out maintenance of track and signalling to 14    infrastructure service units. These are the men you see alongside the    track in bright orange safety jackets. They carry out 'heavy' work,    such as renewing sections of track and putting in new ballast under    the sleepers, and the lighter work of maintaining signalling and    electrification equipment. Employees on April 1: 33,500  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 6  MAINTENANCE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Light maintenance, such as repairing train interiors and renewing    damaged wheels, will be carried out in workshops run by the operating    companies but leased from Railtrack. Major overhauls of locomotives    will be carried out by one of six heavy maintenance depots. They are    up for sale with bids expected from rolling stock manufacturers such    as GEC Alsthom and ABB Transportation. Employees April 1: 3,500  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 7  FREIGHT  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Three new regional companies take over responsibility for heavy    freight operations, involving complete trainloads of bulk products    such as coal, steel and building aggregates. The domestic carrier    business, Freightliner, which moves container wagons from seaports to    inland terminals will be sold off as a single unit. Haulmark, the    international container arm, will also be sold. All freight operators    will pay Railtrack for the use of its track and signalling.    Employees on April 1: 13,100  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 8  PARCELS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Red Star Parcels, the express parcels business, and Rail Express    Systems, which carry the Post Office's mail, will be sold as soon as    possible. Employees on April 1: 1,800  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 9  THE FRANCHISING DIRECTOR  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Mr Roger Salmon, a former merchant banker, is to arrange the sale of    railway franchises. He will negotiate with potential franchisees    including management buy-out teams or outside buyers such as bus    companies, airlines and shipping groups. He will decide, depending on    the bids he receives, the length and cost of the franchise. He also    takes on responsibility for channelling any government subsidy to the    operating companies.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 10 THE RAIL REGULATOR  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Mr John Swift QC has the twin roles of promoting competition and    protecting consumer interests. Encouraging greater competition will    tend to bring fares down and could bring him into conflict with the    franchise director, who wants to charge as much as possible for each    franchise. If a train operator has a monopoly in a particular market,    commuter trains into London, for example, the regulator may impose    maximum fare levels. He must also approve agreements between    Railtrack and the train operators.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 11 GOVERNMENT  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    The transport secretary remains in charge of overall railway policy,    negotiates with Treasury about subsidies and has the final say over    the building of new lines or the closure of existing ones. He also    appoints the franchise director, rail regulator and the chairman of    Railtrack. The Treasury will decide on the level of subsidy.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The ERM - Picking up the Pieces: Bonn announces unexpected fall in industrial output The Bonn economics ministry yesterday announced an unexpected fall in industrial output in June, following a sharp downward revision of provisional growth figures for May, writes Christopher Parkes. Total production last month was 1.5 per cent lower than in May, when industry recorded 0.7 per cent month-on-month growth, corrected from 1.2 per cent. The June figure suggests that there is some way to go before government and Bundesbank claims that the recession may be drawing to a close can be substantiated.</p>

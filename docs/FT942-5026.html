			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Survey of Danish Food Industry 4: How rennet led to biotechnology - Profile / Christian Hansen Given Denmark's long history in the world food industry, one might expect its food companies to have reached a mature old age. A striking exception to this is the Christian Hansen Group, which supplies food ingredients to multinational giants such as Nestle, Kraft, General Foods and BSN. Christian Hansen was founded as long ago as 1874, specialising in the manufacture of rennet, the cheese ingredient used to clot milk and give the cheese its flavour. It is still the world's biggest rennet supplier, with about 20-25 per cent of the world market. The world cheese market is scarcely growing: however, that did not stop the company increasing profits last year by 30 per cent to DKr181m (Pounds 18.65m) before tax, and by 36 per cent the year before. With sales of around DKr1.5bn (Pounds 150m), Christian Hansen is scarcely a giant. Neither is it a financial minnow; being heavily involved in the glamorous business of biotechnology, it is highly rated by the stock market and its market value stands at around DKr2.5bn (Pounds 250m). The involvement in biotechnology is again something of a Danish speciality. But as Mr Poul Hansen, the company president, remarks, the term can be confusing. It is commonly taken to refer to genetic engineering, in which Hansen is involved to some extent. But, Mr Hansen says, the company's origins in the dairy industry mean it has been involved in biotechnology from the outset: in enzymes and bacterial cultures, which exist in nature but which the company began by producing in pure standardised form. The development can be illustrated by reference to rennet, which made up some 90 per cent of the company's sales as recently as 20 years ago. Until the 1970s, the company produced the natural enzyme from calves' stomachs. By the mid-1970s it was producing microbial rennet, derived from fungi or bacteria and qualifying for use in the growing market for vegetarian cheese. Then, some five years ago, it began producing genetic rennet, made by replicating the animal gene but still qualifying as vegetarian in, for instance, the UK market. In genetic rennet, it competes with Pfizer of the US and Gist-Brocades of Holland, both much larger than itself. However, this does not bother the company's executives unduly. The policy, Mr Hansen says, is to operate in niche markets, and to be big in them. Historically, the food ingredients industry around the world consisted of small, privately owned companies in each market. There are still a few left, Mr Hansen says, 'but we are one of the few which have stayed independent.' Besides Pfizer and Gist-Brocades, other giants of the pharmaceuticals business have bought their way into the industry, such as Rhone-Poulenc of France. But Hansen, too, has acquired some 15 smaller companies over the years. Plainly, it is an industry in which size means something. 'The very big multinational food companies,' says Mr Vagn Dinesen, vice-president, 'need people of a certain size as a matter of reliability. The concentration of the food industry brings a corresponding concentration in their suppliers. We follow our customers around the world, and our philosophy is to service the customer at close range. It's an expensive way of selling, but it's necessary for us.' Take, for instance, natural food colourings, another Hansen speciality. A certain red colouring, derived from paprika, is used in pepperoni sausage. 'We buy hundreds of tons of red peppers a year, from Spain, Brazil and Africa,' Mr Dinesen says. 'Suppose a big American pizza chain decides it wants to use our colouring in the pepperoni on its pizzas. When head office has decided that, it spreads throughout the world.' Oddly enough, the company's production is less scattered geographically than it used to be. 'Originally,' Mr Hansen says, 'we put production in almost every market, since transportation of rennet was a problem. Now we're cutting back: we have six rennet plants worldwide - three in Europe, two in South America and one in Australia.' In colours, Hansen now has plants in the UK, Brazil, Spain and Argentina, besides Denmark. Some of its foreign ventures have a distinctly exotic touch. Recently, it has started up a plantation producing annatto, a bush whose seeds have an orange-yellow colouring that is used in butter, mayonnaise, cheese and margarine, on the estuary of the Amazon in northern Brazil. 'Part of our philosophy,' says Mr Hansen, 'is to help industrialise food production around the world. In Denmark or the UK, food is produced in big, modern factories. In the Far East, it is typically made in households. Our philosophy is to help bring food production to industrial scale, using natural ingredients.'</p>

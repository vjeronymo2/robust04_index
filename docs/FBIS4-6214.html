			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bhimanto Suwastoyo] </F>   [Text] Medan, Indonesia, April 19 (AFP) -- Fresh  anti-Chinese sentiments flared again here Tuesday with thousands  of people sacking and looting a downtown ethnic Chinese-owned  commercial mall, witnesses said.    Between 1,000 and 2,000 people, armed with machetes, iron  picks and stones, attacked the Thamrin Plaza in downtown Medan,  owned by leading local ethnic-Chinese businessman Tanoto  Sukanto, vandalizing the building and looting the shops, the  witnesses said.    Intervening security forces immediately blocked the downtown  business area where the mall was located while shops and offices  in the area were closed again, they added.    Lawyer Hasbi Ansori of the Medan chapter of the Legal Aid  Institute confirmed that the attack took place but said the  building was not "severely damaged." He could not say how many  attackers had been involved in the incident.    Ansori said the city's downtown business district was now  completely deserted except for security forces as all businesses  had closed again.    There were no reports of arrests, the witnesses said, and  the  regional police and military spokesmen could not be reached for  comment.    Demonstrations on Thursday and Friday here by tens of  thousands of workers demanding better working conditions  degenerated into anti-Chinese rioting in which one factory owner  was killed and many ethnic Chinese properties were vandalized.    Anti-Chinese pamphlets that first appeared during Thursday's  protest, focusing on how ethnic Chinese were accumulating wealth  to the detriment of other Indonesians, have continued to  circulate in the city.    Indonesia's ethnic Chinese minority -- making up about three  percent of the population -- is widely resented for its hold on  economic power.    Meanwhile, thousands of workers around this northern  Sumatran  capital Tuesday refused to return to work for the second day in  a row.    "Today, many of the factories are still closed and the  workers are still gathering near their factories," said Jansius  Lumban Tobing, Director of the Medan Industrial Zone north of  here, adding that some 12,000 workers were believed to have  taken part in a similar strike the previous day.    "They do not want to work but only sit around near their  factories," Ansori said, adding that a strong security presence  was now in place in and around the industrial zone and that  shops had begun to reopen.    In Belawan, some 18 kilometres (11 miles) north of here, an  officer at the local police post, First Sergeant Purba, said  although some of workers in the area had started to return to  work, "most were still standing outside the fences of their  factories... demanding that their detained friends be set free."    Medan City Police Chief Colonel Chaerudin was Tuesday quoted  by the BERITA BUANA daily as saying that as of noon Monday, a  total of 112 suspects were being detained for questioning.    Witnesses said labor protests had Monday spread to Binjai,  Tanjung [word indistinct], Deli Tua and Belawan -- all towns  around Medan -- as well as in Pematang Siantar, some 125  kilometres (77 miles) southwest of here, where about 6,000  protestors went on the rampage and vandalized nine cars and a  plastic factory.    Pematang Siantar Police Chief Lieutenant Colonel Baroto  Badrus said the town was now calm.    Local military chief, Colonel Sunarto, said security  authorities were letting workers gather in front of their  factories "as long as they do not resort to destruction."</p>

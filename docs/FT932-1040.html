			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computers step on the accelerator Supercomputer users have long been able to process data at high speed, but the benefits of easy-to-use workstation software have largely passed them by. Floating Point Systems (FPS), of Bracknell, believes it has a solution with a workstation accelerator developed by Mercury Computer Systems of Massachusetts. A single multi-processor accelerator board speeds up the input and output of data to 10 times that of today's most powerful workstation. FPS believes the accelerator will be most useful in medical, defence, simulation and financial modelling applications. A workstation with accelerator costs around Pounds 50,000. FPS: UK, 0344 56921.

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Observer: Panoramic view Glenwyn Benson, just named as the first woman editor of Panorama, the BBC's battered flagship of current affairs, got the job for a somewhat surprising reason, Observer hears. Like many rising BBC current affairs stars, Benson did a spell at London Weekend Television, and is therefore indelibly tagged a 'boring Birt- ist' by those who resist the views of John Birt, BBC director general designate, and himself a founding father of the analytical LWT South Bank school of TV journalism. This was her second shot at Panorama, and many thought BBC1 Controller Jonathan Powell, a member of the selection panel on both occasions, would veto her because of that pre-BBC background. But Benson, 44 and currently editor of BBC's On the Record political programme, amazed the panel by saying that one gap in Panorama's recent repertoire was its failure to cover the date rape issue, at the time of the Mike Tyson trial. When at LWT, Benson's speciality was vivid scenes from the life of the underclass. Observer doubts, however, that she would have taken this week's cancellation of Peter Jay's film on the Tory economic mess-up without a fierce show of resistance.</p>

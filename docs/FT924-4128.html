			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Belgium (8): Impact of 'little bang' is slightly muted - Bond market becomes attractive Belgium's 'little bang' - the government reforms which came into force at the beginning of last year - was supposed to energise the Belgian financial markets. But external events conspired to undermine some of the effects of the programme.  Whether it can yet be counted a complete success depends, to an extent, on which sector of the financial markets one looks at. Below, Andrew Hill considers its effect on the stock market, futures and options and the bond and money markets THE bond and money markets were the success story of the wide-ranging financial reforms. The state reduced withholding tax on new fixed yield securities, tied the Belgian franc to the D-Mark, and, later, reformed the money market, and gave a kick-start to the market in linear bonds (which are known as OLOs). The result has been a reduction in interest rate differentials between Germany and Belgium, and active primary and secondary markets in government debt instruments and treasury bills. In the secondary market, total transactions in OLOs averaged BFr25bn daily between the beginning of 1991 and mid-1992, and BFr30bn in treasury bills. On a recent finance ministry mission to Asia, investors complained about the lack of liquidity in Belgian bonds during their morning trading period - an indication, say Belgian officials, of the growing attractiveness of these instruments to international investors. Domestically, debt costs for the Belgian state have been reduced, and the investor now has a much wider choice of instruments. The reform is not over. Since October, primary dealers in OLOs have been able to 'strip' the long-term 2007 linear bonds, allowing principal and coupon to be dealt separately - adding Belgium to France and the US as the only countries in the world which offer such a facility. The government also wants to diversify the market by allowing securitisation of government debt and encouraging the corporate bond market, an area where Belgium has always lost out to Luxembourg with its combination of tax breaks and banking expertise. The key, according to Belgian officials, is to attract issuers to the market, and to that end, a draft law aims to cut the upfront cost of issuing corporate bonds. It will also extend to corporate bonds the complex book-entry clearing system used for OLOs. This would allow Belgian corporations and non-Belgian holders of bearer bonds - usually difficult to identify for tax purposes - to benefit from their exemption from withholding tax on such instruments. Officials hope the framework for such a system will be in place by the middle of next year.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NYMEX, COMEX EXCHANGES EXPLORING POSSIBLE MERGER  </P> <P> The New York Mercantile Exchange and Commodity Exchange Inc. said Wednesday  that they were exploring a merger of the two markets, a combination that  analysts said could give the Comex the most immediate rewards.  </P> <P> The two commodities markets announced that they were pursuing merger  negotiations and would form a joint board that would govern any consolidated  company resulting from a merger.  </P> <P> The exchanges, which trade precious metals and energy futures, said they agreed  to form a joint governing board after their executive committees met Tuesday.  </P> <P> The markets' respective boards instructed their executive committees to  continue negotiations over the most efficient way to consolidate the  administration and operations of the exchanges. Analysts said Nymex and Comex,  which have been housed in the same lower Manhattan building since 1933, have  discussed merging at various times over the last decade.  </P> <P> Sharing resources would mean greater efficiency and cost savings for both  exchanges, but particularly for the smaller commodities exchange, they said.  </P> <P> The joint governing body will include a chairman who is a Nymex member, a vice  chairman who is a Comex member, 16 Nymex member directors, eight Comex member  directors and six public directors.  </P></p>

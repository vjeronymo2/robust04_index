			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Lilibeth Da Corte from the "Union Radio </F> News" newscast]    [Text] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar has embarked on a  campaign to reform the Interior Ministry--a campaign that  includes the restriction of gun licenses, the elimination of  certain permits, and the recovery of illegal weapons, as well as  a crusade to train citizens on bearing arms.    [Begin recording] [Escovar] We want to expedite the issuance  of gun licenses, remove middlemen from the process of issuing  them, and make people pay what the law stipulates, instead of  paying for bribes, which trigger illegal gunrunning in the  country. In other words, we want to moralize the Interior  Ministry's services, as well as increase its control. The  Interior Ministry must control this issue. No other Venezuelan  authority can issue gun licenses. This is what the law  stipulates, and the law must be enforced.    [Da Corte] Would you please explain to us why the population  should see the issuance of gun licenses as something that has  gone awry? Those who want to bear arms should be able to. This  does not necessarily mean people are going to start killing one  another.    [Escovar] Of course not. Those who have gun licenses do not  kill; usually it is only those who lack gun licenses. On the  other hand, the legal and peaceful use of arms is a discipline  that must be taught to the people; it is part of public  education campaigns. It is also part of democracy, but so far we  have failed to accomplish this goal. Therefore, we must strive  to accomplish it. In a national emergency, we cannot let  peaceful citizens go unarmed while criminals and thieves are  armed. [end recording]    The head of the Interior Ministry also listed some measures  that will be adopted shortly, including the expediting of the  issuance of gun licenses and removing middlemen from the process  of obtaining gun licenses, as well as exerting effective control  on the issuance of gun licenses.</p>

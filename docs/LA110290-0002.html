			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHARING BLAME OF 'MORAL MUTANTS'  </P> <P> Gary Abrams' "Moral Mutants" article on Michael Josephson's ethics research was  shocking and sad.  </P> <P> Young American adults have learned selfishness from their parents, public  officials and business leaders. It's a sad commentary on the quality of  American life and the prospects for the future. My hope is that the shocking  truth of low and declining morals and ethical standards will be a catalyst for  change, but I'm not optimistic.  </P> <P> JOHN LICHTER  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Observer: Match point The demise of brand-name consumer goods at the hands of generic brands may be on every marketing guru's lips these days, but the response by Kellogg's and Coca Cola to the Toronto Blue Jays' victory in the World Series baseball championship shows that the old brand-name giants have not altogether lost their touch. Within minutes of the Blue Jays hitting the winning home run at midnight last Saturday, the two companies' Canadian subsidiaries were pulling out the stops to bring out special 'commemorative' versions of Rice Krispies packets and Coca Cola cans. Kellogg's plant in London, Ontario, worked all day Sunday to print special Rice Krispies boxes with a congratulatory message to the Blue Jays, embellished with highlights and statistics of the 1993 season. The first of 120,000 cartons were on supermarket shelves soon after lunchtime on Monday. Coca-Cola had designed its special World Series cans long before the final game. All that remained was to emboss the score, together with those of the previous five World Series games, on the side. The first of 3m cans was filled on Sunday. Both companies expect their 'limited editions' to sell out within a week or two. But how many cereal eaters or cola drinkers will transfer from rival brands?</p>

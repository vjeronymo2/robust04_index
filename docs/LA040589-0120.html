			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACCUSED SLAYER OF 16 DECLINES TO TAKE STAND; DEFENSE RESTS IN TRIAL  </P> <P> After one last, futile effort to persuade a judge to restrict  cross-examination, lawyers for Randy Steven Kraft on Tuesday decided not to  place their client on the stand to testify in his own behalf and instead rested  their defense at his murder trial.  </P> <P> The announcement by Kraft's attorney, C. Thomas McDonald, was a surprise and a  disappointment for spectators in a packed Santa Ana courtroom, and added to the  bitterness of some friends and relatives of the victims that Kraft is charged  with killing.  </P> <P> "You bet I'm angry," said a shaken Rodger DeVaul, whose 20-year-old son, Rodger  Jr., was found slain in 1983. "Even if he got up on the witness stand and lied,  the prosecutor might have gotten something out of him, so that we might have  learned something about what happened. Now we will never know."  </P> <P> </P> <P> On Trial Since July  </P> <P> Kraft, 44, a Long Beach computer consultant, has been on trial for murder since  last July in the deaths of 16 young men between the ages of 18 and 25 in Orange  County. If Kraft is convicted, prosecutors have told the court they may present  evidence suggesting that he killed as many as 29 other young men in California,  Oregon and Michigan. If convicted, Kraft faces the death penalty.  </P> <P> Kraft's lawyers told Judge Donald A. McCartin last week that their client  wanted to testify about five of the 16 murders with which he is charged, but  only if the judge would prohibit Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown from asking  any questions about the other 11. The judge refused to make any rulings until  after he heard Kraft's testimony on direct examination by the defense lawyers.  </P> <P> The courtroom has been two-thirds empty on most days since testimony began in  September. But on Tuesday, after word spread that the defense was on the verge  of resting its case, the courtroom was crowded and the usual number of news  media representatives quadrupled.  </P> <P> "Mr. Kraft definitely wanted to defend himself," McDonald said later, "but the  judge's ruling precluded that."  </P> <P> The defense argued that Kraft, under the U.S. Constitution, has a right not to  answer prosecutors' questions concerning the 11 murders he chose not to testify  about. But prosecutor Brown claimed that the 16 murders are linked by Kraft's  method of operation. If would be impossible for Kraft to discuss five murders,  the prosecution contended, without touching on circumstances involving the  other deaths.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dead Marine in Car  </P> <P> Kraft was arrested May 14, 1983, when two California Highway Patrol officers on  the San Diego Freeway in Mission Viejo found a dead Marine in his car.  </P> <P> Kraft's decision not to testify has left jurors with no explanation of the  circumstances of the Marine's death. Nor has the defense offered much  explanation for pictures of some of the victims -- in lewd poses, and appearing  dead or unconscious -- found in Kraft's car and at his house.  </P> <P> Closing arguments, expected to last two days, are scheduled to begin the week  of April 17.  </P></p>

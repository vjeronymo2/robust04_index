			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["South Korean Puppets Perpetrate Grave Military Provocation </F> in DMZ" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppets  perpetrated a grave military provocation Sunday [8 May] by  deploying an armored vehicle in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)  South of Ipo-ri, Kumgang County, Kangwon Province, in the  eastern sector of the front.    At about 18:55, the puppets drove an armored vehicle into  the  DMZ along the Military Demarcation Line from Sohwa-myon, Inje  County, South Korean Kangwon Province, and took a firing posture  against the North side.    They introduced recoilless guns and large-calibre  machine-guns into the DMZ southeast of Kwijon-ri, Jangpung  County, in the western sector of the front and installed them in  a position on May 1, 3 and 4. They displayed a war frenzy,  firing some 70 bullets of large-calibre machine-guns from the  same spot on May 5.    At about 11:15 May 6, hundreds of puppet Army bandits armed  with large-calibre machine-guns and automatic rifles staged a  frantic war exercise against the North in broad daylight in the  DMZ south of height 1211 in the eastern sector of the front,  getting on the nerves of the North.    The South Korean puppets brought some ten trucks loaded with  hundreds of armed bandits into the DMZ South of Mabang-ri,  Chorwon County, Kangwon Province, in the central sector of the  front at about 08:46 May 2.    The number of the armed bandits brought by the South Korean  puppets into the DMZ in the first eight days of May for the  reinforcement of the positions and military facilities and for  war exercises totals more than 6,400.    This arms buildup of the South Korean puppets, timing to  coincide with different frantic war exercises against the North  with the mobilization of uptodate lethal weapons and fighter  planes in collusion with the U.S. imperialists, is a deliberate  and premeditated military provocation to drive the situation  along the Military Demarcation Line to a dangerous phase.    The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets must  refrain from rash acts, clearly seeing the grave touch-and- go  situation caused by their war provocation moves on the Korean  peninsula.</p>

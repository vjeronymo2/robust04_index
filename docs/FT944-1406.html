			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: German banks hope to shake off the chill - Analysts see a recovery next year after 1994's bleak performance, writes Andrew Fisher The snow is late in Germany this year, but winter arrived early for the country's big banks. As the latest crop of results for the first 10 months shows, 1994 has been a bleak year for their financial performance. The most obvious damage has been caused by the decline in bond markets. This ravaged profits on financial trading on the banks' own accounts, after a bumper year in 1993. They have been only partly successful in compensating for this with a better lending performance and with their ability in a fast recovering economy to start making lower provisions for loan risks. Analysts have downgraded their forecasts for the whole of 1994, looking instead to improved results in 1995 as securities markets settle down and banks benefit from the economic upturn. This year, the bond market rout, caused by rising interest rates, has hit them in two ways: through their own-account trading activities, with heavy write-downs on bond holdings, and through a fall in commission business. 'It is very disappointing all round,' said Mr Peter Thorne, banking analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London. He said the German banks' weak results could presage bad figures from banks elsewhere in Europe. Dresdner Bank's explanation of its derivatives trading  - with a loss by its Paris-based derivatives subsidiary on the trading account offset by a profit on the interest income side  - raised questions about the way banks in general dealt with this complex and controversial side of their business. 'The first question is how much else of a similar nature they are not telling us about,' Mr Thorne said. Mr Bryan Crossley, banking analyst at stockbrokers Hoare Govett in the UK, agreed, seeing 'a certain amusement value' in the way Dresdner explained how derivatives losses were matched by profits on linked securities. Overall, Dresdner ended up with a 17 per cent decline in group operating profits compared with falls of 15 per cent at Deutsche Bank and 27 per cent at Commerzbank (although asset sales lifted its pre-tax result considerably). By far the best performers among the top listed banks in Germany were the Bavarian banks. Bayerische Vereinsbank and Bayerische Hypo-Bank recorded declines of only 2 per cent in operating profits for January-October against the same period of 1993. But their financial trading profits suffered as badly as those of their Frankfurt rivals. The strength of their mortgage banking business, which showed through in a strong interest income result, gave the two Munich-based banks extra resilience. At Vereinsbank, new loan approvals for private housing were about 10 per cent higher at nearly DM12bn (Dollars 7.6bn). But as Mr Albrecht Schmidt, the bank's chairman, said, property lending has lost much of its dynamism this year. Across Germany, mortgage loan approvals have been falling sharply after the earlier impetus provided by the rush to conclude deals before tax concessions were reduced and by low real interest rates. Yet this is not the only cause of concern over the two Munich banks. Analysts' eyebrows have been raised by their rapidly rising labour and investment costs. The banks say these reflect investments that will pay off later by providing better service and advice to customers. 'Those who do not invest now will be punished by the competition,' said Vereinsbank's Mr Schmidt. His bank is spending DM400m on information technology this year, with total spending up 11 per cent, similar to that of Hypo-Bank. By contrast, Deutsche Bank's expenses rose 6 per cent and Commerzbank's 4 per cent. With German banks feeling the competitive pressure as customers become more particular about services and fees, there was much talk at the autumn press conferences about direct banking, lower securities dealings costs and better value all round. Public scepticism has been felt at the banks. As a result, said Mr Schmidt, 'competition between the banks is more drastic than ever'. Shareholders have been watching such trends with interest, especially in a year when bank stocks have underperformed the market by about 16 per cent. But next year's profits performance should be more satisfying. 'We expect the stock market to reward the improved profits outlook for the banks in 1995 and 1996,' said Mr Thomas Radinger, Vereinsbank's banking analyst. The continued economic recovery should stimulate credit demand and further lessen the need for new risk provisions, he added. For Deutsche Bank, he expects a rise in earnings per share to DM59 next year and DM70 in 1996 after a decline in 1994 to DM50.5 from 1993's DM53. For Dresdner, he forecasts DM23 in 1994 after DM28 last year, DM33 in 1995 and DM41 in 1996. For two sets of shareholders, 1995 promises to bring a little extra. Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank celebrate their 125th anniversaries next year. Although both are being coy about whether a bonus payment will be added to the dividend, this is regarded as almost certain. But Dresdner's shareholders will have to be patient. Their anniversary pay-out is not due until 1997.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE TOP FIVE LISTED BANKS (DM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Partial        Financial                           Operating       operating          trading                              profit*         profit**         income***  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Deutsche Bank          3.6bn (-15%)     4.7bn (-8%)      543m (-63%) Dresdner Bank          1.3bn (-17%)    2.8bn (+17%)    -301m (-156%) Bay.

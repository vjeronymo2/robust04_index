			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / UN to set deadline on Libyan suspects THE United Nations Security Council is expected today to set a deadline of April 15 for Libya to surrender the alleged Lockerbie bombers - or face punitive sanctions. Council members put off a vote yesterday at the request of Arab leaders as it was an Islamic holy day. The sanctions would include cutting air links with Libya, an arms embargo, a reduction in Libyan diplomatic missions and restrictions on Libyan diplomats' movements. Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, would be required to give evidence that his regime had renounced terrorism. In private consultations yesterday, a majority of Security Council members agreed there could be no further postponement of UN action, which has been under consideration for almost a month. They rebuffed a move by the Arab League, supported by the Islamic Conference, to put off a sanctions vote until the International Court in The Hague had ruled in the case brought by Libya against Britain and the US. But in deference to requests by the Egyptian president, Mr Hosni Mubarak, and some other Arab leaders, it was agreed not to vote on sanctions during an Islamic holiday being observed yesterday, the 27th day of Ramadan. Mr Diego Arria, of Venezuela, the council president, told reporters there would be no further delay and a vote was certain to be taken today. Western diplomats voiced confidence that the sanctions resolution would be adopted by a respectable majority, although probably not unanimously. China and Morocco are among members expected to abstain. Mr Thomas Pickering, the US delegate, stressed last night that the 24-hour delay did not imply any expectation of a last-minute change of heart that would remove the threat of sanctions. Tony Walker adds from Cairo: Egyptian officials, who have led a rearguard action to save Libya from international censure over the Lockerbie bombing appeared to have resigned themselves last night to passage of UN sanctions. Officials were signalling that Cairo would reluctantly fall into line with some of the sanctions provisions, such as an arms and air embargo, but they were vague as to whether Egypt would also downgrade diplomatic links with Libya. 'My understanding is that we will comply with the resolution,' said a well-placed official. 'Egypt supports international legality and the role of the United Nations.' But there is no doubt that western determination to press ahead with sanctions is causing acute discomfort in Egypt, whose diplomacy has for the past six months been engaged in efforts to head off just such a development. Egyptian uneasiness, and misgivings among the pro-western Arabs generally, stems from a fear that western pressure against Libya will be portrayed throughout the region as another example of the west seeking to bully a weak Arab state. 'To Arabs, it appears like the strong imposing its will on the weak under a new Pax Americana,' said Professor Saad Ibrahim of the American University in Cairo. 'People are unhappy about the precedent that is being established and ask where will it end, not that anyone has much sympathy for Gadaffi himself.'</p>

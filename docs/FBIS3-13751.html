			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dari </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [New Year address by President Borhanoddin Rabbani; place </F> and date not given -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. [passage omitted] With full confidence and  earnest belief we say that the people of Afghanistan, by the  blessing of Almighty God, will overcome the difficulties and  will succeed in defeating conspiracies and intrigues; and peace  and security will be restored in every corner of the country as  wished and desired by the people. With firmness and  steadfastness we will repair the destruction left by the  fighting and will realize the (?plan) for the country's economic  revival and reconstruction. It should be mentioned that the  Islamic State of Afghanistan is at a satisfactory level of  having strength and power and is able [word indistinct] to stop  [the enemy advances]. The Armed Forces of the Islamic state are  enjoying high combative morale and powerful military  preparedness. The past months' experience clearly demonstrates  this fact: [words indistinct] of Kabul, clearing Konduz  Province, districts of Anderab, Khenjan, and Doshi in Baghlan  Province, as well as Ghowrmach District and some regions in  Farab Province, of seditious elements and rebels, are vivid  examples in this respect. Despite all the abilities and  preparedness, the Islamic state follows the strategy of talks  and understanding and rejects a military solution to the issues.    At this time, when the world has entered into a new stage of  coexistence and understanding, a way must be sought for the  fundamental solution of issues by talks in a peaceful manner.  On the basis of these beliefs and thoughts the Islamic state  emphasizes the principle of talks and understanding with the  (?respective) Jehadi forces. Believing in the notion that  people are the real heir [words indistinct] the people have a  right to decide about their country and future leadership.  During the period of the Islamic sovereignty the state has  always paid respect to this principle and has always followed it  in its actions.    Dear Compatriots, in order to get out of the present  condition and for the sake of saving people from pain and  sorrow, preventing further destruction of their homes by deadly  rockets, and in respecting and following the principle of [words  indistinct], the state pays respect to the will of people  concerning the country's future leadership. We believe that a  [word indistinct] decisionmaking assembly of the people  delegates representing the will and views of the people and  elected by a method that is acceptable to the relevant sides, is  to be set up in the country as soon as possible. [passage  indistinct]    Starting from the first day of 'Id al-Fitr the state has  declared a unilateral 15-day-long cease-fire in Kabul city so  that the peace delegations can work and accelerate their efforts  on this path in a secure atmosphere away from threat. We have  also invited the United Nations and the conference of the  Islamic countries' foreign ministers to supervise the  proceedings of convocation and activities of this assembly to  make sure of its freedom of action. With pleasure I was  informed that a UN delegation, led by esteemed Mahmud Mestiri,  will soon travel to Afghanistan. [words indistinct] the state  is ready for every cooperation with the UN delegation in this  respect.    Dear compatriots, for marking Nawroz [New Year Day] in a  proper way, and in order to provide better conditions for the  peace delegations enabling them to accelerate further their  fruitful work [words indistinct], I declare the extension of the  unilateral cease-fire in Kabul city for another two weeks.

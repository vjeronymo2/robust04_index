			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FIREFIGHTERS GROUP BACKS DAVIS FOR SUPERVISOR;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN: THE CANDIDATE FAVORS A COUNTYWIDE PARAMEDIC TRAINING PROGRAM.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Professional Firefighters Assn. announced its support  Wednesday for Simi Valley City Councilman Bill Davis in his bid for the 4th  District county supervisor's seat.  </P> <P> Davis, who has also been endorsed by the Ventura County Public Employees Assn.,  is the second of five candidates in the supervisor's race to receive  endorsements from county organizations and officials.  </P> <P> Vicky Howard, also a Simi Valley council member, was recently backed by Sheriff  John Gillespie, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and the Deputy Sheriffs Assn.  </P> <P> Keith Kraetsch, president of the 370-member firefighters association, said  Wednesday that his group endorsed Davis because he favors a countywide  paramedic training program for firefighters. Firefighters now are not required  to have such training.  </P> <P> Kraetsch said his group decided to back Davis after interviewing the five  candidates.  </P> <P> "One of the reasons we endorsed Bill is that he had an attitude of how can we  fix things rather than the reasons why we can't," Kraetsch said.  </P> <P> The issue of emergency service has been a major concern in the city of  Moorpark, which is part of the 4th District, along with Simi Valley, Somis and  the Santa Clara Valley. Officials and residents have increasingly complained  about private ambulance crews taking up to half an hour to respond to emergency  calls.  </P> <P> Kraetsch said that while private ambulance operators provide quality service,  firefighters cannot always depend on them to be at the scene of an accident  when needed.  </P> <P> Davis agreed with Kraetsch that county physicians could be used to train  firefighters in emergency treatment. He said if elected he will make the issue  his first priority.  </P> <P> "My real concern is that the people in the 4th District have the best emergency  medical service that can be provided," Davis said.  </P> <P> Two other candidates in the race -- Glen Schmidt, a Moorpark planning  commissioner, and Tom Ely, a Ventura Community College District trustee -- said  Wednesday that they felt the Davis and Howard endorsements represent possible  conflicts of interest. They said the only purpose of the endorsements is to  influence the votes of elected officials.  </P> <P> "I don't believe in these kinds of things," said Ely, who said that he recently  turned down endorsements from two community groups that he declined to  identify. "I really believe it's a conflict."  </P> <P> Schmidt agreed, saying Davis and Howard were essentially "buying votes" by  promising to support various programs without knowing where the funding is  going to come from.  </P> <P> "Bill Davis hasn't even looked at the county budget and he wants to commit  millions of dollars" to a paramedic training program, said Schmidt, who served  as 4th District supervisor from 1971 to 1975.  </P> <P> Candidate Harold Fick, a Simi Valley resident, disagreed with his fellow  candidates. Fick said officials and organizations have the right to endorse  candidates.  </P> <P> "I don't have any hard feelings about these kind of things," Fick said, adding  that he did not feel the endorsements would affect the way people vote.  </P> <P> "Today, people are more free thinking," Fick said. "In many cases, they don't  like to have their leadership tell them how to vote."  </P></p>

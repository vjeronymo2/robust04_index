			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Soybean Trading Data Demanded: Lee Adams, president of the American Soybean  Assn., asked the Chicago Board of Trade to release trading positions of "all  market participants that held (soybean) contracts for more than 1 million  bushels in July soybean futures during May through July. If we do not get a  quick and satisfactory response, we are prepared to take appropriate legal  action," Adams said in a statement. The association represents soybean growers.  The commodities exchange last week ordered holders of large July soybean  positions to sell all holdings of more than 1 million bushels by today.  </P></p>

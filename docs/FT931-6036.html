			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: General Accident deficit cut sharply to Pounds 29.3m GENERAL ACCIDENT, the Perth-based insurance company, yesterday reported a fall in pre-tax losses to Pounds 29.3m for 1992, compared with Pounds 171.6m. Heavy losses from hurricane Andrew prevented the company moving back into the black, despite better trading conditions and an improvement in most lines of business. The company also announced it was raising a further Pounds 110m by the issue of preference shares. Hoare Govett were lead managers to the issue, which carries a yield of 10.42 per cent. Explaining the board's decision not to follow in the footsteps of Commercial Union by issuing new ordinary share capital, Mr Nelson Robertson, chief general manager, said: 'We are perfectly happy with our level of solvency.' The margin, net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income, stands at 46 per cent. Mr Robertson said GA was gearing for steady rather than rapid growth in 1993, following a 7 per cent increase in premium income last year, in original currency terms. Premium income on non-life business grew to Pounds 3.83bn (Pounds 3.22bn), with life premiums rising to Pounds 790.4m (Pounds 551.9m). The strengthening of the dollar added Pounds 391m to the total. Capital was adequate to fuel further growth, added Mr Robertson. 'I don't think we will be under any pressure at this point in the cycle.' Despite a net loss of Pounds 65m from hurricane Andrew, which caused extensive damage in Florida and Louisiana in August, underwriting losses fell to Pounds 510.1m (Pounds 569.1m). Other storm losses amounted to Pounds 47m. Investment income rose to Pounds 504.9m (Pounds 448.8m). The estate agency side reported losses of Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 17.8m). Life profits were Pounds 34.8m (Pounds 27m). Loan interest amounted to Pounds 40.1m (Pounds 59.7m). Losses emerged at 7p (32.1p). A final dividend of 17.05p makes a same-again 26.75p total, which is uncovered for a third successive year. The improvement at General Accident has been most marked in the UK, where rises in premium rates fed through into a reduction of underwriting losses to Pounds 175.2m (Pounds 341.9m). Increases in motor rates and a sharp reduction in exposures, helped cut the loss in motor business to Pounds 68.5m (Pounds 113.9m), although Mr Robertson acknowledged that the improvement was weaker than that reported by some of the company's competitors. Price increases of more than 20 per cent helped the homeowners' account turnround from losses of Pounds 37.9m to a profit of Pounds 9.3m. All other lines showed improvment. However, in the US underwriting losses climbed to Dollars 323.7m (Pounds 228m), against Dollars 214.7m, reflecting both the storm losses and a decision to increase reserves on commercial liability following the notification of more potential environmental claims.

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Brammer edges ahead to Pounds 8.3m Brammer, the industrial services group, reported a marginal increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 8.22m to Pounds 8.28m in the year to end-December. The latest figure was struck after a Pounds 900,000 loss on the disposal in November of Master Pumps Equipment, its US subsidiary, and net interest payable of Pounds 1.2m, compared with a nil charge in 1992. At the operating level profits were ahead from Pounds 8.25m to Pounds 10.4m. Total turnover rose from Pounds 123m to Pounds 141m, mainly reflecting the first full year of Roulement Service, the French bearings distributor acquired in 1992. 'The underlying businesses showed a very strong operating performance,' said Mr Robert Ffoulkes-Jones, chief executive. The first quarter this year had shown a substantial improvement over first-quarter 1993. 'Should the trend continue we will have a strong 1994.' Brammer's business is 81 per cent distribution of bearings and power transmission products, in which it is market leader in the UK and France, and 19 per cent rental of test equipment. BSL, the power transmission business in the UK, increased its market share, lifting sales by 5.4 per cent and profits by almost 15 per cent. Roulement sales were down 3.3 per cent, but the French market overall was 15 per cent down, Mr Ffoulkes-Jones said. He wants to push the French market share ahead to a similar level to that of BSL - more than 35 per cent. Group operating profits in the UK rose from Pounds 7.92m to Pounds 10.5m on turnover of Pounds 97.4m (Pounds 91.4m). Continental European activities incurred an operating loss of Pounds 233,000 on turnover of Pounds 36.4m, compared with profits of Pounds 172,000 on turnover of Pounds 34m. The rental division, which specialises in electronic testing equipment, doubled operating profits to Pounds 1.66m on turnover of Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 22.7m). The group had overcome its former dependence on defence for 40 per cent of its business by switching to the data communications and telecommunications sector. Defence now accounts for just 5 per cent of turnover. Net borrowings fell from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 2.1m, helped by a Pounds 5.6m placing in September. Gearing at the year end was 6 per cent (26 per cent). Earnings were unchanged at 13.3p, and a same-again final dividend of 8.5p is proposed, maintaining the total at 13p. COMMENT Brammer has survived the recession with an unbroken run of 13p dividends for the past six years. The yield of more than 5 per cent is itself a good enough reason for holding on to the shares. Profits of Pounds 11m this year put the group on a prospective multiple of almost 19. The main business of transmission distribution is strong, and at last the rentals business is beginning to make some money. Worth a look if you believe there is a growth story in sight.</p>

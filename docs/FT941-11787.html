			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Top Italian bank improves Istit uto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Italy's biggest bank, reported a 29 per cent leap in operating earnings in preliminary results issued yesterday. They reflectthe effects of absorbing two big regional banking subsidiaries. The merger with Banco Lariano and Banca Provinciale Lombarda, the two banks controlled by San Paolo in the Lombardy region, formally took place on January 1 this year. However, the bank said San Paolo's preliminary results for 1993 had been calculated as if the deal had taken place a year earlier, as expenses related to the transaction were incurred entirely in 1993. Operating profit soared 29 per cent to L2,300bn (Dollars 1.4bn), while total financial assets under management climbed 6.5 per cent to L189,500bn. Fee income surged 20 per cent to L5,800bn, reflecting last year's strong growth in earnings from securities. Interest income, meanwhile, rose by just 2.5 per cent to L4,000bn. San Paolo said the proportion of non-performing loans, including mortgages, which account for about 40 per cent of the loan book, had risen to 4.3 per cent of the total. Lending from the bank's domestic branches was virtually stagnant, with a 0.6 per cent fall to L78,300bn. The total loan book, including foreign loans, rose 6.5 per cent to L102,400bn. Deposits at domestic branchesclimbed 10.3 per cent to L82,500bn. Consolidated figures for the group - which includes the Crediop long-term lending institution, San Paolo's foreign subsidiaries, and specialised domestic subsidiaries in areas such as investment banking - will not be released until April.</p>

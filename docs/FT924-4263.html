			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Technology: Haggling over road prices - How a controversial scheme to charge drivers would ease traffic congestion Time is running out for road users. With congestion becoming a worldwide problem, drivers may have to get used to the idea of paying for their journeys. This is certainly true in Britain, where new solutions are being looked at more closely than ever. While recession may have taken some of the heat out of the traffic crisis, it will not be long before vehicle ownership and use resume their rapid rise. In barely a decade, according to UK government forecasts, traffic levels could be 50 per cent worse than they are already. The question is: just how is this traffic growth to be accommodated? Many large towns and cities already experience intolerable levels of congestion, but few have room for more roads. Many trunk roads and motorways are also packed, but even where environmental considerations allow for widening or new construction, the government cannot afford the huge sums required. In both cases, it seems, something will have to give: and in both cases, it looks like being the road user. Indeed, if there were ever any doubts on the issue, they were dispelled by two separate government announcements on the sensitive issue of road charges. One came from Norman Lamont, the Chancellor, in his Autumn Statement. If the country was to get the transport infrastructure it needed, the private sector would have to help provide it. The underlying message was that private companies would be encouraged to build toll roads. What may prove harder to swallow is the government's other announcement. At a London traffic congestion conference last month, John MacGregor, the UK Transport Secretary, fired what appeared to be the first shot in a campaign to soften up attitudes in readiness for the introduction of electronic road pricing in urban areas later this decade. The big difference between this kind of road pricing and motorway tolls is its motives. While the purpose of motorway tolls is to increase the supply of road space by raising money for roadbuilding, the purpose of road pricing is to reduce demand for road space by pricing people off the roads. Understandably, the latter is likely to prove an extremely sensitive political issue. For that reason, the technology of urban road pricing will be crucial. Any system will have to win public acceptability to stand a chance of winning political approval. That means it will have to be seen as fair, easy to use, difficult to outwit, and respectful of civil liberties. Experience abroad is of little help. The only fully-fledged urban system in the world today is in Singapore, where motorists have to buy a daily or weekly permit to drive into the city centre in peak periods. Permits are checked visually by police at the city's 29 entry points. In theory, that system could be replaced by an electronic one using existing tollgate technology. On the Dartford Crossing, east of London, for example, vehicle owners can open an account with the operating company and have it debited electronically each time they use the bridge. A matchbox-size device in their windscreen is read by a roadside beacon and opens the tollgate automatically if the owner's account is in credit. But borders around cities, electronic or otherwise, suffer several disadvantages. One is that they create undesirable cordon effects - for example, encouraging people to dump their cars at the border or divert around it on unsuitable roads. Worse, they are simply unfair, for they impose the same charge on someone momentarily crossing the border as on someone spending the whole day driving around the most congested areas of the city centre. A better system was that tested in Hong Kong in the early 1980s. Cars were fitted with electronic number plates which were read by electronic loops in the road surface, and motorists were presented with bills according to their use of the roads. The experiment failed, however, because of people's concern that the technology could be used to trace their movements. Two systems under development in Britain today have sought to overcome this objection by avoiding the need to record where vehicles have been. One, congestion metering, is being developed for Cambridgeshire County Council by the universities of Newcastle and Northumbria. The other, called Timezone, is being developed by GEC-Marconi, the aerospace and electronics arm of Britain's General Electric Company. Congestion metering, devised as a means of countering acute congestion in Cambridge, is aimed at discouraging people from using scarce road space at the busiest times by charging drivers. Vehicles would be fitted with meters that monitored their progress through traffic. Any vehicle stopping four times or more within any half-kilometre stretch, or taking more than three minutes to cover that distance, would start clocking up units. Drivers would pay for the units with pre-paid smartcards which would be inserted into the meter and debited as the journey progressed. If the meter ran out, a linked device would cut off the fuel supply - though an overdraft of, say, 50 units would be allowed to give people time to buy new cards. Normally dormant, the meters would come into operation when activated by microwave signals from roadside beacons at entry points to the city. Similar signals would switch the meters off at exit points. People without meters would have to buy day passes at slightly more than the average cost of a metered city centre journey. These would also respond to roadside beacons. Any vehicle failing to respond would have its registration plate automatically photographed by roadside cameras so drivers could be traced and penalised. Timezone, too, would require vehicles to be fitted with in-car meters charged up with smartcards and brought into operation by radio waves. But in this case, transmitters would be installed not just at the entry to the city, but throughout the charging zone, with the meter responding to the nearest transmitter. A city like London would probably have several zones charging different rates according to the degree of congestion. Charges could also vary according to the time of day. If a vehicle ran out of credits, the roadside transmitters would sense this and automatically report the vehicle's registration number to the authorities. But GEC-Marconi emphasises that registration numbers could not be detected as long as meters remained charged. People entering the charging zones without Timezone devices would have their registration plates photographed with a view to penalisation. But visitors buying temporary passes would have their registration numbers passed on to the computer which would then ignore the photographic record. What the government thinks of these competing systems will become clearer when the Department of Transport publishes its report on the technological options for road pricing early in 1993. That will be just an interim report; the results of the government's full investigation into road pricing are not due until 1994. Even so, the writing seems to be on the wall for free motoring.</p>

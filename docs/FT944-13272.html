			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Reform urged to cut delay in judicial reviews The Law Commission yester-day called for reforms to cut delays in handling legal challenges to government decisions. The government's law reform body said the number of applications for judicial review of the decisions of public bodies had risen so dramatically that delays of up to two years in hearing them were not uncommon. Judicial review applications have risen from 160 in 1974 to 1,500 by 1987 and almost 2,900 last year. The rise has continued this year, with 1,851 applications in the first seven months compared with 1,728 in the same period of last year. The commission said that if delays in hearing legal challenges were to be reduced procedures for judicial review would have to be streamlined. It is proposing several changes to make procedures easier for applicants. The terms and remedies available will be changed to make their function and purpose more easily understood. The first stage of judicial review will be called the 'preliminary consideration' rather than the stage where the applicant applies to a single High Court judge for 'leave' to bring a judicial review. The commission also recommends for the first time that courts hearing public law cases should have the power to order restitution where organisations or individuals have wrongly been required to pay out money - for example, tax demands which are found to be unlawful. Rules on time limits, the availability of interim remedies pending a full hearing - in particular against ministers and central government departments  -and rules on appeals, all needed clarifying and updating, it said. It recommended that to cut costs and speed up the process most applications should in the first place be dealt with by a judge on paper, without a court hearing. The rules of judicial review should also make it clear that public interest groups as well as individuals adversely affected by administrative decisions should be able to apply for judicial review. The commission said that the purpose of judicial review was to keep the powers of government within their legal bounds and compel public authorities to perform their duties. An effective system for judicial review helped to correct maladministration and to promote good administration. Mr Justice Brooke, chairman of the commission, said that he hoped its recommendations would lead to 'further improvements in the way that citizens may have access to the courts when they seek to ensure that public bodies act lawfully, fairly and rationally'.

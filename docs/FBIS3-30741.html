			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Knin, 7 Feb (TANJUG) -- Croatian forces are still  violating the cease-fire in the Benkovac area on the northern  Dalmatian battlefront.    The main headquarters of the Serb Krajina army has reported  that they opened fire on the area around the village of Biljani  Gornji from recoilless guns and howitzers. Due to the intensity  of fire, and because the soldiers, weapons and equipment of the  Serb side were endangered, the Serb side was forced to respond.  A statement says that while returning fire the Serb side  destroyed one tank and one antiaircraft gun belonging to the  aggressor.    The main headquarters of the Serb Krajina army warns that  Croatia is using the cease-fire to regroup and bring in fresh  forces and equipment to this section of the battlefield.</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CENSUS STAGES A RECOUNT IN NORTH SAN DIEGO COUNTY  </P> <P> Census takers went into the fields of North San Diego County at dawn Friday to  recount migrant workers, but the effort drew criticism from advocates for the  homeless, who said they were suspicious of the results because the Census  Bureau provided no advance notice.  </P> <P> Despite the skepticism, census officials proclaimed that they now had a  "quality count" of the migrants.  </P> <P> "We feel comfortable not only with our procedure, but with the execution of  those procedures," said Dan Conway, a Census Bureau spokesman. "We're better  organized this morning than we were 48 hours ago, and we now have a complete  count of the migrant workers in North County."  </P> <P> But Mike Weiler, assistant regional census manager based in Van Nuys, said  workers only revisited half of the migrant camps that need recounting, and they  intend to count the others sometime next week.  </P> <P> "We felt we did have sufficient staff to at least start the process," Weiler  said. "What we had done was a portion of the recount today, and we will do  another portion next week."  </P> <P> The conflicting comments from census officials and the apparent secrecy with  which the recount was conducted have some homeless advocates saying the Census  Bureau dealt in bad faith. The bureau, which acknowledged it had botched the  migrant count earlier in the week, had said it would make procedural changes,  use more bilingual census takers and retrain the "enumerators" before embarking  on the recount.  </P> <P> "I am suspicious," said Connie Saldana of Hispanic Services of the North County  Interfaith Council who helped identify camp sites of homeless migrants. "It's  curious that they did it so fast, and I would rather have seen them take a  different method of counting."  </P> <P> Neither Saldana nor any other homeless service provider was notified of the  recount before it was conducted, nor were any media agencies, said Conway.  Previously, census officials had said a recount probably would not take place  until next week.  </P> <P> "I definitely feel that they were being sneaky about it," Saldana said. "To me  it's very clear that they were trying to do it without any observers. I know if  I had known about it, I would have gone again to observe."  </P> <P> "I think part of it is that the Census Bureau was thinking, 'If there is any  criticism, why have someone around to watch us count' ?" said Irma Castro of  the Chicano Federation. "I don't think that anyone really feels that they did  it right."  </P> <P> When the original count of homeless people was conducted Tuesday night and  Wednesday morning, the Census Bureau involved most homeless advocates in the  area and alerted all the news outlets. Even before the count began, homeless  advocates had decried the methodology being used as inadequate. But census  officials said the recount showed that they recognized their shortcomings and  were willing to improve.  </P> <P> "We are the ultimate evaluators. We know what we did and did not do," Conway  said. "I think there's a certain level of credibility gained because we  recognized that our original efforts did not meet our own standards."  </P> <P> Conway said a recount had to be done quickly because the homeless population  moves quickly and the bureau wanted an accurate demographic picture of the  region.  </P> <P> "We were trying to move swiftly and we were focused on the operational  component of the project, not the promotional component," Conway said.  </P> <P> However, Census Bureau officials said shortly after the original count that, in  order for a recount to take place, they would "have to go back and do some  reworking" of the operational plan and the number of sites visited, and  retraining of enumerators and supervisory roles.  </P> <P> "We need everything in place before we do this," said Weiler, the regional  census official, on Wednesday. He added that a recount was not likely until  next week.  </P> <P> On Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, 250 enumerators from the Census  Bureau's Carlsbad office took part in the nationwide operation to count the  homeless. After the count was completed, Weiler reported that he had "a little  bit of a concern in terms of the North County area," specifically that many of  the migrant homeless were not interviewed and only head counts were taken.  </P> <P> "I don't think that we feel we missed anything (in North County). It's that the  enumerations should have been face-to-face," Weiler had said Wednesday. "One of  the things we want to get is not just the head count but accurate  characteristics as well."  </P> <P> But migrant workers in the McGonigle Canyon area near Rancho Penasquitos said  they were not interviewed by census workers on Wednesday morning and that no  census workers were seen Friday at this, one of the largest migrant campsites  in North County.  </P> <P> "All they did was count people. They didn't ask the questions that they were  supposed to ask," said Marco Antonio Guevara, who, like others interviewed at  the camp, had experienced several censuses in Mexico.  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned, it's all theater. They want to do what is necessary  for their bureaucracy, but they don't really want to count us," he said.  </P> <P> Of 30 people interviewed in the canyon off Black Mountain Road, none of them  had been interviewed in-depth by census takers on the original count, and none  had seen any enumerators on Friday.  </P> <P> Several people said census takers had trouble communicating with them during  Wednesday's count, and, as far as they could tell, enumerators just took head  counts. One migrant worker noted that people were leaving for work when the  census takers arrived, making it difficult to get an accurate count.  </P> <P> "It was an eleventh-hour final decision to do the recount, and we couldn't say  we were going to do it until we knew we were going to do it," Conway said  Friday.  </P> <P> The recount was conducted between 4:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. Friday by 70  enumerators and nine supervisors. The count was preceded by a three-hour  training session that began at 1:30 a.m. in the hope that mistakes made  previously would not be repeated.  </P> <P> The North County migrant homeless population was the only population that  required a recount from the original count of the homeless, according to a  Census Bureau spokeswoman.  </P> <P> The decision on when to do the recount was based on the availability of  bilingual enumerators to effectively do a count, Conway said, since there were  very few Spanish-speaking census takers covering North County during the  original operation. Bilingual enumerators who worked in other parts of the  county were recruited to help in the North County recount.  </P> <P> "Every team that was sent out this morning (Friday) had at least one bilingual  speaker, sometimes more," Conway said.  </P> <P> The decision was made to go on with the count at 7:30 p.m. Thursday. Of the  1:30 a.m. to 4:30 a.m. training session, Conway said, "We trained them on the  importance of interviews, how to do interviews, and the techniques involved,  and not just to do head counts."  </P> <P> "We had improved training, and a select number of enumerators from the previous  night. We used the ones that understood the process the best, and we had more  supervisors for the recount," Conway said.  </P> <P> Enumerators outnumbered supervisors in the original count by 20 to 1, while the  ratio in the recount was 8 to 1.  </P> <P> The recount focused only on those areas of North County that had specific  problems with enumerators not conducting interviews of the homeless, he said.  </P></p>

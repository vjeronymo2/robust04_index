			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dietrich Zwaetz: "Speculation About Interest </F> Rates"]    [Text] Sheer terror enters the pen of even sober  commentators when they write about the latest weakness of the  dollar. "One cent," that is, one-hundredth of a dollar,  renowned Washington writer Hobart Rowen whines, "is now worth no  more than one Japanese yen." Even more than this rather curious  observation, the more or less forced attempts to explain the  slump of the dollar to one's fellow-citizens show that textbooks  fail when emotions rule the markets.    According to the textbooks, the dollar ought to be strong,  because interest rates have been going up in the United States  since the beginning of February, while in Germany they are going  down. For 18 months the U.S. economy has been experiencing "an  appropriate, if not even vigorous recovery" (Rowen), while in  Germany and in Japan the signs of economic revival are not  particularly dramatic. To make matters worse, however, the  dollar is declining compared with the yen, which should actually  be weakened because of the confusions of Japan's domestic policy  and the new government crisis.    At the time of the Plaza Accord in 1985 the dollar was worth  250 yen. At that time it was worth 2.65 German marks [DM]  compared with the German currency. At that time the G-7 decided  to bring the U.S. currency down to a more comfortable level,  above all to reduce the U.S. foreign trade deficit. Looking  back, it did not help much.    The most recent commentaries forget, however, that the  dollar  has declined to an all-time low only compared with the yen.  Compared with the mark, the U.S. currency met its Waterloo as  early as the fall of 1992, when the Bush Administration's  ability to act on the economy fanned worldwide distrust in the  dollar. At that time DM1.3850 was offered for $1.    Of course, the commentators admit that, in view of the  rising  export deficits, a weaker dollar would actually be welcome to  the Clinton Administration. However, Treasury Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen has always denied that the Administration accepts or  even promotes the slump of the dollar to improve the foreign  trade results. Nor must the politician let himself be caught in  the suspicion that he is secretly promoting the import of  inflation in this way.    Instead of supporting the dollar, the United States has the  alternative of raising interest rates. Actually, on the U.S.  markets there is speculation only about the date of a new  increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board --  whether it will be this week or after the meeting of the Open  Market Committee on 5 and 6 July.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: BAT smokes without fire BAT's smoking cash flow machine coughed slightly in 1993. The dust-up started by the Marlboro men in the US has certainly bruised Brown and Williamson. Its position as number three in the US market means it must continue to follow rather than lead the battle over margins. That struggle may abate now that Marlboro is regaining ground, but there remains a threat of higher tobacco taxes - and thus renewed pressure on gross margins - later this year. From a profits' perspective, the disappointment in tobacco was offset by growth in financial services. Gearing also fell, though significantly most of the improvement came from paying last year's dividend in shares rather than cash. The crimp in underlying cash flow may still be a medium term barrier to the company's expansionist ambitions in continental Europe. BAT's aim of increasing both its dividend payout and its cover is another inhibition on large acquisitions. The company argues that prudence dictates it will not pay the kind of fancy prices currently being demanded by Parisian sellers of insurance companies. In truth, constraints elsewhere within the business must also have played their part. For the time being BAT is probably stuck with growing its own greenfield life business on the continent and chiselling more from the existing insurance operations. The problem of valuing a combination of tobacco and insurance earnings also remains. Potential for dividend growth underpins BAT's yield. But in the absence of anything more dramatic, the shares are unlikely to catch fire.</p>

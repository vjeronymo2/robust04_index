			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Upset at Ribble Valley rattles council Tories: Local taxation is the main issue in this closely fought region IN THE north-west, the by-election defeat for the Conservatives in the formerly safe parliamentary seat of Ribble Valley in Lancashire has added spice to what was already destined to be a vigorous three-party tussle. The local authorities are likely to see shifts in power because a third of the seats are up for re-election and all the seats are to be contested in 11 districts that have had boundary changes. Up for grabs are the metropolitan borough councils in Greater Manchester and Merseyside and the district councils in Cheshire, Cumbria and Lancashire. Crucially, both main parties agree that Labour needs 21 parliamentary gains from the Conservatives in the north-west at a general election to install Mr Neil Kinnock, its leader, in Downing Street. Not surprisingly, both Labour and the Conservatives are massing their resources for the fight. Labour has 14 full-time officials and organisers in the region, co-ordinated from a new headquarters in Warrington, Cheshire, at the hub of the region's motorway network. In 1987, the last time most of this year's contested council seats were fought, Labour did much worse than expected, failing to capture control of several councils. Labour then had fewer than half the full-time workers it has now, and most were diverted by the party's internal war against the Militant Tendency in Liverpool. The Conservatives' regional headquarters is in Bury, near Manchester, at the heart of a clutch of parliamentary marginals, where three Central Office organisers help to co-ordinate 30 full-time constituency agents. At election times, Labour gets additional help from full-time trade union officials. Therefore from an organisational point of view, the two main parties are probably more evenly balanced in the north-west than ever before, and Labour is no longer in disarray. The battleground itself is one of the UK's key economic and political regions. With about 7m people, it is a third larger than Scotland and accounts for about a tenth of UK gross domestic product. About 2.5m and 1.4m people live in the conurbations of Greater Manchester and Merseyside respectively. There are 79 parliamentary constituencies, 38 held by Labour, 37 by the Conservatives and four by the Liberal Democrats. Even some Labour workers admit privately that the task of winning 21 Tory seats may be too much, especially because the Conservatives hope to gain Ribble Valley and Southport on Merseyside from the Liberal Democrats. Yet the loss of the formerly safe Ribble Valley in a parliamentary by-election last month on the single issue of the poll tax has rattled the Conservatives. At least 13 of their Commons seats are marginal. Senior figures at risk of losing their seats include Mrs Lynda Chalker, the overseas development minister, at Wallasey, Merseyside, and Mr David Trippier, the environment minister, at Rossendale and Darwen in Lancashire. Of the 1,170 seats being contested, Labour is defending 471, the Conservatives 413 and the Liberal Democrats 116, with 75 Independents and 11 old-style Liberals in Pendle. Generally, towns and cities already in Labour hands are expected to stay so. Conservative apprehension will centre on the hung councils of Wirral and Sefton - both on Merseyside - Chester, Cheshire's Vale Royal, Blackpool and Lancaster, where the Liberal Democrats are not strong, giving Labour a good chance of taking control. Conservatives will also be concerned with results in wards in Conservative-held parliamentary marginals where Labour came a strong second in the 1987 general election - Ellesmere Port and Neston, Barrow-in-Furness, Bolton North-East, Bury North, Bury South, Hyndburn, Lancashire West, Pendle, Rossendale and Darwen and Wallasey. The parties will also scan the results for an indication of whether the next general election will be a three-party one. In Bolton West, Stockport, and Pendle a strong showing by the Liberal-SDP Alliance ensured Conservative victories over Labour in 1987. Labour stands to gain those parliamentary seats if it can pick up a relatively small number of votes from former Conservative and Liberal Democrat voters. What happens in Lancashire may be the most telling indicator of the electorate's mood. Because six district councils have to be elected in their entirety, more than 421 seats of the north-west's 1,170 will be contested in Lancashire alone. Many are in places such as Hyndburn and Rossendale, where working-class owner-occupation is high - but the houses were formerly low-rated. Thousands who voted Conservative in such marginal constituencies in 1987 have been poll-tax losers. All parties say that their early canvass returns show local taxation to be the dominant, possibly the only issue. The Conservatives say everything will depend on how well people understand the mechanisms by which this year's poll tax bills are being reduced. Party workers will have to wait for May 2 to discover how the voters of the north-west have judged the argument.</p>

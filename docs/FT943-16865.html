			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / US envoy warns of new war in Croatia A senior US diplomat said yesterday that former Yugoslavia could be soon be engulfed by a renewed war inside Croatia, where a ceasefire between Serbs and Croats is looking tenuous. The warning was issued by Mr Peter Galbraith, the US ambassador to Zagreb. He warned that in the event of a renewed war, the Croatian army could be crushed by better armed and more numerous Serb fighters who would be backed by Belgrade. 'The danger of a new war remains,' said Mr Galbraith during a visit to Osijek, north-eastern Croatia. Complaining about Serb intransigence during peace efforts and the absence of progress in international mediation, Croat officials are threatening to seize back nearly one-third of their republic's territory which is under de facto Serb control. If they fail to gain control over the 'state', which severs Croatia in half, Croat political and military leaders say they will not renew the UN mandate. Zagreb says the UN presence has simply frozen Serb military gains, carved out during the six-month war in 1991, although diplomats believe that the 14,000 strong force has prevented an all-out conflict. In Belgrade yesterday, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia met Mr Alexei Nikiforov, a Russian peace envoy, for talks on a map providing for the partition of Bosnia along ethnic lines. The map was unveiled this week by the so-called contact group, composed of representatives from Russia, the US, Britain, Germany, and France. So far the warring parties have not formally rejected the map, which gives 51 per cent of Bosnia to the new Moslem-Croat federation and 49 per cent to the Serbs, who currently control 70 per cent. But they have made clear that war remains an option. In spite of continuing clashes, the UN yesterday said it wanted to extend the widely breached month-long truce between the Bosnian army and the Bosnian Serbs, when it expires on July 9. 'We are going for an extension to consolidate the gains made over the first 30 days,' a UN spokeswoman said.</p>

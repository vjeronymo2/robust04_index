			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Five days to the second round of legislative  elections and there is a return to political violence in Togo.  It is perhaps in an attempt to ward off excesses of this kind  that a meeting was convened today. It was attended by members  of the National Electoral Commission [CEN] and members of the  various political parties. Gege Adjavon reports.    [Begin Adjavon recording] In effect, conscious of the tense  atmosphere in which the candidates and political parties are  preparing for the second ballot, the CEN deems it fit to seek  together with party leaders the means and ways of preventing or  reducing significantly the irregularities that marred the first  ballot. Mr. Sipohon Kue Gaba, the NEC chairman, believes that  although the successful outcome of the ongoing process will not  solve all the problems, it constitutes an important and  indispensable stage for the establishment of the institutions of  the Fourth Republic.    Mr. Sipohon Kue Gaba did not keep mute over the  assassination  of the deputy-elect for Yoto, Edeh Gaston Aziandouvo as well as  two other members of the Action Committee for Renewal. This  odious and sordid act, condemned by the whole political class  and the entire Togolese people cannot go unpunished. In  collaboration with the government, the CEN will do everything in  its power to contribute to the search for the culprits. At the  beginning of this meeting, the leaders of the 13 political  parties present and CEN members observed a minute's silence in  memory of those who died as victims of terrorist acts and  political crimes aimed at destabilizing the public authorities  and preventing the successful outcome of the ongoing democratic  process. A prayer was also said at the beginning of this  meeting. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARAB MOB BURNS ISRAELI SOLDIER TO DEATH FOLLOWING CAR ACCIDENT  </P> <P> An angry mob of Arab refugees stoned and burned an Israeli reserve soldier to  death after his car struck two Palestinian teen-agers in a refugee camp, the  army said Friday.  </P> <P> The soldier, who was not identified, had driven his car by mistake into the  Bureij refugee camp at about 11 a.m. Thursday when the streets were full of  shoppers, an army spokesman said.  </P> <P> Palestinian youths immediately stoned the civilian car, which had yellow  Israeli license plates. The soldier, who was in uniform, tried to escape and  accidentally hit a donkey cart, injuring two Arab brothers riding on it, the  spokesman and Palestinian sources said.  </P> <P> "The accident caused severe rioting in the location," the spokesman said. "The  car was stoned with rocks. The driver was injured, and the vehicle was set on  fire."  </P> <P> The slaying occurred on the start of Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, a national  and religious holiday when most places of business and entertainment are  closed.  </P> <P> On Friday, Israeli politicians on the right and left condemned the attack.  Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, head of the right-wing Tsomet Party, was  quoted by Israel Radio as saying, "The army should wipe from the surface of the  earth all the houses near the scene of the murder. I'll suggest it at Sunday's  Cabinet meeting."  </P> <P> Several Parliament members said the brutal slaying showed the intifada, or Arab  uprising, is not finished. Shevah Weiss, a member of the center-left opposition  Labor Party, called the killing "a victory for the extremists," adding it  showed the depth of hatred motivating Palestinians.  </P> <P> Shortly after the car was set on fire, soldiers arrived and dispersed the  crowd, Palestinian sources said. Bureij camp, home to more than 16,000  Palestinians, was placed under curfew and the Gaza Strip declared a closed  military zone, preventing journalists from entering.  </P> <P> The military censor held up publication of the incident for more than 21 hours  while the soldier's family was notified.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Rafael Leonardo Callejas reiterated  yesterday, that the legal conditions to suspend Armed Forces  Commander General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir are nonexistent.  Thus, he said, the Committee of Relatives of Missing Detainees  in Honduras's (COFADEH) petition in this respect is inadmissible.    "No private organization has the power to order the  suspension of the Armed Forces commander. This action can only  be ordered by the corresponding legal authority," he emphasized.    Callejas, in his role as general commander of the Salvadoran  Armed Forces, opened the session of the Armed Forces Senior  Council this morning.</p>

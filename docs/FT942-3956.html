			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / German Economy: Bundesbank warns over falling demand Falling private demand poses the biggest threat to Germany's economic recovery, according to a senior Bundesbank official. Arguing that no fresh stimulus could be expected from lower interest rates, Mr Otmar Issing warned the government against any further tax increases. Mr Issing, the German central bank's chief economist and a member of its directorate, said state burdens on private incomes were already at record levels. 'No economy has ever delivered the growth rates we need with such high contribution rates,' he added in a weekend newspaper interview. Disposable incomes had fallen in real terms this year, and the prospects for next were not exactly rosy, he added. Mr Issing was referring to a 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge to be imposed next January. The main purpose of this levy is to finance continuing heavy transfers to aid economic reconstruction in eastern Germany. The interview also reflected the bank's concern that recent signs of recovery might encourage inflationary expectations in the 1994 pay round starting this autumn. This year's real wage cuts were insufficient to solve the problems piled up during the unification boom, he said. The popular mood was lifted last week by west German growth figures for the first quarter which showed gross domestic product expanding at more than 2 per cent year on year. Although exports are continuing to grow strongly, the early surge in private consumption which contributed to the good first-quarter result is already showing signs of evaporating. Mr Issing also confirmed that the bank felt its interest rate policy had been relaxed as far as possible for the time being. 'We are of the opinion that we have now reached a level . . . appropriate to the current economic situation and our outstanding problems,' he said. Despite ballooning monetary growth, the bank continued its rates reduction policy up to the middle of last month. Since then, Bundesbankers have made plain that a pause is necessary. 'We must keep our nerve and trust, in spite of all the undeniable difficulties, that we are on the right course,' Mr. Issing said. Steering monetary policy would be even more difficult if government failed to continue reining in state spending. In the meantime, the excess liquidity bloating the country's M3 measure of money supply had to be released - 'but not through inflationary spending, rather in long-term investments.'</p>

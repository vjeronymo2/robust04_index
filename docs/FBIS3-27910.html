(AFMC) signed export contracts for  Korean farm products worth 2.57 million U.S. dollars at the  Berlin International Farm Products Fair, which ended Jan. 23,  an AFMC spokesman said Friday.    Fifteen Korean companies displayed 54 items at the fair,  with  the most popular being sweet rice drink, pumpkin soup, kimchi,  odorless garlic and chicken soup with ginseng. Ginseng  products, a main export item, were not displayed at the fair so  the contracts were poor. AFMC will attend nine international  farm products fairs this year, including the Berlin Fair, to  make Korean products better known to the world.</p>

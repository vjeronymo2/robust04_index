			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Working Life: Socialisms Last month Tony Blair's election to the leadership of the UK Labour Party was completed. The three candidates produced two vivid new terms: moderniser and traditionalist. Like all jargon outside its environment, these words lose their specific currency outside Socialist politics. Modernisers are the right and traditionalists the left of the party. Blair is a moderniser (The Sunday Times, 17 July), unhelpfully described as 'neither Neil Kinnock nor John Smith'. Moderniser has roots meaning 'measure or limit' (Latin modus and moderator from moderare), but also a sense of actuality from modo and modernus which produced modern via medieval French. It is a powerful word which unites ideas of time, change and shape (from the Latin modulus which produces model). In the 1940s and 50s, it applied to developing and Commonwealth countries en route to liberal democracy; it has roots in Weber and Marx. The OED first usage is Fielding (1748), with Thackeray coining the first current sense in 1860: 'gunpowder and printing tended to modernise the world.' Blair's moderniser is closest to theological usage early this century, bringing the idea of advanced or progressive views. Opposite moderniser there is traditionalist. This comes from the Latin tradere (to hand over, deliver, in a sense, to betray) and surfaces in Voltaire's idea of extradition and the English extradite. Ironically, the word contains both safeguard and betrayal: handing on and handing over. Shakespeare coins traditional in Richard III: 'you are too senseless obstinate . . . too ceremonious and traditional'. The sense has changed little in the Labour leadership election, with traditionalist used to describe other people's conservative views. TS Eliot's essay Tradition and the Individual Talent did for literary criticism what the Labour party leadership election tried to do for the party: define the past and shape the future. Eliot thought English Conservatives thrived in proportion to their distance from intelligent thought, more Socialism than solecism.</p>

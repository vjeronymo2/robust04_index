			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Has the West triumphed at last?: Edward Mortimer looks at some rival visions of what the 21st century will be like Perhaps we should call it Year Five: the fifth year of the new era which began on November 9, 1989. Of course, new eras do not really begin as tidily as that. Even if the Berlin wall had not been opened so unexpectedly on that particular night, there would still have been a new era. But 1989 has been generally accepted as Year Zero, and it is long enough ago now for us to be sure. We really do live in a new world order. But does this suggest a different kind of era from those which went before: one of peace, prosperity and the triumph of western liberal values, or will it bring just a different kind of struggle? The phrase 'new world order' became discredited after President George Bush gave it too ambitious and positive a content during the build-up to the Gulf war, in September 1990, as though a new world order must, by definition, be orderly. It soon became fashionable to joke of the 'new world disorder.' But all previous world orders have been more or less disorderly. Even the one we have just left behind - the cold war - was less orderly than it is now portrayed. The two superpowers stayed at peace with each other (just), and imposed peace on what would have been their main battlefield, namely Europe. But millions perished in wars elsewhere - some of them waged or sponsored by the superpowers. Previous world orders have usually dissolved in war. War was the scale on which a new balance of power could be established, as declining empires were weighed against rising ones, and found wanting. But the cold war suddenly vanished without a shot being fired. Well, almost. Soviet communism simply rolled over and died. That did suggest that the new world order might really be different from previous ones. One superpower, the United States, and one ideology, liberal capitalism, were left in sole possession of the field. Even before the Berlin wall fell, Francis Fukuyama, the US academic, had identified this change as 'the end of history'. He did not mean there would be no more conflict, but that serious argument about the basic principles on which society should be organised had come to an end. The superior virtue of political and economic freedom had, he believed, been finally demonstrated. That sounded like a piece of outrageous arrogance, especially from someone who was, when his article appeared, employed by the US state department (although he wrote it before). He has been ridiculed for it ever since, but was he, perhaps, right? His conclusion would hardly have caused so much debate if it had been self-evidently wrong. Like his former boss, US president George Bush, but perhaps with less justice, Fukuyama has taken the rap for the failure of the new world order to live up to the Bush prospectus. Bush promised 'an era in which the nations of the world, east and west, north and south, can prosper and live in harmony . . . a world where the rule of law supplants the law of the jungle . . . a world where the strong respect the rights of the weak'. That does not sound like the world of Slobodan Milosevic, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, or Mohammed Farah Aideed. But such unsavoury characters and their policies have little to do with Fukuyama's thesis. However much conflict and suffering they cause, they do not offer the world any alternative model of civilisation. They present no serious challenge to the western prescription for all societies in search of modernity: take one tablespoonful each of free trade and private investment, plus a dram each of property rights and the rule of law; wash down with a swig of multi-party democracy and swallow. An interesting variant on the Fukuyama thesis appeared last September in a book* by Max Singer and the late Aaron Wildavsky. They divided the world into 'zones of peace' - stable, rich democracies - and 'zones of turmoil' (everyone else): a distinction reminiscent of the traditional Moslem one between the House of Islam and the House of War, although in this case the entire Islamic world, with the possible exception of Turkey, finds itself consigned to the zones of turmoil. They believe that for 85 per cent of the world's population, living in the zones of turmoil, life will continue much as the philosopher Hobbes described it in the state of nature: 'Poor, nasty, brutish and short'. But the prospects of the other 15 per cent, in the zones of peace, are more secure than ever before. All the most powerful states are now democratic. They will continue to be so, and will not threaten each other with war. Russia will probably not be democratic for very long, but it will not be very powerful either. The main element in Soviet power was the 'ability to use communist ideology and a massive system of political agents, allies, supporters, and sympathisers in programs of deceit and political warfare'; and that, argue Singer and Wildavsky, has gone beyond recall. They admit that a country or group in a zone of turmoil might threaten a major city in a zone of peace with clandestine weapons of mass destruction ('suitcase bombs'). But even if such threats or attacks happen, 'they would not alter the nature of the international system'. Such a glib dismissal of uncomfortable thoughts does not necessarily undermine Singer and Wildavsky's argument, which is that we are witnessing a 'gradual change in the technical basis of power, the continuing triumph of quality over quantity, of brain power over muscle power, of mind and imagination over physical resources, of the uncontrolled order of freedom over the rigid order of central control and planning'. Thus to retain power, states are almost obliged to be democratic, and democratic states are very unlikely to fight each other. But do modern states really have to incorporate western democratic values? A formidable challenge to such ideas appeared last summer in an article by Samuel Huntington, doyen of US political scientists, in the magazine Foreign Affairs, entitled 'The Clash of Civilisations?'. He thinks there will be 'non-western modern civilisations,' which the west will 'increasingly have to accommodate', because their power will approach its own, yet their 'values and interests' will differ significantly. Huntington agrees with Singer and Wildavsky that 'military conflict among western states is unthinkable, and western military power is unrivalled'. He admits that 'to date only Japan has fully succeeded' in becoming modern without becoming western. He qualifies even that assertion by saying that 'Japan has established a unique position for itself as an associate member of the west'. But he insists there will be major conflicts in future, whether or not they take the form of world wars, and that the main lines of conflict will be drawn between 'civilisations'. He even suggests the 'Islamic' and 'Confucian' civilisations may get together to mount a concerted military challenge to the west. In response to Huntington's article, pundits ranging from Robert Bartley, of the Wall Street Journal, to Liu Binyan, a leading Chinese dissident, reaffirmed their confidence in the universal validity of the western liberal model. More interesting was the response of a former Singaporean permanent representative at the UN, Kishore Mahbubani, from whom Huntington had borrowed the formula 'the west versus the rest'. Mahbubani endorsed Huntington's thesis but went further. The west's power was declining, he warned, its civilisation decadent - and its arrogance calculated to provoke the anger of other civilisations that are on their way up. Undoubtedly it is from Asia that the most serious challenge to western leadership is coming, in ideas as in commerce - and Singapore seems to have cast itself as Asia's ideological champion. Chan Heng Chee, another former Singaporean ambassador, argues** that 'democracy is but one virtue in the basket of virtues to be weighed', and complains of 'a new found mission in the west to use the imposed category as an international merit test, with democracy hardliners putting on the pressure for change world wide to adopt the democratic model or more precisely, the liberal democratic model'. Developing economies, she says, may benefit from a 'postponement' of democracy, and when it eventually arrives, Asian democracy must be expected to look different from the western type: it will be less permissive, more authoritarian, stressing the common good rather than individual rights, often with a single dominant party and nearly always a centralised bureaucracy and 'strong state'. This was the essence of the position put forward by most Asian governments at last June's UN human rights conference in Vienna. It is hotly contested by various non-governmental Asian voices, such as that of Christine Loh, a member of Hong Kong's legislative council (LegCo) who attended the Vienna conference on behalf of the International Commission of Jurists. 'The existence of indigenous Asian human-rights movements,' she says, 'refutes the claim that such rights are a western concept.' Governments in the region would reply that the movements in question are not really indigenous, but by-products of western colonialism. Is this special pleading by authoritarian governments on the defensive, or the authentic voice of a rising civilisation that aims to compete with the west? Perhaps a bit of both. Part of the argument is essentially pragmatic. People like Chan Heng Chee are not disputing that the basic mix of democracy and capitalism is good for Asia in the long run. They are saying (a) that not all democracies have to be exactly alike (which is self-evident) and (b) that few if any societies can take the whole western prescription at one gulp. The current economic success of China, where capitalism has been embraced with enthusiasm but democracy has been 'postponed' sine die, so to speak, may seem a telling point in their favour when compared to the chaos now afflicting Russia, which is trying to swallow both democracy and capitalism at once. But perhaps one should watch both Russia and China a few years longer before making a final judgment. And meanwhile, what about India, where democracy has been practised after a fashion for nearly half a century, and capitalism is now going from strength to strength? Certainly the brief interruption of democracy in the mid 1970s did little to advance India's economic development. This argument will run and run. Even if Fukuyama, Singer and Wildavsky turn out to be right, and western civilisation is the universal model of modernity, that does not mean the present western countries will come out on top. Japan and other Asian countries may achieve more with western ideas and institutions than the old west can. Huntington is clearly on to something when he says that the sense of belonging to a particular civilisation or culture is getting more important in determining how people line up against each other in a given conflict. That factor was not absent in the past, but it was partially eclipsed by ideological conflicts which now seem to have burnt out. To that extent Huntington is confirming Fukuyama's thesis, not contesting it: no longer disagreeing about the Big Idea, people have only their group interests left to fight for, and you cannot define group interests without first defining the group. For although states are still very important, in most parts of the world they no longer provide their inhabitants with an all-sufficient sense of identity. You define yourself as belonging to a race, religion or culture, and then try to get the state you live in to reflect that identity and the values that go with it. If the state you live in cannot or will not do that, because it is controlled by another group with a different identity from yours, you are likely to transfer your allegiance to another state, or even try to set up a new one. This is one of the most potent sources of conflict in the world today. But will it translate into a global 'clash of civilisations'? I find that much harder to imagine, and if it happens I feel reasonably confident, along with Singer and Wildavsky, that something more like modern western civilisation than any other will stay on top. But then I would say that, wouldn't I? * 'The Real World Order'. (Chatham House Publishers, Chatham NJ, Pounds 11.95. ** 'Democracy and Capitalism: Asian and American Perspectives'.

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong drugs sector Drug shares rebounded yesterday and recovered much of the loss being caused by the big hit the sector took in Friday's volatile market. Bid speculation stocks Zeneca and Wellcome made up the most ground and, following the pattern of recent trading, again moved in line with each other. Wellcome jumped 28 to 685p with some market watchers noting a shortage of the stock. Volume was moderate at 1.8m. Zeneca pushed ahead 23 to 833p. Speculative buying along with corrective action after Friday's fall was said to have been behind the moves as bid anticipation rumbled on. Glaxo, which went ex-dividend yesterday, fell back 12 to 572p although after a dividend of 18p its share price effectively improved by 6p. SmithKline Beecham continued to enjoy steady support and its price firmed 4 to 430p. According to one analyst sentiment in the pharmaceuticals sector was further buoyed by an upbeat KPMG Peat Marwick report into acquisitions and mergers in the healthcare industry. James Capel, one of the City's leading agency brokers, was cited as the driving force behind the good showing of Cable &amp; Wireless, which moved up 4 1/2 to 405 1/2 p on high turnover of 5.3m shares. Vodafone, on the other hand, continued to disappoint, the shares sliding 3 more to 183 1/2 p with 5.1m traded. Vodafone shares have fallen over 12 per cent since the end of August, compared with a 5 per cent decline in the FT-SE 100 and a 7.3 per cent decline in the FT-SE Actuaries telecoms index. Hints in the market that Arjo Wiggins, the paper group, may be considering a Pounds 500m-plus rights issue to finance a Dollars 1.5 bn US acquisition was put forward by traders as the reason behind the marked weakness of Arjo shares which retreated around 8 to 258p after turnover of 2m shares. There were plenty of good performers in the utilities sectors, notably the Recs where East Midlands came in for strong support, closing 16 higher at 737p and London Electricity 12 higher at 700p, the latter after talk of heavy demand from Goldman Sachs, the influential US investment bank. A NatWest Securities buy recommendation triggered good support for Southern Water, which moved up 10 to 583p. MAI, the financial services and media group, came under fire in the stockmarket after releasing mildly disappointing preliminary results. The shares dropped 13 to 255 1/2 p. The banks were in the forefront of the market's mid-session rally but turnover in the sector was well down on recent levels. 'The market got itself short of these things, and that was it; there was no weight of buying, simply a mark-up,' said one dealer. Royal Bank of Scotland was the sector's outstanding performer, the shares climbing 9 to 417p after talk that Mr Peter Wood, chief executive of Royal Bank's hugely successful Direct Line insurance company had met with banking analysts at Credit Lyonnais Laing, Royal Bank's broker. ICI had a buoyant day and pushed up 9 to 842p. Activity was strong in Coats Viyella with 3.4m shares changing hands. The price improved 6 to 208p as one analyst said that buyers were returning to the stock after its relatively weak performance recently. Peel Holdings was the one noticeable mover among property shares, rising 4 to 261p on hopes that its plans for a big shopping development in Manchester may finally get the go-ahead next year. Further consideration of the trans-Atlantic fare wars sparked last weement k by Continental Airlines of the US, led to a 2 1/2 decline (for 9 in two sessions) to 380p at British Airways. Eurotunnel gained 5 to 279p on the announcement that its overture Shuttle service would finally start on or around November 15. After a bounce last week Carlton Communications slipped back 4 to 850p after a very mixed trading day in the media sector. A combination of profit-taking and reaction to recent presentations by the company to analysts was put behind the fall. Recouping half of Friday's losses, British Aerospace rose 6 to 479p ahead of tomorrow's announcement of interim results. Traders are looking for a strong profits recovery, possibly to Pounds 75m pre-tax after Pounds 20m last time. British Steel was again in demand, moving up 3 1/2 to 156 1/2 p on the back of autumn price rises ranging from 3 to 7 per cent. Other statistics, Page 39</p>

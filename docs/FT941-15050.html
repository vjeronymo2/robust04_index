			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / CDU seeks cheap foreign labour curbs The ruling Christian Democrats in Germany are calling for tough measures to crack down on the employment of cheap foreign labour and a national initiative to promote part-time work and flexible hours, in a bid to counter rising unemployment. The economic programme of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, approved at the weekend by the party's national executive, calls for companies employing illegal labour to be blacklisted for public sector contracts. At the same time, it wants special measures to allow long-term unemployed in Germany to be hired for low wages - below the industry minima fixed by national wage contracts. As for part-time working, the CDU is calling for a 'national offensive' to increase the numbers, arguing that at least 2m extra jobs could be created. The controversial document was drawn up by a working group chaired by Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, and it lays great stress on the need to promote new technologies, including environmental technology, to maintain German competitiveness internationally. Shortly after the proposals were published, an inner circle of government ministers agreed on measures to prune a further DM5bn (Dollars 2.9bn) in spending this year, in an effort to keep the federal government's borrowing requirement below DM70bn. The defence ministry will bear the brunt of the latest cuts, with DM1.2bn, followed by the transport and employment ministries. Further savings of DM2.5bn have yet to be found. The CDU programme calls for continuing strict control over public spending, and in particular for state spending on social programmes to ease redundancies in the private sector to be converted from grants to loans. It also proposes the creation of a National Technology Council to co-ordinate research, promote rapid industrial application of German inventions and intervene in a national debate which often appears hostile to innovation. The programme calls for joint efforts between the government and the banking sector to make more venture capital available, with attractive tax incentives, for high-risk projects. It singles out transport investment for special emphasis, through private sector investment in roads and high-tech projects such as the Transrapid magnetic hover-train. The proposed job creation measures are likely to prove controversial in the election campaign, relying as they do on drastic deregulation of the labour market.</p>

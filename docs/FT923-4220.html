			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Suter benefits from lower interest costs A LOWER interest charge enabled Suter, the distribution, industrial and chemical group headed by Mr David Abell, to announce a 2 per cent increase in interim profits. The pre-tax outcome came to Pounds 9.4m (Pounds 9.2m) for the six months to June 27, although turnover dipped 3 per cent to Pounds 101.3m. Trading profits fell 6 per cent to Pounds 11.3m but the net interest charge dropped to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 2.8m). In distribution, trading profit fell 27 per cent because of a downturn in industrial refrigeration sales. The drop was exaggerated as the comparable profits were lifted by legislative changes which led to customers upgrading equipment. Recession in UK construction affected sales of air conditioning equipment. But automotive components did well and the decline in the industrial division's trading profit was limited to a 11 per cent. Chemicals performed strongly and lifted trading profits 27 per cent to Pounds 4.2m. Fine chemicals increased sales 14 per cent, helped by exports, although Pentagon continued to be affected by last year's cancellation of a sub-contracting contract. Net borrowings fell Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 36.4m - the benefit of tighter working capital control. Mr Abell said he expected year-end borrowings to be little changed from last time at Pounds 30.2m. Gearing, on shareholders' funds of Pounds 48.2m, was 76 per cent (80 per cent) although interest cover improved to 5.9 (4.3) times. Fully diluted earnings were again 5.4p. The interim dividend is held at 3.2p and the final is forecast to stay at 5.6p. Mr Abell, who in May promised 'radical action' to improve Suter's share price, said he could still not comment on what plans were under discussion. The Department of Trade and Industry is continuing its investigations of six companies with Suter links. DTI inspectors were appointed in 1988 and 1989 to establish whether certain investors in the companies acted in concert. Their report is still pending. COMMENT Yesterday's dividend pledge may have helped Suter's shares hold steady at 97p, but they are still languishing from last May's peak of 142p which followed Mr Abell's statement on 'radical action'. Most observers assume his cryptic comments will lead to a disposal, possibly of the automotive or valve businesses. This would certainly help the balance sheet which, despite a fall in net borrowings, still looks vulnerable. But assuming a buyer can be found, Suter will have little left to recommend it. Parts of the business, for example chemicals company Chemoxy, are well managed and should perform well out of recession. But refrigeration and air conditioning sales are likely to remain muted until 1993 at the earliest. Analysts clipped back full year forecasts to Pounds 19m yesterday, putting the shares on a multiple of 9. Even if the DTI cloud passes, the shares are not undervalued.</p>

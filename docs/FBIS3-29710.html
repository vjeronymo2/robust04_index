Pathom Phanityanuson from the Foreign Trade Department does not  think so. In a statement contradicting all the optimism  prevailing in the business community since the embargo was  lifted, he said, "the mutual trade value between Thailand and  Vietnam is expected to decline, while the restrictions on  commerce are likely to increase."    At yesterday's seminar on "The Trade and Investment Policy  After the American Lifting of its Trade Embargo on Vietnam",  Pathom appeared to be cautious about the positive anticipations  of mutual trade ties between the two countries expanding. He  said the end to the embargo would instead prompt the Vietnamese  government to adjust its economic structure by promoting import  ubstitutions and preserving the available raw materials for  local investors.    In short, this would mean Thailand no longer being able to  import raw materials like teak, minerals and ore from Vietnam,  while Thai investors would find it more difficult to sell their  goods. "The Vietnamese government will likely implement import  restrictions via three measures; by setting high tariffs,  introducing quotas and restricting the volume of imports in  industries it is trying to promote," he said.    For example, the Vietnamese government recently announced it  will be restricting 16 categories of imports. "Thai investors  should therefore make a profound study before deciding to enter  into any business in Vietnam," he suggested. [passage omitted]    In the short run, Pathom suggested Thai businessmen should  adjust their business strategy to cope with the new investment  promotions of the Vietnamese government. Instead of expecting  to import only raw materials from this emerging economy, Thai  investors should cooperate with local Vietnamese businessmen in  areas where they can share expertise, such as processed-farm  goods or textiles. "Else, we should act as a marketing gateway  for Vietnamese sellers in the same way the Dutch resold Thai  tapioca exports in the European market," he said. [passage  omitted]    Dr Sutham Yu-Naitham said Thai investors would be  well-positioned to participate in a wide range of services, such  as hotels, distribution and human resource development. "Thais  have somehow been overlooked [though they have] strong expertise  in the service sector." he said.    Loxley Plc's Thongchai Lamsum, whose company is already in  Vietnam providing household telephone services, thinks  differently. While others identify hotels and tourism management  as primary service industries for local investors to bring to  Vietnam, he identified hospitals and fast food businesses as  more likely to succeed.    "The Vietnamese have more purchasing power than we think  they  have," Thongchai said. Like others, he also identified the  consumer products industry as a potential candidate for  investment. He said others include computers and PABX telephone  services, including installation and repair.    Narong Chiwangkun, the managing director of Kodak (Thailand)  Co Ltd, seemed to agree with Thongchai's identification of  potential industries Thais will be able to compete in. "[Were]  Thailand a company and I its managing director, I would identify  the industries we Thais are to go into Vietnam [with].  Industries which cannot compete need not to go there," Narong  said.    Several of the speakers said both Bangkok and Hanoi still  had  certain problems that immediate remedies had to be found for.    On the Vietnamese side, problems usually identified are the  difficult Vietnamese investment laws, red tape, inadequate  infrastructure and poor management.    On the Thai side, Vietnamese investors seem to distrust  their  Thai counterparts. Thai investors, according to several  speakers, were viewed as exploiters, rather than as good-willed  investors.    Le Cong Phung, the Vietnamese Ambassador to Thailand,  yesterday affirmed the lifting of U.S. embargo will not bring  about a sudden explosion of economic development via U.S.  investment there.    "Rather, it will psychologically relieve our friends to  cooperate and invest in Vietnam," Phung said.    The ambassador emphatically said the new situation will not  divert his government's foreign policy and economic relations  with other countries, especially those in Southeast Asia.    "I can assure you we have and continue to encourage and  promote the economic cooperation, trade and investment with  Thailand. It is our consistent policy,'' he said.</p>

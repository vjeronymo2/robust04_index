			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> INTERPRETIVE CENTER APPROVED ON SITE NEXT TO MADRONA MARSH  </P> <P> The Torrance City Council has voted unanimously to set aside a two-acre site  next to Madrona Marsh to build an interpretive center for the seasonal  wetlands.  </P> <P> At the recommendation of city naturalist W. Walton Wright, the council also  voted Tuesday to modify designs for a bike path around the marsh.  </P> <P> There are no proposed designs or cost estimates for the center, but Wright said  he would like it to be about 12,000 square feet in area and house exhibits, a  meeting room, public restrooms, a library and a laboratory where exhibits would  be prepared.  </P> <P> The center, to be located on a vacant triangular parcel at Plaza Del Amo and  Monterey Street, will include between 50 and 75 parking spaces, Wright said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Few Wetlands Remaining  </P> <P> City officials said it is too early to estimate how long it will take to  prepare designs, advertise for bids and begin construction of the center.  </P> <P> Madrona Marsh, which is bounded by Sepulveda Boulevard, Madrona Avenue, Maple  Avenue and Plaza Del Amo, is one of the few vernal wetlands remaining in  Southern California and is a refuge for about 140 species of migratory birds,  frogs, snakes and other small animals.  </P> <P> The decision to move ahead with the center had the support of the Friends of  Madrona Marsh, an environmental group dedicated to preserving the marsh, which  has been lobbying for the interpretive center for years.  </P> <P> Last year the council approved plans for a bike path and sidewalk landscaped  with trees and brush that would weave along the perimeter of the marsh, varying  40 to 60 feet inward from the street. A 17-foot-wide bike path already exists  on the edge of the marsh along Sepulveda and part of Madrona.  </P> <P> Wright, who was hired in February as the city's first full-time naturalist to  oversee preservation of the marsh, met with several city officials and  suggested that the landscaping be eliminated and that the path be laid out  closer to the street.  </P> <P> That way, Wright said, the bike path and sidewalk will occupy less marshland  than under previous plans and will be easier to maintain.  </P> <P> The bike path and sidewalk will run along the border of the marsh on Sepulveda  Boulevard, Madrona Avenue and Plaza Del Amo. The eastern boundary of the marsh  along Maple Avenue will contain only a six-foot-wide sidewalk.  </P> <P> The bike path will connect with one that runs along Sepulveda, Crenshaw  Boulevard, Monterey and Madrona.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Changes Get Support  </P> <P> About six members of the Friends of Madrona Marsh attended the meeting, and  most gave tentative support to the bike path modifications.  </P> <P> Sam Suitt, former president of the group, said he would prefer that the city  not use marshland for a bike path, but added: "If you must have a bike path,  then for heaven's sake have it on the edge and make it straight."  </P> <P> City officials have said they believe that the bike path will provide a  recreational benefit for residents while improving the marsh's appearance.  </P> <P> The marsh was obtained by the city under a 1983 agreement with the developers  of Park Del Amo, a massive residential and office project next to the marsh. In  the agreement, the developer won the right to build 1,482 residential units and  850,000 square feet of office space in exchange for donating 34 1/2 acres of  marshland and selling an additional 8 1/2 acres to the city.  </P> <P> The agreement required the developer, Torrance Investment Co., to pay for a  pathway and landscaping along Sepulveda, Madrona and Plaza Del Amo. Parks and  Recreation Director Gene Barnett estimated that it will cost at least $750,000  for the complete bike path and sidewalk. The city will pay for the sidewalk  along Maple Avenue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 60 Days to Act  </P> <P> The developer has 60 days to review and give final approval to the  modifications approved by the council.  </P> <P> The city has applied for a $427,000 grant from the state Department of Parks  and Recreation to help pay for other landscaping and improvements to the  perimeter of the marsh and the medians of some adjacent streets. Wright said he  is not sure when a decision on the grant is expected.  </P> <P> The City Council also voted to replace the rusting chain-link fence that  encircles the marsh with a wrought-iron fence. The new fence will cost about  $80,000 -- about $20,000 more than the cost of a new chain-link fence. City  Council members said the wrought-iron fence is aesthetically superior.  </P> <P> Mayor Katy Geissert said the present chain-link fence diminishes the marsh's  appearance.  </P> <P> She said the city doesn't permit chain-link fences "around people's front  yards. I don't see why we should have it around this important piece of  property."  </P> <P> Wright suggested that the city plant only native species of trees and  vegetation within and along the marsh's perimeter. For example, he suggests the  city plant weeping willow, sycamore and cottonwood trees instead of eucalyptus  trees, which inhabit the marsh and adjacent land.  </P> <P> "We should start looking at what the habitat was, and we should try to keep  that in mind," he said. "A lot of people who have been looking at this have  been trying to plant trees that would make this look like a botanical garden  and that is not natural."  </P></p>

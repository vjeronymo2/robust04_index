			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PANAMA BANK GETS FINE OF $5 MILLION IN COCAINE CASE  </P> <P> A Panamanian bank has pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges in a major  case involving drug proceeds for Colombia's Medellin cartel and has been  ordered to pay a record $5-million penalty, the U.S. attorney in Atlanta  announced Monday.  </P> <P> The pleas stemmed from a massive investigation code-named Polar Cap, which also  led to indictments in Los Angeles, Houston, Miami and New York. Trials in the  Los Angeles case are scheduled for January, 1990, and May, 1990.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge William C. O'Kelley in Atlanta sentenced Banco de Occidente  of Panama to forfeit $5 million to the United States after accepting the bank's  guilty plea. "This sentence not only is the largest sentence ever imposed by a  federal court against a bank for drug money laundering, but also marks the  greatest single forfeiture of substitute assets to the U.S.," said Robert L.  Barr Jr., U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.  </P> <P> Barr said the judge's action was based on provisions of the 1986 Anti-Drug  Abuse Act, which provides that defendants may be ordered to forfeit  "substitute" property if the actual drug proceeds cannot be seized. In this  case, Barr said, the government's investigation found that the drug money had  been removed from the United States after it passed through the bank in  Atlanta.  </P> <P> "The ability of the government to seize the bank's assets unquestionably  brought the bank to the negotiating table," Barr said.  </P> <P> The plea agreement called for the government to dismiss its case against Banco  de Occidente's (Panama) parent bank, Banco de Occidente (S.A.), headquartered  in Cali, Colombia. Barr said the Colombian bank has guaranteed the United  States the full payment of the Panamanian bank's forfeiture.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Largest Investigation Ever  </P> <P> Prosecution of the banks was part of the Polar Cap probe, which was the largest  narcotic money-laundering investigation ever by U.S. law enforcement agencies.  </P> <P> On March 8, federal prosecutors in Los Angeles announced that a grand jury here  indicted 33 wholesale jewelers and associates in the downtown jewelry district  on charges of running a $1-billion cocaine money-laundering ring. Prosecutors  said they also had filed civil complaints aimed at seizing $80 million in  property owned by the defendants, including a 10-story building in the heart of  the jewelry district.  </P> <P> Mark J. Werksman, an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles who is one of the  prosecutors in the jewelry mart cases, said Monday's guilty pleas in Atlanta  will have a positive effect on the Los Angeles cases but declined to elaborate.  A federal prosecutor in Atlanta said he did not know if any Banco Occidente  officials would testify in the Los Angeles cases but said evidence gathered in  the case might be used here.  </P> <P> But Stanley I. Greenberg, a lawyer for one of the major defendants in the cases  here, said that Banco Occidente was not a defendant in Los Angeles and had not  been mentioned in any papers he had seen in the case.  </P></p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Book Review: Architecture of corporate advantage FOUNDATIONS OF CORPORATE SUCCESS: HOW BUSINESS STRATEGIES ADD VALUE By John Kay Oxford University Press Pounds 19.95. 416 pages For more than 30 years, students of corporate strategy have sought to understand and categorise the essential conditions which determine business success. But in that time, what of practical value have they actually discovered? Not much, according to John Kay. At worst, he argues, corporate strategy is akin to quack medicine. Highly susceptible to fad and fashion, it owes its continuing appeal more to the plausibility of practitioners and the desperate search by managers for solutions than to any evidence that it delivers beneficial results. As professor of economics at London Business School and former head of its Centre for Business Strategy, Kay is well-qualified to play iconoclast. However, the main purpose of this book is not to demolish corporate strategy, but to legitimise it as a discipline by re-defining its role and equipping it with more precise analytical tools. The obvious first question is how to judge success. Kay rejects yardsticks such as scale, market share or return on capital. He plumps instead for added value, the margin by which the value of a company's output exceeds the costs of the raw materials, capital and labour it employs. On this measure Glaxo, Benetton, Reuters, Petrofina, Kwik Save, LVMH and Guinness rank among the stars of European industry, with which Kay is primarily concerned. By contrast, Philips, the ailing Dutch electronics group, has had negative added value in recent years: in other words, it has been destroying wealth, a process which, in the absence of subsidy, cannot go on. In analysing these companies' performance, most approaches to corporate strategy would seek to extract from their management methods and organisation general lessons which could be profitably applied by other businesses. But that, according to Kay, is where conventional practitioners have come badly unstuck. Not only, he says, do their prescriptions often amount to arid checklists and platitudes, of negligible practical value. Their whole approach is based on a logical nonsense. For every company's competitive advantage is, by definition, unique to it and cannot be replicated or adapted by others. If it could be, it would soon be nullified. Failure to grasp this lesson has trapped many businesses in futile 'wish-driven' strategies. In the case of Bull, the embattled French computer maker which has long struggled to become Europe's answer to IBM, the vision was unachievable. In the case of the Saatchis' ruinously expensive efforts to build a global marketing services company, it was not worth achieving. Kay argues that, instead of being beguiled by the vision thing, the proper function of corporate strategy is to start with the question: 'How can we be different?' The answers are to be found by identifying within each company its most valuable sources of actual or potential advantage. These distinctive capabilities, as he calls them, fall into four broad categories and can occur singly or - preferably - in combination. One is innovation, a fragile advantage because it is easily replicable by competitors. Another, more defensible, capability is reputation, typically in the form of strong brands. A third is strategic assets, such as a government-sanctioned monopoly or airlines' landing slots. These inhibit market entry by rivals, though their owners do not necessarily create added value. The fourth capability - and in Kay's view the most critical - is what he terms architecture: the links between a company and its employees, customers and suppliers. More far-reaching than corporate culture, architecture is the fountainhead of institutional knowledge and adaptability. At the heart of strong architecture is a network of stable relational contracts, or implicit understandings between participants which govern their behaviour towards each other. In a novel application of the rules of game theory, the author finds that such contracts are most likely to flourish when a game is played repeatedly over a long period. This is because players' knowledge that they must go on dealing with each other discourages selfish opportunism and favours a mutually beneficial outcome. This is an important feature of successful businesses such as Marks &amp; Spencer and many Japanese and German companies, which have consistently managed to unite a range of interests behind a common purpose. As Kay puts it: 'Architecture does not create extraordinary organisations by assembling extraordinary people . . . but by enabling very ordinary people to perform in extraordinary ways.' Conversely, many of the deficiencies of US and UK corporate practice identified by critics of 'short-termism' stem from a business environment which prizes one-off transactional relationships and pursuit of individual gain above continuity and stability. One of its biggest weaknesses is that the appropriation of wealth can too easily take priority over its creation, as exemplified by the US buy-out boom of the late 1980s. Other students of corporate performance have identified some of these connections before. But none has explored them as thoroughly as Kay, who succeeds in marrying an authoritative grasp of economic, legal and sociological theory with an impressively detailed knowledge of contemporary business practice. A further strength of his approach is that it does not assume that outstanding corporate success is immutable - a common mistake of management books, notably In Search of Excellence, Waterman and Peters' best-seller of the early 1980s. Indeed, Kay's analysis of Benetton concludes that the company has exhausted much of the potential of its distinctive capabilities and is condemned to much slower growth in future. Foundations of Corporate Success is not without faults. Kay's claim to put strategy in a distinctly European perspective does not really stand up. Not only does he appear most at home when dealing with the British corporate scene, but the sheer diversity of national business practices in Europe militates against generalisations. Furthermore, some chapters, such as those devoted to cost accounting and acquisitions and mergers, have little new to add. But these are minor criticisms of a powerfully argued book, which casts a fresh light on a range of practical business challenges. It should also engender a healthy scepticism towards the currently fashionable school of theory which holds that strategy is all about aspiring to realise towering management visions. As Kay puts it: 'If there is a single central fallacy in much modern strategic thinking, it is the notion that the act of will is the most important element in corporate achievement.'</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Ucatt attacks 'debts' rumour Ucatt, the construction union, yesterday said that groups of trade unionists were in collusion with employers in a 'rumour campaign' which falsely alleged that it was about to go into liquidation, Robert Taylor writes. Mr George Brumwell, general secretary, said: 'Our union has been subject to vicious lies alleging either that we have gone bust or are in imminent danger of doing so. Nothing could be further from the truth.' He did not give details of which union or unions the individuals involved came from. Ucatt merger talks with the TGWU general union have reached a delicate stage. A conflict over alleged membership poaching in construction is still going on with the AEEU engineering union. Mr Brumwell said the 'only real financial liability' was a Pounds 1.4m overdraft facility with Unity Trust, the union bank, which was more than adequately covered by assets.</p>

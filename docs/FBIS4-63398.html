			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- According to some  information, former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy plans to  resign as chairman of the Free Russia People's Party (FRPP) and  to concentrate on the creation of a people's patriotic movement  "Power".    Rutskoy had been a ringleader of the abortive state coup in  Moscow last October and had been put into prison along with  other conspirators, following the collapse of the coup. He was  amnestied by the Russian parliament together with other leaders  of the coup in a move to reach civic accord in the country.    However, he claimed in an interview with the KOMSOMOLSKAYA  PRAVDA newspaper on Friday that he was not guilty of anything,  and there was no need to amnesty him. He said that the amnesty  (incidentally, railroaded through parliament by his supporters  and opposed by President Yeltsin) was issued by those who were  eager to cover facts behind the October tragedy.    Speaking of party affairs, Vassiliy Lipitskiy, chairman of  the FRPP Board, claimed in an interview with journalists on  Friday on the eve of the opening of the second FRPP congress  that it is too early to speak about the creation of the  movement and that it will not compete the FRPP in any way.    The congress will adopt several documents, including a  statement formulating the FRPP's tasks for the nearest future,  which is, in actual fact, tantamount to a party programme.    According to the Board chairman who now is the actual leader  of the party, the FRPP should also decide whether to sign the  social accord treaty. "It is more likely, the results will be  negative. But in any case, the party will examine unilateral  obligations to preserve civil peace," Lipitskiy stressed.    Asked by ITAR-TASS about the party's relations with Rutskoy,  the Board chairman replied that the former vice-president "was  always somewhat independent of the party, and its members got  accustomed to this".    He expressed doubt that there would be a serious discussion  at the congress concerning Rutskoy's leadership, although, he  admitted, "there is critical attitude to some of his  pronouncements" among party members.    In Lipitskiy's opinion, the former vice-president "has his  basis of support which is expanding".    The Board chairman pointed to the Russian Agrarian Party and  some small parties of social democratic orientation as his  party's closest allies. Lipitskiy said that the FRPP occupies  the centrist position, which means social democratic orientation  under the present conditions in Russia.    The Board chairman noted that the Civic Union bloc, of which  the FRPP was a member, can be recreated only on a new basis.  Its former idea of partnership between industrial managers and  hired labour turned to be out of date under the present  conditions, which predetermined the union's defeat at the  elections.</p>

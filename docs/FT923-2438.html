			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: Remy chairman warns of lower than forecast profits THE TURBULENCE in the French drinks industry continued yesterday with Remy-Cointreau, a leading wine and spirits producer, warning on profits, and reports that LVMH, one of the largest players in French drinks, had secretly bought a stake in Grand Marnier liqueur. Remy, which has interests in wines and spirits including Cointreau liqueur, had originally been expected to make net profits of about FFr313m (Dollars 65.07m) for the present financial year to March 30, an increase of 15 per cent on the FFr271m in the previous year. However, Mr Andre Heriard Dubreuil, Remy chairman, warned shareholders at yesterday's annual general meeting that final profits may fall short of those originally forecast because of 'the uncertain economic climate' and the falling US dollar. Meanwhile, LVMH has refused to comment on a report in Les Echos, the French economic daily newspaper, that it has acquired a 7 per cent stake in Marnier-Lapostolle, the family-controlled company that owns Grand Marnier liqueur. LVMH, which today announces its first-half results, said it was 'up to Grand Marnier to comment on any changes in its shareholding'. LVMH, which distributes Grand Marnier in south-east Asia, is reported to have bought the 7 per cent holding from Marceau Investments, a French finance house. Marnier-Lapostolle made net profits of FFr75.5m last year on sales of FFr601m, with its eponymous liqueur representing 80 per cent of total sales.</p>

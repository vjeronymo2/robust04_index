			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Official status. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  This commentary is the means by which the staff of the Office of General Counsel of the National Credit Union Administration issues official staff interpretations of Part 707 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations. Good faith compliance with this commentary affords protection from liability under section 271(f) of the Truth in Savings Act (TISA), 12 U.S.C. 4311. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Section 707.1_Authority, Purpose, Coverage, and Effect on State Laws <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Coverage <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Foreign applicability. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Part 707 applies to all credit unions that offer share and deposit accounts to residents (including resident aliens) of any state as defined in &sect;707.2(v) and that offer accounts insurable by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) whether or not such accounts are insured by the NCUSIF. Corporate credit unions designated as such by NCUA under 12 CFR 704.2 (definition of ``corporate credit union'') are exempt from part 707. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->  Persons who advertise accounts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Persons who advertise accounts are subject to the advertising rules. This includes agent and agented accounts, such as a member who subdivides interests in a jumbo term share certificate account for sale to other parties or among members who form a certificate account investment club. For example, if an agent places an advertisement that offers members an interest in an account at a credit union, the advertising rules apply to the advertisement, whether the account is held by the agent or directly by the member. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (d) Effect on State Laws <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->  Preemption of state laws/Inconsistent requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  State law requirements that are inconsistent with the requirements of TISA and part 707 are preempted to the extent of the inconsistency. A state law is inconsistent if it requires a credit union to make disclosures or take actions that contradict the requirements of the federal law. A state law is also contradictory if it requires the use of the same term to represent a different amount or a different meaning than the federal law, requires the use of a term different from that required in the federal law to describe the same item, or permits a method of calculating dividends or interest on an account different from that required in the federal law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Preemption determinations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  A credit union, state, or other interested party may request the Board to determine whether a state law requirement is inconsistent with the federal requirements. A request for a determination should be addressed to NCUA's Office of General Counsel, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314. Written preemption requests should cite (or include a copy of) the allegedly inconsistent state law, demonstrate the inconsistency with TISA and part 707 and the burden on credit unions, and formally request a preemption determination. The Office of General Counsel may provide other interested parties, particularly affected states, an informal opportunity to comment on any request for a preemption determination, unless it finds that such notice and opportunity for comment would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. NCUA will publicize any preemption determinations using any means readily at its disposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Effect of preemption determinations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  After the Board, through its Office of General Counsel, determines that a state law is inconsistent, a credit union may not make disclosures using the inconsistent term or take actions relying on the inconsistent law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Reversal of determination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The Board reserves the right to reverse a determination for any reason bearing on the coverage or effect of state or federal law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Section 707.2_Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Account <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Covered accounts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Examples of accounts subject to the regulation are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. Dividend-bearing and interest-bearing accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. Non-dividend-bearing and non-interest-bearing accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii. Accounts opened as a condition of obtaining a credit card. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iv. Escrow accounts with a consumer purpose, such as an account established by a member to escrow rental payments, pending resolution of a dispute with the member's landlord. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> v. Accounts held by a parent or custodian for a minor under a state's Uniform Gift to Minors Act (or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vi. Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and simplified employee pension (SEP) accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vii. Payable-on-Death (POD) or ``Totten trust'' accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->  Other accounts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Examples of accounts  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  subject to the regulation are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. Mortgage escrow accounts for collecting taxes and property insurance premiums. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. Accounts established to make periodic disbursements on construction loans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii. Trust accounts opened by a trustee pursuant to a formal written trust agreement (not merely declarations of trust on a signature card such as a ``Totten trust,'' or an IRA or SEP account). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iv. Accounts opened by an executor in the name of decedent's estate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> v. Accounts of individuals operating businesses as sole proprietors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vi. Certificates of indebtedness. Some credit unions borrow funds from their members through a certificate of indebtedness that sets forth the terms and conditions of the repayment of the borrowing, such as federal credit unions do through 12 CFR 701.38. Such an account does not represent an account in a credit union and is not covered by part 707. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vii. Unincorporated nonbusiness association accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Other investments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The term ``account'' does not apply to these products. Examples of products not covered are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. Government securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. Mutual funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii. Annuities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iv. Securities or obligations of a credit union. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> v. Contractual arrangements such as repurchase agreements, interest rate swaps, and bankers acceptances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vi. Purchases of U.S. Savings Bonds through a credit union. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

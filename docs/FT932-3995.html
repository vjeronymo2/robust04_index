			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Close contest for leadership of Canada THE race for the leadership of Canada's ruling Progressive Conservative party has turned into a neck-and-neck contest between Ms Kim Campbell, defence minister, and Mr Jean Charest, environment minister. The contest, based on personalities rather than policies, is reflected in the feverish last-minute campaigns by both front-runners to secure the loyalty of the 3,800 delegates attending the party convention this weekend in Ottawa. The winner, to be chosen by secret ballot on Sunday afternoon, will succeed Mr Brian Mulroney as prime minister and lead the Conservatives in a general election this year. Opinion polls, which had given Ms Campbell a seemingly unassailable lead, still give her the edge among delegates committed to one of the five candidates. But the 34-year-old Mr Charest has made a strong showing. Conservatives were initially excited by the idea of having a bilingual woman from British Columbia at their helm. But Ms Campbell has since been characterised as a prickly intellectual, her French has turned out to be less fluent than she had claimed, and attention has been drawn to her being twice-divorced. The Globe and Mail newspaper said in an editorial this week that she displayed 'a brittleness, a nervous insistence on the rightness of her cause that will not wear well with time.' Also, it applauded Mr Charest for 'a quick mind, a likeable demeanour and a plain way of speaking.' His main drawback remains the unease among Conservatives about choosing another Quebecer as their national leader  - he is a staunch federalist, committed to protect the rights of Quebec's English-speaking minority. But the Charest camp has been lifted by the endorsement by two of the party's most influential English-speaking ministers  - Mr Joe Clark, ex-prime minister, and Mr John Crosbie, fisheries minister. Convention delegates and the public have few clues to how Ms Campbell or Mr Charest would tackle Canada's economic and social issues.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / British and US jets strike at Bosnian Serbs: Nato hits back after attacks on UN troops British and US jets attacked a Bosnian Serb tank west of Sarajevo yesterday after United Nations peacekeeping troops twice came under Serbian fire. It was the fourth Nato attack on Bosnian Serb positions since UN troops were deployed and reflected international exasperation with violations of a weapons-free zone around the Bosnian capital. The Nato retaliation was led by a US A-10 jet which strafed the Serbian tank and was followed by two British Jaguars which dropped bombs on the position, Nato officials said. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned in Washington of more Nato air strikes if Bosnian Serbs violated exclusion zones or attacked UN peacekeepers. But the Bosnian Serb army denounced the air strike and said it reserved the right to attack Nato and UN peacekeepers. Earlier, a French armoured personnel carrier was hit by Bosnian Serb forces as it monitored an exchange of fire between Bosnian Serb and Moslem-led Bosnian forces near Sarajevo. One UN soldier was injured. General Sir Michael Rose, the commander of UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, defended the Nato action, saying the Serb attack on the French armoured vehicle had been deliberate. Gen Rose said the Serbs had one tank left in the weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo and that was chosen as the target. In his view, the strike was a proportionate reaction to the Bosnian Serb attacks. The air strike is the latest sign that the allies are taking a firmer stance towards former Yugoslavia. Nato, urged on by the US, has been pressing hard in recent days for a more vigorous effort to counter the Bosnian Serbs, who have rejected an international peace plan. The US administration has promised the powerful pro-Bosnian lobby in Congress that it will start moves to lift the UN arms embargo against Bosnia unless the Serbs accept the peace plan by October 15. European governments have warned the US that that might lead to a disastrous escalation of fighting. The White House, which disclosed news of yesterday's air raid, has been pressing for tougher enforcement of existing policies in Bosnia. General Bertrand de Lapresle, commander of UN forces in former Yugoslavia, said the air strike was a 'proportionate' reaction to the Serb attack. Senior Nato officials have asked the UN for a stricter interpretation of the rules under which heavy weapons in Sarajevo and the enclave of Gorazde - and any forces that attack the UN anywhere in Bosnia - are subject to air strikes. UN commanders say they are better judges than Nato of when air strikes are appropriate. However, yesterday's action seemed to have the full support of both international organisations.</p>

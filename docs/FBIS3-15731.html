At about 6:00 on Wednesday, residents of the settlements of  Chermen, Kurtat, Dachnoye, Saniba and Verkhny Komgaron, as well  as Terek cossacks, blocked the main road between the villages of  Oktyabrskoye and Kartsa in North Ossetia's Prigorodny District,  brought traffic to a standstill and staged a rally of protest.    The action was prompted by the recent murder by armed  bandits  of two civilians from the settlement of Verkhny Komgaron located  within the safety zone under control of Russian peacekeeping  forces and local law-enforcement bodies, according to Gatsir  Dzagoyev, head of the Prigorodny District's local  self-government and a North Ossetian deputy. The protesters  demanded that North Ossetian authorities, the temporary  administration and investigation bodies expose the criminals.    Participants in the rally believe that troops assigned to  the  temporary administration do not perform their functions  properly. They also accused the Russian Interior Ministry's  investigation group investigating crimes in the zone under state  of emergency rule of somewhat neglecting their official duties.    The Prigorodny District's residents also demanded that the  state of emergency be lifted in North Ossetia from March 31 and  that the temporary administration be dissolved. To substantiate  their demand, the protesters stressed there were appropriate  power structures in the republic capable of taking control over  the situation and of settling all differences with Ingushetia.    According to Dzagoyev, who attended the rally together with  an official of the temporary administration, villagers of the  Prigorodny District would like these issues to be raised at the  republican parliament's next session shceduled for late March.    Meanwhile, North Ossetian President Askharbek Galazov met on  Wednesday the head of the temporary administration in North  Ossetia and Ingushetia, Vladimir Lozovoi. They discussed the  situation in the context of the current developments in the zone  under state of mergency rule.</p>

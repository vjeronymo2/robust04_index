			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT MUCH OF AN IMPROVEMENT  </P> <P> In the case of President Bush's campaign reform proposal, half a loaf is not  much better than none. While it has a few good points -- which are elements of  most reform plans -- the major thrust of his program would be to move the money  around, not get control of it. He claimed it was time to free the electoral  system from the grip of special interests. But his plan primarily would free it  from the grip of one set of special interests and deliver it into the grip of  another set of special interests.  </P> <P> And it certainly is not just coincidence that the proposal would help  Republicans and hurt Democrats. As Bush cracked the day before he revealed the  proposal: "Well, I have a good reason to want to lock out the status quo in  terms of control of the House or control of the Senate." Democrats dominate  both houses of Congress and incumbents tend to suffer from any reform program.  But the undisguised partisan overtones of the Bush plan would seem to doom it  from the outset from serious consideration.  </P> <P> For one, it would outlaw political action committees that are affiliated with  business and labor, but not those oriented toward an ideology or issue. Most  political observers believe there are more of this type of committee favoring  Republicans than Democrats. Even so, it would not be difficult for a trade  association committee, for instance, to reconstitute itself around an ideology  or issue.  </P> <P> The political action committee contribution limit would be reduced from $5,000  per candidate to $2,500. Another part of the plan would permit political  parties to contribute up to $150,000 to a congressional candidate's campaign,  about double the present limit, to reduce the amount of time a candidate must  devote to fund-raising. But this provision would not necessarily diminish  special-interest influence. The contribution would merely be somewhat more  indirect, and it would not be hard to draw a dotted line from the contributor  tothe congressman's campaign.  </P> <P> Even more dubious is Bush's plan for establish ing reapportionment criteria in  federal law, ostensibly in an effort to eliminate gerrymandering of  congressional districts to favor one party or the other. This would be done in  part by requiring geographically compact districts that cross city and county  boundary lines as little as possible. Such a proposal would infringe on an area  traditionally left to the states and the courts. And there are other valid  criteria for reapportionment that must be considered.  </P> <P> There are some excellent points in Bush's plan. As he proposed, there should be  a limit on an incumbent's ability to carry over unspent campaign funds from one  election to the next. The imposing campaign war chest is a nifty device for  scaring away potential challengers. Members of Congress, indeed, should get  higher pay in return for giving up outside income, such as speaking honoraria  that often are nothing more than legalized graft. There should be a limit on  the number of newsletters a member of Congress can send to constituents without  any postal charge, especially at campaign time.  </P> <P> The major flaw in the Bush plan, however, is that it does not put any limit on  how much a candidate can spend to get elected. Until that is done, incumbents  always will find a way to get a major financial advantage over challengers. If  the special interests want to get campaign money to incumbent candidates, they  will find a way. And the only way to avoid a First Amendment constitutional  problem with limiting campaign spending is to provide a measure of public  financing, such as now is done in the presidential primaries. A candidate would  have to qualify for public matching funds by pledging to abide by the limit and  by raising a certain amount himself, preferably in small amounts and preferably  in the district in which he is running.  </P></p>

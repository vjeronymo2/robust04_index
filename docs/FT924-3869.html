			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Law lords reject plea by don on job-for-life right THE RIGHT of university academics in England and Wales to tenure until retirement, even if appointed before the practice was made illegal in 1988, was undermined yesterday when the law lords refused to intervene in support of a lecturer made redundant on cost-cutting grounds. Mr Edgar Page, made redundant by Hull University in 1988, lost his appeal against the decision of the university's visitor - a law lord appointed on behalf of the Queen to review the case - to uphold the redundancy. The case has serious implications, since most of the 50,000 academic staff in the 'old' universities were appointed with tenure before 1987, from when the 1988 Education Act made it illegal. Those in the 'new' universities - former polytechnics - never had that right. Widespread redundancies are not likely, but the ruling makes cuts in academic staff an option for universities facing financial difficulties after the slowing of expansion announced by the government last month. Five law lords, headed by Lord Keith, dismissed the appeal from Mr Page, 61, whose case was backed by the Association of University Teachers. Mr Page, a former philosophy lecturer, was the first academic to be made compulsorily redundant. He had been in post for 22 years. Mr Page claimed that Hull's decision was unlawful because it was contrary to its own charter and statutes, which stated that staff could only be dismissed for incompetence or gross misconduct. The decision was upheld by the university's visitor in October 1989. It was quashed by the High Court after a judicial review, but the Court of Appeal upheld the university's case. Lord Browne-Wilkinson ruled that the courts had no power to overrule a visitor in his exercise of discretion within his jurisdiction under an institution's statutes. The visitor was not applying the general law of the land but a 'peculiar, domestic law' of which he was the sole arbiter. Mr John Akker, acting general secretary of the AUT, said he was 'profoundly disappointed' by the decision.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Panzhihua, December 30 (XINHUA) -- China is to step  up the exploitation of vanadium and titanium resources in its  southwestern part through absorbing more overseas funds and  technology.    The resources are concentrated in an area called Panzhihua  in  Sichuan Province. More funds will be poured into the renovation  project of an existing titanium separation plant, which is  capable of producing 100,000 tons of titanium concentrate a  year, and a titanium dioxide extraction plant.    By the year 2000 the annual output of titanium concentrate  will reach 300,000 tons and that of titanium dioxide, 25,000  tons. A high-grade titanium extraction plant will also be built  to further process the 300,000 tons of titanium concentrate into  100,000 tons of high-grade titanium slag, according to the  development blueprint.    In addition, more vanadium extraction plants will be built  by  the end of this century in a bid to produce 100,000 tons of  vanadium slag and 22,000 tons of vanadium pentoxide a year.    Qin Wanxiang, mayor of Panzhihua, told XINHUA that the city  is co-operating with some domestic research institutes to study  ways to extract from tailings scandium, which, like vanadium and  titanium, is widely used in the space, electronics,  petrochemical and medical industries.    Statistics show that more than 20 million tons of vanadium,  or 63 percent of China's total reserves, and 890 million tons of  titanium, or 93 percent of China's total titanium reserves, are  located in the Panzhihua area.    The vanadium deposit is the third-largest and that of  titanium is the largest in the world.    Twenty-eight years of construction have made Panzhihua a  medium- sized city and the largest metallurgical center in  southwest China. Products including high-grade iron and steel,  vanadium slag and titanium concentrate have been exported to  Japan, Southeast Asia and Europe.    However, due to the small scale of technology and investment  so far, the utilization of vanadium and titanium is still in the  primary stage, according to the mayor. The products are mainly  sold as low-grade raw materials and the production capacity is  low.    Qin said that the Ertan hydroelectric power station on the  Yalong river, which is expected to be completed by the year  2000, will provide sufficient electricity for the new  development plan.</p>

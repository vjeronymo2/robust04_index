			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko under "Ukraine" rubric: "There </F> Is Simply Ukraine; The Former Minister of Defense Criticizes the  Policies of Official Kiev"]    [Text] The round table on the problems of the national  security and military policy of Ukraine that was prepared by the  "Elections-94" press center essentially turned into a press  conference for one of the candidates for people's deputy, former  Minister of Defense Colonel-General Konstantin Morozov, whose  ratings are rather high after he left his post on account of  disagreement with President Leonid Kravchuk on many questions of  current interest.    In responding to the question of Russia's claims to a  special  role in the post-Union territory, Konstantin Morozov declared  that Moscow has no basis for this and, moreover, without the  sanction of the UN cannot perform the role of peacemaker  utilizing its armed forces. In the words of Konstantin Morozov,  the military conflict in the Dniester Region arose largely  precisely because of the presence of the 14th Russian Army there  and "they drew Georgia into the CIS because of a military  conflict." Konstantin Morozov declared that he supports the  demand for the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from  foreign territories and that in his possible action as a deputy  he will never allow Ukrainian forces to participate in  operations in hot spots without UN permission. And in general,  with respect to the resolution of the delicate problems in  interrelations between former allied republics, Konstantin  Morozov called on everyone to "get used to the fact that there  is no longer a territory of the former USSR and there is no  young, sovereign, or some other Ukraine, but simply the  independent state Ukraine."    Konstantin Morozov said that he supports Ukraine's signing  the Lisbon Protocol to the START-1 Treaty because this would  allow it, along with Russia, to be a full participant in the  world process of nuclear disarmament and to be a country  responsible for destroying its share of nuclear weapons. The  only mistake of the Ukrainian leadership, in the words of the  general, is the fact that it did not define the new status of  Ukraine, with which it must join the Nuclear Weapons  Nonproliferation Treaty. In his opinion, Ukraine must join with  a special declaration of its support of the idea of the  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons on the planet and the  control of their transfer to third countries, and it must define  its status as a "temporary nuclear state that is reducing its  share of nuclear weapons from the former USSR."    In this connection, Konstantin Morozov spoke out in favor of  the establishment of an international commission to monitor the  dismantling of the nuclear weapons removed from Ukraine, because  "Ukraine really does not have full assurance that the missiles  will be destroyed rather than redistributed."    The former minister of defense also made a number of other  comments differing from the point of view of official Kiev. In  particular, he criticized the trilateral Moscow declaration,  calling it a "naked declaration that does not even guarantee the  political interests of Ukraine." In the opinion of Morozov, it  is necessary to sign a trilateral agreement that would be  subject to ratification in the parliaments of the three  countries and that would provide for international control of  its fulfillment by them. It should be noted that this is perhaps  the most widespread point of view in Ukraine, which finds a  large number of supporters in different political and military  circles.    Touching on the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, Konstantin  Morozov stated that he supports any solution of the problem of  the Black Sea Fleet, whether it be a gift, a transfer to Russia,  or division and destruction, but under one mandatory condition  -- the removal of the Fleet and its infrastructure from  Ukrainian territory. In his opinion, the most advantageous  solution for Ukraine is the 1992 Yalta agreement on the division  of the Black Sea Fleet into Ukrainian and Russian parts and the  establishment of naval forces of Ukraine and Russia on this  basis. At the same time, Konstantin Morozov declared that the  military forces of Ukraine are adequate to resolve the problem  of the Black Sea Fleet in favor of Ukraine, but "these forces  must not be the basic argument; rather it is necessary to seek  political solutions for every question." Konstantin Morozov also  said that he supported a political solution with respect to the  Crimean problem, which he called artificial and produced by the  political passivity of official Kiev. In the opinion of Morozov,  Kiev must pass laws that would first stabilize the situation in  the Crimea and then would make Crimean legislation correspond to  that of Ukraine.</p>

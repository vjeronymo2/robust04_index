			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA April 15 -- The Hoa Binh Hydro-Electric  Plant, the largest in Vietnam, has reached its full designed  output of 1,920 mw [megawatts], with the launching of its eight  and last turbine on Thursday morning. Construction of the plant  was started on November 6, 1979, with assistance from the former  Soviet Union, and is continued with the help of the Russian  Federation. Since the first turbine became operational in  December 1988, the plant straddling the Black River west of  Hanoi, has supplied the country with 17.15 billion kwh [kilowatt  hours]. Last year's output was 4.73 billion kwh, or 45 [as  received] of the national output. The big ceremony held for the  completion of the last turbine was attended, among other ranking  officials, by Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong and visiting  Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov. Prime Minister Vo  Van Kiet also sent his congratulations to all the workers and  specialists who have taken part in building this historic  project. Finishing touches are being made to the plant, which  is to be officially opened in September.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Some 1.93 million  people have found jobs through market competition in this  capital city of northeast China's Liaoning Province.    According to Wang Dezhou, who is in charge of the city's  labor affairs, Shenyang now has 303 intermediary organizations  bridging labor supply and demand.    Wang said that in recent years job agencies in the city have  received a total of 2.27 million job applicants.    He said the agencies have so far helped find jobs for  260,000  jobless people, redeployed 170,000 redundant workers,  transferred 280,000 technicians and found re-employment for  690,000 retired workers.    This largest industrial center in northeast China has  granted  enterprises autonomy in hiring and firing workers.    The implementation of the contract system has helped nurture  a more rationalized employment mechanism that reflects labor  market supply and demand. Meanwhile, the minimum wage system  has also been introduced in the city, the official said.    He said the mobility of technical workers has eased a  conflict between the structure of industries and the make-up of  the work force, as well as unleashed a freer flow of technology.</p>

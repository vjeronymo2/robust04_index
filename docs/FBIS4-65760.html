			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nizamettin Toguc and Felemez Basboga, </F> members of the pro-Kurdish Turkish Party of Democracy, by  unidentified correspondent in Brussels; date not given: "Real  Separatism Is Practiced by the Turkish State" -- interviewees  are not identified in the text]    [Text] Five deputies of the DEP (Party of Democracy), a  pro-Kurdish Turkish party that has undergone a series of  metamorphoses, have been stripped of their positions and  arrested for "separatism." They are liable to appear before the  State Security Court, which can pronounce death sentences.  Deputy Nizamettin Toguc and Felemez Basboga, a member of the  DEP Central Committee, recently made a stopover in Brussels.  They gave their explanations:    If the State Security Court decided to ban the DEP, the (17  -- LA LIBRE BELGIQUE editor's note) deputies of the party will  be dismissed and arrested, as will most of the leaders. Several  files have already been opened with regard to their statements  on Kurdistan and democracy. The party's property will be  seized. The constitution specifies that, when a party is  banned, its deputies cannot engage in politics for 10 years.  This constitution was drawn up in 1980, following the military  coup d'etat. It is still in force.  <H5>  Money </H5>   [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] This is the fourth time you have  reformed  the party. That must be costly. Where does the money come  from? There is often talk of a revolutionary tax...    [DEP Official] We have been supported by the people, without  any other support. We have not forced anybody. In Turkey,  there are also rich Kurds, but even those who are not rich give  their support to the parties which are fighting for liberation.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] The DEP is being prosecuted for  separatism.    [DEP Official] The real separatism is practiced by the  Turkish state. Turkey is led by the military. That is why it  does not recognize any minority, no other people, no other  culture. Our party wants democracy, fraternity, and respect for  human rights.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Is fraternity synonymous with  federation,  or confederation?    [DEP Official] The important thing, when we talk of  fraternity, is that everybody should be able to express  themselves freely. Fraternity means equality. If everybody  could express themselves freely, we could talk of federation or  confederation, a different system in which peoples can live  fraternally, in full equality.  <H5>  Cover </H5>   [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Could the question be: Do you want to be  independent?    [DEP Official] Independence is not our objective as a party.  It is for the people to choose, not us.    [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] It is sometimes said that the DEP serves  as a cover for the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan], which is  waging an armed struggle against Ankara.    [DEP Official] There are many things that the PKK does and  that we do too, but not together. The PKK is acting to show the  will of the population living in this region, and that is what  we are doing too. There are similarities between us, but the  DEP is not a cover for or a section of the PKK. We are fighting  in a legal and democratic way. Unfortunately, we are being  prevented from doing that. Armed struggle is one method. As  the Party of Democracy, we cannot say we are for or against the  armed struggle.    If there was a means of struggling legally and  democratically, I think that even the PKK would not wage an  armed struggle. But, as you can see, we cannot wage a  democratic struggle. Many Kurds are taking up arms, and this is  not surprising.  <H5>  Changing the Rationale </H5>   [LA LIBRE BELGIQUE] Is there a solution?    [DEP Official] The Turkish Government must stop its war  against people who are demanding their rights. We need a  political and democratic solution. Instead of spending so much  on the war, this money should be devoted to investment in  Kurdistan. But the Turkish Government is headed by military  leaders and that is why it insists on waging war in Kurdistan.  If the Turkish Government does not change its policy and  persists in this military rationale, the republic of Turkey will  disappear. If the war continues, it will not be separation but  the destruction of the Turkish state. The Turkish budget for  1993 was 394 trillion Turkish pounds, but the money spent on the  war was 400 trillion. If this continues, Turkey will be in a  complete blind alley economically.</p>

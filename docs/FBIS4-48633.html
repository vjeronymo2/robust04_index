			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 22 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist  Congress [PAC] said on Sunday there was no reason to believe  that King Goodwill Zwelithini would abuse his powers regarding  the Ingonyama [King's] Land Trust. PAC economic director Sipho  Shabalala said in a statement that "the land is to be held in  trust for the born and unborn citizens" of South Africa.    He said the transfer of land to the Ingonyama trust did not  represent the privatisation of land, which the PAC rejected.</p>

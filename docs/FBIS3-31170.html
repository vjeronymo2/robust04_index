Early on Wednesday [9 February] morning at a meeting with  Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik, allegedly "a call was born,  which will probably grow into a 16-member platform," the paper  says.    "Two sources have told us independently that it was a  declaration about two and a half pages long, in which the  members of the alternative announce their desire for a broad  coalition without the participation of the top members of  political parties and movements. They consider this solution a  temporary one, because they are counting on an agreement on  early elections being called next year," NARODNA OBRODA writes.    The call was preceded by Friday's [4 February] summoning of  deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac by Slovak Prime Minister and  HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar, who accused him of proceeding  incorrectly during the parliamentary crisis in organizing the  active participation of several deputies' groups in parliament.  Reservations concerning Kovac and Moravcik were heard at the  HZDS on Monday [7 February], the paper notes.    An alternative program within the governing movement did not  have to radically influence the change in the balance of power  in parliament. "Nor can it be ruled out that the new platform  will continue to vote in unison with the coalition and the  balance between the HZDS and the opposition, a pair of horses,  will be preserved," the paper writes.    At the same time, though, the declaration in favor of a  wider  coalition without top party members and in favor of early  election is an "indirect declaration by part of the movement of  lack of confidence in the methods and style of Prime Minister  Vladimir Meciar's work," the paper believes.    "The clash of these two conceptions could end with the  faction's defeat at a party assembly, but the snowball effect in  the HZDS could also bury its leader under an avalanche," says  NARODNA OBRODA.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHERE HAVE ALL THE LEADERS GONE?;  </P> <P> THE PEOPLE HAVE REPLACED THEM  </P> <P> American democracy, 1990:  </P> <P>  -- In California, the people vote to lessen the power of the men and women who  represent them in the Legislature by limiting the time they can serve.  </P> <P>  -- In New Jersey, the governor answers pleas for leadership by producing laws  and funding to improve the state's worst schools -- and destroys himself in the  process.  </P> <P>  -- In Washington, the two most recent chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  warn members of Congress that the country should avoid war because the military  cannot do what Americans want done.  </P> <P> All these events illustrate a breakdown of old-fashioned authority. That is the  way democracy works in Post-Leadership America.  </P> <P> This seems to be what Americans have been waiting for -- the chance to really  try government by the people. It is not a question of initiative and  referendum, California-style, although these blunt weapons are being used  against politicians wherever possible. Rather, it is a question of more and  more people wanting to exercise power themselves rather than delegating it to  elected or anointed betters.  </P> <P> Gridlock in Washington? People love it. If "they" fight among themselves, maybe  they'll leave "us" alone.  </P> <P> I have never really believed that Americans wanted "Leadership!" no matter how  many demands for such mystical guidance I have heard in conversations and read  in polls. It is like "family values." We talk about them so much because we  don't have them. We are a nation of leavers, greatly preferring individual  freedom and mobility to shared obligation since the days we left home and  family in the Old World.  </P> <P> "Government is best that governs least" goes back at least to Thomas Jefferson.  And we have lived for more than 200 years under a Constitution that  deliberately divides powers into branches, even twigs. When anyone of us says  "leadership," we mean leadership by someone who agrees with us, or leadership  that leads less.  </P> <P> Obviously, the nation has accepted leadership in war and peace, and in other  things, too. But that acceptance was often grudging and usually based on the  resigned assumption that "they," our leaders, knew something the rest of us did  not. Now, more and more Americans no longer believe that -- or are sure of it.  More mobility, the communications revolution, particularly satellite television  transmission, better education or, at least, more knowledge and national  street-smarts, all are persuading many Americans that maybe we do know more  than we thought we did. Or our leaders know less.  </P> <P> What the people know and when they know it is the engine that drives the  politics of a democracy. And control of the flow of information has been the  greatest of presidential powers this century. But now, all of us and each of us  know more and know it sooner.  </P> <P> It is not only politicians who are finding that the half-lives of leadership  seem to get shorter and shorter. That deterioration has been partly offset by a  lowering of the standards by which leadership is judged. President Harry S.  Truman's definition -- "Leadership is the ability to get men to do what they  don't want to do and like it" -- has been transformed along the slippery slope  of recent years to being interviewed by Ted Koppel or getting on the cover of a  newsmagazine with a headline that indicates you seem to know what you're doing  -- at least for now.  </P> <P> As power and fame come together, some future Andy Warhol will be able to to say  that each American will be the leader for 15 minutes. Among the heroic leaders  whose time passed this year were Lee Iacocca and Donald Trump. These two  salesmen were defined as important, as daring and competent, in apposition to  indecisive and evasive politicians. Iacocca and Trump were, in a sense, empty  vessels filled by many -- especially editors and other professional worriers --  to make a point about the decline of political leadership.  </P> <P> But it seems that empty vessels are exactly what people want. What used to be  called "being all things to all men" is being transformed into "being all  things to me -- for now." Leadership as wine-tasting.  </P> <P> As Americans in the lonely crowd struggle to define themselves by wearing a  Rolex or driving a Jeep or reading Vanity Fair, they can also attach themselves  to political (or cultural) symbols -- Jesse Helms or Jesse Jackson, Jerry  Falwell or Jerry Brown, Bill Cosby or Bart Simpson. The symbols come and they  go. What they say or do, if they do anything at all of significance, is not the  important thing.  </P> <P> It's not as if they're Milli Vanilli, and people are going to check on whether  or not this is lip-synching. In Post-Leadership America, those who once were  followers now have greater choice: They can define and re-define themselves  just as politicians always have, in the land of the free and the home of the  brave, phony resume.  </P> <P> Americans are trying to lead themselves by switching symbols, styles, channels  or venues.  </P> <P> Jim Florio, the governor of New Jersey, provided a lesson in why, given a  choice, politicians prefer to let political consumers do with them what they  will. Leaving aside the question of whether or not Florio deliberately misled  the people about his intentions, within weeks of taking office he announced  that the state was in real trouble and he was going to do something about it.  </P> <P> He said that the books were cooked, that phony numbers and other political  accounting tricks had been used to hide billions of dollars in debt. Worse, the  new governor said, schools in New Jersey's cities and poor rural areas were  turning out functional illiterates, many of them dangerously anti-social.  </P> <P> So, he pushed through legislation raising state income taxes on families making  more than $80,000 a year and shifting revenues from prosperous suburban school  districts to the poor schools.  </P> <P> That might be called leadership. But that was not one of the words that leaped  from the lips of Jersey's voting classes.  </P> <P> The message for more traditional contemporary politicians was summarized by the  senior U.S. senator from Florio's state, Bill Bradley. Asked how he intended to  deal with the Florio furor, he replied: Stay out of the state.  </P> <P> Getting involved with leadership was the last thing on Bradley's mind. It might  be contagious. And that is how it will be.  </P> <P> Military matters are one area in which political leaders have had some recent  success in controlling the flow of information to the people they are leading  -- by cutting it off totally for short periods of time. In blacking out almost  all information for two or three days in the invasions of Grenada and Panama,  the government developed (or stumbled into) an essentially psychological  strategy that neutralized public reaction by, in effect, launching a surprise  attack on the American people. In the controlled confusion at home, the  government was able to substitute feelings for facts about less controlled  confusion in the field.  </P> <P> But rising public doubt and disenchantment about the Administration's gulf  policy reveals the limits of information containment over time. It also shows  the wisdom of President Bush's strategy of sharing power and responsibility  from the start with other countries and the United Nations. The only place Bush  did not feel compelled to deal at first was in the U.S. Congress. Members made  it perfectly clear that they had not the slightest intention of saying or doing  anything until orders came up from the public.  </P> <P> Legislative bodies are like that, often inert, desperately turning leadership  over to the courts when the going gets rough on issues. This time, the crudest  declarations of Post-Leadership politics were Democratic senators and  representatives who said they would only speak out after body bags starting  coming back to their constituencies.  </P> <P> If the President manages to come off looking like a determined and effective  leader in his confrontation with Saddam Hussein -- perceived victory at costs  acceptable to the American people -- that will almost certainly be because he  accepted the limits or the leadership conceived by these same people. If he  misunderstands or violates the limits -- if he is capable of exerting  old-fashioned leadership -- he could not only find himself in a larger version  of the Florio fix, destined for electoral defeat in 1992, but for impeachment  talk in 1991.  </P> <P> That kind of reaction is greatly speeded up now but it is not entirely new, and  I don't believe it is a passing thing. Americans, individually, have always  wanted to run things themselves and have been encouraged in that by the  rhetoric and conviction of government governing least. Now, new mechanisms have  provided more information -- and with it a certain individual confidence, or  arrogance -- putting more of the levers of knowledge and power within the reach  of most of the people, most of the time. More and more people are trying to  beat the system. Or, the system, the Republic is being made new before our  eyes.  </P> <P> Political "leaders" can deal with that. Dealing is what they do, so long as  part of the deal is their own reelection. And now even that may be in question  in California -- and, soon enough, in the rest of Post-Leadership America,  governed by the people for themselves.  </P></p>

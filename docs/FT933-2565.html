			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Closed-end Vietnam fund meets with strong demand DEMAND for a new closed-end fund which invests in Vietnam has exceeded expectations, reflecting the growing international interest in a fast-growing Asian economy. The Beta Viet Nam Fund has raised Dollars 65m through the placing of 1.3m units, well above its target of Dollars 50m. Before its launch, the only quoted vehicle for investment in the country was the Vietnam fund. Both funds are listed in Dublin. Mr Peter Scott, chief executive of Beta Funds, which specialises in investing in emerging markets, said around 20 per cent of the units were bought by Swiss, Scandinavian and Malaysian companies looking for an exploratory investment. The remainder was bought by institutions. In the event of the US lifting its economic embargo against Vietnam, the fund will be reopened in order to satisfy demand from US investors, Mr Scott said. US companies are barred from investing directly in Vietnam and can only participate in development projects which are funded by international financial institutions, such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund. The immediate aim of the Beta Viet Nam Fund is to invest in joint ventures that are likely to get a stock market listing in the future. The long-term objective of the fund is to devote its investment to listed companies. For example, the fund is thought to be involved in a joint venture which will build and operate a new international passenger terminal at Noi Bai Airport in Hanoi.</p>

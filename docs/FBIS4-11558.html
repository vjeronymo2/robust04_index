			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 Apr (EFE) -- It was reported today  that the businesses and investments of Argentina, Brazil,  Paraguay, and Uruguay -- which make up Mercosur [Common Market  of the South] -- are concentrated in one fourth of the regional  integration project's vast territory.    According to a survey conducted by the Deloitte, Touch, and  Simonsen Associates company of Buenos Aires, 250 enterprises and  financial companies with important businesses within Mercosur  are concentrating their main activities in Brazil and Argentina.    The analysts confirmed that the "real Mercosur," the most  interesting entrepreneurial area due to its economic potential,  involves 110 million inhabitants with an average income of  $5,000 per year.    The "real Mercosur" has a GDP of some $550 billion, compared  with the $726 billion of the complete territory of the four  member countries which have a total population of 198 million  persons.    The area where there is the greatest business interest has  the form of a stylized S with the apex in Belo Horizonte  (Brazil), while its other point is in the Argentine province of  Mendoza on the border with Chile.    This includes all of Uruguay, two thirds of Paraguay -- on  its borders with Argentina and Brazil -- and the wealthier  regions of Brazil and Argentina.    The centers that have a very large economic potential  include  Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Curitiba in Brazil; Buenos Aires,  Cordoba, and Rosario in Argentina; Montevideo in Uruguay; and  Asuncion and Ciudad del Este in Paraguay.    The trade exchange (exports plus imports) among Mercosur  partners has increased by 34.7 percent per year since 1991, when  the agreement went into effect.    According to the study, the increase in regional trade  between 1987 and 1990 amounted to 16.5 percent.    Regional trade increased from $5.403 billion in 1991 to  $10.257 in 1993, a period when Argentina overcame an economic  crisis and when market ups and downs, which continue, began in  Brazil.    Of the 250 companies that do most of the business deals  within Mercosur, 44 percent are small and medium sized  companies; 33 percent are large companies -- mostly Brazilian  and Argentine; and the other 23 percent are multinationals.    According to a poll of the businessmen involved,  manufactured  products and services represent 55 percent of the business deals  within Mercosur.    Some 17 percent of businessmen installed new industrial  plants in another country in the heat of the integration wave.    Some 10 percent opted for the opening of commercial offices  in another country, and 7 percent decided to purchase or form a  partnership with a neighbor.    The manufacture of vehicles and the financial and insurance  services -- with 23 and 21 percent of the market respectively --  account for the majority of the investment.    The manufacture of capital assets (machinery and tools),  with  13 percent of the market, and the production of food and  beverages, with 12 percent, must also be highlighted.    Mercosur will become a free trade zone as of 1995 when all  customs barriers will be lifted. There will be a 1-year grace  period for the products that are protected by Uruguay and  Paraguay.</p>

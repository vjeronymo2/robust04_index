			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Education programme at Ford improves industrial relations AN EDUCATION programme at Ford has significantly improved industrial relations at the motor company, according to senior managers and union leaders. Mr Jack Adams, deputy general secretary of the TGWU general union and the senior Ford negotiator, said the Education and Development Assistance Programme (EDAP) had been responsible for keeping last year's pay talks to one day - the first time this had happened for many years. Last year was also the first year in which no strike threat was made. EDAP, in which Ford pays up to Pounds 200 a year for each employee's after-work education, is run by local committees on which union and management representatives have an equal say. In the magazine of the Involvement and Participation Association, Mr Adams says union-management co-operation on the project had caused 'suspicions on both sides to diminish'. EDAP, which was set up in 1988, allows employees to study any subjects except those which have a direct bearing on their jobs. Mr John Hougham, Ford's personnel director, told the magazine: 'We have had experience of working together, of learning together, of co-ownership, of joint acceptance of responsibility, of actually sharing an enormous enthusiasm for what we are achieving.' A report by the Ruskin College Trade Union Research Unit emphasises that EDAP has not only improved union-management relations but also the relations between employees themselves. It adds that the company will benefit from easier recruitment and retention and concludes that EDAP is a model of what 'social partnership' could achieve.</p>

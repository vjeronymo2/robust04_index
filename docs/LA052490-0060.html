			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> AN EXPLORATION OF HISTORY AND OF THE HUMAN SOUL;  </P> <P> THE PRINCESS AND THE DRAGON BY ROBERTO PAZZI TRANSLATED FROM ITALIAN BY M.J.  FITZGERALD ALFRED A. KNOPF $18.95, 160 PAGES  </P> <P> The fall of the Romanov dynasty, and the death of Czar Nicholas II and his  family in the Bolshevik Revolution, have given Roberto Pazzi a vantage point  for his sustained exploration of history and the human soul. For this subtle  and poetic Italian novelist, the two are intricately joined. History expresses  our conscious and unconscious lives, and shapes them.  </P> <P> Pazzi's history has a pliability of a dream; and both "Searching for the  Emperor," published here last year, and his new "The Princess and the Dragon"  move on the dreams and illusions of marginal, half-invented historical figures.  Beyond dreamer and dream is something that moves both and that we never see.  Pazzi is partly a religious writer, and perhaps this explains why he chooses  the Romanovs for his fictions.  </P> <P> To his subjects, the czar was the promise that God would be with them.  Possessing no extraordinary vision or talents, the Romanovs had to be the  narrow and not especially well-made containment vessel for two mighty and  unmanageable forces: God and the Russian people.  </P> <P> The dream machine in "Searching for the Emperor" was a White Russian regiment  that wandered for years in Siberia, imagining that it was on the way to save an  emperor still in power. In the new book, it is Nicholas' brother, George, an  invalid prince confined on an estate by the Black Sea. Nicholas, ruling in St.  Petersburg, wears the Romanov power, but George wears its divine authority.  Divine authority proclaims that the dynasty is ill. In 1899, in the gardens of  Livadia, George is prophet and pioneer of that illness. He is there to sleep --  the book ends with his final sleep -- before the dynasty does; to dream its  past and future; and to be the prisoner waiting for death that Nicholas would  become 20 years later.  </P> <P> Pazzi, who writes with a delicacy that is sweet and pungent by turns, describes  the waking moments of a prince whose sensibility was so fine that Pope Leo XIII  declared that he was more fit to be a Pope than a king. Half free, half not --  Prince Ourousov, his chamberlain, is a spy for Nicholas -- he moves uneasily  against the burden of being royal.  </P> <P> Getting dressed -- putting on royalty -- is agony. In St. Petersburg, Nicholas  wears his uniforms as a sign "of everything that was sacred in that immense and  savage land." In Livadia, George's narrow wrists tremble against the cuffs of  his dressing gown. "To dress for others seemed to him among the most real  causes of his disease; he was aware that his waking led to an inevitable,  perfectly rehearsed series of actions on the part of a dozen or so people in  some wing of the palace."  </P> <P> He plans, futilely, to escape to France where his cousin, Helen, is living.  Their love is frowned upon by the czar; Helen is vital, alive, rebellious and  free of history. Once, at a time when they were together, Helen watched his  restless sleeping and reflected: "My love, what an effort History is for you."  </P> <P> George's dreams of escape have him practice to pack everything he values in a  single suitcase. History is not portable, though. His responsibilities as  dreamer are too heavy for personal happiness. He moves to another estate in the  mountains of Georgia. There, he begins the long series of visions that form the  second half of the book.  </P> <P> In company with Ourousov, he becomes a world and time traveler. He visits  broken dynasties: Napoleon in St. Helena, Louis XVI at his beheading, the court  of a Chinese emperor who has run off to find a fabled valley -- it is in  Georgia, according to legend -- where death cannot find him. He moves forward  to 1938 and tries to obtain his death certificate from an agitated Soviet  bureaucrat.  </P> <P> The slyly sinister figure of Ourousov swells to monstrous proportions. Someone  calls him "the Creature" at one point. At another, an old cardinal recognizes  him and recoils. If George is the dreamer of history, Ourousov is perhaps  history itself. Visiting the dying Empress Catherine, he informs her that his  creatures will eventually rule. In the Georgia mountains, he produces two  monstrous shapes and introduces them to George. They are, or will be, Stalin  and Brezhnev.  </P> <P> Like "Searching for the Emperor," "The Princess and the Dragon" balances  suggestiveness and a breathtaking symbolic grace upon a knife-edge of  obscurity. In this case, the obscurity prevails more often, and the essentially  static setting -- in contrast to the entranced wandering of the Siberian  regiment -- makes us more aware of it. Here, the wandering tends to be  reflection rather than reflection in action. The result can be arid even as it  stretches and astonishes us.  </P> <P> Next: Elaine Kendall reviews "The Road to the City" by Natalia Ginzburg.  </P></p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / The Personal Pensions Time Bomb: Thousands pay dearly for company agents' poor advice - Questions have been raised about personal-pension sales techniques and the role of regulatory bodies in monitoring this. FT writers use case studies to illustrate the plight of those affected, and report on measures taken by leading groups in the sector to remedy the shortcomings Brian Belk is fed up. Having switched into a personal pension six years ago from his occupational scheme, Mr Belk said: 'It seemed a good idea at the time. But I would have been better off staying where I was.' He is one of  1/2 m or more people who have moved out of occupational pensions into personal schemes since legislation to allow this was introduced in 1988. The 42-year-old former mineworker was sold his pension by Mr Wayne Rose, a sales representative at Britannic Assurance's office in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Mr Belk said he had been considering opting out of his British Coal occupational scheme because he thought he might get a better deal elsewhere. Mr Rose was a natural person for him to talk to, as he had been a colleague at Bentley colliery near Doncaster until 1985. Mr Belk worked there until last March when his leg was fractured in an accident which has needed extensive treatment. After eight months' sick leave he was made redundant when the pit closed. Had Mr Belk stayed in the mineworkers' pension scheme, his injury might have proved bad enough to enable him to leave mining on the grounds of ill health. In this case, according to Mr Belk's calculations which British Coal said seem accurate, he would have been eligible for a pension of about Pounds 100 a week, with a Pounds 15,000 lump sum. Opting out appears to have cost Mr Belk a lot. By his normal retirement age he would have been paid about Pounds 130,000. But the Britannic scheme has no provision for early payment for ill-health. When he was made redundant he got a one-off sum of Pounds 26,000 from British Coal. Mr Belk said the possible snags to opting out were not properly explained at the time: 'I feel Wayne should have told me more about the disadvantages of leaving the miners' scheme. In my view he didn't give me the best advice.' Mr Rose said he did not want to discuss Mr Belk's case, but Mr Brian Shaw, Britannic's general manager, said the case was one of 'about 12' which the company was investigating with a view to a possible transfer back to the original occupational scheme. He said: 'It was not our practice to encourage people to opt out (of occupational schemes). With hindsight we probably gave (Mr Belk) poor advice.' Cases such as Mr Belk's illustrate the controversy about some of the methods used to sell personal pensions and whether the companies involved had full knowledge of their sales agents' activities, especially when personal-pension sales took off in the late 1980s. There have also been questions about the extent to which the main industry regulatory bodies - including the Securities and Investments Board, the Lautro insurance industry watchdog and Fimbra, which regulates independent financial advisers - have controlled the activities of individual sales agents. About 150,000 people in the UK sell personal-investment products including pensions on behalf of more than 5,000 companies. The pensions industry distinguishes between opt-outs - involving people such as Mr Belk who moved into a personal pension while continuing to work for a specific employer - and pension transfers which have been far more common. Pension transfers take place when a person shifts his or her benefits from an occupational scheme into a personal scheme after leaving an employer. Industry estimates put the number of opt-outs since 1988 at between 5,000 and 30,000. In contrast there have been  1/2 m or more pension transfers. The total value of all opt-outs and transfers is put at about Pounds 6bn. Many big pension companies say they have never encouraged opt-outs because, assuming people remain in employment, they are invariably better off staying in an occupational scheme where the employer makes a substantial contribution to overall benefits. The merits of pension transfers for employees are, on the other hand, more difficult to assess. As an employer is no longer contributing to his or her benefits a personal pension may be more attractive. A KPMG Peat Marwick study in December for SIB found that in nine out of 10 cases where people had transferred into a personal pension from an occupational pension there was no evidence that sales agents had met regulators' standards. In more than one in three cases, the files suggested that suspect advice had been given. The exact number of people who received poor advice when switching pensions  -either through opt-outs or transfers - should become clear this summer when SIB completes an inquiry into the issue. Preliminary industry estimates put the likely figure at between 20,000 and 100,000. Estimates for the cost to the industry of compensating people who have suffered from poor advice vary widely, from Pounds 100m to Pounds 1bn. The cost will depend on how easy and costly it is to reinstate people into occupational schemes. The biggest companies in the transfer business include Prudential, with about 80,000 cases, and Allied Dunbar, Legal &amp; General, Pearl, Lloyds Abbey Life and TSB each with an estimated 50,000 cases. Sun Alliance and Britannic have arranged about 30,000 each, National Westminster Bank about 25,000, Scottish Amicable 18,000 and Barclays about 12,000. Most of these companies also have arranged some opt-outs but the figures are much smaller. Mr Jon Minchin, managing director of Surrey-based Pensionline, which gives independent advice on pensions, said there was significant mis-selling of personal pensions in 1988 and 1989, mostly where companies gave people in occupational schemes an over-optimistic view of possible benefits from opting out. Mr Minchin said: 'Lots of companies came into the market to take advantage of the change (in legislation in 1988). They thought Christmas had come twice: it was a marvellous way to make money. The government created a market and then failed to regulate it properly.' An Allied Dunbar official said 'complexities' in the pension transfer business had come to light in the past few years. 'If we'd known then what we know now we would have approached the issue of training the sales force differently, we would have brought more things directly to their attention.' L&amp;G said: 'In the past couple of years we have put the right mechanisms in place to ensure that the best advice is given. But as to what was going on in 1987-92, God only knows.' In 1992 TSB set up a special pensions unit, separate from the sales force, to consider appropriate transfer values in these cases. It said: 'Initially we wanted to focus the skill base; we realised the sales force was not always addressing the right issues.' The case of Mr Paul Ruthven, 32, a tyre builder with Goodyear in Wolverhampton, illustrates the point. In 1987 he opted out of the Goodyear occupational scheme, taking a personal pension with TSB. He said: 'The TSB agent advised me that when I retired I would be better off in the TSB scheme than if I stayed with Goodyear. Because he was an easy sort of bloke I trusted him.' Last year, when Mr Ruthven told TSB he was unhappy with his pension, it agreed to transfer him back to the Goodyear scheme, and paid Pounds 7,500 to the scheme to make up for lost benefits. TSB said it accepted that in this case poor advice had been given. It is not hard to find reasons why agents sometimes give the wrong advice. Most are paid by results, and the pressures can be very great. One salesman, who asked not to be named, said he worked for three years until 1992 as an agent with Acuma, a seller of personal finance products including pensions that up to last year was owned by American Express. It is now part of the United Friendly insurance company. The agent worked in Redhill with about 12 other sales men and women, part of Acuma's total sales staff of 300. 'We described ourselves as salaried employees, but you got your salary only if you met specific sales targets. I was told I would be paid Pounds 1,000 a month, but I realised soon after starting that to earn this I had to to sell around Pounds 3,000 worth of business, amounting to seven or so pensions or similar products. If you didn't meet the target, you owed the company money on the salary you had been paid but hadn't earned.' He added: 'Some colleagues ran up large debts. The average time a salesman lasted while I was there was six months. Acuma said all its 300 agents were technically qualified and 'doing a good job'. It had no figures on the average length of time sales people stayed with the company. The Redhill office had been closed and practices there might not have represented what happened across the company.</p>

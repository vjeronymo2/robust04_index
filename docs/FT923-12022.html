			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Transamerica plans to drop non-life insurance TRANSAMERICA, the San Francisco-based financial services group, plans to pull out of the property-casualty insurance business. The company said yesterday it had called in Morgan Stanley and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, two Wall Street investment banking firms, to advise on the disposal of its non-life insurance division. Transamerica added that it would consider either selling the operation, 'demerging' it through a free distribution of shares in the insurance division to Transamerica shareholders, or floating the business on the stock market. The news sent Transamerica's shares sharply higher in a plunging stock market; in late trading the shares were Dollars  7/8 higher at Dollars 45 3/8 . Transamerica's insurance group is based in Woodland Hills, California, and ranks as the 27th largest property-casualty insurer in the US, in terms of net written premiums. It made after-tax profits of Dollars 63m in 1991, including investment gains of Dollars 6m. Its revenues were Dollars 2.2bn, and assets stood at Dollars 4.6bn. However, the subsidiary increased reserves in the second quarter, mainly to back its workers' compensation and entertainment insurance operations. Because of this, it is expected to make an operating loss of Dollars 40m in the second quarter. Transamerica said the move would allow it to concentrate on 'less cyclical, higher-returning finance and life insurance activities'. 'We face demands for increased capital to support growth in many of our businesses,' said Mr Frank Herringer, chief executive. 'In view of these demands, we have elected to focus our resources on our life insurance and finance businesses.' Transamerica added that it did not expect to realise any significant gain or loss on the disposal. The remaining operations have assets of about Dollars 30bn, and made after-tax profits of Dollars 71m in the first quarter. The company said its continuing operations should also have a strong second quarter, more than doubling the Dollars 43.6m reported in the same period of 1991.</p>

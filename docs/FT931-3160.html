			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Bundesbank cautious over rates: Solidarity pact welcome but not reason enough for cut, says Issing LAST weekend's solidarity agreement between the German government and opposition was a positive development, but not a reason in itself for easing interest rates, Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the Bundesbank's directorate said yesterday. Monetary developments remained the main basis for such decisions, he told a conference in Wolfsburg. But Mr Issing welcomed the pact because it spelt an end to political uncertainty. The central bank council would carefully examine its implications for public sector debt and taxation levels at its meeting tomorrow. 'We have to analyse what the result means in concrete terms for the economy,' he told reporters. While the weekend package has been widely welcomed for its political implications, analysts suggest that it will lead to increased government deficits in the near-term, and point out that the direct and indirect tax increases run counter to the Bundesbank's declared preference for spending cuts rather than higher taxation. Mr Issing's caution was in distinct contrast to an upbeat claim from Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, that circumstances for further interest rate cuts had been improved. Now that money supply was on course, conditions were more favourable, he said. Mr Waigel added, however, that he did not want to predict if, when and to what extent rates would fall, because he did not want to speculate. Many analysts say a cut of at least 0.25 per cent in the 8 per cent discount and 9 per cent Lombard rates is likely tomorrow, although they agree that last weekend's political developments will have at best a neutral impact on the bank council's thinking. According to Mr Issing, monetary policy was not part of the solidarity pact, nor was it a slave to other political circumstances. He was not sure if February's money supply figures would be available for tomorrow's meeting of the bank's central council, but inflation was still too high, he noted. However, growth in the M3 measure of money supply is widely believed to be shrinking under the pressure of recession. Inflation, 4.2 per cent at the last reckoning, is tending to fall. While wholesale prices rose 0.2 per cent between January and February, they were still 1.8 per cent lower than a year earlier, the federal statistics office reported yesterday. In January, M3 contracted at an annualised rate of 2.4 per cent, revised from a preliminary 2.3 per cent, in contrast to the bank's target range of 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent annual growth. Preliminary figures are usually available around the 20th of each month. Meanwhile, the Bundesbank held to the lower rates at which it supplies wholesale funds to the money market with the announcement of a fixed rate tender for securities repurchase funds at 8.25 per cent. Despite apparent tightness in the market - call money rates rose towards 8.75 per cent yesterday after 8.40-8.45 per cent on Monday - the central bank said it believed that there was enough liquidity in the markets. Mr Johann Gaddum, a directorate member, said that the fresh 'repo' allocation was expected to ease some of the 'unjustified' concern in the markets. The bank surprised markets earlier this month when it lowered the repo rate by almost a quarter of a point to 8.25 per cent. This was seen at the time as a signal that the discount and Lombard rates were likely to be cut at this week's meeting.</p>

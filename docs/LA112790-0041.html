			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UTOPIA FOR CRIMINALS?  </P> <P> The California Legislature passes many bills, but seldom does it pass a bill  that has such potential for causing an increase in crime as Senate Bill 2557.  </P> <P> SB 2557 allows counties to charge cities for certain services for which  counties are already receiving tax money. Some counties have indicated an  intent to take advantage of the bill to charge cities for booking of prisoners.  </P> <P> If a city cannot afford to pay $183 every time a prisoner is booked, will (it)  turn the prisoners loose or will they lay off policemen to get the money? I  anticipate that SB 2557 will make California a utopia for criminals.  </P> <P> BOB DINSEN, Garden Grove  </P></p>

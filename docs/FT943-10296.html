			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: European prices slip ahead of US jobs data Stronger-than-expected economic data in Germany and position-squaring ahead of today's US jobs report put downward pressure on prices in most European government bond markets yesterday. German government bonds slipped more than  1/2 point following a larger-than-forecast jump in June manufacturing orders and the second consecutive drop in seasonally-adjusted jobless figures. The data were taken to indicate that the German recovery is stronger than widely assumed, causing some market participants to revise their projections for short-term interest rates. This took a particularly heavy toll on the short end of the market, where some 1995 three-month Euromark interest rate contracts fell by up to a quarter-point. But the long end also suffered, with the September bund future on Liffe falling by around 0.54 point to 93.55. French government issues followed bunds lower, but were further pressed by the tepid reception to the Treasury's latest auction of long-dated bonds. This caused French bonds to underperform their German counterparts, their 10-year yield spread over bunds widening to 46 basis points from 40 basis points on Wednesday. The auction yielded a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.09 on FFr13.4bn of 10-year bonds, 2.02 times on FFr2.95bn of 14-year paper 1.82 times on FFr3.6bn of 30-year bonds. When the September notional bond future on Matif approached technical support at 117.40, retail selling kicked in, pushing the contract even lower, he said. It closed at 117.08, down 0.82 point on the day. UK gilts followed continental European markets lower, pressed further by sales ahead of today's data releases in the US and the UK. 'The market had got a bit too long on the relief that there was no rate rise, and some people were squaring their positions ahead of the US jobs numbers and UK industrial production and manufacturing output data,' said Mr Ifty Islam, fixed income strategist at Merrill Lynch. Gilts underperformed bunds, with the 10-year yield spread widening by around 10 basis points to 175 basis points. The September long gilt future fell one point to 102 3/16 . US Treasury bonds drifted lower yesterday as dealers squared their positions ahead of today's crucial data on July employment. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  9/32 lower at 86 3/32 , with the yield rising to 7.412 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was off  1/16 at 100 9/32 , to yield 5.955 per cent. Yesterday's session brought a piece of negative news as the market prepared for this morning's jobs report. The government announced that initial claims for unemployment benefit had declined by 10,000 last week, suggesting the economy was moving along at a steady pace. The reading was unfavourable to a market looking for signs of moderating growth, which could delay the Federal Reserve's next move to lift short-term interest rates. Bond prices slipped on the announcement, but the declines were modest. Still, traders were hoping the figure was not a preview of today's data on non-farm payrolls. An increase of more than 200,000 jobs could send bonds prices sharply lower. Yesterday, a neutral scenario seemed to be holding sway. Most investors appeared confident the payroll figure would come in near expectations. But the approach of next week's quarterly refunding operation, which would bring a big influx of supply into the market, could stand an obstacle to any upswing in bonds prices even if today's data proved supportive.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Branson plans no-profit bid for national lottery MR RICHARD BRANSON, chairman of the Virgin Group, said yesterday he was seriously considering applying for the licence to run the UK's national lottery on a non-profitmaking basis, distributing all the proceeds to good causes. Mr Branson confirmed that he has a team working full-time on a possible application and said he had the support of influential businessmen, although he declined to name them. 'We are seriously looking at it and we think it should be run this way (non-profitmaking)', Mr Branson said. Mr Branson's comments came on the day that Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, formally launched the lottery race following royal assent for the National Lottery Bill. 'I believe that we are on the threshold of great things. A flutter for the punter and a bonanza for good causes,' said Mr Brooke, who is taking a conservative view of turnover by predicting revenues of Pounds 1.5bn a year. Most specialists looking at international experience believe that a properly run lottery in a country the size of the UK ought to be able to raise more than Pounds 3bn a year. Even at Pounds 1.5bn, prizes could total Pounds 14m a week with some potential operators talking about a top prize of as much as Pounds 5m a week, drawn on national television. Mr Brooke yesterday appointed Mr Peter Davis, deputy chairman of Abbey National, the bank, as director-general of the Office of the National Lottery. Mr Davis, who will invite tenders for running the lottery, license each game and monitor the operation, will publish a draft licence soon. Mr Davis said yesterday that the licences would probably run for between five years and 10 years. The likeliest period will be about seven years. He confirmed that non-profitmaking organisations would be able to apply for the licence and would be treated the same as other applicants. The aim would be to maximise the money raised for the five 'good causes' - the arts, charities, sports, national heritage and a millennium fund. Mr Branson, who first approached the Home Office with the idea of a national lottery for good causes four years ago, envisages setting up a foundation. He said he would decide within the next month whether to apply. Mr Brooke said he hoped the first tickets would go on sale late next year or early 1995 and Mr Davis said he hoped to award the licence to operate the lottery by next spring. Lex, Page 24</p>

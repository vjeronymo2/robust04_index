			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS SEAL BEACH CITY COUNCIL;  </P> <P> VOTE SEEN AS REFERENDUM ON HELLMAN RANCH PROJECT  </P> <P> When voters go to the polls Tuesday to fill two open seats on the City Council,  they will be voting not only for the four candidates in the runoff but also  deciding the future of development in this beach community, the candidates say.  </P> <P> The central issue in the campaign is the Mola Development Corp.'s proposed  $200-million housing project for the Hellman Ranch property.  </P> <P> Local leaders say Tuesday's election -- which offers voters a choice between a  two candidates for and two against the Mola plan -- will be, in effect, a  referendum on what residents want the city to do with one of the last remaining  parcels of vacant land in the city.  </P> <P> "This election is probably one of the most important the city has had in a long  time," said outgoing Councilwoman Joyce Risner, a supporter of the Mola  proposal. Risner is vacating her District 3 seat because of the city's two-term  limit.  </P> <P> The council seats up for election represent two of the most diverse districts  in the city.  </P> <P> In District 1, which covers downtown and Surfside, the candidates are Marilyn  Bruce Hastings, 61, and Joe Rullo, 54.  </P> <P> In District 3, which covers part of the Leisure World retirement community and  the area between Pacific Coast Highway and Gum Grove Park, the candidates are  Galen F. Ambrose, 49, and Gwen Forsythe, 35.  </P> <P> Rullo and Forsythe support the Mola proposal, while Hastings and Ambrose oppose  it. The four were the top vote-getters in their district races in the March 27  election.  </P> <P> Mola's proposal was approved by the City Council last fall, but an Orange  County Superior Court commissioner in March invalidated that approval. Now a  new council will begin a new round of public hearings on the project, soon  after the new council members are seated May 15.  </P> <P> The current Mola plan calls for 329 homes, 26 acres of parks and 41 acres of  restored wetlands. According to Forsythe, who headed the effort to have the  parks included in the plan, this project may represent the best use the city  can make of the land.  </P> <P> Her opponent, Ambrose, disagrees, saying that local decision-makers are selling  Seal Beach's most precious commodity to the highest bidder.  </P> <P> Ambrose is co-founder of Wetlands Restoration Society, which succeeded in  getting the Mola plan invalidated on the grounds that permits for the project  were issued under a section of the city's General Plan that was outdated.  Ambrose proposes doing away with most of the project's 329 proposed units in  the interest of saving 100 acres of what were originally wetlands.  </P> <P> Hastings said she believes that slow, controlled development of the tract may  be necessary, but that she would fight to do away with the Mola plan in hope of  getting a better deal for the city.  </P> <P> Rullo, her opponent, said the plan's density of 2.2 homes per acre and the  public amenities included in the plan would benefit Seal Beach citizens.  </P> <P> If Ambrose and Hastings both succeed in gaining council seats, Mola may have a  difficult time gaining approval for the project. Much of the support for the  development in the past has come from council members Risner and Mayor Victor  S. Grgas. Grgas is also leaving the council because of the two-term limit.  </P> <P> The candidates have been spending much of their pre-election energy pointing  out the lack of experience of their foes and defending their own track records.  </P> <P> Rullo accused Hastings of being a Johnny-come-lately who has never been  involved in city affairs until this election. "I'm running on experience," he  said. "I have experience, she has none."  </P> <P> Hastings countered that she has been involved in the city as a concerned  citizen since she got involved in a successful fight against a development of  more than 700 houses planned four years ago for Hellman Ranch.  </P> <P> Forsythe -- described by her opponent, Ambrose, as an "inexperienced housewife"  -- called the campaign mudslinging "low blows" and said Ambrose resorts to  these tactics because he is afraid that he cannot win by running on the issues.  </P> <P> Forsythe, who has helped her husband operate a sign business since it opened  five years ago, has been a member of the city Planning Commission since earlier  this year.  </P> <P> Ambrose, in a letter to constituents earlier this month, said: "A person can  only negotiate skillfully (with developers) if they have education, knowledge  and experience."  </P> <P> He cited his master's degree in business and his experience as controller of a  company with a budget larger than the city's as qualifying him for the job.  </P> <P> Though many laud Ambrose for his efforts to save the wetlands, Risner -- who is  supporting Forsythe and Rullo -- said Ambrose's three years as a Seal Beach  resident have not given him enough time to understand the city's issues and the  people.  </P> <P> Others question why someone billing himself as an environmentalist would work  for a commercial air-conditioning factory, which produces ozone-depleting  chlorofluorocarbons.  </P> <P> "I have to make a living like everybody else," Ambrose said. "I don't know of  any industry that doesn't impact the environment."  </P> <P> SEAL BEACH CITY COUNCIL CANDIDATES  </P> <P> District 1  </P> <P> Marilyn Bruce Hastings  </P> <P> Age: 61  </P> <P> Occupation: Property management specialist  </P> <P> Background: Hastings served on the board of directors of Children's Memorial  Hospital Auxiliary in Long Beach and was the founding member of the Long Beach  chapter of GOP Juniors.

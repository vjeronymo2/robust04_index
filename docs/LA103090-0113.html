			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> UCLA;  </P> <P> LINGERING INJURIES HAMPER THREE BRUINS  </P> <P> UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said his team didn't suffer any serious injuries in  Saturday's 26-17 victory over Oregon State at the Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> However, center Lance Zeno, defensive end Mike Chalenski and outside linebacker  Arnold Ale have lingering injuries.  </P> <P> Zeno has torn tendons in his left foot and played only a couple of series  against Oregon State. Chalenski has a shoulder injury that has bothered him all  season, and Ale didn't play because of an ankle injury and tendinitis in his  knee.  </P> <P> "Lance is like a car with a flat tire," Donahue said. "He can't push off. I  think his role the rest of the season will be as a spot player."  </P> <P> Zeno wears a specially constructed shoe to immobilize his foot.  </P> <P> With Zeno unable to play regularly, walk-on Aron Gideon has become the starting  center. The No. 2 center, John Zilinskas, is inactive with an ankle injury.  </P> <P> Donahue said that Gideon has done a creditable job and might be in line for a  scholarship. MAL FLORENCE  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wu Xueqian, vice chairman of the Chinese </F> People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National  Committee, by unidentified RENMIN RIBAO reporter in Beijing;  date not given: "Suiting the New Situation, Exploring a New  Path, Making Fresh Contributions"]    [Text] Beijing, 7 Mar (RENMIN RIBAO)--[RENMIN RIBAO] As  far as I know, to meet the needs of the new situation and the  new tasks of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization,  the Eighth National Committee of the CPPCC has energetically  carried out fruitful explorations over the past year. Please  tell me about the status of this effort.    [Wu] Faced with the constantly developing reform, opening  up, and socialist modernization, everybody has a sense of  urgency, and the CPPCC is no exception. How to duly give play  to its role as an organization of the most extensive patriotic  united front of the Chinese people and an important organ of  multiparty cooperation under the leadership of the CPC and  political consultation in developing the socialist market  economy, promoting the building of socialist democracy,  deepening reform, and safeguarding social stability is an  important task before the CPPCC. In the past year, under the  leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin  as its core, the CPPCC National Committee has seriously summed  up the past work of several CPPCC National Committees and, on  this basis, has energetically explored a new path for the work  of the CPPCC under the new situation. As pointed out by  Chairman Li Ruihuan: The new situation and the new tasks have  set new demands on the CPPCC. The new CPPCC National Committee  should always take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guideline, should  gain a thorough understanding of the important position and role  of the CPPCC in the new period, should keep abreast of the new  situation, should explore a new path, and should make new  contributions.    [RENMIN RIBAO] How do you, as a vice chairman of the CPPCC,  assess the work of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee over the  past year?    [Wu] The Eighth CPPCC National Committee has made a good  start in this first year. New progress has been made in all  kinds of work. Many personalities at home and in the  international community have gained a fresh understanding of the  CPPCC, and people have begun to attach importance to and pay  attention to the activities and role of the current CPPCC  National Committee. All this has created favorable conditions  for the further development of the CPPCC. It should be said  that this is the outcome of the concerted efforts of all CPPCC  units involved and all CPPCC members.    [RENMIN RIBAO] Please detail the new characteristics of the  CPPCC's work over the past year.    [Wu] First of all, the understanding and activities of the  Standing Committee in discussing and taking part in state  affairs have been strengthened. Meetings of the CPPCC National  Committee Standing Committee are the main form for fulfilling  the duties of political consultation and democratic supervision  during the adjournment of the plenary sessions and represent an  important channel for various democratic parties, non-party  democrats, various people's organizations, and personalities of  various nationalities and circles to discuss and take part in  state affairs. Over the past year, the CPPCC National Committee  held five Standing Committee meetings for consultation and  discussion about the economic situation of the country and the  measures to be taken, the international situation, establishing  the socialist market economic structure, strengthening the  building of honest administration in state organs, punishing  corruption, and so on. Zhu Rongji, Qian Qichen, Wen Jiabao, Wei  Jianxing, and other leading comrades of the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council attended the meetings, made  reports, and took part in the consultations. With a patriotic  heart toward the state and the people, the members of the  Standing Committee opened their minds, frankly aired their  views, contributed excellent measures, and put forward good  suggestions and proposals. We seriously put these suggestions  and proposals in order and reported to the relevant departments  in good time. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council  attached importance to the suggestions and proposals.    Second, the role of the special committees have been  strengthened further. The CPPCC special committees are working  organs for organizing the CPPCC members to carry out regular  activities and are basic links for fulfilling the duties of  political consultation and democratic supervision and for doing  a good job in discussing and participating in state affairs.  Over the past year, the planning, standardization, timeliness,  and effectiveness of the work of various special committees have  been markedly improved, and the initiative and enthusiasm of  CPPCC members have been further brought into play. Many  investigation reports provided by the special committees have  produced good economic results and social benefits.    Third, guidance to and cooperation with local CPPCC organs  have been strengthened to a certain extent. There are  altogether 3,041 local CPPCC organs with 460,000 members at  various levels. Closing ties between the CPPCC National  Committee and the local CPPCC organs is conducive to giving play  to the strong points of the CPPCC as a whole in jointly  promoting the development of the CPPCC's cause. Over the past  year, the CPPCC National Committee has attached importance to  its ties and cooperation with local CPPCC organs. For example,  in making study tours of various localities, main leaders of the  CPPCC National Committee have, without exception, "visited CPPCC  organs, met CPPCC members, and discussed matters concerning the  CPPCC"; some special committees have held informal discussions  on common issues in work and have carried out joint  investigations and study on some important issues.    Fourth, the work of improving organs has been strengthened.  Over the past year, we have paid attention to strengthening  work to improve the ideology and work style of the CPPCC organs.  Everybody has worked hard to bring about the good common  practice of energetically making progress, stressing efficiency,  unity, cooperation, honesty, and of being realistic.    [RENMIN RIBAO] Over the past year, the CPPCC National  Committee has carried out relatively active friendly exchanges  with foreign countries. Can you tell me something about this  situation?    [Wu] The CPPCC National Committee's exchanges with foreign  countries are an important part of China's diplomacy. In  exchanges with foreign countries, the National Committee can  give play to its special strength of being both "an official and  a popular" organization. It can have high-level contacts with  parliaments of various countries and can also establish ties  with popular organizations. Since the First Session of the  Eighth CPPCC National Committee, the CPPCC National Committee  has energetically widened the scope of its exchanges with  foreign countries and has developed activities with foreign  countries. From the end of November to the beginning of last  December, Chairman Li Ruihuan made an official friendly visit to  three Southeast Asian countries and achieved complete success.  Besides, Vice Chairmen Ye Xuanping, Seypidin Aze, Hong Xuezhi,  Hu Sheng, Qian Weichang, Sun Fuling, and myself also visited  some countries one after another. In the past year, the CPPCC  National Committee has also played host to delegations from some  countries.</p>

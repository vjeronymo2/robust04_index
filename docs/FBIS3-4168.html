Wu Jichuan, chairman of  the Chinese Government reception committee and minister in  charge of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, made a  special trip to Shanghai to greet Kim Yong-sam on behalf of  President Jiang Zemin.    This evening, Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju met with Kim Yong-sam  and his party and hosted a banquet in their honor at the New  Jinjiang Hotel.    This is Kim Yong-sam's first visit to China after he assumed  the presidency. During the meeting, Kim Yong-sam said he is  glad that, as China's largest economic center, Shanghai is the  first leg of his visit to China.    Kim Yong-sam said: Though the ROK and China just established  diplomatic relations more than a year ago, their friendly  cooperation is enjoying further development in various fields.  Last year, the two countries' bilateral trade volume exceeded  $10 billion. A bigger growth in bilateral trade volume is  predicted for this year.    Kim Yong-sam also said he believed Shanghai can play a  bigger  role in its economic exchanges with the ROK.

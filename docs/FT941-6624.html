			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Up, up and away: Germany's runaway public sector debt When the buses and trams stopped running in many parts of Germany for a couple of hours early yesterday morning, most commuters reacted with calm and good humour. They were only witnessing a brief rash of token strikes, after all, and nothing like the widespread chaos caused by an 11-day stoppage called by the public sector trade unions two years ago. This time nobody believes that the unions will go that far. Not only are they operating against a background of sharply rising unemployment; they are negotiating with a bunch of employers whose coffers are visibly empty. For once, the public sector pay round, covering some 3.5m workers ranging from bus drivers to garbage collectors, school caretakers and postal workers, has united the normally quarrelsome ranks of the German political establishment. From the ruling conservative-liberal coalition in Bonn, through the 16 state governments, to the whole multiplicity of local authorities, ranks have closed in favour of an outright pay freeze. At every level of government in Germany, budgets are under extraordinary pressure. It is not just the federal government in Bonn that is desperately struggling to keep its net borrowing under DM70bn (Pounds 27.2bn) for the second year in succession. The wealthy west German states will this year be forced to borrow DM28.5bn on the capital markets, for the first time exceeding their all-time record deficit of DM26.1bn in 1981. In east Germany, the five 'new' federal states which began life at unification in 1989 without any debts at all, now expect to borrow DM28bn this year. By the end of 1994, they will have run up a debt mountain of DM76bn. As for the local authorities, their combined net borrowing this year will add another DM22bn to the total, in spite of a severe squeeze on services. At the weekend, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's irrepressible finance minister, sought to put the best possible gloss on the situation when he told his Group of Seven colleagues about the prospects for economic recovery. The Bonn government will cut its budget deficit from the current 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product to less 3 per cent by 1995, he said - and thus conform once again to the level laid down in the Maastricht treaty for European economic and monetary union. What he failed to mention was that at precisely the same time - in 1995 - the overall public sector debt will sail through another Maastricht convergence criterion, topping DM2,000bn, or rather more than 60 per cent of GDP. It is a prospect that is causing concern right through the German economic and business establishment, not least because the process seems to be unstoppable. The Bundesbank warned in its latest monthly report that the total public sector debt was approaching the Maastricht ceiling 'by leaps and bounds'. According to a comprehensive analysis just published by the German chambers of commerce and industry (DIHT), the public sector debt will reach DM2,163.5bn in 1995, or 62.7 per cent of GDP. What the DIHT is seeking to launch is an entire debate on the nature of public spending, and the need for wholesale structural reforms, instead of the piecemeal approach of annual savings packages adopted by Mr Waigel and his colleagues in Bonn and the federal states. In the first 30 years of the German federal republic, the public sector accumulated a total debt of DM500bn, the DIHT says. In just five years since German unification, the republic will have added double that amount, pushing the debt burden up from DM1,039bn in 1990 to the forecast DM2,163.5bn next year. Unification is obviously one overwhelming factor for the surge. The other is the explosion of social spending. The last straw has been the addition of east German debts to the total: DM275bn from the Treuhand privatisation agency will be taken over by the federal government next year, and some DM125bn in debts from the former East German housing fund. Add to that some DM80bn in the debt burden of the combined German railway system, assumed from last January 1, and the DM2,000bn barrier will be easily surpassed. What concerns the DIHT, however, is not just the scale of borrowing, but the purpose to which it is put. For the level of consumption in public spending has been steadily increasing at the expense of investment spending. In the budgets of the federal states, for example, more than 82 per cent of their combined spending of DM456bn last year was on the current account. Of that, DM175bn, or 38.5 per cent of the total, was on the wage bill. Another DM71.5bn was on administrative expenses. 'The Lander,' says the DIHT, 'are becoming little more than labour-intensive service enterprises.' The other main concern is that Mr Waigel's hope of bringing his net borrowing back within 3 per cent of GDP is based on over-optimistic assumptions of future economic growth. The finance ministry's medium-term plan assumes a nominal growth rate of GDP of 6 per cent a year up to 1997, and a 3 per cent annual spending limit. On the basis of this the total net increase in debt would be DM288bn between 1993-97. The extra interest rate burden would add a further DM17.3bn, assuming a 6 per cent interest rate. Yet if the nominal growth is only 5 per cent, the accumulated deficit would hit DM425.6bn, and the extra interest burden would total DM25.5bn. It is a grim prospect for whichever party or parties win the coming national elections in October, let alone the various state and local elections in the offing. The one man who is currently seeking to make political capital out of it is a real outsider: Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former economics minister, now languishing in the wings of the Free Democratic party, plotting to get back into power. He has published a radical plan which would slash the number of federal government ministries from 18 to 12, the number of members of parliament from 662 to 500, and the number of federal states from 16 to 7. He wants to slash subsidies to ailing sectors - such as agriculture - and increase charges for public services across the board, like energy, water and sewage. The trouble is that he is largely a discredited force, in his own party and in the ruling coalition. He is unloved by the opposition SPD. So the probability must be that the debt will go on soaring, and radical solutions be rejected in favour of piecemeal savings.</p>

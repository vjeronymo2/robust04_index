			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Business and the Law: Lords to probe Community competition rules - Briefs THE House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities has launched an inquiry into the enforcement of EC competition rules. A sub-committee chaired by Lord Slynn, Britain's former judge at the European Court of Justice, will concentrate its inquiries on the procedures of the European Commission and levels of decision-making. Following concern expressed by the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, the committee will examine: whether Commission procedures are flawed; whether staff shortages and budgetary constraints within the competition directorate are delaying decision-making; and it will look into the Commission's publicly-expressed wish that more enforcement of competition rules should take place at national level. The committee's previous examination of competition practice - in 1982  - resulted in improvements in procedures. The sub-committee will also examine procedural operations and possible revision of the thresholds of the Merger Regulation.</p>

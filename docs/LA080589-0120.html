			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACKARD OPPOSES TWO COUNTY SITES STUDIED FOR AIRPORT  </P> <P> A congressman who sits on a powerful House aviation panel said Friday that he  strongly opposes two Orange County sites recommended for a new regional  airport. A third primary site is in San Bernardino County.  </P> <P> Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) said potential airport sites in Cleveland  National Forest east of San Juan Capistrano and at Camp Pendleton, both in  Packard's 43rd Congressional District, "are unacceptable to me, and I will  fight them."  </P> <P> He voiced equally strong objections to two secondary sites in Cristianitos  Canyon near San Clemente and Palomar Airport in San Diego County -- also in his  district.  </P> <P> "We simply are not anxious at all to have an airport sited in either the  populated area, or the future populated area of Orange County," Packard said in  an interview.  </P> <P> He said the only primary site listed that seems acceptable is soon-to-be-closed  Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino County.  </P> <P> Packard sits on the aviation subcommittee of the House Public Works and  Transportation Committee, which oversees the Federal Aviation Administration  and which would have to approve federal money used in construction of a new  airport.  </P> <P> "I hope (the site selection committee) will read some writing on the wall  there," Packard said.  </P> <P> The potential sites were recommended earlier this month by the staff of the  Airport Site Coalition, a private group sanctioned by the Orange County Board  of Supervisors and aided by professional planning consultants.  </P> <P> The coalition is assisting preparations for a new air passenger airport that  would relieve the severe overcrowding at John Wayne Airport, nestled between  Costa Mesa and Irvine, and northeast of Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Packard said he has had preliminary talks with Rep. George E. Brown Jr.  (D-Colton), whose district includes Norton Air Force Base, about the idea of  putting a new airport there.  </P> <P> "What we're doing is inquiring about what the constituents feel about whether a  commercial airport could replace some of that economic and job loss" caused by  the Air Force's decision to close the base, Packard said.  </P> <P> Building a new airport at the proposed site in the Cleveland National Forest,  at Potrero Los Pinos, "would have a very serious impact on the environment,"  Packard said.  </P> <P> The Camp Pendleton location "is totally out of the question," he added, because  "it would literally destroy Camp Pendleton as a training base. We simply cannot  permit that."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KHJ'S NEWSCASTS  </P> <P> Henry's description of KCAL's former news operation as "lackluster and  under-performing" shows a remarkable ignorance of both the Los Angeles market  and his current ratings (about 25% below a year ago). The pre-Disney news team  was well-respected locally, bringing in dozens of Emmys and Golden Mike Awards  over the 15 years of my tenure there.  </P> <P> (Channel 9 won no awards this year.)  </P> <P> "Undercapitalized and over-performing" would have been a more accurate  description of the KHJ news department. Mr. Henry is from WOTV-TV in Grand  Rapids, Mich., in the country's No. 37 TV market. He could not possibly know  the kind of person it takes to dispatch six remote trucks: His former station  had two microwave trucks.  </P> <P> JODY MILLER  </P> <P> (Former art director,  </P> <P> KHJ-TV, 1983-87)  </P> <P> Encino  </P> <P>  Before working in Grand Rapids, Henry was with a station in Dallas, part of a  market that is in the Top 10.  </P></p>

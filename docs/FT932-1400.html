			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Milan's new mayor threatens to expel illegal immigrants MILAN'S new mayor, Mr Marco Formentini, has threat ened to expel illegal immigrants from the city if national immigration rules are not tightened. Milan, which has a severe housing shortage, is a magnet for illegal immigrants, mainly from north Africa. The recently-elected Mr Formentini is a leading member of the populist Lombard League. He said that, in the interim, Milan could apply special rules for companies wanting to employ immigrants. Those would require workers from outside the European Community to have formal employment contracts and would require employers to take responsibility for housing them for up to six months. Mr Formentini, a member of the lower house of the Italian parliament, has recently appeared more moderate on sensitive issues, such as immigration, than Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's leader. However, his remarks, in his first newspaper interview since becoming mayor, suggest immigration will be at the top of the agenda for League mayors, who scored a string of victories across northern Italy in last weekend's second round of local elections. He dismissed claims by Ms Margherita Boniver, a former immigration minister, that enforcing tough entry rules for non-EC citizens was virtually impossible because of Italy's long coastline and proximity to north Africa. 'The problem isn't the long coast but short brains,' he said. On the economy, Mr Formentini accused previous local administrations of contributing to the current weakness of Italian industry. Corporate competitiveness had been eroded by the existence of a 'perfect oligopoly' among companies making rigged bids for big infrastructure contracts which had 'degraded the whole system'.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Stockbrokers return to profit after surge in market turnover THE UK's stockbrokers returned to profit last year after devastating losses in 1990 - though they managed only a meagre return in one of the most buoyant recent years for the stock market. Securities companies which belong to the London Stock Exchange had lost Pounds 353m in 1990 but managed combined profits of Pounds 286m in 1991, the exchange said yesterday. That is equivalent to a return of just over 10 per cent on the capital they had invested in the market - less than was available last year on risk-free UK government bonds. The return to profits, however, was enough to stop the steady attrition that had seen some banks withdrawing from the market since the 1987 stock market crash. The turnround in stockbrokers' fortunes last year was due largely to the 14 per cent leap in turnover on the stockmarket as share prices rose after the Gulf war. Commissions earned by brokers jumped 19 per cent as a result, to Pounds 1bn. The spurt in trading also made it easier for market makers to show a profit: their profits more than doubled during the year, to Pounds 815m. Also, as share prices leapt, companies queued up to raise cash by selling shares, pushing up fees for underwriting and managing new issues to Pounds 301m. One side effect of the sudden leap in stockbrokers' income was a return of the staff bonuses that had withered during the lean year of 1990. Bonuses had amounted to only 7 per cent of the annual brokers' basic salary in 1990. Last year, they jumped to 22 per cent. Despite this, securities companies managed to put the lid firmly on their total staff costs, the single largest expense they face. By holding down basic salaries, they managed to keep salary increases to just 1 per cent. Experience in the last quarter of the year and the early part of this year, however, suggests that salaries are now rising again, the exchange says. Trading in futures and options showed a surprise loss of Pounds 10m last year, after a Pounds 41m profit the year before. Stock Exchange Quarterly, January-March 1992, London Stock Exchange.

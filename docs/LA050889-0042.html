			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Philadelphia Public Health Department will allow bathhouses, adult  bookstores and adult movie theaters to remain open as long as customers are  provided with free condoms and AIDS prevention information, according to a  published report. The Philadelphia Inquirer detailed the department's official  policy, which was made public Friday through the city's AIDS Activities  Coordinating Office. The policy differs from those in cities such as San  Francisco, where health officials closed down bathhouses because of evidence  that sex between strangers there was spreading the AIDS virus, the Inquirer  said.  </P></p>

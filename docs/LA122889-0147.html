			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. COMPUTER FIRMS ARE SPLIT ON PROSPECTS FOR 1990;  </P> <P> SALES: EXPECTATIONS RANGE FROM SO-SO TO GREAT, BUT THE HIGH-TECH FIRMS ARE  UNIFORMLY EXCITED ABOUT FOREIGN MARKETS.  </P> <P> With expectations ranging from the unexceptional to the strongly upbeat, Orange  County computer companies' sales forecasts for 1990 are as diverse as the  industry itself.  </P> <P> Local computer firms are involved in many aspects of the computer business,  from supplying software to manufacturing personal computers and distributing  them to retailers. And their fortunes often are closely tied to the growth in  their slice of the market.  </P> <P> Companies that manufacture PCs and PC components are particularly enthusiastic  about prospects for 1990. On the other hand, makers of minicomputers -- the  size of computers between PCs and the largest mainframes -- report that they  see little reason for cheer.  </P> <P> The county's computer industry is expected to continue to grow in fits as it  enters the new decade. In 1990, Western Digital of Irvine and Ingram Micro D of  Santa Ana are likely to become the first county computer firms to hit the $1  billion annual sales mark.  </P> <P> One common thread among local companies is their enthusiasm about the prospects  for doing more business overseas. With the promise of new markets opening in  Eastern Europe and the development of other markets in Asia and elsewhere, many  computer firms say foreign sales may providen their fastest sales growth in  1990.  </P> <P> The majority of local computer firms are involved in the personal computer  field. PC sales were dampened in 1989 because of widespread confusion over  competing designs, industry officials say. A lot of that confusion has cleared,  they say, and the outlook for 1990 is for generally strong, though not  spectacular, growth.  </P> <P> "I think it's going to be a very good year for the industry," said Gene Lu,  president of Advanced Logic Research Inc., an Irvine personal computer maker.  "We've had a lot of confusion with these different industry standards. In 1990,  I think all those issues will be clarified and it will be a matter of selection  for buyers."  </P> <P> But not everyone shares Lu's optimism.  </P> <P> Dataquest Inc., a Silicon Valley market research firm, predicts that 23.3  million PCs will be sold worldwide in 1990, an unexceptional 10% increase over  1989. For an industry accustomed to 20% to 30% growth rates throughout most of  the 1980s, a 10% growth could be considered relatively flat. However, some  segments of the industry -- for example, companies that supply networks that  link PCs within an office -- are expected to grow much faster than the overall  industry.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Apple Computer Inc. surprised investment analysts when it  said its sales would grow more slowly in 1990 than previously predicted. The  Cupertino, Calif., computer maker said it expects U.S. sales to rise by 15% to  18% next year.  </P> <P> "Some people are skeptical about 1990," said AST Research President Safi U.  Qureshey, "but we do not share that skepticism." Qureshey declined to provide a  specific sales forecast for his company.  </P> <P> Qureshey and other computer executives said one unknown factor that could  affect sales is the health of the U.S. economy. "There is talk about a possible  recession," he said. "If the economy really goes into the tank, our industry  will be affected. But a minor economic slowdown will not have that much  effect."  </P> <P> Ingram Micro D, the nation's largest wholesaler of PC hardware and software,  expects sales growth of more than 20% next year, said Chairman Linwood A.  (Chip) Lacy. "There are a lot of exciting products coming in both hardware and  software products."  </P> <P> Traditionally, new products and technology have been the keys to growth in the  PC industry as computer users swap their older machines for faster, more  powerful models.  </P> <P> Industry analysts say one key reason that PC sales stalled in 1989 was  uncertainty over which of two competing PC design standards was technologically  superior and likely to gain greater acceptance in the market. One standard was  developed by International Business Machines and the other was proposed by nine  PC manufacturers that compete with IBM.  </P> <P> Now, it appears that the industry is making room for both PC standards. Some  computer makers, such as Advanced Logic Research, are building PCs  incorporating both designs: IBM's Micro Channel and the Extended Industry  Standard Architecture (EISA) developed by Compaq Computer Corp. and other PC  makers.  </P> <P> Rainbow Technologies Inc. of Irvine, a supplier of software designed to protect  the data in PCs, also sees a very strong year ahead, said Peter M. Craig, vice  president of business development. Sales of the company's products are closely  tied to overall sales of computer hardware.  </P> <P> "We're coming off one of the best months we've ever had in December and are  looking for continued growth in 1990," Craig said. "We haven't seen anything  yet that would be of concern to us."  </P> <P> Western Digital Chairman Roger W. Johnson said 1990 will be a "pretty good  year" for the county's largest computer manufacturer. The company's sales have  been flat throughout most of 1989.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't be surprised to see our sales growing at about 15% this year," he  said. "Our order rates right now are the best they have been in 18 months."  </P> <P> But companies that supply products for the minicomputer market are less cheery  about 1990. They forecast conditions similar to those they had in 1989:  sluggish growth.  </P> <P> Minicomputer sales have been hurt by competition from sophisticated PCs and  workstations that can perform the same tasks as many minicomputers but cost far  less.  </P> <P> Emulex Corp. Chairman Fred Cox is anticipating an increase in sales in early  1990 after a sluggish 1989. The Costa Mesa company supplies storage products  for minicomputers made by Digital Equipment Corp. and components for computers  made by other manufacturers.  </P> <P> "It's tougher this year than it has been, but I think we have the potential for  some growth," Cox said.  </P> <P> Robert Kleist, president of Printronix Inc., an Irvine maker of printers for  minicomputers, says industry sales will be flat and "our sales will reflect  that." He said Printronix is hoping that a new line of printer products will  help invigorate sales.  </P> <P> Printronix and other local companies are forecasting a more rapid growth in  international sales than domestic sales in 1990.  </P> <P> "Europe looks very strong for us," Western Digital's Johnson said. "And if  Eastern Europe continues the way it is going politically, that could be a net  incremental boom to the whole industry."  </P> <P> "We expect our international growth will be very strong in 1990," said Jim  Farooquee, chairman of CMS Enhancements, a Tustin supplier of computer storage  devices for PCs. Farooquee says CMS's 1990 sales will reflect the overall  growth in the computer storage market, which is expected to grow 15% to 20%.  </P> <P> CMS plans to open a sales office in Western Europe next year and is eyeing the  Soviet Union and Eastern Europe as ripe markets.  </P> <P> "We anticipate a lot of new markets opening up in Eastern Europe," Farooquee  said.  </P> <P> And local firms hoping to tap into the Eastern European market may get some  help from the Bush Administration. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said  earlier this month that the administration is actively reviewing proposals to  relax the ban on sale of high-technology exports to Warsaw Pact countries, the  result of sweeping political changes occurring in the Communist bloc.  </P></p>

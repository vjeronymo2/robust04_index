			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Sales data knock pound Hopes for an early UK interest rate cut received a boost yesterday from the release of weaker than anticipated retail sales figures which added to doubts about the strength of the UK economic recovery, writes Philip Gawith. February retail sales fell by 0.5 per cent, compared to the 0.2 per cent growth expected in the market. Sterling finished the day weaker as a result, closing in London at DM2.5227, from DM2.53 on Tuesday. Across the Atlantic, a 0.3 per cent rise in February consumer prices, in line with market expectations, dampened hopes of a tightening in US monetary policy this week. The dollar, trading at DM1.6970 before the figures, lost 0.6 pfennig to close at DM1.6910. It finished in New York at DM1.6890. In Germany, meanwhile, the Bundesbank cut the repo rate by 6 basis points at its weekly tender  - also in line with market forecasts, but double the three basis points of each of the last two cuts. Like the curate's egg, UK economic releases were good in parts. Countering the retail sales number, which hinted at an economic slowdown, was the 38,000 drop in February unemployment, considerably more robust than the general expectation of a 15,000 fall. The market focused on retail sales and sold sterling. This downward move was helped by the weaker dollar, with the pound unable to rise past the Dollars 1.50/51 level against the US currency. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America, said the figures had 'increased the prospect of a Bank of England rate cut, irrespective of what the Bundesbank does (today)'. Following the controversy of the previous rate cut  - on February 8  - he predicted that the Bank would 'be very keen to make sure it has the economic justification this time'. The general view is that if the retail prices number next week is low, then this will open the way for another 25 basis-point reduction. The data were positively received in the sterling futures market, the June contract rising four basis points to 94.86. The December contract was eight points higher at 94.52, while the longer contracts for March and September 1995 were up by 14 to 15 points. Dealers said speculation about a rate cut would continue to weigh on sterling, where sentiment is anyway depressed. Mr Stuart Frost, technical analyst at Natwest Treasury, said dealers saw repeated sterling resistance at the Dollars 1.50/51 level as an opportunity to make money. The pound has also been hitting a ceiling at DM2.53 against the D-Mark. Mr Frost predicts that if it falls through the 'key technical level' of DM2.52, technical dealers will sell the currency. Liquidity conditions in the UK discount market were again fairly tight, with overnight rates rising to a high of 9 per cent in mid-afternoon. This followed the market realisation that the Bank of England was not going to offer a repo. After revising the estimated shortage to Pounds 950m, the Bank purchased Pounds 127m of bills outright before offering Pounds 630m of late assistance. Following the fairly subdued producer price data on Tuesday, the dollar drifted lower yesterday when consumer inflation came in line with the market forecast. The February consumer price index (CPI) and the 'core' rate, which excludes food and energy, both rose 0.3 per cent. Mr Hawkins said the market's reaction had been predictable, with some buying of the dollar before the lunchtime data release, and light profit-taking afterwards. He said the general consensus was that although the next policy tightening from the US Federal Reserve was just a matter of time, it would probably now only come through next week. The caveat to this scenario is the release today of the Philadelphia Fed survey. Last month the Fed tightened policy when the Philadelphia report showed inflation pressures after a good set of core inflation figures. The dollar fell back against the yen, closing at Y105.75 from Y106.15. But in New York it ended at Y106.055. Although the US currency has been firmer recently, analysts said renewed weakness probably flowed from the combative stance taken earlier this week by Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade secretary. This showed that while the Motorola dispute might have been settled, the broader trade dispute between the two countries remained very much alive. The D-Mark was barely changed in Europe after the Bundesbank repo cut. It closed at FFr3.399 from FFr3.398 and at L987.5 from L985.4. Although the repo cut was broadly in line with expectations, it disappointed the futures market, and the three-month Euromark contract was three basis points lower at 94.57 yesterday evening. The December contract was unchanged at 95.04. Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, said the repo cut was 'very encouraging'. He said if the Bundesbank continued to cut at the current rate  -12 basis points in the past two weeks - the discount rate could fall to 3.25 per cent by next year from 5.25 per cent.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / More than the job's worth: Recession has changed Japanese attitudes to work - maybe for good In the past, slaves were loaded onto slave ships and carried off to the New World. But in some way, aren't our daily commuter trains packed to the brim even more inhuman? These corporate slaves of today don't even share the simplest of pleasures that forced labourers of ages past enjoyed: the right to sit down at the dinner table with their families.' Toshitsugu Yagi, a Japanese advertising executive, made this entry in his diary, with tragic prescience, shortly before his recent death from karoshi, or sudden death caused by overwork. He is among the estimated 10,000 Japanese to die this way annually, the same number as are killed in traffic accidents, a phenomenon which is attracting public concern as well as a host of legal demands for compensation from employers. Mr Yagi's diary speaks for the many salarymen whose devotion to a company in return for lifetime employment has helped transform Japan into an economic superpower but who are now questioning the postwar social contract. The toughest recession for 20 years has forced both partners to the contract, companies and employees, to rethink attitudes to work. The process may already have been under way, pushed by the internationalisation of Japanese corporate culture, before the economy took a dive. If so, Japanese feelings about work could be undergoing a permanent change. On the employers' side, corporate Japan has been obliged to take an axe to excessive wage costs, a legacy of the social contract uncovered by four years of falling profits. Early retirements, job transfers to remote affiliates, enforced holidays on low pay and reduced hiring, have been toughest among the biggest companies, the very groups which were once seen as guarantors of the tradition of jobs for life. They include telecommunications group NTT, which is Japan's biggest employer, Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel group, and most top electronics companies. On the part of employees, many salarymen today feel there is more to life than honourable sacrifice in the service of a great multinational - and it is fashionable to say so. Fewer, for instance, today introduce themselves in the traditional fashion, company name first, own name second; a pattern that indicated that the company did indeed come first in everything. More striking still, some salarymen are starting to hit back by taking their companies to court for alleged unfair treatment. A recent example is Mr Haruo Kawaguchi, who has achieved big publicity by suing his employer, Teikoku Hormone Manufacturing, for compensation for a six-year separation from his family caused by a routine job transfer. A sign that businessmen think Japan should throw out some of its traditional workplace values came in a recent survey of 1,600 executives, who said the top three qualities that Japanese society should pursue are creativity, fairness and symbiosis. The values commonly thought to have made Japanese companies into world beaters, such as efficiency, growth and competition came bottom of the scale, in the poll by the Social and Economic Congress of Japan, a private think-tank. An increasing number of salarymen are turning their new aspirations into reality by taking the initiative and asking to be switched to less ambitious but more fulfilling jobs outside Tokyo headquarters. The bursting of the 'bubble economy' and subsequent corporate streamlining have offered salarymen an opportunity to review their relationships with companies. And some of them, especially those in their 30s, have decided to switch jobs,' says Kazuhiko Tanaka, editor of B-ing, a job placement magazine. One of them is Tetsuro Handa, who two years ago left a high-flying job as section manager of Mitsubishi Corporation's copy machine export division, to work in the newly created environmental affairs department, where he vets the environmental impact of Mitsubishi capital investment plans. 'I couldn't care less about promotion now. What I am doing is more important and rewarding for my life. The environment is a cause that I can devote myself to, even after I retire,' he says. But the liberated Mr Handa is in a minority. Those who have been forced to take more leisure or change job as part of a cost cutting plan, rather than make their own moves, have sometimes discovered that trying to kick workaholicism can be traumatic. Mental illness is increasing among early retiring and semi-redundant salarymen. While this is well-known among surplus executives in the west, it is unfamiliar in Japan, and especially striking because of the Japanese taboo against admitting to psychological upsets. Several Tokyo psychiatrists say a rising number of distressed salarymen have come to their couches in recent years. 'Many patients say that . . . they have been assigned to sections they did not desire, and have lost confidence,' says Dr Toru Sekiya, a psychiatrist who treats about 10 people a day for mild depression, twice as many as five years ago. Dr Sekiya recalls a patient who could not bear to tell his family that he was out of a job and left home clad in a suit every morning, to spend the day killing time in coffee shops. Eventually he tired of this and asked Dr Sekiya for a medical certificate, citing 'internal problems' as an excuse to stay at home. The public debate opened by the casualties among Japan's corporate slaves can only increase the urge among those still in work to put private aspirations first and loyalty to the company second. This invites the question of whether Japan's corporate strength, partly built on salarymen's selflessness, might be weakened by a dilution in devotion to the company. 'It could be a sign of the decline of the economy . . . it could make it hard to adapt if there is a really severe recession,' argues Toshio Kusamitsu, associate professor of social history at Tokyo university. Alternatively, Japanese companies might secretly welcome confrontation with the workforce, as an excuse further to cut their bloated payrolls. Officials at the Keidanren business federation says that companies have an estimated 800,000 to 1.2m surplus workers on their books, on top of the 1.5m registered unemployed. If the change in attitudes does help erode companies' old loyalties to their unwanted staff, corporate Japan could come out of it leaner and meaner.</p>

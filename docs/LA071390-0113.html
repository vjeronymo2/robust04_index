			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WARNING LIGHT CAUSES FORCED LANDING AT LAX  </P> <P> A United Airlines DC-10 bound for Washington with 268 passengers aboard was  forced to return to Los Angeles International Airport Thursday when a fire  warning light activated shortly after takeoff. The plane, operating on two of  its three engines, landed safely after dumping fuel and no injuries were  reported.  </P> <P> Dick Morrison, assistant air traffic manager, said the landing was "fairly  normal" once the pilot noticed the light, which warns of an engine fire. The  pilot shut off the engine and made a few passes over the ocean to dump fuel.  </P> <P> Inspectors examined the aircraft, and determined that there was no fire and  that the light was triggered by a malfunction, a United official said. No  emergency evacuation procedures were necessary during the landing of United  flight 54, officials said.  </P></p>

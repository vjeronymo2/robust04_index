			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Appointments: Welsh Water plugged Holes in the senior management at Welsh Water created by the surprise departure of managing director David Jeffrey at the end of last year have now been plugged. Paul Twamley, a partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte for the past 11 years, has been hired as finance director, replacing Graham Hawker, who was promoted to fill Jeffrey's spot in January. Twamley, who has worked in Wales all his life, and for 28 years as a chartered accountant, specialised latterly in corporate finance, with geographic responsibilities for the West of England as well as Wales. He was also the audit partner for Welsh Water until two years ago. When Coopers merged with Deloitte's, the terms of the deal meant that it was the senior partner of Deloitte's who secured the top position in the merged entity. Twamley had been senior partner at Coopers. He acknowledges that one of the most important aspects of the job - managing relations with the City - will represent a new departure for him. But Graham Hawker, he says, is well versed in that department and will be hand-holding 'until the City feels it can deal with me'. ***** Perhaps with an eye to local sensitivities, Britain's biggest bank has decided put a Welshman in charge of the biggest part of its Welsh business. Gareth George, 42, is taking over as Barclays Bank's regional director for South Wales on June 1. Having joined the bank in 1971, he is now moving from Birmingham to Cardiff  -very much a return home. He was born and brought up in the Rhondda valley and went to Cardiff University. As a 'fanatical' rugger man he welcomes the chance to be among sympathetic colleagues for a change; at Birmingham, where he has been personal sector director for the past five years, he was the butt of all the anti-Welsh jokes every time Wales lost. Like many successful clearing bankers, George has done more than his fair share of charitable work and became national president of the Round Table at 39. George is replacing Englishman, Grant Walshe, who is retiring on reaching 60. Having been brought in from Bristol, Walshe is regarded as having done a good job nursing the bank's business in a local economy which has been hit hard by the problems in farming and traditional heavy industries. He quickly established himself in Cardiff business-life where no function is complete without his bonhomie and booming voice. He is staying on in the city among his bridge friends. 'I bring a civilising English touch,' he says.</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEIL AND BRUCE  </P> <P> In regard to Daniel Paul's July 9 letter stating that if it hadn't been for  Neil Diamond the world would not have Bruce Springsteen's song "Born in the  U.S.A." or the movie "Yentl":  </P> <P> I find it unacceptable to think Mr. Springsteen had Neil Diamond anywhere on  his mind while writing "Born in the U.S.A." just because America and U.S.A. are  synonymous.  </P> <P> The only similarities I can see between "Yentl" and the film "The Jazz Singer"  is that both of their characters were Jewish.  </P> <P> I have nothing against Neil Diamond. I am simply against the belief that Neil  Diamond is God.  </P> <P> SEAN TUCKER  </P> <P> Bakersfield  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tehran, 18 Jun -- The human rights documentary  center in Iraq today sent an urgent appeal to Max van der Stoel,  special rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Iraq,  to halt a new collective exodus from various parts of Iraq.    In an urgent cable to Der Stoel, the Tehran based center  said  that the number of families who have arrived at the Hemet and Um  Ni'aj border areas has reached 264 families, totalling 1,315  persons according to the latest census.    The center indicates that the current exodus started three  months ago, but has witnessed a large increase in the number of  immigrants during the last month.    The cable says that the reasons of the exodus are caused by  the stepping up of oppressive measures by the Iraqi regime, such  as arrests, executions, and because of the deteriorating life  and health conditions of the immigrants, such as the outbreak of  skin diseases and dysentery.    The cable says that the new wave of immigrants are from  Baghdad, al-Hillah, Karbala', al-Basrah, al-Qurnah, al-Madinah,  Misan, al- Mijar, al-Nasiriyah, al-Chebaich, and the marshes of  Suk al-Shuyukh, al-Hammar, and al-Fuhud.    In another development, a communique issued here today by  the  supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI] says  that the engineers corps of the Iraqi regime's Army have  completed the preliminary works in a new destructive project,  which could be considered as the final phase in the so-called  al-Anfal Project III, which was carried out early last year and  which caused the draining of vast areas of southern Iraq's  marshes.    The communique quotes sources in southern Iraq as saying  that  the new project consists of a canal starting at al-Maymunah  district, southwest of al-'Amarah, toward the al-Islah region in  the al- Nasiriyah governorate in southern Iraq, then west  alongside the al-Nasiriyah marshes to meet the Euphrates, and  then into the Shatt al-Arab.    The engineers corps of the Iraqi regime's Army are carrying  out the new project, which is costing about 65 million Iraqi  dinars, in cooperation with the Irrigation Ministry. [passage  omitted]</p>

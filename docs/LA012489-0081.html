			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN JOSE ST. WILL HONOR SCHOLARSHIPS OF 10 BOYCOTTING BASKETBALL PLAYERS  </P> <P> San Jose State will continue to honor the scholarships of the 10 basketball  players who are boycotting the team, Athletic Director Randy Hoffman said  Monday.  </P> <P> "I felt a sense of commitment to these men, and we wanted to fulfill that  commitment from our end," Hoffman said. "Secondly, some of them . . . aren't in  the greatest financial shape, and I didn't want to do anything that might  impact their ability to complete their college educations."  </P> <P> The threat of a lawsuit by the players was not a factor in the decision,  Hoffman said.  </P> <P> "Under (National Collegiate Athletic Assn.) rules it was clearly our  prerogative," Hoffman said.  </P> <P> NCAA rules provide that if a player leaves the team voluntarily, aid may be  withdrawn at the end of the current semester. San Jose State's spring semester  begins Thursday.  </P> <P> The players walked out on Coach Bill Berry last week, accusing him of verbal  abuse and vowing not to play again until he is fired or resigns. The school  repeatedly has backed Berry, and last Thursday it fielded a team that included  the four remaining players, four football players, a team manager and three  other walk-ons for a game won by Cal State Fullerton, 82-60.  </P> <P> None of the boycotting players has sought to return to the team, Hoffman said.  </P> <P> "I think (Berry) is still holding out hope, as well as myself, that some  players might reconsider," Hoffman said. "But there's going to be a time frame  where we have to make a final decision." ROBYN NORWOOD  </P></p>

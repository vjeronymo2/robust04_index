			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From David Healy in London] </F>   [Text] Political relations between Beijing and London have  sunk to a new low over Hong Kong, with an angry exchange of  letters between senior figures in the two capitals, a British  source has revealed. Beijing has launched a "coded" attack on  the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC)  investigation into Sino-British relations and their effect on  Hong Kong. The committee is preparing a report expected to  firmly back Governor Chris Patten's reforms. The influential  British parliamentary committee has responded by rejecting the  Chinese attack.    An angry letter from the Foreign Affairs Committee of  China's  National People's Congress--a copy of which has been obtained by  the SUNDAY MORNING POST--claims its British counterparts have  "grossly interfered in the internal affairs of China and  severely trampled upon the norms governing international  relations" by investigating Beijing's human rights record in  Tibet. It warns of the consequences for "bilateral relations"  of the British parliamentarians' investigation, and threatens  that it will "undermine the normal exchanges between the two  parliaments".    "The Chinese side has done nothing to harm Britain and its  Parliament. However, in disregard of the sound relations  between the two parliaments, a small number of British MPs have  grossly interfered in China's internal affairs. This has not  only seriously hurt the national feelings of the Chinese people  but also contravened the position of the British Government,"  the letter alleged.    Although ostensibly concerning the committee's investigation  of human rights in Tibet, one senior member said they were  taking the letter as a coded attack on their inquiry into Hong  Kong, which recently heard evidence from Mr Patten and will this  week question Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd on the issue.  "Make no mistake about it. This letter is not just about  Tibet. It's a message of how bitter the Chinese side feels  about Hong Kong," the committee member said.    "They know we're going to come out in support of Chris  Patten  and insist in our report that there must be human rights  safeguards in Hong Kong...this is a coded message to us about  how they feel over our stand on Hong Kong.    "Our view is that the Chinese record on human rights in  Tibet  is one way of judging what they might do in Hong Kong," he  added. A source said the British parliamentary committee had  drafted a response rejecting the accusations.    Beijing's letter was provoked by a December 8 hearing which  called as a witness Tashi Wangdi, foreign minister for the  Tibetan government in exile, headed by the Dalai Lama. China  does not recognise the Dalai Lama's government, and frequently  protests against the activities of its members in foreign  countries.    "The Foreign Affairs Committee allowed its hearing to be  used  by the so-called `witness' to shamelessly deny China's  sovereignty over Tibet and flagrantly advocate the independence  of Tibet. The political motive of the committee in doing so was  all too clear," the letter said. "Such an act of the committee  constituted open support of and connivance with the political  activities of the Dalai clique aimed at opposing the Chinese  Government and splitting the motherland."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Ex-RAF Member To Be Released in the </F> Middle of May"]    [Excerpts] The pardoning of former Red Army Faction [RAF]  member Bernhard Roessner after 19 years in prison encountered a  mainly positive reaction yesterday. Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel welcomed this decision, reached by President von  Weizsaecker. Together with Justice Minister Sabine  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, Kinkel had helped bring about  Roessner's pardon. [passage omitted]    Roessner is the third RAF terrorist serving a life sentence  to be pardoned. Previously, Klaus Juenschke was pardoned in  1988, and Angelika Speitel in 1990.

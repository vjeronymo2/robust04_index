			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (1): In search of a new consensus - United Germany may be in for a spell of indecisive government. But that could culminate in a new political consensus The last votes were barely counted in last month's narrow-squeak federal elections before the lobbying hordes - including Bundesbankers, industrialists and economists - lined up to swamp the returning government with advice on the contents of its agenda for the German Bundestag's 13th legislative period. Even though the conservative/liberal coalition was coming back to power in a considerably weakened state, and promptly subjected to speculative attacks that it would not hold together through the four-year term, the lobbyists' demands remained as rigorous as ever. Mr Klaus Murmann, president of the BDA employers' association called for nothing less than the restructuring of the DM1,000bn annual social welfare budget which was threatening to 'crush us all'. The list presented by Mr Heinrich von Pierer, Siemens chairman, started with a call for budget consolidation, and closed with demands for political support for business plus coherent energy and telecommunications policies. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said the government should not rely on the cyclical recovery in the economy to make good the nation's structural deficits. Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, urged Chancellor Helmut Kohl to pluck up the courage to tell the population that he faced a 'pile of unpopular tasks,' including the need to cut spending. Although the choice of items largely reflected the petitioners' peculiar political or business interests, they were also pointed reminders of crucial issues, still unresolved, from the previous government's agenda. An immediate outcry against Mr Murmann, especially from his natural allies in the ranks of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats and the Bavarian Christian Social Union, served as a warning that governing with a majority of 10 instead of 134 required rather more subtlety than Mr Murmann seemed to appreciate. Despite Mr Kohl's claims of having a 'perfectly good working majority,' his hand has been significantly weakened by the shrinking of the coalition's Bundestag majority, the enfeeblement of the Free Democratic Party (FDP), the CDU's and CSU's liberal partners, and the consolidated supremacy of the Social Democrats in the Bundesrat or upper house. The view across the wider political landscape has also been distorted by the gains of the Party of Democratic Socialism, successor to the East German communists, which took nearly 18 per cent of the vote in its home region despite being dubbed 'fascists painted red' by Mr Kohl. Against this background, observers believe the government must expect conflicts with the FDP which has effectively lost its roots in regional parliaments and has fewer seats than the Greens in the new Bundestag. Analysts say it must either raise its own liberal profile - at the risk of friction with its conservative partners - or lose its identity. They also point to the danger of conflicts within the CDU from prominent members jockeying for the leadership as Mr Kohl approaches the expected end of his parliamentary career at the next elections. Such considerations, they say, may lead to the paralysis of domestic policy-making. Rather than struggling with a strong opposition and a tiny majority to implement contentious legislation on welfare spending cuts, for example, the chancellor may prefer to turn his attention to his 'historic' responsibilities in the foreign field, including the further development of the European Union. Mr Kohl intends to play a leading role in the EU intergovernmental conference in 1996, with the aim of giving new gravitas to his honorary if rather faded post-unification title of 'Unity Chancellor'. The possibility of governmental neglect of domestic economic and fiscal affairs is further aggravated by mounting public confidence that after the short-sharp shock of recession, everything is coming quickly right again. Trade unions are already agitating for 'real' wage increases this year although the Bundesbank has warned that years of restraint are necessary if Germany's pay-to-productivity ratios are to be restored to internationally competitive levels. Certainly, Germany is emerging with unexpected speed from the steepest slump since the war. Unemployment started falling far faster than is typical at the end of a cyclical recession. Company profits are booming in many sectors. Business confidence is high - misleadingly high, according to the influential DIHT federal chamber of trade and industry. A recent check on the mood among 25,000 of its members, in the form of its annual autumn confidence poll, concluded that while the recovery certainly reflected the inherent strengths of the economy, it was now tending to conceal the severity of the structural weaknesses exposed during the slump. For example, although unemployment is down from its peak early in the year, a third of those without work have been jobless for more than 12 months and half have no vocational qualifications. Even the most stoutly conservative forecasters predict little substantive change in the labour market for at least 18 months. Only 9 per cent of the DIHT survey sample planned to take on staff, while 28 per cent said they were still cutting their payroll. Companies also stress there are no grounds for euphoria over profits. In the engineering industry, for example, net return on sales this year is expected to be only 0.8 per cent compared with a negative rate of minus 0.7 per cent in 1993 and a 'normal' level for the industry of 2.5 per cent, according to recent surveys by the Ifo economics institute in Munich. But industry's main concern is that its efforts at restructuring in the past two years may be rendered fruitless if federal government and regional and local authorities fail to consolidate budgets and reduce the burden of taxation and welfare contributions on businesses and consumers. Business leaders argue that unless the whole economy is subjected to a rigorous slimming cure - and the government accounts for half of GDP - they will be obliged to go through the entire restructuring process again when the next cyclical slump occurs. At the heart of government's problems, and the single most important source of concern to the Bundesbank, is the burden placed on the future by mountainous public debts. The total is expected next year to exceed DM2,000bn for the first time. At an estimated DM2,150bn it will be more than twice as high as the national debt in 1990, the fateful year of unification. Despite misgivings, the government has made progress, and this year launched a consolidation programme intended to cut some DM90bn from the federal budget by the end of 1996. One result was that federal debt was not increased this year and the total public sector deficit fell slightly from 1993's record DM182bn. A more substantial decline, to less than DM130bn, is already programmed for next year. Bonn has also made an effective start on reducing and simplifying corporate taxation, but the levy on retained profits is more than double that in the UK. It has chipped at statutory payroll costs by reducing the charge for pensions insurance. But a new levy to cover the costs of care for the elderly, coming in next January, will cancel this out. More than 20 per cent of German wage costs are accounted for by statutory insurance and other 'social state' benefit charges which are three times as high as in Britain. As management has shown in industry there is no shortage of scope for economies and new ideas. Most strikingly, it has demonstrated in the past two years, in which radical and painful changes have been introduced without any trace of industrial unrest, that in Germany it is still possible to build consensus and compromise in the most unpromising circumstances. Which gives grounds for optimism that it may be much to soon to be worrying about the onset of political paralysis.</p>

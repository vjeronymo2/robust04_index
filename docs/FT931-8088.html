			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Rugby Union: Awkward Norster puts his expertise on the line THE LION-HEARTED defence by Wales in their Five Nations rugby union victory over England two weeks ago has overshadowed one important aspect of the game. The Welsh line-out work was superb. A supposed weakness was turned into a strength. This was a surprise, to put it mildly. Not long ago, Wales won only two line-outs in an entire game against Australia, prompting one journalist to write: ' . . . in the first half Wales won a line-out and in the second-half, just to prove it was no fluke, they won another.' The improvement is due mainly to Robert Norster, the Welsh team manager who was one of the most effective line-out forwards in Europe during the 1980s. He was awkward and thoughtful, determined and courageous, and these characteristics helped him overcome a lack of inches. He is 6ft 5in and Wade Dooley, England's big lock, is 6ft 8in - yet, in their meetings, it was always Norster who came off better. Now he is passing on to his team what he learned then. The key to Norster's success as a player, and Wales' line-out performance against England, is attention to detail. 'The line-out is a team performance,' he says. 'It is not just about who jumps highest. You need a bit of skill, accuracy and team-work. You have to work as a team, and we did. I am happy to say that we won more than 80 per cent of our own ball against England.' There is much preparation before Wales play an international these days. The technical department of the Welsh Rugby Union records each of their team's games and those of future opponents. (A camera will be at Lansdowne Road in Dublin this afternoon filming Ireland against France, to help Wales prepare for their remaining matches in the Five Nations championship). Then, sections of each match are compiled and sent to the players concerned. Before the England game, the Welsh line-out forwards were sent clips of England's line-out performances against Canada, South Africa and France earlier this season. Then, at practice, Norster urged them constantly to try new techniques and refine old ones. He stressed variety and surprise. He made them rehearse their line-out calls, routines and support systems. The result was that Gareth Llewellyn, the big Neath lock, had his best game yet in the line-out for Wales and fellow-lock Tony Copsey turned in a good performance, too. It was typical Norster, who says self-mockingly: 'Even my friends would say I am a bit over-regimented.' Derek Quinnell, the former British Lion who now manages the Wales A team, adds: 'As a second-row forward, Bob was forever organising people around him so that he could give of his best. He would analyse his opponents and work out how best to counter them. 'He would sometimes make his opponents move forward to compete with him for a ball, and sometimes make them go back. His style was to stand out of the line-out and leap into it. He was very agile for a big man, spring-heeled, a genuine leaper.' Norster grew up in a hard school. Born in Ebbw Vale in 1957, his first rugby experiences were with Abertillery; and he joined the famous Cardiff club in 1978, the year after he became a member of the Welsh national squad. Norster did for his country in the '80s what another Lion, Delme Thomas, had done in the '60s and '70s. Both won priceless line-out ball, often against bigger and stronger men. In theory, neither was quite tall enough; but they made up in technique what they lacked in physique. Both recorded outstanding Sargent jumps, the method used to measure a standing jump. As he developed, Norster acquired an uncompromising hardness. He needed it in New Zealand when he played in two Tests for the Lions in 1983, and again in one Test against Australia's Wallabies in 1989, as well as in 34 internationals for Wales between 1982 and 1989. He needed it, too, when Wales beat England in the 1987 World Cup and, against the odds, at Twickenham in 1988 - after which England coach Roger Uttley said ruefully: 'A player like Norster will always give you trouble.' Most of all, Norster needed his hard-nosed attitude against Ireland in Dublin in 1988 when chasing the Triple Crown (victories against all three home countries in the Five Nations championship). Wales were up against it and so was Norster, who had trapped a shoulder nerve after catching a line-out ball and was in constant pain. Yet, he turned in a performance of such courage that Stephen Jones was moved to write in the Sunday Times that, in the second half, 'Norster grabbed hold of Wales and simply flung them at the Triple Crown.' Wales won 12-9, sneaking home in the dying minutes, and went on to win the Crown. Even in rugby union's new professional atmosphere, it might surprise many to learn that the Welsh players are backed up by their coaching staff, a selection committee and selection adviser, two doctors, two physiotherapists, a fitness adviser, a sports scientist, a match analyst and a dietician. But it all tallies with Norster's philosophy. 'Attention to detail has always been, and always will remain, an essential ingredient in our preparation,' he wrote in the programme notes for the Wales v England game. At Murrayfield in Edinburgh this afternoon, we will see what ploys Norster has thought up when Wales face the strong line-out threat posed by the Scots. But you can be sure of one thing: like Baden Powell and the Scouts, Norster will be prepared.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: A gift to posterity - Paul Sacher, musical pioneer and patron The house has an elegant stone facade, one side overlooking Basle's cathedral square, the other the River Rhine. Inside, the design blends modern practicality with clean, classical lines. No expense has been spared. In the reading rooms, musicologists study autograph scores on microfilm. In the vault-like safe, librarians methodically sift through manuscripts. The Paul Sacher Foundation, inaugurated in 1986, is going about its work. This is Paul Sacher's gift to posterity. The 87-year old Swiss musician, who conducts the London Mozart Players at the Queen Elizabeth Hall next Wednesday, has spent his life commissioning and performing new music. Now he has gathered it together as a 20th century archive. The starting point was his own priceless collection of scores, bolstered by his purchase of the Stravinsky estate in 1983. Then came the complete Webern manuscripts, followed by a steady flow of material from Berio, Birtwistle, Boulez, Dutilleux, Henze, Ligeti and others. The collection grows every week - negotiations are currently under way to buy John Cage's estate - and will soon need expanded premises. The only major gaps are Schoenberg and Berg. Paul Sacher is a living legend. The son of a Basle gardener, he studied violin, founded the Basle Chamber Orchestra in 1926, married the widow of the head of the Hoffmann-La Roche chemical company, and used the family fortune to commission more than 200 works - among them Bartok's Music for Percussion, Strings and Celesta and other modern classics by Hindemith, Honegger, Martinu and Frank Martin. These compositions were not simply ordered and paid for: in many cases, Sacher befriended the composer, put the spacious surroundings of his country home at their disposal, offered encouragement and watched the work develop. Then he would conduct the first performance (and often the second and third . . . ). How different from today's cultural sponsors] Perhaps it is his progressive, open-minded spirit that has kept Sacher so young. Another source of vitality is his 12-year old son, whose mother - a young medical scientist - died of cancer in 1989, a few months before Sacher's wife died at the age of 93. He still leads a remarkably active life. Although he played a key role during and after the war in the growth of Hoffmann-La Roche (in which, thanks to his initiative, his family gained a majority shareholding), business interests now play second fiddle to the foundation. He receives guests in his apartment at the top of the building, where the rooms - decorated with paintings by Picasso, Chagall, Modigliani and others - bear testimony to his wife's lifelong patronage of 20th century art. Did he have a plan, a mission, from the start? 'I knew exactly what I wanted. I had my own orchestra at school, I wanted to be a conductor. I wanted to do old music, I wanted to do new music, I wanted to do unknown things - anything but the pieces which were repeated over and over again at concerts. I wanted to hear the voice of our time, how a man living today composes music. For me, the most important musician is the composer. 'When I started the Basle Chamber Orchestra, we had no money. That didn't stop me inviting Stravinsky and Hindemith to come and conduct their music. If I asked a composer to write a piece, he immediately agreed. He knew me and my orchestra, the quality and competence, and said yes with pleasure. Today's composers have lists of commissions and not enough time to fulfil them. In 1926, there were hardly any chamber orchestras - today there are hundreds. When I started, radio had only just begun; today, you only need go to a music shop and buy the record for yourself. It's a century of change.' Sacher's pioneering work in early music - he founded his own original instrument ensemble, Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, in 1934 - is almost forgotten today. His wealth has also tended to overshadow, and even obstruct, his career as a conductor. But no-one has ever doubted the quality of his musical judgment. The number of his commissions which have stood the test of time speaks for itself. And he is still commissioning - the latest being a violin concerto by Wolfgang Rihm, to be premiered next year by Anne-Sophie Mutter. It was Sacher's influence which turned Mutter's attention to contemporary music. 'I told her 10 years ago - 'listen darling, you can't go on playing the Romantic classics for ever, it's boring. You're a young woman of our time'. We started with Stravinsky. She understands every style, she's a sweetheart and a fantastic fiddler.' He is convinced that understanding contemporary music is only a question of generation, and that today's modern music will be popular tomorrow. 'Boulez is now at Salzburg. He conducts Boulez, and the hall is as full as it was with Karajan. We have modern composers who are first class people - Carter, Lutoslawski, Berio. I don't see any crisis. Music will go on developing - as it always has.'</p>

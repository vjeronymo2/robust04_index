			<p>BFN     [Text] COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] has  rejected the criticism by the commissioner of police, General  Johan van der Merwe, of the so-called truth commission. COSATU  said that among other things it wanted to know who was  responsible for the murder and disappearance of trade union  members during the apartheid regime, and for the explosion at  COSATU House. COSATU said that Gen. van der Merwe's criticism  was suspect after the attempt by the head of the SANDF [South  African National Defense Force], Gen. George Meiring, to obtain  a court order against the publication of covert army operations.  It is reported that the minister of justice, Mr. Dullah Omar,  has indicated that the truth commission will go ahead despite  Gen. van der Merwe's opposition.</p>

"Alphaville" is a mixture of private eye  thriller and science fiction, seemingly modelled, in equal parts, on "The Big  Sleep," "Metropolis" and Jean Cocteau's "Orpheus." Eddie Constantine -- a  popular American star of French movies -- is sent here to "Alphaville," a  dehumanized city of night, run by computers, somewhere in the outer galaxy. All  of the movie was shot in actual locations in 1965 Paris, to emphasize the  movie's metaphor: This cybernetic hell is not some piece of myth. It is here  and now, on top of us. Godard's metaphoric approach kills immediacy -- the  actors move like puppets through a fluorescent, metallic maze. In this bright  hell of expressionless faces, Constantine's violence becomes the only cri de  couer, Anna Karina's Gish-like profile the only icon of soft flesh. A brainy,  strange film: cold on top, hot underneath. MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

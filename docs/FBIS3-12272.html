			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Remarks by Nimr Hammad, PLO representative to Italy, made </F> while speaking to correspondent Michele Cucuzza on 25 February  in Rome -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Hammad] The settlers are  responsible for this tragedy. This time the Israeli Government  must make the brave decision to disarm the settlers and to  clearly state that the settlements are illegal, and these  settlers must be told that this land is occupied territory. If  the Israeli Government does not make this decision, the entire  peace process could lose its credibility. This will not only  give rise to extremism, but the peace process will be refuted:  Even the moderates will decide that it is meaningless. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Jordan and Israel set up diplomatic relations Jordan and Israel yesterday announced the establishment of diplomatic ties in line with last month's peace treaty leading to full normal relations after a 46-year state of belligerency, Reuter reports from Amman. A joint communique issued in Amman and Jerusalem paved the way for exchanging ambassadors and opening embassies in Amman and Tel Aviv by December 10, as set out in the treaty. A party of schoolchildren will go to Israel tomorrow to attend celebrations in Haifa, becoming the first group of Jordanians to enter Israel formally since November 14, when both countries opened the way for visits. Hundreds of Israeli tourists have flocked to Jordan in the past two weeks. The statement added that both countries hoped the move would promote comprehensive peace, development and co-operation. They will now formally exchange letters nominating ambassadors. King Hussein personally chose Mr Marwan Muasher, 38, Jordan's former Middle East peace team spokesman and a US-educated computer entrepreneur, as Jordan's first envoy to Israel. The cabinet appointed Mr Muasher ambassador at the foreign ministry on Saturday and is expected to send his papers to Israel soon. Israel has yet to name an envoy to Jordan.</p>

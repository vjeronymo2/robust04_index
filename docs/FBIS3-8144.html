			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Koev: "Bulgarian-Macedonian Talks"] </F>   [Text] Skopje, March 3 (BTA) -- A Bulgarian delegation led  by Deputy Foreign Minister Dimitur Ikonomov arrived in the  Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM]. Today Ikonomov was received by President Kiro  Gligorov to whom he delivered a message by Bulgarian President  Zhelyu Zhelev.    The message, a reply to a recent letter by Gligorov,  emphasizes Bulgaria's principled stand for the promotion of  relations with Macedonia. It stresses Bulgaria's desire to  develop with its neighbours, including the young Macedonian  state, a policy based on mutual understanding and friendship.    In a special message to President Zhelev, the Macedonian  president had thanked him for the support the Republic of  Macedonia received from Bulgaria after Greece had imposed a  unilateral economic embargo against it.    The exchange of personal messages between the presidents of  Bulgaria and Macedonia is an important part of direct contacts  between the state leaders of the two neighbouring countries and  has a great significance for the regulation of bilateral  relations. Political observers here see this fact as evidence of  the willingness of Sofia and Skopje to promote cooperation in  the difficult situation in the Balkans, leaving behind points of  dispute accumulated in the past.</p>

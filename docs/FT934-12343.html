			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Taking no liberties: A nationwide identity card scheme in the UK need not discriminate The idea of a limited identity card scheme, now being considered by the UK government as a possible way of combating social security fraud, has provoked a chorus of protests from the civil liberties lobby. It argues, quite rightly, that any such scheme would be discriminatory. Moreover, if such a scheme were to have any chance of being effective in defeating social security fraud, it would have to intrude on the freedom and the privacy of the individual on a horrendous scale. But the libertarians make a mistake when they go on to argue that the case against this particular scheme is only a limited version of the much larger case against a generalised system of national identity cards. On the contrary, the libertarians grossly overstate the threat to individual liberty which would necessarily be posed by a national identity card, and understate the offsetting benefits that it might confer. Above all, it seems slightly eccentric to attribute so much virtue to the absence of a system of documentary identification, when there are so many, much larger, defects in our political system which limit the rights of the individual, starting with an unrepresentative electoral system. The discriminatory nature of the scheme being considered by the government is obviously its biggest drawback. But even if it were limited to the original purpose of fighting social security fraud, its administration would be immensely cumbersome; not just because many millions of people would have to be issued with cards, but because the scheme would have to take account of the fact that a significant proportion of them would be constantly floating in and out of the social security net. Even if these practical problems were overcome, a simple iden-tity card would not solve the problem. Much of the Pounds 5bn reportedly being defrauded from the social security system is not the result of mistaken identity, but derives from the fact that claimants tell lies about their circumstances. Any identity card which was likely to be useful in preventing that kind of fraud, therefore, would have to be a smart card, which has large amounts of updateable information about the private circumstances of beneficiaries, including their work, income and family. Such a card would obviously constitute an outrageous intrusion on the privacy of the individual. Moreover, the political inspiration of the idea rests at least in part on the illiberal sentiments of the right-wing of the Conservative party. The law-and-order mob within the party cannot be counted on to defend other people's liberty. The second half of the libertarians' argument holds a good deal less water than the first. It is not at all obvious that the absence of an identity card system provides the British subject with civil protections that are not available to the citizens of France or Germany. On the contrary, it seems obvious that these protections lie elsewhere, in the political system, in the civil society, in the framework and application of law. If our liberties are threatened, it is primarily because these other facets of the social fabric are defective. The absence of any recognised form of identity is an anachronism which harks back to some mythical, bygone era when society was purely composed of private individuals. The reality today is a mass society where everybody has frequent, multiple and almost unavoidable transactions with different parts of the state system, and in which both sides of those transactions have an interest in being able to establish the identity of the individual. The libertarians try to scare us with the danger that a menacing police force would constantly be stopping people to check their identity cards, but this is just a trumped up bogey. In five years in France I was not once stopped on the street for an identity check, and I never met anyone who was. In place of this bogey, there may be other cases where an identity card system might actually improve the quality of civil society. Young blacks who could easily prove that they were born in Britain and were not illegal immigrants might be better protected against police harassment; and the rest of us might be better off if Irish terrorists found it more difficult to remain underground. For either of these benefits, I should gladly be prepared for the trivial inconvenience of being required to admit to my identity. A discriminatory identity card should be unacceptable on civil liberty grounds. But a national identity card system is much less objectionable, and might even offer compensating advantages.</p>

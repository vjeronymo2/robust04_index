			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa left Tunis this morning  for Malta on a three-day official visit after participating in  the African summit meetings. In a predeparture statement, he  said that President Mubarak's participation in the African  summit and his inaugural speech played an extremely important  role in advancing efforts toward resolving African problems.  These efforts were in completion of Egypt's tasks during its  chairmanship of the OAU. He said that Egypt presented proposals  and held consultations that were welcomed and appreciated by all  delegations. They contributed significantly towards resolving  problems discussed during the summit, particularly the issues of  development and debts.    Musa said that his visit to Malta is within the framework of  cooperation among the Mediterranean countries and preparation  for a meeting among a number of those countries' foreign  ministers to study the situation in the region and coordinate  policies. He noted he will also discuss ways of bolstering ties  between Egypt and Malta in all fields.</p>

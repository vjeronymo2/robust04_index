			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Lib Dems target urban Tory seats The Liberal Democrats yesterday outlined plans to target urban Conservative seats in an attempt to establish the party as the main metropolitan alternative to Labour in the May local government elections. Launching a paper on urban policy Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said Britain's rundown cities could be regenerated through decentralisation and wider council powers over taxation and planning. The paper, Reclaiming the City, aims to build on the Liberal Democrat's successes in last year's county council elections, when the party made widespread gains at the expense of the Tories. It attacks the government for imposing undemocratic quangos on local government and 'failing either to arrest the underlying processes of urban decay or to ameliorate the effects'. Mr Ashdown said the paper was intended to challenge the public view of the Liberal Democrats as a rural party of the south-west of England, Scotland and Wales. 'Up and down the country we are moving away from being a party exclusively winning seats in rural areas and one which is becoming an inner-city alternative to the Labour party,' he said. The paper is based on the Liberal Democrats' long-standing commitment to decentralise local government under a new tier of regional assemblies for Scotland, Wales and the English regions. It calls for lower business rates; local agencies to mobilise savings and channel national and European funds into development projects; tax relief for municipal development bonds; and workforce agreements to ensure that local people benefit directly from jobs created by redevelopment projects. It also urges the use of planning law to direct businesses and homes back to inner-city areas, combined with a development tax to discourage development on greenfield sites. The paper also calls for a substantial increase in light rail and other public transport systems.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Intel ships Pentium chip INTEL, the US semiconductor group, yesterday began officially shipping its newest and most powerful personal computer microprocessor, the Pentium, which is designed to preserve its status as the world's leading chip-maker through much of the 1990s, writes Martin Dickson in New York. The company said it would ship hundreds of thousands of Pentium microprocessors this year, with volume passing the 1m mark in 1994. Intel microprocessors are the brains for over 70 per cent of the world's personal computers. The Pentium will provide increased power for applications such as complex financial analysis and computer-aided design. The Pentium contains 3.1m transistors, compared to 1.2m on Intel's current 486 model. It performs 112m instructions per second, making it five times faster than the original 486.</p>

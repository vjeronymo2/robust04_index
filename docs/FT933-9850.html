			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Exiled Tibetan government in 'cordial' talks with China THE Tibetan government-in-exile, headed by the Dalai Lama, has held 'frank and cordial' talks in Beijing with the Chinese government, according to a statement from its office in London yesterday. It said Mr Gyalo Thondup, the Dalai Lama's elder brother, and Mr Sonam Topgyal, political affairs secretary of the India-based government, had met ministers and senior officials of China's United Front Department, which deals with Tibetan issues. A Tibetan spokesman in London said that although Mr Thondup had visited China on a number of occasions as the Dalai Lama's personal emissary, this was the first time since 1984 that he had done so as a representative of the exiled government. He is minister for security. Experts on Tibet were surprised both at the issue of a statement - talks are usually held in secret - and at its positive tone, though they were wary of interpreting it as a sign of a breakthrough in relations between the Dalai Lama and Beijing. China's policy has been that anything could be discussed with the Dalai Lama except Tibet's independence. The Dalai Lama implicitly accepted this when he called, during a visit to London in May, for a 'one country, two systems' approach. Beijing is under mounting pressure from the west to engage in talks with the Tibetans. US President Bill Clinton, who met the Dalai Lama in April, made renewal of China's most-favoured nation trade status conditional upon improvements in human rights in Tibet. Britain has called for talks without pre-conditions. Yesterday's statement said the Tibetan delegation had presented a letter to the Chinese leadership from the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government wanted to maintain contact with him. The Chinese embassy in London said it had not seen the Tibetan statement and had no comment.</p>

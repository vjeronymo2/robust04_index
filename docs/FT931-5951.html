			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Abbey dull There was slight disappointment in the market with full-year figures from Abbey National, but dealers said most of the sharp fall in the shares was a reflection of their recent strong outperformance against the wider market. One specialist pointed to the improved profits performance in the second half of the year, which he said went largely unexplained. 'The interest margin was 2.1 per cent in the first half and 2.5 per cent in the second half; there are question marks about the company's ability to maintain margins,' he added. Abbey dropped to 378p at one stage following the results, but later rallied to close 12 off on balance at 385p. Fisons' preliminary figures were viewed as marginally disappointing and saw the shares retreat to finish a net 7 down at 222p, after 219p, on good turnover of 5.5m. General Accident's preliminary results, accompanied by a Pounds 110m issue of preference shares, were much as expected and failed to trigger any substantial excitement in the market. The shares drifted back 10 to 585p, with analysts adopting the view that the stock's near 30 per cent premium to net asset value was too large in the composite sector. 'There is a useful yield but no prospect of a dividend increase for 1993,' said one analyst, who also pointed out that a rights issue might still be made in around a year's time. Guardian Royal, reporting today, eased 5 to 188p. Sun Alliance came under more selling pressure, closing 7 weaker at 326p in relatively heavy volume of 6.1m shares; the group announces its preliminary numbers on April 8. Barclays came in for a flurry of support, ending 7 firmer at 432p ahead of tomorrow's full-year results, which are keenly awaited by the market. A reduction in the dividend, widely forecast by some of the market's leading analysts, would not only trigger a steep fall in Barclays' shares, dealers said, but severely damage confidence in the wider market. A strong performance by BICC was mostly responsible for the good showing by the FT-Actuaries electricals index, which moved up 2.9 per cent compared with a marginal rise in the FT-SE Mid-250 Index and weakness in the FT-SE 100. BICC finished 12 higher at 345p, helped by increasing optimism over the preliminary figures due this morning. Turnover reached a healthy 4.6m, boosted by an agency cross of 500,000 shares at 343 1/2 p. SG Warburg, recommending clients to increase holdings, believes the dividend will be maintained. The general consensus is that the cables and construction group should report profits similar to last year's Pounds 81m, although estimates range from Pounds 70m to around Pounds 85m. The profits total would be net of exceptional charges of Pounds 40m, comprising Pounds 30m for the write-down of the development at Spitalfields, London, and Pounds 10m for the Channel tunnel project. Delta, second-largest component of the electricals group, rose 6 to 438p. A cautious statement accompanying the interim results from Raine Industries did little to comfort the market and unsettled the stock, which dropped to 99p before finishing a net 12 off at 101p. US buying, coupled with hopes of a recovery in European steel prices, helped shares in ASW Holdings, the Cardiff-based steel and wire group, shrug off Monday's poor figures. The stock forged ahead 24 to 177p. The strong sentiment in ASW helped boost trade in several other stocks. Chief among these was British Steel, which had a busy session as turnover rose to 20m. The shares hardened 3 1/2 to 86p. Another beneficiary was Glynwed International, which appreciated 4 to 273p, while William Cook advanced 14 to 155p. Engineering group James Wilkes, in which Suter now holds an 8.9 per cent stake, suffered from profit-taking after Monday's strong run. Having climbed 4 to 70p in early trading, the shares closed 10 lighter on the day at 56p. Suter once again ended unchanged at 135p. Both James Capel and Hoare Govett were reported to have recommended Siebe and the stock appreciated 9 to 484p. Among transport stocks, P &amp; O moved forward 6 to 568p as NatWest Securities urged investors to buy the stock. NatWest said it 'provides a good example of a stock which combines security of dividend with improving fundamentals'. With results expected towards the end of the month, the securities house once again said it believed the dividend to be secure. Hoare Govett was said to have been the big seller of Hays, which reported unchanged interim figures yesterday. The shares gave up 14 to 227p. SG Warburg was positive on NFC, which closed 3 better at 267p. Shares in Rank Organisation were boosted by recommendations from several brokers. The stock climbed 9 to 676p, with SG Warburg, the company's own broker, among those to recommend the stock. Kleinwort Benson believes the shares to be a buy in the long term. Nervous trading in Ladbroke Group ahead of tomorrow's figures left the shares 2 lighter at 193p. The range of forecasts is between Pounds 185m and Pounds 190m, before property write-downs. Shares in Carlton Communications again suffered from the threat of a competitor in the video copying market and they fell 9 to 769p. Among hotels, Queens Moat Houses was wanted and the shares put on 2 at 52p. The market continued to suspect trading difficulties at Tate &amp; Lyle, where the chief executive resigned on Monday. The shares retreated another 5 to 429p.</p>

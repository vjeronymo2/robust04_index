			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Serbs fire on medical convoy SERB irregulars yesterday again ambushed a van carrying medical supplies into the besieged capital of Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, as United Nations officials started negotiations aimed at reopening the city's airport. A medical assistant was shot dead after a hail of anti-aircraft machine-gun fire sprayed the vehicle which was marked with the Red Cross symbol. Mr Zoran Pirovic, a journalist at Sarajevo radio, said the 'gunmen do not respect any symbols. It is the same story every day. More fighting, more killing, and increased hunger for the people of Sarajevo.' Serb militia and the Yugoslav federal army have been blocking the airport for two months in order to starve the city into submission. UN officials yesterday said the sticking point on agreement to reopen the airport was a dispute over which forces should control it. 'There is no point in lifting the blockade if people cannot travel freely to and from the airport,' a UN official said. UN officials said this would require a considerable UN peace-keeping force. The Bosnian newsagency yesterday reported that the UN was planning to deploy a contingent of 1,000 French peace-keeping troops to protect the airport. A UN official said this 'could be true'. French officials have visited Sarajevo to consider such an option. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic said in a British television interview yesterday that he was ready to resign if that would bring an end to UN sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro, Reuter reports.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Midlands Electricity lifts dividend by 15.9% MIDLANDS ELECTRICITY rounded off the power company results season yesterday with a 17.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits and a 15.9 per cent rise in the dividend - one of the strongest in the sector. Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman, described the result as 'excellent' and said it bore out Midlands' aim to be a broadly defined energy company. 'I have great confidence in the future', he added. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 142.1m to Pounds 167.1m, equivalent to a 13.9 per cent rise in earnings per share. The board is recommending a final dividend of 4.65p, making a total for the year of 20p including the second interim dividend paid in April. This compares with last year's total of 17.25p. Mr Townsend said the benefits of Midlands' performance had been shared almost equally between shareholders, the customers who got tariff reductions of 4 per cent, and the tax man. Much of the profit increase came from a 6.7 per cent reduction in costs, including the loss of 350 jobs over the year. Further manpower reductions are envisaged, bringing annual savings to Pounds 20m. The operating profit on distribution increased from Pounds 137.8m to Pounds 144.3m, and on supply from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 18.8m. The number of electricity units distributed increased by 0.3 per cent. Midlands' interest in power generation took shape with the opening of the Teesside gas-fired plant in which it has a 19 per cent stake. The company is now part of an international consortium, Wing Merrill, which is looking at further generation projects in Kuwait, China and Turkey. Among other businesses, the new retail gas subsidiary acquired 1,000 customers and produced a small operating profit. The retailing side was also in profit, but during the year it was merged into a new venture with Southern and Eastern Electricity which has incurred heavy start up costs. Gearing was reduced during the year to 1 per cent with the repayment of Pounds 75 of government debt. COMMENT The shares gained 8p to 491p in a buoyant electricity market on a result that was stronger than it looked. Midlands tucked away Pounds 38m of provisions, and resisted the temptation to round off the results with a dividend increase to top the rest. The prospects depend on how successful Midlands is with its 'energy company strategy'. It makes sense to widen its base in the business, but is it prudent for a REC to be building power stations in China? Midlands is an average REC share, and its reluctance to make firm pronouncements about dividend prospects mean it will probably stay that way. The prospective yield is a shade under 6 per cent.</p>

It goes without saying that the Korean peninsula is the main  target of the reactionary Radio "Free Asia," which will  broadcast "news and commentaries helpful to the national  interests of the United States."    This is another move of the anti-socialist, anti-DPRK  campaign of the United States. It shows they are executing in  real earnest their "peaceful transition" strategy to disunite  the DPRK ideologically from within.    This is an intolerable challenge to the DPRK.    It is self-evident that the U.S. scheme to start "Free Asia"  broadcasting is aimed at sending the wind of "liberalization"  into our country and thus instilling bourgeois ideology into the  minds of the Korean people and undermining the Korean-style  socialist system centred on the popular masses.    The U.S. attempt to undermine the DPRK ideologically and  culturally by false propaganda through "Free Asia" is as stupid  as trying to move a rock with a mouthful of blowing.    The Korean people firmly equipped with the chuche idea will  never lend an ear to the bourgeois propaganda that does not  appeal to their sentiments.    The United States must clearly know the ideological will of  the Korean people and stop the futile attempt to start the  broadcasting of "Free Asia."</p>

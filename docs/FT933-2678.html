			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Organisation at root of stress Sir, While Lucy Kellaway notes that Silvea Thomas 'finds stress everywhere', it is unfortunate that she promotes such a superficial remedy for workplace stress (Management: 'Give yourself a pat on the head', September 8). Stress at work is mainly caused by employers failing to identify clearly what employees' tasks are; give the training and support to do those tasks; offer any system to resolve difficulties as they arise; and provide a reasonable work environment. So if 5,000, 10,000 or 15,000 workers are sacked (sorry, 'made redundant'), I hardly think that 'stroking their hair or inhaling deeply' is going to be of much help to them or to those remaining - who, after all, are left to pick up the work of those made redundant. While there are measures that can help individuals, it is much more effective to deal with stress organisationally. At least the law in the UK recognises stress as an issue of health at work. Since January this year, employers must undertake a risk assessment of all health and safety hazards. This includes stress. Why wasn't this even mentioned?

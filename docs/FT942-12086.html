			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Indian inflation at highest level for two years Pressure is mounting on the Indian authorities to act to curb inflation after the publication of figures at the weekend showing the annual rate of price increases rising to 10.6 per cent, the highest in nearly two years. The figures, measuring the rate of increase in wholesale prices for the week ending April 9, show inflation has climbed steadily from just 6.9 per cent 12 months ago. With foreign exchange reserves at record levels, finance ministry officials see little risk of a repeat of the 1991 economic crisis when inflation, government borrowing and the balance of payments veered out of control. But they admit that rising prices could undermine efforts to achieve stable growth and to carry out further economic liberalisation. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, and Dr C Rangarajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, have both emphasised in recent speeches the dangers posed by inflation. The government last month acted to try to protect the poor from possible further increases in food prices by lifting restrictions on sugar imports. However, it is not clear how much these measures will limit the overall inflation rate rise, which is being driven not by changes in food prices but by financial pressures - notably persistent government deficits and a surge in foreign investment. The fiscal deficit in the year to March soared to 7.3 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with a target of 4.6 per cent, according to finance ministry figures, which may yet be revised upwards. Meanwhile, foreign investment has soared to about Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.4bn) in 1993-94, far exceeding government forecasts and flooding the financial markets with excess cash. The central bank estimates the money supply grew by 17.9 per cent in the year, up from 14.6 per cent in 1992-93. Commenting on India in its recent report, The World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund listed as 'troubling features' the rekindling of inflation and the weakening of fiscal management. The Reserve Bank is expected to try to curb further money supply growth when it decides its credit policy for the period April-September at a much-delayed board meeting due on May 14. It might balk at raising interest rates since industrial growth is sluggish, but it could raise the minimum deposits commercial banks are required to make at the Reserve Bank. India's exports in the year to March grew 20.4 per cent to Dollars 22.17bn, according to figures announced yesterday by the commerce ministry. They provided fresh evidence that the government's liberalisation of foreign trade and investment is bearing fruit. Imports grew 6.8 per cent to Dollars 23.1bn, leaving a trade deficit of Dollars 1.0bn, compared to Dollars 3.3bn in 1992-93.</p>

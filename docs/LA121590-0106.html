			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANY U.S. BANKS ON BRINK OF INSOLVENCY, REPORT WARNS  </P> <P> Most of the nation's largest banks are teetering on the brink of insolvency and  tax money must quickly be injected into the government fund insuring deposits,  warns a congressional report due out Monday.  </P> <P> Bank failure costs could total $63 billion in a severe recession, it said.  </P> <P> Even the mild downturn expected by most economists would leave the fund short  of cash, said the report, which was written by three economists at the request  of a congressional subcommittee.  </P> <P> "This nation faces an almost unprecedented situation in having most of its  largest banks operating on -- or conceivably, over -- the edge of insolvency,"  said the report, prepared for the House Banking subcommittee on financial  institutions, chaired by Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.).  </P> <P> The study was written by Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, a  Washington-based think tank; James Barth of Auburn University and R. Dan  Brumbaugh of Stanford University. Barth and Brumbaugh are former chief  economists of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the regulatory agency since  dismantled -- of the savings and loan industry.  </P> <P> The report is due to be released at a public hearing Monday, but the Associated  Press obtained the economists' summary on Friday.  </P></p>

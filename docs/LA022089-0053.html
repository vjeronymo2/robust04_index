			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Former Dunes Hotel owner Morris Shenker was indicted for allegedly funneling  hundreds of thousands of dollars to his children to avoid paying back taxes and  bankruptcy creditors. A federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment  against the 82-year-old Shenker, who now resides in St. Louis. FBI spokesman  Tom Nicodemus said Shenker will be issued a summons and will be arraigned on  the charges in St. Louis. Shenker, who operated the Dunes during the 1970s, has  been in bankruptcy protection since January, 1984. According to the indictment,  Shenker allegedly diverted money from a California partnership owned by his  children to individuals in Canada and back to Shenker's secretary in Las Vegas  in an elaborate scheme to avoid his creditors.  </P></p>

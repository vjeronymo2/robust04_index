			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (16): Experience and relationships are vital - Winning contracts in Africa / In South Africa, UK exporters face intense competition from German, Japanese, and US companies Longstanding social and business links between the UK and South Africa were underlined during the visit of prime minister John Major to the republic in September - see the regional focus, on the facing page. 'The strength of the relationship is a very important factor,' emphasises Ian Robinson, chairman of the engineering division of Trafalgar House, who was a member of Mr Major's mission. Many of these links pre-date South Africa's emergence from apartheid and sanctions. Trafalgar House subsidiary Davy International has been supplying equipment to the region's metals processors for over two decades. It won an order in early 1993 for some Pounds 200m worth of hot and cold rolling mills to the Columbus stainless steel plant, 'where UK technology and UK finance are pivotal,' says Mr Robinson. Davy has since secured another contract for the supply of aluminium smelting furnaces for the smaller Alusaf project for which the UK's Export Credits Guarantees Department (ECGD) announced a Pounds 15m project supply line in conjunction with Hill Samuel in April 1994. Experience in the South African market and established links are still critical factors - 'it's a conservative country,' says a banker active in providing trade finance for South African buyers. Other companies such as John Brown Engineering and Rolls Royce have enjoyed a presence there for much of the last 30 years, with involvement in areas such as offshore hydrocarbons development and sales of aerospace engines. Over this period, trade has become increasingly linked to investment. The Industrial Power Group of Rolls Royce operates a local subsidiary company NEI South Africa to tap into the market for industrial power products. The transfer and application of new technology is now a prime feature of UK export contracts to South Africa, says Chris Cox, the Department of Trade and Industry's export promoter for South Africa. 'There has been a lack of investment in machinery,' adds Mr Cox, who spent 13 years at Cable &amp; Wireless (C&amp;W) before secondment to the DTI, and has lived much of his life in southern Africa. Bronx Process Engineering, a UK firm which is involved with the Columbus project, has been selling to South Africa for 25 years. Mr Malcolm Roberts, the company's managing director, says that relationships, developed over many years, have formed the most crucial element in the company's success in the region, though he also emphasises that it adopts a competitive pricing strategy. Bronx specialises in processing equipment for the steel and aluminium industries. It was a nominated sub-contractor to the main Columbus contractor Davy for a Pounds 14m sub-contracting deal. The contract involved the refurbishment of old machinery and the delivery of new equipment - currently being installed at Columbus - to prepare coils for the rolling mills. Long-term financing played a key part in negotiations for the Colombus deal, says Mr Roberts - 'it was eventually done by Davy, through Kleinwort Benson.' Bronx has also won another South African contract, worth Pounds 5m, for equipping Trident Steel, part of the large Anglovaal group. The development of local infrastructure is a source of contracts, but significant orders often call for a commitment to invest. East Midlands Electricity (EME) has injected working capital of Pounds 200,000 into the Phambili Nombane joint venture signed at the end of 1993 with South African and French partners. The consortium expects to deliver electricity by 1996 to the township of Khayelitsha, 30 miles from Cape Town. EME acts as the agent for its South African partner Eskom, which will meet the costs of the project. EME is overseeing the construction, operation and maintenance of the distribution system and provides customer services such as meter reading and billing. In a small, but growing, mobile telephone market, C&amp;W has taken a 25 per cent stake in Mobile Telephone Network (MTN), which received a 15-year operations licence in 1993. The network began operations in April in Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town and Johannesburg, and is in competition with the Vodacom network involving fellow UK concern Vodaphone. Part of the deal involves installing pay-phones in townships, which then connect to the MTN network to become static cellular phones. C&amp;W expects eventually to invest around Pounds 25m in MTN, and has awarded a sub-contract to a UK company for the supply of a digital access cross-control 'running into millions of rands,' says C&amp;W. Accompanying networks include communications software. Network Designers (NDL) has a deal with Telkom, the South African state telecommunications corporation. The order includes the supply of over 5,500 workstations and was secured against tough local and international competition as NDL could meet Telkom's requirements for 'connectionless' network implementation. Software companies did well selling into the cellular market, observes Mr Cox. Smaller exporters have also developed niche sales: Weybridge-based STT Badalex was awarded a Pounds 3.5m contract in June by Consolidated Lamp Manufacturers Pty (CLM) for the delivery of its specialised manufacturing equipment for lamps. CLM, whose shareholders are GEC Alsthom, Barlow Rand and Philips, will site the equipment in Port Elizabeth. For all the region's potential, there are still substantial problems facing exporters to South Africa. One, now being tackled by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is the question of high import tariffs. There is also intense competition from German, Japanese, US and other exporters. While UK companies have 'an inside track to some extent, they cannot rely on the empathy factor,' says Chris Cox. South Africa is a focus for UK official financial support for exporters. Fifteen ECGD-backed credit lines are in place, including, for example, a Pounds 30m line, funded by Kleinwort Benson. By August this year, ECGD exposure to South Africa stood at Pounds 1.35bn and UK government sources indicate that over Pounds 1bn in unused capacity is still available. This makes South Africa the third most important market in the world for ECGD, after China and Hong Kong. The late September trade mission 'opened up some very significant industrial contacts,' says Mr Robinson of Trafalgar House. Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, has hailed South Africa as the gateway to the rest of the continent for UK investment and trade. Certainly in terms of contract awards, it dominates. And in many cases, companies active in the republic are also operating elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa: Davy International, for example, is 'actively pursuing' business in Zimbabwe, C&amp;W has a management deal in Botswana, Badalex recently landed its fifth national contract in Nigeria. EME is active in Zanzibar and Zambia.</p>

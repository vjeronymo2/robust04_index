			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wei Shang-li (7279 1424 4409): "Trade Unions </F> Founded Spontaneously in Various Localities in Guangdong"]    [Text] There are now over five million "non-resident  workers" in Shenzhen and adjacent areas in Guangdong, most of  whom are farmers-turned workers employed by foreign-funded or  private enterprises. Because foreign businessmen and private  enterprise operators -- who are only too interested in making  use of cheap labor -- pay very low wages, labor trouble is a  common occurrence.  <H5>  A Worker's Monthly Pay Is Only 300 Yuan </H5>   According to a restricted report, factory operators in  Shenzhen and nearby areas seriously encroach on workers' rights  and interests to in the following ways.    1. Factory operators pay workers very low wages. Statistics  from the labor personnel department show that a non-resident  worker only gets 300 yuan a month in Shenzhen and adjacent  areas, much lower than wages for local people. Though the  Guangdong Provincial and Shenzhen governments set the minimum  monthly wage at 300 yuan, factory operators in Shenzhen and the  adjacent areas usually pay this minimum figure. As a result,  many "non-resident workers" can save little after spending their  wages on food, clothing, and other daily necessities.  Complaints from these workers, who live a miserable life, are  heard everywhere.    2. The workers' living conditions are extremely inadequate.  To lower their production costs, factory operators cut back  their expenditures on housing for workers and other basic  facilities. In some places, over a dozen workers are packed  into one room, which results in a foul smell. Sanitation  facilities also leave much to be desired, with only one water  tap or water closet provided for many people. Usually the smell  in the water closet is so offensive that one feels like vomiting  when using it. Some factories do not even provide dormitories,  and the workers have to sleep in the workshops, which is rather  dangerous.    3. Safety facilities are not installed as required. Many  factories try to earn as much money as possible and pay no  attention to safety. 1) The equipment is outdated, resulting in  an increasing number of injured and disabled workers; 2) fire  fighting equipment and escape mechanisms are so backward that  the number of fire victims has become alarming. The  conflagration in a foreign-funded factory in Shenzhen, in which  approximately 100 workers were killed, shocked the world; and 3)  working conditions are very poor. The workshops, which are  dirty, noisy, and poorly illuminated, are frightening. And,    4. Workers' welfare is not guaranteed. Workers are not  given subsidies when they fall ill and receive no attention when  they become disabled due to industrial accidents. Many workers  do not have the minimum guarantee of welfare.  <H5>  Workers' Certificates Are Retained To Prevent Them Seeking </H5> Employment in Other Factories    Workers frequently "change their employers" due to the poor  working conditions. To prevent workers seeking new jobs in  other factories, enterprise operators in Shenzhen and nearby  areas typically illegally retain their employees' certificates.  A restricted investigation report states that Shenzhen  government departments often receive complaints from workers  against their employers for illegally detaining their  certificates. Some enterprises in Shenzhen have collected the  workers' identity certificates and border passes and then locked  them in drawers on the excuse of helping them get temporary  residence permits. An employer in a garment processing factory  in Shenzhen did not apply for temporary residence permits for  over 100 workers eight months after collecting their identity  certificates and border passes and refused to give the  certificates back to the workers, despite repeated demands,  using the excuse that the "necessary procedures for applying  temporary residence permits are underway" or that the  "certificates were lost in the process." When the department  concerned, after receiving the complaints, inquired with the  employer about the matter, the latter continued to lie, saying  that they "kept" the certificates because the police substation  rejected the workers' applications for temporary residence  permits. A factory, which specializes in processing supplied  materials, set aside the workers' certificates for fear that  they would seek jobs in other factories, and the employer, when  questioned by the department concerned as to the reason,  shouted: "If I do not retain their certificates, will my  factory not be forced to suspend production if they `go over to  other factories'!"  <H5>  Both Employers and Employees Lack Awareness of the Need To </H5> Abide by the Law    Putting on a long face, a female worker told the following  story: When she, along with a number of fellow villagers, was  employed by a garment factory, the boss took away their  certificates. After receiving a telegram from home telling her  that "her father was seriously ill" and urging her to come home,  she asked the boss for leave and to return her certificate.  Instead of getting back her certificate, she was scolded by her  boss.    Many workers complained: "Since our employer has retained  our certificates, we dare not go out, for fear that we will be  arrested by public security officers if we fail to produce a  certificate. We are on tenterhooks when we are in bed at night,  because public security officers could come to our dormitory and  ask us to produce certificates."    An analysis has revealed that there are three reasons why  employers retain workers' certificates. 1) Some enterprise  operators are undereducated and lack awareness of the need to  abide by the law, so they know nothing about the regulations  regarding identity certificates and believe that it is an  insignificant matter to retain workers' certificates. 2) Some  enterprises which have poor economic efficiency and offer  workers low wages retain workers' certificates for fear that the  workers will seek jobs in other enterprises. 3) Some workers,  who also know nothing about the regulations regarding the  identity certificate, still work honestly for the employer after  their certificates are retained rather than safeguarding their  rights and interests in a lawful way, thus enabling the  employers to have their way. And, 4) Some units recruited  workers before going through the necessary procedures for hiring  workers and could not get temporary residency permits for their  workers. But they cheated the workers by saying they "were  applying for temporary residency permits" for the workers and in  fact kept the certificates in their own hands, refusing to give  them back to the owners for quite some time.  <H5>  The Workers Set Up Trade Unions Simultaneously </H5>   Having their rights and interests been repeatedly encroached  upon, workers in Shenzhen and nearby areas set up trade unions  on their own to deal with the unlawful practices of enterprise  operators. Initial statistics have indicated that there are  currently over 800 trade unions at various levels. The main  task of these trade unions is to seek a solution for the problem  of unequal payments to workers through discussions with  employers. Generally speaking, workers are willing to join  trade unions, but they do not do so openly, because they are  afraid they will be laid off for such activity.    Though these trade unions play a positive role in  safeguarding workers' rights and interests, they have several  serious defects. First, the trade unions are not very  well-organized and resemble secret societies, which lack a set  of management principles and rules, and thus usually act based  on feelings and personal loyalty. Second, many trade unions do  not have a well-considered strategy for safeguarding their  legitimate rights and interests. Instead of dealing with the  employer in a lawful way, they usually choose the method which  is so destructive that foreign investors are quaking in their  boots. Third, some trade unions often set forth inappropriate  demands which are unacceptable to the employer. And fourth, the  trade unions often go so far in their disputes with the  employers that the situation ends up in a mess.    Obviously, the trade unions simultaneously organized by  workers in enterprises in Shenzhen and nearby areas are  different from those set up by the central authorities in a  planned way, but governments at all levels do not take any  action against these unauthorized trade unions. Foreign-funded  and private enterprises are very disgruntled with these  unauthorized trade unions, and the two sides are displaying  great hostility against one another. This has received adequate  attention from the central authorities and provincial and  municipal governments, and it is believed that some measures  will be soon taken to solve the problem.</p>

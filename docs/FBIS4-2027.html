			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 4 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese foreign  currency trading center went into official operation today in  Shanghai, one of the biggest financial centers in China.    Officials with the center said the supply and demand of  foreign currencies at this center will provide an authoritative  standard for China's foreign currency exchange rates.    The trading center is China's first nationwide unified  foreign currency market. It is linked up with trading centers  in other big Chinese cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou,  Shenzhen and Guangzhou, the officials said.    The transactions today proved to be stable. The exchange  rate of U.S. dollars against renminbi yuan opened at 1:8.681 and  closed at 1:8.6908.    In its initial stage, the center will only deal with  transactions in U.S. dollars and Hong Kong dollars against  renminbi. It will pair up sellers and buyers through an  advanced communications and computer system.    Trading members at the center will include 13 domestic  banks,  more than 80 Sino-foreign joint banks and some other financial  organs.</p>

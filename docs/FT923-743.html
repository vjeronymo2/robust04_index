			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Insider trader guilty A FORMER senior managing director of a Japanese machinery maker, Macross, yesterday became the first executive of a listed Japanese company to be found guilty of violating recently-overhauled insider trading laws, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. Mr Yoshio Kamijo, 56, was fined Y500,000 (Pounds 2,360) in the Tokyo District Court, which found that he sold 22,000 shares in Macross immediately before an unfavourable profit forecast in September 1990 that he knew would depress the company's share price. A new Securities and Exchange Law took effect in April 1989, but only two cases have been brought since then. The other involved purchase of shares in Nisshin Steamship by a finance company official who allegedly had prior knowledge of a share allocation.</p>

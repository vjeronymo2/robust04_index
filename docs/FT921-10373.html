			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / World Trade News: EC to extend copyright for heirs of authors HEIRS of authors would earn protected royalties from the writer's work for an additional 10 or 20 years after the writer's death in most EC countries, under draft copyright legislation approved by the European Commission yesterday. The Commission plans to harmonise copyright protection at 70 years in the Community. That would mean an extension of protection in all countries except Germany, which already has a 70-year limit, and Spain, which protects authors' copyright for 60 years. All 10 remaining member states have a limit of 50 years. The rights of performers, broadcasters and record producers would be set at 50 years after publication or broadcasting, compared with between 20 and 50 years in most member states. If approved by EC members states, the legislation could play havoc with publishers' forward planning for this decade. In recent years the industry has welcomed the expiry of copyright as an opportunity to commission new editions of famous works. In Britain, for example, 1992 will see a spate of new editions of the novels of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf. They both died in 1941, and their oeuvres came out of copyright at the beginning of last month. The draft legislation would mean that any writers' work still covered by copyright protection on January 1, 1994, would earn an extension from 50 or 60 years to the new 70-year limit. Protection would not be renewed for works which had already emerged from copyright. The Commission move is aimed at removing potential distortions in the publishing market after internal EC barriers to trade come down at the end of this year. But according to officials the draft directive is also in line with the trend worldwide. The World Intellectual Property Organisation is looking at a standard 70-year limit, and a number of countries have tabled draft legislation which proposes 70 years of protection.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yevgeniy Bovkun in Bonn and Boris Vinogradov in </F> Moscow: "Boris Yeltsin and Helmut Kohl Will Decide How To Give  the Russian Troops a Worthy Send-Off"]    [Text] A final decision on the place and nature of the  Russian troops' send-off will obviously be the main result of  Boris Yeltsin's visit to the FRG, which will end 13 May. The  send-off ceremony itself, scheduled for 31 August, has  unexpectedly caused certain difficulties.    In a personal letter to Yeltsin six weeks ago Kohl proposed  starting the send-off in Weimar, one of the centers of German  culture, and continuing it in the grounds of Berlin's Treptow  Park. The leadership of the Western Group of Forces  categorically rejects Weimar. The former Buchenwald  concentration camp is in the vicinity of the city of Goethe and  Schiller. In addition, Weimar was liberated by the Americans.    A compromise will most likely be found. After all, the  farewell could also take place in Wuensdorf, near Potsdam, where  the Russian troops' headquarters is located.    On 1 July Germany will take over the presidency of the  European Union, and Helmut Kohl has already promised Boris  Yeltsin that he will promote the question of Russia's joining  the Council of Europe, using all his economic and political  clout for this. Helmut Kohl constantly urges the West to treat  Russia as a great power.    Everyone in Germany has made his own preparations for the  Russian president's arrival. On the eve of it DER SPIEGEL  published extracts from his book "On a Knife Edge," NEUES  DEUTSCHLAND carried a lengthy interview with Aleksandr Rutskoy,  FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE printed an article by Gorbachev aide  Anatoliy Chernyayev, and television's second program invited  Nikolay Portugalov, a former CPSU Central Committee adviser, to  speak.    The official program has ended up tightly packed, but it has  repeated the route of one of Gorbachev's trips: political  meetings in Bonn, a cultural program in Speyer with a visit to  the famous cathedral, a brief private visit [uyedineniye] with  Chancellor Helmut Kohl in his native Oggersheim, in Rhine  Palatinate, and then Stuttgart, the capital of  Baden-Wuerttemberg.    Councillors at the German Embassy in Moscow have said that  the visit should be rated a "nonconflict" visit or, as people  used to say, a "friendship visit." Because there are no  unresolved problems, still less disputes, between Germany and  Russia today. All possible treaties and agreements have already  been signed. Now it is only necessary to fulfill them and  exchange opinions.    But, whereas all is in order with the treaties, it is  evidently too soon to speak of a shortage of problems in  bilateral relations. Almost 90 billion marks in aid has gone on  nobody knows what. Economic ties are developing according to  the old scheme. Trade remains monostructural. Russia exports  mainly gas and petroleum products, while machine tools, motor  vehicles, and food go in the other direction. According to the  data for last year, more than 1,000 joint ventures have been  registered -- which is approximately 12 percent of the total  number of joint ventures in Russia (the FRG occupies second  place after the United States in terms of this indicator).    In the foreign policy sphere Russia and Germany have more  reasons to strive to improve cooperation. This time Boris  Yeltsin will not be able to avoid questions about the new  concept of relations with NATO, as Pavel Grachev announced on  the eve [of the visit]. People in Bonn and other European  capitals have already been pondering the riddle set by the  Russian minister of defense. What will a partnership of two very  great military structures be like in real life? A great deal  must be cleared up during the talks between Yeltsin and Kohl.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission  [IEC], Mr. Justice Johann Kriegler, says the commission is  considering amended ballot papers to include the Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP] in the 27 April election.    Judge Kriegler said the IEC had met with representatives of  the South African printing industry to investigate the  possibility of producing amended ballot papers even at this late  stage. He said it was to be hoped that negotiations would  succeed in bringing the IFP into the election. Judge Kriegler  said the election would definitely go ahead.    The IEC would provide the necessary framework and mechanisms  for the election to take place. However, it was up to political  parties and their leaders to ensure that it was free and fair.</p>

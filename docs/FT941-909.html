			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Arts: History means business - Britain is losing a real sense of its past Is the United Kingdom slipping quietly into the role of the historical theme park of Europe? When we first joined the European Union there were many sceptics who predicted that Britain's future was clearly marked out as a museum of industry. How far have the sceptics been proved right and how far has the British appetite for history been allowed to sap our energy for the future? Last week this page recorded the opening of the latest display at the Tower of London - the new Jewel House for the glittering baubles of our Imperial past - which are now shown in a way that combines theatre, the movies and a modicum of history. It is, of course, all in the cause of tourism - millions of visitors have, by the sheer weight of their numbers, set in motion the machine of profit and bureaucracy that will ultimately remove any real sense of the past. In 1989 the Historic Royal Palaces agency was set up to run five unoccupied royal palaces as an independent and profitable business: Hampton Court Palace, Kew Palace, the Tower of London, Kensington Palace (the state apartments only) and the Banqueting House in Whitehall. Since the agency's formation, a great deal has happened, with restorations and improvements brought about to ensure that more people visit more of the palaces, and that each visit is, in some way, made more rewarding. Curiously, it was the fire at Hampton Court Place in 1986 and the subsequent restoration of the King's Apartments that put the new agency on the map. The decision was taken to carry out six years of highly skilled restoration under the inspired direction of a new young curator, Mr Simon Thurley. His decision to present the rooms at Hampton Court exactly as they were left by Sir Christopher Wren, in response to the original commission of King William III, was the right one. Thurley has been much aided by the textile conservation studio, which is based at Hampton Court, and by the general wish to see the palace not merely as a series of empty rooms but as a place where monarchs once lived. The inspiration for the approach at Hampton Court is the palace of Versailles, where the painstaking restoration and rejuvenation of the royal apartments began in the 1970s. The search for authenticity is, however, an entirely elusive thing. No amount of research can precisely capture the way the royal palaces were used. I have written in the past about the highly dubious restoration that went on in the Queen's House at Greenwich, where there was little genuine decoration or furniture. There were some inexcusable things at Greenwich - the photographic copy of ceiling murals, the cheap gilded furniture and everywhere inexpensive materials masquerading as 'authentic' ones. The quality of the work at Hampton Court is in a different league. The raw materials are better but so is the taste and the judgment. There are some grey areas - the costumed guides do smack of a Disney experience and the sensation of everything looking new is curiously neat and depressing. I wonder what foreign visitors really make of the smart apartments? I am old enough to remember the sense of enjoying the old and the shabby at Hampton Court and also the sense of discovery that comes from not being organised and steered as a visitor, of making one's own discoveries. I will never forget the first time, as the only person there on a winter visit, I looked down into the Chapel at Hampton Court. The people I have spoken to at Historic Royal Palaces are full of the word, 'reinterpretation'. It is a word that is also much in vogue at the National Trust. It involves freezing palaces, parks and rooms at a certain moment in history. We are going to see a good example of this at Kensington Palace soon, when the King's Gallery will be 'restored' to the William Kent designs with white and gold panelling, with pictures rehung in William Kent frames. This room will in fact be new but will be described as a restoration. We are on thin ice here and in danger of losing all sense of the marks of time on the walls of our ancient palaces. At Kensington Palace there will also be special 'themed' tours. You will be able to plug into an architectural tour or a costume tour or even a play that will relay the past via your 'Walkman' as you pace the newly polished floors. The past was once seen as a delicate thing that had to be gently nurtured and largely left alone. Now the past is a business and is doing well drumming up the visitors in numbers large enough to kill the things they love. I often feel like a lone voice - I actually like decay and signs of wear and age. I like undiscovered and uninterpreted history. It is the sound byte of history that we are experiencing today. As I went past the Crown of England on the travelator at the Tower, I knew that all sense of real mystery and significance of that once sacred object had gone for ever. Is that what is happening as we sanitise and restore so much of the past? Making all things new and then reinterpreting them as old is a baffling way to maintain a sense of history. But then, perhaps I'm in need of a bit of restoration myself.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian government has appointed Andrey Dagayev  the new Deputy Minister of Foreign Economic Relations.    INTERFAX learned from sources in the government that this  appointment was due to the increasing role of the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations in coordination of foreign economic  activities of the federation's constituent members and to  strengthening control over the export-import operations.  Earlier, Dagayev had headed the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations Department of Export-Import Operations for State Needs  and had been responsible for registration of special exporters.  He will continue to perform these functions in his new post.    Dagayev said in an interview with INTERFAX that state  control  over export activities of the regions would be more important  since the president had issued the decree cancelling quotas and  licensing of export deliveries.</p>

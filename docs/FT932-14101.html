			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: C&amp;W to attack Asian markets CABLE and Wireless, the UK telecommunications company, is planning a joint venture with Hongkong Telecom to penetrate telecommunications markets in Asia, including China. C&amp;W will own 51 per cent of the new company; Hongkong Telecom, in which C&amp;W has a majority shareholding, will have 49 per cent. Although the initial capital investment will be small, Lord Young, chairman of C&amp;W, said the joint venture was intended 'to take a significant share in the region's communications development'. Apart from its Hong Kong interests, consolidated into Hongkong Telecom in 1988, C&amp;W already has several joint ventures or stakes in the regions, including activities in the Philippines, China, Thailand and Macao. Its Asia Pacific business has grown rapidly over five years. By volume, its international traffic in the region was up from 341m outgoing minutes in 1988 to 976m last year. With Asian telecommunications markets growing fast, the joint venture is designed to enable C&amp;W to mobilise its regional expertise to enlarge its share. Mr Mike Gale, chief executive of Honkong Telecom and Asia director of C&amp;W, who is to head the joint venture, said it was 'an ideal vehicle for combining the resources and international reputation of the two companies in the development of business opportunities in Asia.' Hongkong Telecom is one of nine companies set to sign a pact in June or July to lay underwater fibre optic digital cables linking nine Asian nations, at a cost of about USDollars 610m (Pounds 406m). According to Singapore Telecom, another participant, the other seven signatories will be from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Jaguar pay deal Workers at carmaker Jaguar have voted narrowly against strike action to improve a two-year pay deal, it was announced yesterday. Almost 4,000 workers at the Midlands-based company decided in a ballot by just 273 votes to accept the offer, worth 3.5 per cent over the next year and 4 per cent or the inflation rate the year after.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Letter: Grounds for a Lloyds bid for Midland are 'dubious', says union Sir, There has been much recent press speculation about the possibility of Lloyds Bank making a bid to take over Midland Bank. The speculation is allegedly based on sources from within Lloyds Bank. Your own editorial (April 22) seemed to support the idea on the very dubious grounds that 'only a full-scale integration of two banks is likely to bring about the scale of cost-cuts the industry needs'. We are the only union in Midland Bank and have some two-thirds of the staff in membership. In Lloyds Bank, we have over 15,000 members, which again is a significant proportion of the total workforce. We have been involved in discussions with Midland Bank about the bid from Hongkong Bank and have received a number of assurances, which we welcome. We have had no discussion with Lloyds and I find it extraordinary that Lloyds could even consider a merger with Midland without discussing the matter with us, representing many thousands of staff in both banks. If Lloyds were to merge with Midland there would be wholesale branch closures and reductions of staff and - contrary to what your editorial said  -this is not what the industry needs, nor is it what the staff needs. There is a great myth being perpetrated that Britain is 'over-banked'. Such myths carry credence when they are repeated, but there is no evidence for that. In comparison with many other developed countries we are under-banked: there are more people still paid in cash and there are more monetary transactions carried out in cash than elsewhere. Staff numbers in the various British banks have been cut fairly savagely in the last year and the result is that existing staff margins and pressures have become extremely acute. At the same time the pre-tax profit figures - without allowing for the incidence of bad debts because of the economic recession - have been extremely good and this is a direct result of the efforts of the staff in branches up and down the country. If Lloyds makes a bid for Midland, then I trust that the director-general of the Office of Fair Trading will immediately call for a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. I would hope, however, that Lloyds does not make such a bid. If it does, it will add to uncertainty and confusion - and this is the last thing that staff as well as customers need.

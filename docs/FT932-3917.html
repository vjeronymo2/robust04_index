			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Park Food achieves 33% growth to Pounds 10.3m PARK FOOD Group, which specialises in supplying Christmas hampers via a network of 70,000 commission-paid agents into about 1m homes, produced cheery results for the year to March 31. Pre-tax profits rose 33 per cent to Pounds 10.3m, against Pounds 7.7m, on turnover down 3 per cent at Pounds 116.1m (Pounds 119.5m). Earnings per share were 13.29p (10.21p) and a proposed final dividend of 4p makes a total of 6p (3.2p). The seasonal nature of the group's primary business allows it to estimate early its likely performance for the year. On the basis of customer orders already received for Christmas 1993, Park said yesterday it expects results to show similar levels of growth to those of 1992. Then the average customer spend increased by 10.5 per cent. This year the typical spend is 11.2 per cent over that of 1992. The group has some 40 per cent of the total UK Christmas hamper market, which is worth an estimated Pounds 300m. Two subsidiaries - Jetlag, supplying travellers' kits to airlines and hotels, and Bee Cee Foods, the group buying arm - continued to contribute to overall profitability. Mr Peter Johnson, chairman, said that the group was interested in both organic and acquisition growth. He added that while Park Food had not been approached by potential buyers, 'we are, no doubt, ourselves a juicy morsel'.</p>

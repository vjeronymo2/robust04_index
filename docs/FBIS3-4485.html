As part of the drive, the semi-official trade promotion body  is organizing a delegation of machinery manufacturers and  traders to attend an international trade fair to be held in  Bogota, Colombia in July, the spokesman reported.    CETRA will provide transport subsidies for local machinery  manufacturers who want to exhibit their products at the Bogota  trade show, the spokesman said.    "We are also compiling a list of major Colombian machinery  importers and will help local manufacturers negotiate trade  deals with them," the spokesman said. "We hope we can sell all  the Taiwan machines displayed at the Bogota show," he added.    The spokesman said the biennial Bogota Trade Fair used to  focus on consumer goods, but, starting this year, it will also  feature machines and other production equipment.    The demand for production facilities in Bogota and other  Latin American countries has been growing steadily in recent  years, fueled by recovering economies, the spokesman said.    Moreover, the spokesman said, Bogota has largely cut its  tariff rates on machinery imports. "This is a good time for  Taiwan machinery makers to penetrate that market," he noted.    CETRA will rent a large booth for local manufacturers to  display their machinery at the Bogota fair, the spokesman said.  "Local manufacturers of plastics, footwear, textile and molding  machines are welcome to join the CETRA mission to tap the  Colombian market," he added.    If the Bogota show turns out to be a success, the spokesman  said, CETRA will use similar tactics to help local machinery  manufacturers explore other Latin American markets.</p>

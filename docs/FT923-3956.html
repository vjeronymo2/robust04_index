			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow lower as market reflects on jobs data Wall Street US SHARE prices weakened across the board yesterday as investors continued to digest the implications of Friday's disappointing employment news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 21.34 down at 3,260.59, near the day's low. The market was closed on Monday for Labor Day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 declined 2.64 to 414.44, while the American SE composite slipped 1.49 to 383.36 and the Nasdaq composite lost 2.27 to 571.17. Turnover on the New York SE was light at 161m shares. The ramifications of last week's announcement by the Labor department that non-farm payrolls had fallen 83,000 in August, against analysts' expectations of a rise (analysts had been expecting a solid increase in payrolls), continued to dominate market sentiment. The main focus of attention was on monetary policy, and whether the Federal Reserve would follow Friday's  1/4 percentage point reduction in the Federal Funds rate to 3 per cent with a similar, or bigger, cut in the more important discount rate. Speculation has also centred on the possibility of additional fiscal stimulus for the economy. HJ Heinz fell Dollars 1 in early trading after the food group appeared to disappoint the market with fiscal first-quarter profits of 55 cents a share, down sharply from the 95 cents earned at the same stage a year ago. Analysts later hailed the figures as a solid result, once one-off factors were excluded, and the shares ended a net Dollars  3/8 off at Dollars 41 1/2 . Banks were lower on concern that they would gain little from lower interest rates and that this year's rally in the sector could be over. Chemical retreated Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 31 1/2 , Chase Manhattan Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 22, BankAmerica Dollars 1 to Dollars 42 7/8 and Citicorp Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 15 1/2 . The repercussions of Hurricane Andrew, now deemed the worst natural disaster in US history, continued to afflict certain stocks. Sears Roebuck dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 40 3/4 in active trading after Wall Street securities house Salomon Brothers cut its 1992 earnings estimate for the company from Dollars 4.20 a share to Dollars 3 to reflect the greater than expected losses that Sears' Allstate Insurance subsidiary expects to incur because of hurricane damage in south Florida and Louisiana. Genentech climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 33 1/2 after broking house Smith Barney upgraded the stock to a 'buy' in the expectation that new product introductions will spur a sharp rise in earnings for the California biotech company. Carriage Industries jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 12 1/4 on news that the carpet supplier and manufacturer's chairman and his affiliates plan to sell their 46.5 per cent stake to textiles group Dixie Yarns for Dollars 13.25 a share in cash. Dixie Yarns fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 9 1/2 on the Nasdaq market. Canada THE Toronto market stayed within a narrow range all day in spite of the downward pressure exerted by the lower Wall Street values. The TSE 300 index eased only 4.9 to 3,451.9, while overall advances held a small lead over declines by 267 to 252 after volume of 29.4m shares valued at CDollars 308.8m. Seagram receded CDollars  5/8 to CDollars 34 3/4 . The board has renewed the company's authorisation to buy up to 5 per cent of its common shares, a maximum of 18.8m shares.</p>

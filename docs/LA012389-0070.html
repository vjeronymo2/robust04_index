			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IS MCENROE MELLOWING? WOODFORDE THINKS SO  </P> <P> John McEnroe, in his first appearance in the Australian Open since 1985, says  he has made a conscious effort to relate to the fans here at the National  Tennis Center.  </P> <P> And he has become a crowd favorite, the fans seeming to appreciate his tennis  ability for all its artistry.  </P> <P> Has he made a conscious effort with the lines judges, too?  </P> <P> It might not have looked that way last Friday when he was fined $500 for verbal  abuse of a linesman, but McEnroe is trying to take a more mellow approach.  </P> <P> And Mark Woodforde of Australia, who in this tournament is McEnroe's doubles  partner for this first time, says he has seen a change.  </P> <P> "After I beat him at the U.S. Open (last year), he came up to me and shook  hands and said, 'Good match, Mark. You played really well and I hope you do  well in the tournament.'  </P> <P> "No one ever does that. I think that's an indication that he's trying to change  and I think he's achieving it."  </P> <P> McEnroe, seeded seventh here, says he thinks he has made "a transition from a  real kid to a man."  </P> <P> "Just seeing what I've done in the past, I realize it's not what I want to be  doing when I'm 30," he said. "I've changed quite a bit in the last 2 years for  the better."  </P> <P> But with his 30th birthday less than 5 weeks away, McEnroe says his game has  not taken a turn for the better as quickly as he would like. He says he has not  found the inner drive he once possessed, and is not sure if it will ever come  back.  </P> <P> "I now wonder how I was that intense for that long of time; that I was able to  get up for so many matches," he said after beating Patrick Kuhnen of West  Germany, 6-2, 7-5, 6-2, in the third round here. "In retrospect, I actually  felt like I had come back too soon. I would probably have liked to take more  time off to get the juices flowing more."  </P> <P> McEnroe said the pressure from family, friends and sponsors played a part in  his decision to return to the game.  </P> <P> The break was necessary to evaluate his life and take responsibility for his  world outside a tennis court.  </P> <P> "The 8 or 9 years on the circuit had gone so fast," said McEnroe, whose wife  Tatum O'Neal and two sons chose to stay at home in Malibu rather than making  the trip to Australia. "I had accomplished a lot in tennis and received a lot  of rewards for it, but I was looking at life negatively. I needed to take a  step back and decide where I wanted to go, especially as a human being."  </P> <P> Today, McEnroe says he has a desire to win, but doesn't let the desire run his  life.  </P> <P> "It's a great challenge to try to get to the top again, but I'm not going to  try to worry about being No. 1. In some ways, I'm not sure if I want to be No.  1 again because I don't want to be on top again the way it was in the past. I  wasn't enjoying myself the way I would have liked."  </P> <P> Players such as Woodforde welcome the new McEnroe as a friend.  </P> <P> "It was a strange feeling last week driving to play golf in my new car, in my  hometown, with John sitting in the passenger seat. I had to pinch myself to  believe it was all happening," Woodforde said. "I can't believe tennis has  given me the opportunity to be friends with a guy I've always admired."  </P> <P> For McEnroe, the trick is getting more than Woodforde to notice the change.  </P></p>

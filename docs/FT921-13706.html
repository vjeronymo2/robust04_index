			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Ukraine ignores appeal not to break up forces UKRAINE has brushed aside an appeal by officers of the former Soviet army not to break up the armed forces, saying it does not recognise the legitimacy of a conference held by 5,000 officers who voted for an indivisible force. Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk also reiterated his threat to leave the fledgling commonwealth of 11 former Soviet states if Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the commonwealth commander in chief, tries to prevent Ukraine from pressing ahead with plans for its own army. 'If Marshal Shaposhnikov can change the decisions of the heads of state overnight, then that kind of commonwealth of independent states will find it very difficult to survive,' he told reporters yesterday. Commonwealth leaders last month agreed that Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova should be allowed to create their own armies, while vaguely-defined strategic forces would remain under unified command. However, the leaders did not work out a clear mechanism or timetable for altering the composition of the former Red Army to allow for republican armies. Earlier, Mr Kravchuk was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying it was not 'clear at all whom the delegates to the Moscow all-army conference represented, and by whom and on what legal basis they were elected'. Delegates to Friday's conference voted unanimously for maintaining the unity of the world's largest army. Marshal Shaposhnikov has said he hoped the message from the officers would push commonwealth leaders into solving 'military issues more seriously, fruitfully and in a considered manner' when they meet in Minsk next month. In an unprecedented foray into inter-republican politics, the officers' conference voted to send a delegation to the February 14 summit. '(We) must compel the state leaders to listen to the officers and correct their previous decisions,' one of the air force delegates, Major A Taranenko, told the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star). The conference has undoubtedly boosted attempts by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and other republican leaders, such as Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev, to retain a single commonwealth army. But although it may discourage other republics such as Moldova and Azerbaijan from unilateral takeovers of the armed forces, the conference vote is unlikely to reverse steps already taken by Ukraine to set up its own army, which the republic has described as essential to preserving its independence. In a clear sign of Ukrainian determination, 99.4 per cent of servicemen of the Kiev military district on Saturday swore allegiance to the newly-independent republic, followed by officers and soldiers from the Odessa and Carpathian districts, Tass reported. Marshal Shaposhnikov said after the conference that while Ukraine was still determined to take over land forces on its territory, there was hope for a 'constructive dialogue' on the future of the Black Sea Fleet  - the bulk of which, according to the marshal, would remain commonwealth property. However, reiterating the view expressed at the conference that the army would never forcibly intervene in politics, General Valery Patrikeyev, commander of the volatile Transcaucasus district, said he would keep out of Georgia's internal power struggle.</p>

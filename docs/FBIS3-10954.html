			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Mar (EFE) -- Colombian  Agriculture Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo has said Colombia will  sell rice, African palm oil, pork, poultry, and grain to Cuba in  keeping with a preliminary agreement signed between both  countries.    Colombia and Cuba also agreed in February that Colombia  would  sell 20,000 barrels of oil per day to the island, a fact that  has provoked protests from opponents of Cuban President Fidel  Castro's regime.    The preliminary agreements for food sales were the result of  Colombian Deputy Agriculture Minister Santiago Perry's visit to  Havana. Perry has said Cuba will design and build a pilot plant  for the production of biological control measures in Colombia.  Likewise, a joint project will be developed to obtain banana  strains resistant to Black Sigatoka via genetic engineering  techniques, and research will be conducted to combat the white  fly, which attacks vegetables.    Colombian Agriculture Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo will  travel to Havana shortly to ratify the agreements.</p>

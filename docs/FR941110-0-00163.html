			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree that a temporary manager would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be able to do his or her job effectively without being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oriented to the task, and will direct the State survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies in our State Operations Manual to provide an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> orientation, the form of which shall be determined by them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters requested that we impose an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforceable limit on the salary of the temporary manager,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and a large number of those recommended that we use the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevailing salary limit set forth in the preamble to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPRM. Other commenters proposed that we require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensation for the temporary manager to be set at a rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient to attract people with the necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifications, and they recommended that we not limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salary of the temporary manager to the rate mentioned in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble. These commenters were concerned that it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unlikely to draw the expertise needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters requested that we identify who will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the salary of the temporary manager, and certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of those asked whether it will be negotiable. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter asked if the facility will be obligated to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits to the temporary manager.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  After reviewing the comments we received,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we have concluded that the salary limit put forth in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble to the proposed rule would not be in the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interests of facilities or their residents because it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make it difficult to attract qualified temporary managers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The temporary managers that are available are sometimes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located long distances from the facilities which need them,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and unless the salary offered is sufficiently attractive, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not induce individuals to temporarily upset their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normal routines and accept the challenge of managing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severely deficient facility. If temporary managers cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be secured, we will have no choice but to proceed with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination. In order to avoid this result and promote the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of temporary management as an alternative remedy, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will give facilities the flexibility to exceed the salary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floor specified below if the State is otherwise unable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attract a qualified temporary manager and the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considers a higher payment preferable to termination. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salary of the temporary manager must be at least equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the prevailing salary paid by providers in the facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic area for positions of this type, plus the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevailing cost of certain additional allowances. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional allowances will include costs that would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably been incurred by the provider if the temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager had been in an employment relationship, such as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of a benefits package, prorated for the amount of time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the temporary manager is working in the facility. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility will also be responsible for any other costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurred by the temporary manager in furnishing services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under such an arrangement or as otherwise set by the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the State is in a better position than HCFA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the prevailing salary and other employment related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs of a nursing home administrator within what the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considers to be the facility's geographic area, it will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for setting the salary/benefits floor of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary manager and for determining whether or not it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to exceed it. The State may consult with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider while it determines the appropriate salary, but we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not require that the salary of the temporary manager be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter asked what would happen if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility agreed to temporary management, but then failed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pay the salary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are considering requiring that facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pay the salary of the temporary manager before the remedy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begins, which would eliminate the need for a recoupment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategy. Until a decision is made, the mechanism that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently used to recover Medicare and Medicaid funds from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities which have been overpaid will be used to collect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money from any facilities that owe the salary of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary manager. The amount owed would be withheld from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future amounts due to the facility from HCFA or the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because Medicare and Medicaid payments may continue for up  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 30 days after termination, salaries may be recouped even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when they are owed by terminated facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A large number of commenters disagreed with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provision that the temporary manager's salary be paid by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility. A few commenters stated that the money spent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on temporary management would be better spent by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility on its own improvements. Certain commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complained that a lack of sufficient funds is often what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leads to noncompliance, and so they were concerned that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy would be worthless without additional funding. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of commenters argued that a facility's inability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pay for temporary management should not preclude its use as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a remedy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters recommended that the temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager's salary be paid out of a fund composed of civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalties collected by the State, and certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters cited 42 U.S.C. 1396r(h)(2)(A)(ii) (section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act) as establishing the authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to do so. Other commenters believed that States should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to use funds collected through imposition of civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalties to cover the costs of correcting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies incurred by the temporary manager, but only if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility cannot afford to pay these costs itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain commenters believed that the facility and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators should be liable to the fund for reimbursement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses. One commenter recommended that the States should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be authorized to impose liens on the facility and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets of the corporate entity until the facility reimburses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fund. Another commenter believed that the States should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be charged with the duty of using all available collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods afforded by law to recoup expenditures from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter noted that 42 U.S.C. 1396r(h)(2)(E) (section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(2)(e) of the Act) provides that temporary management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs are legitimately payable administrative expenses of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State. Therefore, this commenter and others believed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the temporary manager's salary and the costs that he or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> she incurs while managing the facility should be borne by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State and reimbursed under the State's Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

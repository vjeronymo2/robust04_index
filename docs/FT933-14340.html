			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Regional aid rules approved MEPs last night over-whelmingly approved new rules for the EC's 1994-99 regional development and structural aid programme, removing a major hurdle for disbursement of around Ecu141.5bn (Pounds 107.96bn) in the new year. The favourable parliamentary opinion paves the way for the final go-ahead of the biggest-ever EC development programme at a meeting of EC foreign ministers next Monday, barring last-minute objections from Ireland and Greece. Under the deal the UK will receive special aid for Merseyside and the Scottish Highlands, including Argyll, Bute and West Moray. With this and other funding, the UK could receive between Ecu5bn and Ecu6bn over the next six years. Prospects for a comprehensive deal rose earlier this week after the Irish government lifted its veto, despite its claim to IPounds 8bn which it claims was guaranteed in last December's EC summit in Edinburgh. Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, has been in close touch with Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, and Mr Bruce Millan, EC commissioner responsible for regional affairs, in an effort to resolve outstanding differences. MEPs voted 317 to 8, with only four objections, and generally welcomed the new aid programme.</p>

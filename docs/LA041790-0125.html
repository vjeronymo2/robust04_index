			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COURT REJECTS USE OF PEYOTE AS A RELIGIOUS RIGHT  </P> <P> The Supreme Court ruled today there is no constitutional right to take the  hallucinogenic drug peyote as a religious practice.  </P> <P> The justices, voting 6-3, said Oregon officials may deny unemployment benefits  to two fired drug counselors who ingested small amounts of peyote in Indian  religious ceremonies.  </P> <P> Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said the First Amendment does  not permit people to break the law in the name of religious freedom.  </P> <P> "We have never held that an individual's religious beliefs excuse him from  compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting the conduct that the state  is free to regulate," he said.  </P> <P> Oregon's drug laws do not "regulate religious beliefs, the communication of  religious beliefs or the raising of one's children in those beliefs," Scalia  added.  </P> <P> In a strongly worded dissent, Justice Harry A. Blackmun accused the court of  treating religious freedom for the first time as a "luxury" rather than "an  essential element of liberty."  </P> <P> He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall.  </P> <P> Scalia's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices  Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy.  </P> <P> Justice Sandra Day O'Connor provided the sixth vote to deny the unemployment  benefits to the fired drug counselors. But she said in a separate concurring  opinion that the five other justices in the majority went too far in limiting  religious freedom.  </P> <P> Peyote is a cactus "button" containing the hallucinogen mescaline.  </P> <P> Lawyers for Galen W. Black and Alfred C. Smith said using small quantities of  peyote in a church service is comparable to sacramental use of small quantities  of wine in Christian religious ceremonies.  </P> <P> But state officials said that if peyote is permitted in church ceremonies it  will create a wedge for allowing other drugs, such as marijuana, to be used by  other religious groups.  </P> <P> Oregon officials also argued that creating an exception for peyote would be a  violation of constitutionally required separation of church and state.  </P> <P> In another decision, the court made it more difficult for employers to withdraw  recognition of a labor union representing striking workers after new employees  are hired to break the strike.  </P> <P> Today's 5-4 decision in a Texas case reversed a federal appeals court ruling  that said the National Labor Relations Board must presume that strikebreakers  oppose the strikers' union.  </P> <P> "Replacements may in some circumstances desire union representation despite  their willingness to cross the picket line," Justice Marshall wrote for the  court.  </P></p>

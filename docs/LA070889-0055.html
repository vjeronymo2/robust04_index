			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VATICAN PRAISES ABORTION RULING  </P> <P> The Vatican's chief guardian of doctrine on Friday praised this week's U.S.  Supreme Court ruling that allows states to restrict abortion.  </P> <P> "The decision is a sign of the birth of a new moral consciousness on abortion,"  Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph A. Ratzinger said at a news conference at Madrid  University.  </P> <P> "It is a kind of move away from earlier attitudes, where I see a reflection  that weighs more on the side of the value of human life," said the prefect of  the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which makes sure that church  officials adhere to Catholic doctrine.  </P> <P> Ratzinger made the comments after delivering a lecture entitled "Jesus Christ  Today" at a university seminar.  </P> <P> In a decision issued Monday, the Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 to give the states  broader powers to restrict the availability of abortions. The ruling narrowed  the court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion.  </P></p>

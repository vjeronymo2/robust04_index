			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: The Limited recovers with a 10% increase The Limited, a US clothing retailer, improved on its recent weak financial performance by reporting a 10 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 90.5m from Dollars 82.2m in the third quarter to October. Mr Leslie Wexner, chairman and chief executive, said: 'This quarter is early confirmation that the changes we've made in our business are having a positive effect.' The Limited has been experiencing good performances in its lingerie, men's, children's and Bath and Body Works businesses. However, these have been outweighed by poor results from its core women's fashion accessories stores, trading as The Limited and Lerner New York. Yesterday Mr Wexner said the company had been focusing on margin recovery at its women's clothing stores for several months. 'We have tightly controlled our inventories and expenses,' he said. 'As the third quarter ended, in addition to the margin rate recovery, we began to see improvements in our store-for-store sales comparisons at our women's fashion businesses.' Revenues for the group as a whole rose by 6 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn, with most of the increase coming from the lingerie, men's, children's and body care businesses. Earnings per share rose to 25 cents from 23 cents . Mr Wexner said the Bath and Body Works joint venture in the UK launched its first three stores during the quarter, and initial customer response met or surpassed The Limited's expect-ations. Dillard Department Stores, one of the biggest US department store groups with 232 outlets, increased net income by 20 per cent to Dollars 50.8m from Dollars 42.4m in the third quarter to September. Revenues increased to Dollars 1.3bn from Dollars 1.2bn. Earnings per share rose to 45 cents from 38 cents.</p>

[see item PM1002162494 in Near East Regional  Affairs section of previous Terrorism Report]    However, contacts between Sudanese authorities and Israel  over Khartoum's mediation with Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the  occupied territories have continued in Europe and the United  States.    The Sudanese move took place in December when "mutual  friends" conveyed a message from Khartoum to Paris. The  Sudanese message said that an alliance between "the Armed Forces  and Islamists along the lines of the Sudanese model" could solve  the Algerian problem. A senior Sudanese intelligence officer  visited Paris twice in January and met with Defense Ministry  officials.    The French sources confirmed that a meeting was held between  Colonel Jean-Claude Mantione [as transliterated], expert in  black African affairs, and the Sudanese general. However, the  sources said that the meeting did not broach the situation in  Algeria. Instead, the two men discussed the regional dispute  between Central Africa and Sudan. There are reports that Bangui  is planning to occupy a strip of Sudanese territory which it  claims belongs to it.    First reports about the secret contacts between Paris and  Khartoum emerged last month. The news provoked opposition and  criticism from Sudanese opposition leaders in Cairo. They met  with the French ambassador in Cairo. He denied the report,  describing them as baseless.    Khartoum has for some time persisted in presenting itself to  the West as a mediator with fundamentalist forces in Africa and  the Middle East. And Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, secretary general of  the National Islamic Front in Sudan, expressed his support for  the agreement between the PLO and Israel. He also criticized  Algerian FIS leader Abassi Madani for not taking account of  France's opinion during the general elections two years ago.    FIS leaders in exile have rejected Khartoum's move vis-a-vis  Algeria. In a press interview yesterday Rabeh Kebir said that  he had heard about these contacts from the media only. He said  "if that is true, it is regrettable, because it represents a  biased move in favor of the military group in Algeria."    Contacts with Israel began in Geneva last year when two  Sudanese envoys met with a Swiss businessman close to Tel Aviv.    Western intelligence sources say that Khartoum offered to  help win over the support of the Palestinian rejectionist  movements, especially Hamas, opposed to the agreement between  the PLO and Israel. In return, Khartoum wanted Israel to help  to open the channel of dialogue with Washington.    In December Hasan al-Turabi persuaded the Islamic Conference  in Khartoum not to adopt hard-line positions against the West  and Israel.    Khartoum's attempt to move closer to Paris is attributable  to  the Sudanese belief that France is seeking to open a dialogue  with some of the "isolated regimes," including Iran and Iraq.    But the French sources said that "no one wants to buy what  Sudan is offering." Khartoum's recent initiatives have led to a  state of coolness in relations with Tehran. Late last year  Iranian media services described al-Turabi's attempt to mediate  in Afghanistan as "suspicious." Tehran turned down al-Turabi's  request to visit it to discuss Afghanistan, so the mediation  failed before it began. Western analysts say that recent  Sudanese moves are linked with the deterioration of economic  conditions and the Sudanese leadership's hopes of neutralizing  the West while the Sudanese Army prepares to launch large-scale  new military operations in the south.</p>

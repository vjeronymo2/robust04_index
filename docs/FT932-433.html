			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Howard outlines blueprint for police THE white paper on police reform published yesterday sets out a Home Office blueprint intended to forge a new partnership between Britain's police force and the community against crime. Unveiling wide-ranging plans for what he called 'a police service for the 21st century', Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said they would enable the police to better focus on a clear set of priorities while revitalising community support for their activities. The plans include the recruitment of more special constables, the strengthening of local police authorities, greater flexibility to fix local policing budgets and the regular publication of performance targets and results for individual forces. Mr Howard said there were four main elements to his proposals, all of which he would like to see in place by April 1995. To strengthen links with the public he is setting a new target to raise the number of special constables in England and Wales from the present total of nearly 20,000 to 30,000. Local police authorities, which will be smaller, will develop local policing plans in consultation with the public and have to publish their performance to compare with other forces. To make police authorities better reflect local interests the government says they will have 16 members, comprising eight local councillors, three magistrates and five local people appointed by the home secretary, who will also appoint a paid chairman. In collaboration with the chief constable, police authorities will set their own budgets, allowing the Home Office to relinquish detailed controls on staffing and capital expenditure. Authorities will decide on the best mix of police officers, civilian staff, equipment and other resources. Central government grants will, however, be cash-limited. The home secretary will set out the main objectives for the police service, providing a national framework for assessing police performance. Mr Howard, who said he wanted to see less 'paper pushing', also announced a review of administration procedures. He said he wanted the Home Office to retain responsibility for the Metropolitan Police, in spite of the suggestion by Mr Kenneth Clarke, his predecessor, that the capital might get its own independent police body. But he said he would no longer rely solely on advice from Home Office officials and would establish a new body to set the Metropolitan Police budget, monitor its performance and publish annual performance results. The home secretary said he accepted that it might be desirable eventually to reduce the number of police forces operating in England and Wales from 43, but added that amalgamations should only take place after progress had been made on his other reforms.</p>

L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, 1955, 1962, and 2098, amended title 23, U.S.C., and the Federal Transit Act by revising sections 134 and 135 of title 23 and section 8 of the Federal Transit Act (49 U.S.C. app. 1607) which require a continuing, comprehensive, and coordinated transportation planning process in metropolitan areas and States.

As the agencies conduct certification reviews in FY 1994 we will be looking at possible modifications based both on the experience of having conducted the reviews and on the comments received on the guidance and during the reviews. Specifically, the FHWA and FTA are interested in comments regarding the process of review, appropriate sources of information to be considered during the review, and the role of key government officials and the public in providing input to the review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Public Involvement in Certification Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FHWA and FTA are soliciting public comment on the planning processes of the FY 1994 certification review sites identified below.

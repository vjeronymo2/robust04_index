			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: GPG acquires Brown Shipley GUINNESS Peat Group, the UK investment vehicle of New Zealand entrepreneur Sir Ron Brierley, is taking over Brown Shipley Holdings, the investment and broking business, in an agreed bid which values BSH at Pounds 5.6m. GPG has reached agreement with Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise, previously BSH's largest shareholder, to buy its 29.8 per cent stake for 35p a share. GPG has already acquired 29.9 per cent of the equity. It is also paying Pounds 1.8m to KBL to settle claims against BSH. KBL was the original bidder for BSH in February. It offered 30p a share after potential claims emerged against BSH amounting to Pounds 2.4m. These arose from indemnities given to KBL when it bought Brown Shipley and Co, BSH's banking arm, last year. The claims threatened to reduce BSH's net assets to less than half the Pounds 16m called up capital. Brown Shipley's share price slid from 51p after the claims were revealed and KBL launched its offer. KBL said: 'When someone was prepared to make a higher offer and settle the claims, this was a more than acceptable solution.' GPG regained its stock market listing in November after a suspension lasting nearly two years. It has investments in about 25 companies, the largest being Tyndall Australia, a life assurance company. In the 15 months to December GPG made unaudited pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.8m and had shareholders' funds of about Pounds 49.5m. BSH made a Pounds 27.1m pre-tax loss in 1991-92. In the six months to September it made a loss before tax, exceptionals and non-banking interest of Pounds 839,000.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In talks today delegations from the Romanian and  French Defense Ministries reviewed the current stage in  bilateral relations and their perspectives and assessed the  current situation in Europe and the tendencies of security  structures at the continental level.    Romanian National Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca told us  that he had asked French Minister Leotard to urge the important  French companies to come to Romania to cooperate both in the  field of military equipment and in the civilian economy.    Similarly they assessed cooperation between Romania and  France, as well as between the two armed forces, within the  framework of NATO, in the context of the Partnership for Peace  initiative, and within the Western European Union [WEU], where  they noted Romania's status as an associate partner within that  organization, a status granted to central European countries.    The talks also focused on the perspectives of strengthening  European stability, the readiness of the two parties to  cooperate in that domain, and the possibilities opened by the  stability pact initiated by French Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur.    The talks held this afternoon by the Romanian and French  defense delegations proved to be a good opportunity to reconfirm  the friendly relations between Romania and France and the two  armed forces and the mutual desire to further those relations,  in view of the need for cooperation to find the most favorable  solutions to remodel the security context and common future of  united Europe.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Figures and fiction: UK TV groups face upheaval The day after Christmas, the BBC showed a feature film-length version of One Foot in the Grave, its hit comedy about the curmudgeonly pensioner, Victor Meldrew. The accident-prone grump pulled an audience of 20m for his One Foot in the Algarve and helped to clinch a holiday ratings triumph for the corporation. On Wednesday the BBC launches its most expensive costume drama, the Pounds 6m six-part adaptation of George Eliot's novel, Middlemarch. The contrast this week with the commercial ITV network could not be more stark. There the talk is not of populist programmes and Victorian fiction, but about the cut-and-thrust of multi-million corporate deals and the first signs that newspaper groups, looking over their shoulders at media link-ups in the US, might before long be allowed to own commercial broadcasting companies in the UK. Following the government's decision in November to allow one company to own two ITV licences, a mould-breaking process of consolidation is under way. This week a majority of Central shareholders accepted an agreed bid, worth about Pounds 750m, by Carlton Communications, holder of the London weekday licence. Meanwhile, London Weekend Television continued its struggle, against apparently overwhelming odds, to avoid being swallowed up by Granada, the leisure and television group, in a hostile bid worth about Pounds 670m. 'ITV is undergoing fairly significant change and we will not fully understand it before the end of the year, until the dust settles,' said Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive of London Weekend Television. This week LWT lost a significant round in its battle to stay independent. The company confirmed that takeover talks with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees had collapsed. Under the plan LWT would have taken over the Yorkshire Television broadcasting licence and Anglia would have taken over Tyne Tees. As part of the deal Anglia would have received a share of the combined earnings of the overall Yorkshire-Tyne Tees group, based on the amount it invested in the agreement. Even though Yorkshire was prepared to recommend the deal, the Anglia board said 'no', leaving itself a takeover target. LWT plans to continue with a defence based on its managerial record, backing it up with the publication next week of a profit forecast that could top Pounds 40m for 1993. City analysts nevertheless regard a Granada victory as inevitable following the collapse of the Yorkshire talks. Meanwhile, Lord Hollick, chief executive of MAI, the main shareholder in Meridian Broadcasting, the south of England ITV company, is interested in an agreed merger with Anglia but only at the right price. It is not clear that he will pay the present one of 472p or that Anglia is planning to fall quietly into his arms. But few in the industry believe Anglia is big enough to remain independent in the longer term. With a further relaxation of the ITV ownership rules possible, allowing ownership of more than two licences before the end of this year, Carlton, Granada and possibly MAI could emerge as the dominant players in the network. These chess moves gathered pace against the background of an announcement by national heritage secretary Peter Brooke that the government plans a comprehensive review of the UK's restrictive cross-media ownership rules. At the moment newspaper publishers cannot own more than 20 per cent of a commercial broadcaster in the UK. The review was promised in November, when the ITV ownership rules were liberalised. But the setting up of the review, bringing together officials from National Heritage, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Treasury and the 10 Downing Street Policy Unit is a sign that change is likely - although to allow newspapers to own ITV companies would require legislation. The government is trying to square a difficult circle - maintaining diversity and choice for audiences while creating UK media organisations large enough to play on the world stage. The setting up of the review has pleased newspaper owners, several of whom have been lobbying for months under the banner of the British Media Industry Group for media ownership rules to be eased. The group brings together four newspaper publishers: Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail; The Guardian Media Group; Pearson, owner of the Financial Times; and The Telegraph, which wants to expand its television interests. One option for examination is whether ownership of the media should be treated like other industrial activities and regulated through existing monopoly and mergers rules. So far, the upheavals have been about purely UK domestic battles, even though since January 1 the relaxation of ownership rules has made it easier for European Union companies to take over ITV companies. So far the silence has been deafening. If a continental invasion were ever to materialise, on top of the existing turmoil, executives at the ITV companies might exclaim - to use Victor Meldrew's catchphrase - 'I don't believe it'.</p>

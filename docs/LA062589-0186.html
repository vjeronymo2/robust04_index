			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DEATH OF Z CHANNEL -- WHAT NOW?;  </P> <P> VIEWERS CAN TURN TO OTHER STATIONS TO HELP FILL THE VOID  </P> <P> There'll never be another Z Channel. It was one-of-a-kind television, shaped by  a personal vision and guided by eclectic tastes. But there are other pay-TV and  basic-cable channels that Z viewers can turn to, even if their tastes run to  offbeat films, little-known works of famous directors and foreign films with  sensible subtitles instead of out-of-sync dubbing. They just won't find  everything in one place anymore.  </P> <P> Here's a viewer's guide to the other cable channels that primarily run movies:  </P> <P> Mainstream movies. Pick any pay service. Home Box Office, Cinemax, Showtime and  The Movie Channel carry blockbuster hits and most other mainstream Hollywood  releases. But be advised that, in a battle to tie up exclusive rights to film  titles, rivals HBO and Showtime have divvied up the output of most of the major  Hollywood studios. Look for this summer's blockbuster Paramount hits "Indiana  Jones and the Last Crusade" and "Star Trek V" and Warner Bros.' "Batman" on HBO  and its sister service Cinemax. Showtime and The Movie Channel, on the other  hand, have a long-term lease on Disney's Touchstone films, including "Who  Framed Roger Rabbit," Bette Midler's films and Tom Hanks' upcoming "Turner and  Hootch." Also in Showtime's stable: the "Rambo" films and pictures from  producer-directors Rob Reiner, Taylor Hackford and Ron Howard.  </P> <P> Foreign films. Forget subtitled versions when it comes to the two major pay  services, HBO and Showtime. Programmers say Middle America prefers dubbed  versions, so they banish subtitled films to the wee hours. Even Cinemax and The  Movie Channel are cautious; both look for Academy Award-winning films such as  Sweden's "My Life as a Dog" and tend to shun riskier fare. Neither, for  example, has scheduled Jean-Jacques Beiniex's steamy "Betty Blue." You'll have  better luck with Bravo and Arts &amp; Entertainment Network, which schedule  foreign films (usually with subtitles) every month. Bravo offers Claude Berri's  "Jean Mon Amour" in July. Arts &amp; Entertainment Network's "Screening Room"  series turns up treats from time to time: Look for "La Nuit de Varennes" July 4  and China's "Yellow Earth" in October.  </P> <P> Treasures from the vault. Turner Network Television, Ted Turner's grand  challenger to network television, has earned itself a neat little reputation  for its own cache of screen gems. On June 13, the basic cable service aired the  original black-and-white version of Richard Brooks' "Blackboard Jungle" (Turner  colorized the movie earlier this year) and dug up a rarely seen series of RKO  films known as "The Falcon Mysteries." Another basic cable channel, American  Movie Classics, seeks to deliver what its name promises: John Ford's "Fort  Apache," "Murder Inc." and the original "Heaven Can Wait" were unfurled this  month. Since 1981, Showtime has had a showcase for MGM films each month.  Sometimes they're dogs that don't even merit a mention in Showtime's guide, but  you'll also find "Gigi," "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Silk Stockings."  </P> <P> Bad Bs. Remember "The Attack of the 50-Foot Woman"? "Plan 9 from Outer Space"?  "Glenn or Glenda"? Z Channel had a knack for giving you a reason to watch even  the worst films. Sure, they were cheap time fillers, but Z never pulled any  punches in letting you know just how bad these movies were. It had a "Best of  the Worst" series and a "Worst of the Worst" series. The major pay services  also face the need to fill time. Cinemax does it with what in corporatespeak is  called "opportunistic umbrellas" -- that is, cute series names for bad movies.  Under the umbrella this fall: the original "The Blob" and its 1988 remake. The  Movie Channel has elevated the scheduling of bad movies to an art form with  "Joe Bob Briggs' Drive-In Theater." Briggs (satirist John Bloom) rates films by  the number of exposed body parts. Enough said.  </P> <P> Restored films. It took Z Channel to unearth a rarity like director John Ford's  "Up the River," the 1929 jailhouse comedy that featured the film debuts of  Humphrey Bogart and Spencer Tracy. Sadly, hunting for rare films doesn't much  interest the major pay services. Some pay homage to various directors and say  they are open to opportunities to license restorations. The sensibilities may  be slightly different. The Movie Channel last year ran a "Director's Cut"  special on the hardly long-lost feature film "Manhunter" by "Miami Vice"  producer Michael Mann. Things look better at TNT, which participated in the  restoration of "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid," which was tracked down in TNT's  MGM library by Jerry Harvey's Z Channel successor, Tim Ryerson. TNT is  restoring most of its $1-billion library of MGM, RKO and pre-1949 Warner Bros.  films. In March, TNT aired "Ben Hur" with a restored score.  </P> <P> Imaginative Film Festivals. Z wrote the book on packaging, with festivals that  ranged from a celebration of the films of French director Luis Bunuel to a 1986  collection of potboilers called "Sexpots &amp; Sorcerers." All the pay services  now program this way, with more or less success. Cinemax's "Vanguard" series  features films it considers avant garde. The loopy "Baghdad Cafe" debuts today  under the Vanguard label. Pairing original and new versions of films is  popular: The Movie Channel did it in May with the French and U.S. versions of  "Three Men and a Baby," under the clever title "Six Men and Two Babies." TNT  reserves its overnight time periods for hard-core film buffs. To please them,  TNT plans things like a Robert Armstrong festival after the July 18 prime-time  triple-header of the original "King Kong," "Mighty Joe Young" and "Son of  Kong." Armstrong was the non-simian male lead of "King Kong."  </P> <P> Cinematic specials. Z specialized in delivering cinematic treats to viewers --  the 5 1/2-hour versions of Bernardo Bertolucci's "1900" and Ingmar Bergman's  "Fanny and Alexander," the 6-hour version of the German war drama "Das Boot,"  the long and short versions of "Once Upon a Time in America." The other pay  services occasionally followed suit. "Once Upon a Time in America" ran in its  short and long versions on Cinemax and the Movie Channel. The Movie Channel  will offer the 6-hour "Little Dorritt" in two-night segments in November or  December.  </P> <P> Great Guide. Z Channel's terrific program guide was the first thing sacrificed  to the service's money problems last year. Unfortunately, you won't find its  informed, opinionated like anywhere else in cable TV. HBO, Showtime, Cinemax  and The Movie Channel offer throw-away guides with upbeat thumbnail  descriptions of films. The Cable Guide resembles a pre-Rupert Murdoch TV Guide  with occasional good articles but little critical material. American Movie  Classics' monthly guide comes closest to the mark with some of its background  pieces on the service's classic films. PEGGY ZIEGLER  </P></p>

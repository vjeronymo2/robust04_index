During a full session of the CPPCC National Committee today,  Zhou Shaozheng, chairman of the CPPCC subcommittee for handling  proposals, delivered a report on the handling of proposals made  since the last session a year ago.    Over the past year, members of the CPPCC National Committee,  various democratic parties and people's organizations have made  a total of 1,981 proposals, he said, adding that his  subcommittee had handled 99 percent of the proposals by February  25, 1994.    He said that 1,506 members, 72 percent of the total, made  proposals in 1993. Of these, 13 came from the Central Committee  of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Central  Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party,  and groups of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese  Kuomintang, the Jiu San (September 3) Society and the All-China  Federation of Trade Unions.    According to Zhou, 673 of these proposals, or 35.4 percent,  deal with China's economic development; 617 of these, or 32.5  percent, involve education, science, culture, public health and  sports; 394 of these, or 20.7 percent, cover political affairs,  legal affairs, labor and personnel; and the rest deal with  united front work, nationality affairs, religious affairs, and  affairs relating to Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and Overseas  Chinese.    All the proposals made during the first session of the CPPCC  National Committee, held a year ago, have been submitted to  departments of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and  the State Council for handling, he said.    To date, those departments have either adopted or handled 82  percent of these proposals in various ways and have also  explained why they cannot adopt the remaining, he said.    He said that a considerable part of the proposals contain  specific measures to accelerate reforms, open China wider to the  outside world, step up the modernization drive, push forward the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure, promote  ideological and cultural progress, and improve the party's style  of work and the building of a clean and honest government.    For example, members made a number of proposals calling for  increased investment in agriculture and faster construction of  large water conservancy facilities. There are nine proposals  requiring the undertaking of a massive project to divert water  from south China to water-deficient north China.    The State Planning Commission has listed diverting Chang  Jiang River water to north China as a priority project and is  now making a feasibility study of it, he said.    Many members also proposed setting fair and rational tax  rates and establishing a new rational taxation system throughout  China.    The party Central Committee and the State Council have  decided to institute a tax assignment system since the beginning  of this year, in an effort to tighten the central government's  unified management of tax revenues, he said.    Moreover, the Standing Committee of the National People's  Congress has adopted a proposal suggesting that an amendment to  China's constitution provide for the establishment of a  "multi-party cooperation and political consultative system under  the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party."    The stipulation "a multi-party cooperation and political  consultative system will exist for a long time to come and  develop" has been included in China's constitution, he added.    Zhou Shaozheng pledged to handle proposals by CPPCC National  Committee members more efficiently in future.</p>

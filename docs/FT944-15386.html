			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Turkish privatisation advance Mrs Tansu Ciller, Turkish prime minister, has convinced her cabinet's biggest opponent of privatisation to back a draft framework law on state asset sales, significantly increasing the chances that parliament will enact it. Mr Mumtaz Soysal, foreign minister, a member of her coalition government's junior partner, the Social Democratic party, signed the draft law on Monday night after obstructing privatisation for months. He demanded that Mrs Ciller adopt a political liberalisation package before backing privatisation. Earlier this year he won a constitutional court appeal against her plan to impose privatisation by decree. The government still hopes to raise Dollars 1bn this year from privatisation and a further Dollars 9bn-Dollars 12bn next year. The state telephone and electricity utilities as well as five banks, the national airline, manufacturing and oil refining businesses are to be sold. State companies lost Dollars 5.6bn last year. Privatisation is a key feature of a wider World Bank-supported public sector reform programme aimed at tackling the main causes of the government's big budget deficits and Turkey's high inflation.</p>

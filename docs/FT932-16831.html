			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Associated Fisheries' Pounds 3m profit SHARES in Associated Fisheries rose 17p to 144p yesterday after the company reported a turnround from a loss of Pounds 4.48m to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.16m in 1992, after restatement to comply with FRS 3. The effect of the restatement is to charge against pre-tax profit a provision of Pounds 5.5m that was originally treated as extraordinary. The 1992 profit was boosted by Pounds 500,000 write back of an over provision in the previous year for the loss on disposal of the Macfish investment. Earnings per share were 19.19p (losses 31.67p). The final dividend is 7p for a total of 8p (7p). Turnover came to Pounds 84.6m (Pounds 83.6m) and operating profit to Pounds 2.89m (Pounds 1.84m).</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> SCOTT BANKHEAD FACES SURGERY  </P> <P> Seattle Mariners pitcher Scott Bankhead is scheduled to undergo surgery on his  right shoulder next Tuesday to repair a shoulder bone spur and expects to miss  the rest of the season.  </P> <P> Dr. Arthur Pappas will operate on the acromnio clavicular joint in Bankhead's  right shoulder in Boston, the Mariners said in a news release.  </P> <P> Bankhead was placed on the disabled list Sunday for the second time this  season.  </P> <P> Bankhead, 26, led the Mariners with a 14-6 record and a 3.34 earned run average  last season but is 0-2 with an 11.08 ERA in four starts this season.  </P> <P> He had been scheduled to undergo arthroscopic surgery two weeks ago, but that  was put on hold when examination indicated the soreness in his shoulder might  be from inflammation. He subsequently pitched twice for five innings without  pain, only to have the pain return and force him to leave a game Friday night  after 1 2/3 innings.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A report by the Main Public Relations Center of the  Internal Affairs Ministry of Ukraine qualifies the decrees by  the president of Crimea on the dismissal of Oleksandr Plyuta,  the internal affairs minister of the autonomy, and the  appointment of Former Military General Valeriy Kuznetsov to his  post as yet another step toward aggravating the situation on the  peninsula.    The document, in particular, points out that yet another  attempt was made to involve the law enforcement bodies in  political battles, Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry in  particular. All this may lead to negative consequences.    On the strength of the law of Ukraine on militia, the report  also says, the militia of our state is a single system of bodies  that are part of the structure of the Internal Affairs Ministry  of Ukraine and whose activities are subordinated to it. The  leading personnel of the interior bodies, excluding rayon and  city departments, are appointed by the internal affairs minister  of Ukraine personally. Therefore, underlines the Main Public  Relations Center, such a personnel reshuffling has exclusively  political essence, it does not promote consolidation of  lawfulness in the state and leads to confrontation in society.    The above decrees by the president of the Crimea Republic on  changes in the leadership of the Internal Affairs Ministry of  the autonomous republic must be cancelled as such that do not  comply with the legislation currently in force in Ukraine.</p>

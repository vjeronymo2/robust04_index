			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Enduring foe of Japan's provinces: Robert Thomson visits a once-thriving city blighted by the recession WITHOUT much prompting, the residents of Kamaishi, in northern Japan, will vividly describe how they or their forebears rebuilt the city on the rubble of devastation wreaked by tidal waves and US wartime bombing raids. But the confidence displayed in past conflicts with calamity is being severely tested by a more enduring foe, recession. A steel plant has been gradually decommissioned, the fishing industry is in decline and, now, the local bank, Kamaishi Shinkin, is to be liquidated. 'Kamaishi Bank was like the local doctor. Now we will have to deal with the big hospitals,' said Mr Morio Wada, head of the chamber of commerce. The 'big hospitals' are the regional banks taking over the 12 branches of the Shinkin, which is on the lowest rung of the Japanese banking hierarchy. Kamaishi is unusually blighted, but some causes of its ills are shared by other provincial Japanese cities, and the political upheaval in Tokyo has added to the economic uncertainty in regional areas. The continuing downturn has most hurt centres already made vulnerable by structural changes such as manufacturers relocating to lower-cost east Asian countries and the steady outward flow of young workers to larger regional cities and Tokyo. Kamaishi Shinkin's death was the direct result of its role as the local provider of funds to small business, as money was pumped into ailing companies unable to raise funds from other sources. For its sins of commission, the bank's bad loans are now estimated at 41 per cent of its Y35.6bn portfolio, though a regional banker said the final non-performing figure would be close to half the outstanding loans. Having been the site of the country's first blast furnace for pig iron in 1857, Kamaishi now has the ignominy of being home to the first Japanese bank to receive liquidation assistance from the Deposit Insurance Corporation, likely to provide about Y20bn to ensure that depositors are not out of pocket. For Japanese outside Kamaishi, the most disturbing characteristic of the bank's demise is that it was not a result of stock and property speculation during the 'bubble era' of the late 1980s. The failure of finance companies with a taste for speculation is seen as an inevitable result of their excesses and not as a sign that the established order is crumbling. 'It's a terrible thing that the name Kamaishi Bank will disappear,' lamented Mr Takeyoshi Noda, the city's mayor, whose office is coloured by relics of Kamaishi's glory days. The Nippon Steel Kamaishi rugby team won the national title seven years in succession during the 1970s. Mr Noda has a bruised rugby ball atop a display cabinet. But as Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, has scaled down its plant, transfering operations to newer factories in the south, the rugby team has also lost potency. There is a smaller pool from which to select players, as Kamaishi's population peaked in 1963 at 92,123, and fell to 50,820 this year. The area's struggling businesses were further shaken last year when the Japanese government estimated that Kamaishi would have a population of only 27,000 in the year 2010. Mr Noda thinks the calculation did not take into account efforts to revive the city, including a Nippon Steel-sponsored mushroom farm and a building materials company. But it is these new ventures which have been most exposed to the harsh winds of recession. The city had hoped that Nippon Steel would build a theme park on an old factory site, but the poor response to Space World, another theme park built at a former steel plant in the south, led to the shelving of those plans. The building materials venture has been bruised by the fall in private construction demand. An increase in public works spending this year may help, but demand for private housing in Kamaishi is falling in tandem with the population. Mr Noda has high hopes for an office furniture venture, but demand will be dampened by securities houses' planned 68 per cent cut in capital spending this year and smaller reductions by other institutions. 'There was no financial bubble in Kamaishi, but we have been hurt by the bubble's collapse simply because the real economy has been hurt,' Mr Noda said. 'Land prices were falling here, when they were surging in Tokyo, but now we find it difficult to offer young people good jobs. We have to create more projects.' Local businesses fear that the regional banks may not be as willing to risk funds on a new venture which could have expected support from Kamaishi Shinkin, officially thought to have been too sympathetic to the local cause. One regional banker said the the small bank had been more interested in 'sentiment than asset-backing'. Three years ago, Mr Susumu Oikawa was sent from the finance ministry to restructure Kamaishi Shinkin, as it was hoped that low-interest loans from the Shinkin banks' governing body would be enough to ensure survival. But, as Mr Oikawa explained, the continuing downturn in the national economy has pushed many businesses, including his bank, over the edge. 'Some Kamaishi people invested in stocks, but that did not bring down their companies,' said Mr Oikawa, aged 58, who will be idle after the formal liquidation in October. His transfer was a form of amakudari, a descent from bureaucratic heaven to a private financial institution. 'Many Japanese have a traditional image of Kamaishi as a robust, steel producing city, but when I came here I was quite surprised. Businesses were in trouble, and it has got worse,' he said.</p>

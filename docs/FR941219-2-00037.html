			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Decision and Order of the Department of Energy,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of Special Refund Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> Name of Firm: Murphy Oil Corp. / Murphy Oil USA, Inc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Date of Filing: October 25, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Case Number: VEF&hyph;0003  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 --> December 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 25, 1994 the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), to distribute $10,700,000 remitted by Murphy Oil Corp., Murphy Oil USA, Inc., and Murphy Exploration &amp; Production Co. (collectively referred to as ``Murphy''), pursuant to the Consent Order entered into between Murphy and the DOE on July 15, 1994. In accordance with the procedural regulations codified at 10 CFR part 205, subpart V (Subpart V), the ERA requests in its Petition that the OHA establish special procedures to make refunds in order to remedy the effects of alleged regulatory violations which were resolved by the present Consent Order. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's plan to distribute these funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Murphy is a major integrated refiner which produced and sold crude oil and a full range of refined petroleum products during the period of federal price controls. As such, it was subject to the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations. During that time, the ERA conducted an extensive audit of Murphy and issued an issue letter to Murphy on September 29, 1976. ERA issued a Notice of Probable Violation to Murphy on January 28, 1981. ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Murphy on December 15, 1986, which Murphy contested before the OHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  On February 9, 1987, Murphy and the DOE entered into a Consent Order which resolved disputes regarding Murphy's refined petroleum product operations during the period the petroleum price and allocation regulations were in effect.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Murphy Oil Corp., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  17 DOE &para;85,782 (1987) (the first Consent Order). The first Consent Order left the issue of Murphy's alleged violations as a producer of crude oil unresolved. Those issues were decided by the OHA on June 17, 1992 when the OHA issued a modified version of ERA's PRO as a Remedial Order (RO).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Murphy Oil Corp., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  22 DOE &para;83,005 (1992). Murphy subsequently appealed the OHA's determination to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). On January 24, 1994 a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued a Decision and Proposed Order (D&amp;PO) which modified the RO.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Ocean Drilling &amp; Exploration Co., et al., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  66 FERC &para;63,002 (1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  On July 15, 1994, Murphy and the DOE entered into the present Consent Order, the second between Murphy and the DOE. This second Consent Order, which does not modify or affect the terms of the first Consent Order, resolves all existing or potential civil and administrative claims against Murphy for alleged violations of the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations left unresolved by the first Consent Order. Under the terms of this second Consent Order, Murphy has remitted $10,700,000 to the DOE, and all outstanding or potential claims by the DOE against Murphy have been extinguished. These funds are being held in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained at the Department of the Treasury pending a determination regarding their proper distribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Jurisdiction and Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing a plan of distribution for funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is to use the Subpart V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;07;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Office of Enforcement, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  9 DOE &para;82,508 (1981);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Office of Enforcement,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8 DOE &para;82,597 (1981).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  We have considered the ERA's Petition that we implement a Subpart V proceeding with respect to the second Murphy Consent Order fund and have determined that such a proceeding is appropriate. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's tentative plan to distribute this fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Proposed Refund Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Crude Oil Refund Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We propose to distribute the Murphy funds in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986) (the MSRP). The MSRP was issued as a result of a court-approved Settlement Agreement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  653 F. Supp. 108 (D. Kan.), 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para;90,509 (1986) (the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement). The MSRP establishes that 40 percent of the crude oil overcharge funds will be remitted to the federal government, another 40 percent to the states, and up to 20 percent may be initially reserved for the payment of claims by injured parties. The MSRP also specifies that any monies remaining after all valid claims by injured purchasers are paid be disbursed to the federal government and the states in equal amounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The OHA has utilized the MSRP in all Subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986). This Order provided a period of 30 days for the filing of comments or objections to our proposed use of the MSRP as the groundwork for evaluating claims in crude oil refund proceedings. Following this period, the OHA issued a Notice evaluating the numerous comments which it received pursuant to the Order Implementing the MSRP. This Notice was published at 52 FR 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April 10 Notice).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The April 10 Notice contained guidance to assist potential claimants wishing to file refund applications for crude oil monies under the Subpart V regulations. Generally, all claimants would be required to (1) document their purchase volumes of petroleum products during the August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981 crude oil price control period, and (2) prove that they were injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges. We also specified that end-users of petroleum products whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry will be presumed to have been injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges and need not submit any additional proof of injury beyond documentation of their purchase volumes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See City of Columbus, Georgia, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  16 DOE &para;85,550 (1987). Additionally, we stated that crude oil refunds would be calculated on the basis of a per gallon (or ``volumetric'') refund amount, which is obtained by dividing the crude oil refund pool by the total consumption of petroleum products in the United States during the crude oil price control period. The OHA has adopted the refund procedures outlined in the April 10 Notice in numerous cases.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., Texaco, Inc, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  19 DOE &para;85,200 (1989);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Shell Oil Co., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  17 DOE &para;85,204 (1988) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Shell <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> );  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mountain Fuel Supply Co., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  14 DOE &para;85,475 (1986) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mountain Fuel <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Refund Claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We propose to adopt the DOE's standard crude oil refund procedures to distribute the monies remitted by Murphy. We have chosen initially to reserve 20 percent of the fund, plus accrued interest, for direct refunds to claimants in order to ensure that sufficient funds will be available for injured parties. This reserve figure may later be reduced if circumstances warrant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The OHA will evaluate crude oil refund claims in a manner similar to that used in Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based on alleged refined product overcharges.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Mountain Fuel, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  14 DOE at 88,869. Under these procedures, claimants will be required to document their purchase volumes of petroleum products and prove they were injured as a result of the alleged violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> In her "School of Velocity" paintings, Robin Palanker pursues one of the old  lures in 20th-Century art: capturing the moments between significant actions,  pinning down the look of pure motion. But the works -- with their softly  rounded forms and their muted grays and pinks -- offer instead a reassuring  kind of simplicity more closely identified with American regional artists of  the 1930s. Part of the retro appeal of her work lies in its traditional,  sometimes rural subject matter: a singer in a swirling pink dress about to  settle into the curve of a baby grand; two women in long sundresses running  (with backs to us) down a country road; two pigs rushing forward, ears  flapping.  </P> <P> The title painting, depicting a soft-gray barn mounted on a circular track-like  platform, looks a tad too Hopper-esque, although the curious platform provokes  a weird, closed-circuit anxiety that is specifically Palanker's. Her other  images of houses -- slightly blurred, perhaps as they would look to someone  driving by -- are disappointingly bland.  </P> <P> "I-5" is a medley of gray curves of highway seen from the soft grass below; an  absurdly tranquil scene, really (not a car in sight) except for a slightly  disquieting, abstract patch of red. In "BFO (Buffalo)," rows of dark tree  trunks grow in a blue-white pad of snow against a pink sky. This image doesn't  in the least suggest a landscape seen from a plane (as the title would  indicate). In fact, it dances with out-and-out triteness (trees in a winter  sunset -- are you kidding?). But somehow, because of the rhythm of the forms,  it has the freshness of utter simplicity, honestly achieved. Speed, after all,  isn't everything. (Krygier/Landau Gallery, 2114 Broadway, to May 19.)

			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO-SECESSION CANDIDATES LEAD IN LATVIA VOTE  </P> <P> Estonians and Latvians cast ballots in their Soviet republics' first  multi-party parliamentary elections Sunday, with nationalists predicting both  victory and a slower approach to independence than that seized by the  neighboring Baltic breakaway state of Lithuania a week ago.  </P> <P> Unofficial returns from Latvia, gathered by the grass-roots People's Front,  showed pro-secession candidates apparently on their way to an impressive  victory. Early results showed they had taken at least 109 seats to at least 29  for anti-independence campaigners, according to Anda Anspoka, spokeswoman for  the Front.  </P> <P> But Anspoka said it was too early to declare victory since the group needs a  two-thirds majority in the 201-seat legislature, or 134 seats, to implement its  independence plan.  </P> <P> No early returns from Estonia were immediately available.  </P> <P> In Vilnius, Lithuania's capital, about 35,000 people led by Communists still  loyal to Moscow rallied outside a sports complex against the week-old  independence declaration, with some protesters carrying signs reading "We Don't  Want to Live in a Bourgeois Lithuania."  </P> <P> V. Lazutka, a party secretary, told state-run Soviet television, "We view the  events here as a coup that liquidated the constitution."  </P> <P> The bold action by Lithuania's legislature was the first crack in the  theoretically voluntary union of 15 sovereign Soviet republics and may spark  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's gravest domestic cri sis. On Sunday, Gorbachev  denounced the act as a "wrongful decision" but did not say what, if anything,  the Kremlin would do to reverse it.  </P> <P> "Something was decided overnight, in the heat of the moment," Gorbachev told  reporters after voting in local and parliamentary runoff elections held in  Moscow and much of Russia. "Nevertheless, we shall carry on the dialogue."  </P> <P> Gorbachev denied that a three-day limit given Lithuanian leaders to answer the  Soviet Parliament's charge that their March 11 proclamation was illegal  constituted an ultimatum.  </P> <P> "I think we shall receive a reply from the authorities of present-day Lithuania  and, depending on it, everything else will become clear too," said Gorbachev.  Without elaborating, he added: "The character and content of a reply will  determine our subsequent steps."  </P> <P> The Lithuanian example was on the minds of many voters in the neighboring  Soviet republics of Estonia and Latvia as they cast ballots in elections for  republican parliaments. All three Baltic states became independent after World  War I but were forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 under a secret  agreement between Josef Stalin's regime and Nazi Germany.  </P> <P> "The Lithuanians have shown us how it can be done," Sarmite Elerte, chief of  the information center of the pro-independence Latvian People's Front, said by  telephone from her republic's capital of Riga. But she said there also had been  a negative effect on non-Latvian residents "who fear a similar turn of events  here."  </P> <P> Since Lithuania's breakaway move, ethnic Russians in Latvia are in "an alert  mode," Igor V. Lopatin, chairman of the Russian-led Interfront group, said from  Riga. "People feel a threat, and activity in the elections is a natural  response. Lithuania has served as a catalyst for the Russians in Latvia."  </P> <P> Non-Latvians are a force to be reckoned with since Latvians make up only 54% of  the republic's population of 2.7 million. To elect 201 members of Latvia's  Parliament, voters chose from among 384 candidates, of whom 187 were endorsed  by the People's Front, including Valdis Steins, leader of the republic's Social  Democrats, and the chiefs of the environmentalist Greens and the Liberal Party.  </P> <P> Janis Vagris, the republic's Communist Party chief, sat out the elections, a  pointed contrast with past practice, when the party could expect automatic  voter approval for the sole nominee it proposed for each seat. However, 70% of  the candidates were members of the Communist Party, and the two top government  leaders, President Anatoly Gorbunov and Prime Minister Edvin-Vilnis Bresis, ran  unopposed.  </P> <P> Elerte said the People's Front sought to elect at least two-thirds of the  membership of the Latvian Parliament to have the majority required to alter the  republic's constitution and restore independence. But she predicted that  candidates endorsed by the grass-roots group would win little more than half  the seats Sunday, making swift action impossible.  </P> <P> "A proclamation of independence, however, is not in doubt," Elerte said. "It  will happen. We just don't know when this will be -- in the legislature we are  electing now, or in the one after that."  </P> <P> In Estonia, 30 parties and political organizations fielded 392 candidates for  100 seats in the republic's legislature, including at least three groups  calling themselves Social Democrats and a separate Green Party, Green Movement  and Green Regiment. That seeming variety was deceptive, said Estonian Radio  commentator Harri Tiido: "All Estonian parties as a matter of fact have quite  similar platforms -- the main goal is an independent Estonia."  </P> <P> Among the best known candidates were Communist Party leader Vaino Vyalyas,  President Arnold Ruutel and People's Front leaders Marju Lauristin and Edgar  Savisaar. Only about one-quarter of the total were Communists, and Tiido  stressed that "even those Estonian Communists who are running support an  independent Estonia."  </P> <P> Ethnic Estonians, however, make up only about two-thirds of their homeland's  population of 1.6 million people, and Russians and other non-Estonians running  in enclaves in the republic's northeast, where they are in the majority, were  expected to win election to Parliament easily.  </P> <P> Where the Estonians part ways with the Lithuanians is over tactics, preferring  a more cautious approach. "They declared themselves independent, then asked to  begin negotiations (with Moscow)," commented Tiido. "We Estonians want to start  negotiations, then think about declaring independence."  </P> <P> Estonia has also created an institution without parallel in Lithuania: a  Congress representing people living in the small Baltic homeland at the time of  the 1940 Soviet takeover and their descendants.  </P> <P> That body, which met for the first time this month, is considered the legal  heir of the Estonian state, while the Parliament is regarded as a creation of  the occupation, Tiido said. However only Parliament's decisions are likely to  have validity in Moscow's eyes, he admitted, so ideally, the institutions will  join in pursuing a restoration of Estonian independence.  </P> <P> Runoff elections were also held in the Russian Federation, the Ukraine and  Byelorussia, the three republics that make up 80% of Soviet territory and are  home to two-thirds of its 290 million people. The first round of elections  March 4 left many local and parliamentary posts unfilled, including 948 of the  1,068 seats in the newly created Russian Congress of People's Deputies and 352  spots in the 450-seat Ukrainian legislature.  </P> <P> Officials said the problem was the large number of candidates who split votes  among them, including more than 20 in some districts of the Russian Federation.  But the chief problem Sunday appeared to be voter indifference.  </P> <P> Soviet television's evening news program Vremya, quoting the Central Elections  Commission, said voter turnout in the Slavic republics was between 40% and 50%.  By Soviet law, if less than half the voters take part, then new elections must  be held.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HERMOSA BEACH ORDERED TO RESTRICT PCH  PARKING  </P> <P> After battling with the state for more than 20 years over rush-hour congestion  on Pacific Coast Highway, Hermosa Beach has been given 60 days to do its part  for commuters by restricting curbside parking along its stretch of the  thoroughfare.  </P> <P> In a Dec. 3 letter, J.B. Baxter, District 7 director for the state Department  of Transportation, warned that unless Hermosa Beach officials provide a  no-stopping zone on the west side of the highway during the evening rush,  Caltrans will do it for them.  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach has consistently argued that the parking ban would put merchants  out of business and create an expressway in the heart of town.  </P> <P> Caltrans spokesman Karl F. Berger said the agency usually backs away from  forcing a city to institute a parking ban, preferring to rely on cooperation.  He said the state was forced to act when employers in surrounding cities  complained that the parked cars were creating a regional traffic problem.  </P></p>

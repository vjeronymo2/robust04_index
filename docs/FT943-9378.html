			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: Investigation into share dealing at Fust A preliminary inquiry has been launched into suspicions of insider trading in the shares of Fust, a Swiss household appliances retailer part-acquired by Grands Magasins Jelmoli, a leading department stores group, in a controversial deal announced last Friday. Shares in Fust soared to SFr440 last Thursday from SFr390 a week earlier, prompting Jelmoli to bring forward the announcement of its bid by about a week and to consider asking for an investigation. The Zurich prosecutor's office announced yesterday that it had started a preliminary investigation to discover whether people with inside knowledge of the impending deal were buying. Insider trading became a criminal offence in Switzerland in 1988 but so far no one has been successfully prosecuted on an insider charge. Meanwhile, a row continues to simmer over the terms of the deal because Jelmoli has paid a higher price to the controlling Fust family for their shares than it is offering to minority shareholders. Jelmoli, in which UTC International of Basle has a 50.01 per cent voting stake, has acquired 34 per cent of the capital and 51 per cent of the voting rights in Fust from the controlling Fust family for SFr141.5m (Dollars 107.1m) in shares and cash. The purchase was based on an average market price of SFr410 for the group's bearer shares between February and May this year. Jelmoli said that in deference to minority shareholder protection provisions in a new stock exchange law coming into force next year it would make an offer to buy shares from other Fust shareholders, but only at SFr390 per share. Mr Peter Leumann, finance director of Jelmoli, said that Mr Walter Fust, chief executive of Fust, had not wanted any offer to be made to minority shareholders because he was afraid so many shares might be turned in that the company could no longer be publicly traded. Both Jelmoli and Fust are recommending that minority shareholders hang on to their shares. Mr Leumann said Fust profits were set to rise rapidly and shareholders should do very well. He said that the groups' financial advisers argued strongly for an offer to minority shareholders. In the end, it was equivalent to the strict minimum provided in the new stock exchange law, that is, the market price for the shares. The bearer shares were traded at SFr390 on July 28, the day the deal was concluded. Mr Leumann said that was purely a coincidence. The price was selected because it was the average market price between May and July.</p>

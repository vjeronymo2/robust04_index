			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEVELOPER SCRAPS HIDDEN HILLS PROJECT  </P> <P> The builder behind a controversial development proposal that would have brought  lower-cost housing to wealthy Hidden Hills said Monday that the project is  dead.  </P> <P> Danny Howard of H.H. Lasher Road Ltd. said his option to buy the 25-acre  property has expired because the Hidden Hills City Council has not made a final  decision on the entire project.  </P> <P> Howard said his contract with landowners Jon Galiher and William Maingot  required him to obtain final council approval by early May.  </P> <P> The proposal called for nine luxury homes to be built on 21 acres that were to  have been incorporated into the exclusive gated community and connected to its  private road network. Howard had wanted to build commercial properties,  including a five-story office building and a 48-unit apartment building for  low- and moderate-income senior citizens, on the four acres that would have  remained outside the city's gates.  </P> <P> "It means it's dead," Howard said of the project.  </P> <P> Howard had asked the City Council to expedite a decision on the project last  week. The council, however, approved only the single-family residential portion  of the project. Council members said they were not ready to take further action  because they had too many unanswered questions about the rest of the project's  environmental effects.  </P> <P> Howard said he would continue to seek financial damages in a lawsuit he filed  against the city late last year.  </P></p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Rally at Campbell &amp; Armstrong Campbell &amp; Armstrong, the shop and office fitting group, returned to the black in the three months to June 30. The Manchester-based group has changed its financial year-end from March to December to 'balance the seasonal influences of activities over the two halves'. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 81,000 compared with losses of Pounds 553,000 last time and a deficit of Pounds 3.55m for the last full year. Mr Ray Chambers, chairman, attributed the recovery to reduced overheads and the disposal or closure 'of those businesses judged incapable of making a positive contribution'. Current order books were improving in shopfitting and manufacturing operations, but remained under pressure in construction activities, Mr Chambers said. Turnover amounted to Pounds 12.8m, up from Pounds 12.6m which included a contribution of Pounds 442,000 from discontinued operations. Earnings per share emerged at 0.6p (losses of 3.8p). The group did not declare an interim dividend.</p>

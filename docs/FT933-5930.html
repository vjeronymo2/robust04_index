			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Big Lloyd's agency hit by cash fall MERRETT HOLDINGS, one of the largest managing agencies at Lloyd's, is turning to corporate investors to offset a sharp fall in popularity of its syndicates among Names - the individuals whose assets support the insurance market. The group's chairman, Mr Stephen Merrett, already under pressure to resign as deputy chairman of the Lloyd's insurance market, has faced increasing difficulty this year in persuading Names to back the group's nine syndicates. It emerged yesterday that members' agents - who handle the affairs of Names and channel them on to syndicates - can supply only about Pounds 50m of capital to the biggest of the Merrett syndicates, number 418, for next year, about a third of the amount it has for 1993. The syndicate, which underwrites US liability business, is one of the Lloyd's market's most important but has declined steadily since 1988 when its capacity amounted to Pounds 285m. A second Merrett syndicate, number 1,067, has also suffered from a sharp fall in popularity among Names and can expect only Pounds 22m in capacity for 1994 compared with Pounds 55m in 1993. Following yesterday's meeting the Merrett agency is stepping up its efforts to attract corporate investors to support its business. Mr Stephen Cane, managing director, said he was optimistic about the prospects of increasing corporate investment in the group's syndicates. Merrett is hoping to be able to convert a Bermuda-based company, Underwriting Capital (Merrett), set up this year to provide reinsurance to its syndicates, into a fully fledged incorporated Name as soon as Lloyd's rules permit. Even with the new company's backing, however, Merrett's problems may not be over. Under Lloyd's provisional rules corporate investors are restricted from supplying more than 50 per cent of a syndicate's capacity.</p>

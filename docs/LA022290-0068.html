			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CIF GIRLS ROUNDUP  </P> <P> La Quinta 60, North Torrance 49 -- They'll be teammates in the fall at UCLA,  but La Quinta's Amy Jalewalia and North's Laura Collins got acquainted on the  basketball court a few months early.  </P> <P> So if you could call Wednesday night's 4-A quarterfinal a head-to-head matchup  between Jalewalia and Collins, then Jalewalia got the best of it.  </P> <P> She poured in 32 points -- one shy of her season average -- to lead La Quinta  at home.  </P> <P> Collins, North's 6-foot center, was frustrated by La Quinta's triangle-and-two  defense and ended up with 16 points. Collins was double-teamed most of the  night by Heather Brannan and Janet Kanno.  </P> <P> "I didn't know how we'd stop Collins," La Quinta Coach Kevin Kiernan said. "But  somehow we did."  </P> <P> La Quinta (25-3) earned its first trip to the semifinals since 1985. North  finished at 17-8.  </P> <P> North's box-and-one defense held Jalewalia to only 10 points in the first half.  Instead, La Quinta's guards went to work from the outside.  </P> <P> A pair of set shots from the point by Kanno gave La Quinta an eight-point lead  early in the second quarter, and the Lady Aztecs stretched the lead to 28-15 at  the half.  </P> <P> With more freedom in the open court, the 6-2 Jalewalia scored La Quinta's first  12 points of the second half. She made 11 of her 22 shots on the night,  including a pair of three-pointers, and added 19 rebounds and six steals.  </P> <P> Collins finished 8-of-13 from the field and grabbed 16 rebounds. North also got  10 points apiece from guards Carolyn Hiramoto and Faith Hirayama.  </P> <P> "We had to go to the other side to get our shots tonight," North Coach Richard  Rosato said. "We had a hard time tonight getting the shots we wanted. It was  just one of those nights." STUART MATTHEWS  </P></p>

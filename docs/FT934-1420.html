			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Travel: Aloha Bond St-sur-mer - Sara Webb finds tourism is taking its toll in Hawaii Arriving in Hawaii is like stepping back into childhood. The last time I wore garlands of flowers around my neck I was six, playing with daisy chains. In Hawaii you are decked out in leis, or garlands, as soon as you land, and waft along in a cloud of frangipani and rose. Then you notice that everyone is wearing them - people arriving, people departing, people celebrating a birthday or going to a party. Then there is the language, which to the newcomer sounds like baby-talk: great slabs of vowels and apostrophes, with the rare consonant thrown in (there are only seven in use, which must make Scrabble a challenge). People pepper their conversation with odd words of Hawaiian, in particular Aloha, which seems to mean 'hello,' 'goodbye,' and 'lots of love'. After that, you notice the outlandish clothes: men with splodges of colour across their chests, decked out as brightly as reef-feeding fish, and women in equally colourful muumuus, the invention of the missionaries who, displeased at the sight of happy girls in grass skirts, forced them to wear what look like particularly nasty C&amp;A nighties, circa 1970. For many tourists, muumuus and Aloha are about as much as they see of Hawaiian culture. It is enough for the sun-and-surf seekers in their day-glo and ponytails; for the designer fashion victims heading for the Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Celine boutiques where assistants tot up your spending power as you walk in and throw you an air-conditioned glare once they realise you are only browsing; and for the young Japanese couples who tumble out of white stretch limos for a quick wedding photo-session on the luxury hotel lawn. If they want a beach in Honolulu, they go to Waikiki, where surf-boarders zip back and forth along the waves and men patrol the sands with metal detectors in the hope of finding some rich woman's rock-encrusted jewellery. Apart from the risk of losing your diamonds in the surf, Honolulu seems a pretty quiet, safe place. The streets are spotless, thanks to a Dollars 1,000 fine. The real debate is whether the 50th US state should become independent and perhaps reinstate its monarchy. As royals go, the Hawaiian contingent seemed to know how to enjoy themselves - the king and queen even had their own surfing beach. Perhaps the Hawaiians are unaware of the hazards of a modern-day monarchy, or perhaps it is just a canny way to pull the crowds and boost tourism. While Hawaii once thrived on whaling and then on agriculture, nowadays tourism is seen as its salvation. One feels apprehensive: Honolulu has already been spoiled and turned into a sort of Bond Street-sur-mer. One can only hope that the other islands do not suffer the same fate. On the island of Lanai, tourism has only just been introduced. Lanai, owned by the Dole food company, once depended on its pineapple plantations. But it could not compete with cheaper exporters, and the last pineapple crop was harvested this year. It is a sleepy one-town island. You drive past rugged mountains and moorland until you reach the inappropriately named Lanai City, which consists of a few neat rows of bungalows and a main square with a police station, bank, theatre, and cafe overlooked by a tiny hostel. Now, the islanders work as waiters and laundry staff in two luxury hotels built by Dole, rather than in the pineapple fields. 'The new crop is tourism,' laughs Sol Kahoohalahala, a director of cultural resources on the island who is striving to preserve its culture and environment, much of which has changed because of overgrazing by animals brought in by early ranchers. Hawaiians will tell you that each of the eight main islands has its own character. Lanai is still a relatively unspoilt innocent. Big Island (known simply as 'Hawaii') is 'very spiritual, lots of Californians go there to meditate,' one woman told me. 'You can feel the energy as soon as you step off the plane.' All I could feel was a blast of heat. While much of Hawaii is rooted in the 20th century, Hawaiians still tend to talk about its myths, legends and superstitions. On Big Island, with its live volcanoes, people talk about Pele, the goddess of fire, and warn visitors never to take any lava home because it will bring bad luck. Every year the authorities receive post-bags full of chunks of lava returned by tourists who regretted the consequences. In places, the lava is studded with petroglyphs, drawings of stick people giving birth or sailing, as well as dots and squiggles which are thought to represent messages about journeys undertaken centuries ago. Then there are the old burial sites. Some hotels have had to redesign their buildings because foundation-digging has unearthed human bones. Priests have to be called in to bless the site and settle the spirits. Centuries ago, if you broke the law or committed something which was taboo, you would be killed unless you could escape to the 'place of refuge' on Big Island. For some, this involved running miles across land; for others, a swim across shark-haunted waters. Today there are no taboos, but thousands of athletes face an even worse ordeal - the annual Ironman contest or triathlon, which combines a 2.4-mile ocean swim, a 112-mile bike race and a 26.2-mile marathon. Dominated by Californians, it can take anywhere from eight to 15 hours to complete, after which the contestants usually collapse into the spiny embrace of an intravenous drip to be rehydrated. It makes the earlier race for the place of refuge sound easy. Sara Webb travelled to Hawaii with American Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines. She stayed at the Halekulani Hotel in Honolulu; the Manele Bay Hotel on Lanai; and the Royal Waikoloan, Kohala Coast, Big Island.

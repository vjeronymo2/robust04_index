			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Too many little piggies come to market: UK farmers' efforts to escape from a deep trough Most pigs to be slaughtered in the UK this week will be sold at a loss of about Pounds 3.40 per animal as the pig industry remains in the deep trough of a year-old recession. Even for an industry used to the ups and downs of the production cycle, the latest downturn has hit producers hard. Pig farming is not cushioned by subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, unlike most other sectors of European agriculture, which means producers must rely on the vagaries of the free market. This has seen farmers losing up to Pounds 7 on every pig sold when prices dropped to an all-time low last October. The severity of the recent downturn has pushed many individual producers out of business and forced companies to rethink their commitment to pig farming. Dalgety, the food and agribusiness company, which last week pointed to the slump in the European market as a dampener on its annual profits, says it will leave pig farming altogether within the next year. Pig producers have been operating below break-even for most of the past year except for a brief respite in May when prices rose above the cost of production for four to six weeks. Pigs operate in a typical farm commodity cycle whereby high prices encourage over-production which leads to a slump in the market. But the National Farmers' Union complains that the pig cycle - the period between the peaks and lows in price - used to take five years, but has recently speeded up to two. Added to that, the current downturn has lasted longer than usual. There are a number of factors behind the recent decline. It started in 1991 with the re-unification of Germany when up to 60 per cent of the former East Germany's swine herd was culled - a factor which depressed pork prices across the European Union. After that, reform of the CAP in 1992 with its planned cuts in cereals prices, encouraged many arable farmers to re-direct some of their farming effort into pigs. France also offered state aids to some pig producers as a way of ensuring they stayed in production. Those payments have since been condemned by the European Commission, which called on the producers to repay subsidies received. But these factors in the EU market led to 4 per cent over-supply or 700,000 tonnes of pork last year. 'We've been reducing our involvement in pigs on the feeding side over the past three years. We've now got only 30 per cent of the sows we did have,' said Mr Mick Hazzledine, general manager of Dalgety's livestock division. He predicts Dalgety will have disposed of its remaining pig schemes within a year. Dalgety will stay in the high-tech business of selling breeding stock through its Pig Improvement Company subsidiary. Others are cutting back or getting out. Unigate, the dairy company, sold its remaining 6,500 pigs last month, and Daisy Hill Pigs, part of the Usborne animal feeds group, is to cut its number of sows from 15,500 to 9,000. But BOCM Pauls, the agribusiness unit of Harrisons and Crosfield, is bucking the trend and actually expanding its involvement in pigs even though Mr George Paul, chief executive, says the company lost Pounds 3m on this business over the past year. 'We called some consultants in to have a very critical look at our business earlier this year,' Mr Paul said. 'They concluded that the UK does not have any inherent disadvantages in pig production compared with its European competitors and that our business is one of the most efficient in the sector. That's why we decided to expand - an upturn has got to come sooner or later.' BOCM Pauls runs the biggest pig production unit in the country as a joint venture with J. Sainsbury, the supermarket group. Breckland Farms in Norfolk produces 3,000 pigs a week. The company also has pigs of its own which farmers look after for a fee. As part of its expansion plans, it has taken on pigs from the Malton Bacon factory owned by Unigate and the pig operations of Louis Dreyfuss, the grain trading company. These pigs are raised on farms to which BOCM supplies the feed and then pays farmers a fee for caring for them as well as a bonus for good performance. While farmers are guaranteed a steady income, the feed company has to absorb the profit and loss on the sale of the pigs. Agribusiness companies have traditionally been involved in pig production as a way of securing outlets for their feed. But Mr Hazzledine says that farmers sometimes see them as competitors and blame them for distortions in the market. They are willing to absorb losses for longer than individual farmers which can distort free market signals. This could be one reason for the slowness of prices to bounce back from recent lows. The Meat and Livestock Commission, the UK industry's promotional organisation, reports last week's price at 99.6p per kg of dead weight. But the industry's benchmark for breaking even is generally put at 105p per kg which means farmers are still losing money. The European herd has contracted this year, but supply remains higher than static levels of consumption and prices are recovering only gradually.</p>

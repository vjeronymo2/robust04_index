			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Only Institutional Investors will be eligible to invest in Institutional Shares. Applicants may choose not to make a particular class of Institutional Shares available to one or more categories of Institutional Investors. If no class of Institutional Shares is made available to a particular category of Institutional Investor, Institutional Investors in this category will be permitted to purchase Non-Institutional Shares. However, no Institutional Investor that is eligible to invest in any class of Institutional Shares will be permitted by applicants to invest in any class of Non-Institutional Shares. Accordingly, there will be no overlap between the investors eligible to invest in Institutional Shares and investors eligible to invest in Non-Institutional Shares of a Fund or series thereof. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Under the Multiple Distribution System, certain expenses may be attributable to a Fund, but not to a particular series thereof. All such expenses will be borne by each class on the basis of the relative aggregate net assets of the classes, except in the case of a Fund that has series, in which case they will first be allocated among series, based on the relative aggregate net assets of such series. Expenses that are attributable to a particular series, but not to a particular class thereof, will be borne by each class on the basis of the relative aggregate net assets of the classes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Applicants also propose to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive or reduce a CDSC on certain redemptions of their shares. The CDSC will not be imposed upon a redemption of shares that were purchased more than a specified period of time prior to the redemption (the ``CDSC Period'') or upon shares derived from reinvestment of distributions. Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed upon an amount that represents share appreciation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. The Funds request the ability to waive the CDSC as described below: (a) On redemptions following the total disability (as evidenced by a determination by the federal Social Security Administration) of the shareholder (including a registered joint owner) occurring after the purchase of the shares being redeemed, (b) in the event of the death of the shareholder (including a registered joint owner), (c) on redemptions pursuant to the Funds' right to liquidate small accounts or to charge an annual small account fee, (d) on redemptions of shares acquired as a result of the investment of distributions from shares of a class of one Fund into shares of the same class of another Fund, (e) for redemptions made pursuant to a systematic withdrawal plan, and (f) in connection with the following redemptions of shares held by employer sponsored employee benefit plans maintained on the subaccount record keeping system made available by KFS: (i) Redemptions to satisfy participant loan advances (loan repayments would constitute new purchases for purposes of the contingent deferred sales charge and the conversion privilege), (ii) redemptions in connection with retirement distributions (limited at any one time to 10% of the total value of plan assets invested in the Fund), (iii) redemptions in connection with distributions qualifying under the hardship provisions of Internal Revenue Code section 403(b)(7) or in Treasury Regulation 401(k)&hyph;1(d)(2), as amended, and (iv) redemptions representing returns of excess contributions to such plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. The Funds will provide a credit (i.e., a reimbursement) for any CDSC paid by a redeeming shareholder in connection with a redemption of shares of a class followed by a reinvestment in any shares of the same class of the same Fund or, as permitted by KFS, the same class of another Fund, effected within such number of days of the redemption as may be specified in a Fund's prospectus. The CDSC credit will be paid by KFS. Upon redemption thereafter, when calculating the amount of the CDSC the shares will be deemed to have been held for the period from purchase through reinvestment, except for the period between redemption and reinvestment, until such shares are finally redeemed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The creation of multiple classes of shares may result in shares of a class having priority over another class as to payment of dividends and having unequal voting rights, because under the proposed arrangement: (1) Shareholders of different classes (i) would pay different fees because of the rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (and related costs) and (ii) may pay different service fees, shareholder servicing fees and Class Expenses and (2) each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights as to matters concerning its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The abuses that section 18 of the Act is intended to address as set forth in section 1(b) of the Act are that the interest of investors are adversely affected when investment companies by excessive borrowing and the issuance of excessive amounts of senior securities increase unduly the speculative character of their junior securities or operate without adequate assets or reserves. The Multiple Distribution System does not involve borrowings and does not affect the Funds' existing assets or reserves. In addition, the proposed arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares of the Funds, since all such shares will participate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in all the Fund's appreciation, income and expenses (with the exception of the different distribution fees payable by each class of shares and any other costs relating to implementing the rule 12b&hyph;1 plan for such class or an amendment to such plan including obtaining shareholder approval of the rule 12b&hyph;1 plan for such class or any amendment to such plan), any different service fees, shareholder servicing fees, and Class Expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Amendment 9 would extend the current reef fish permit moratorium from its scheduled expiration on May 8, 1995, through as late as December 31, 1995. For the red snapper segment of the reef fish fishery, Amendment 9 would authorize the collection of commercial landings data for the years 1990 through 1992 and the collection of information to identify certain participants. It would also extend the red snapper endorsement system and its associated trip and landing limits from their scheduled expiration on December 31, 1994, through as late as December 31, 1995. The intended effects of this rule are to collect information needed to evaluate red snapper effort management alternatives, to identify individuals who may qualify for initial participation in a red snapper effort management regime, and to continue interim management measures until the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) has an opportunity to implement longer-term measures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments must be received on or before July 11, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments on the proposed rule must be sent to Robert Sadler, Southeast Regional Office, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive, St. Petersburg, FL 33702.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Requests for copies of Amendment 9, which includes an environmental assessment and a regulatory impact review, should be sent to the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, 5401 West Kennedy Boulevard, suite 331, Tampa, FL 33609.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments regarding the collection-of-information requirement contained in this proposed rule should be sent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Edward E.

Red snapper commercial landings data for 1990, 1991, and 1992 would be collected for vessels according to owner and, in the case of permitted vessels for which the permit was based on the earned income qualification of an operator, according to such operator. Data would also be collected to identify ``historical captains'' in the red snapper fishery and their share arrangements with vessel owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rationale for Proposed Actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Historical Captains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After review of testimony and recommendations of the Council's Ad Hoc Allocation Advisory Panel, the Council determined that historical captains should be considered for fishing privileges under a red snapper effort management system, as well as vessel owners and operators whose earned income qualified for the vessel permit. The eligibility criteria for determining historical captain status were designed to discourage submission of applications by recent entrants to the fishery desiring to qualify for the effort management system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To establish status as a historical captain for purposes of the effort management system, a captain must have:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) From November 6, 1989, through 1993, fished solely under a verbal or written share agreement with an owner to lease a vessel, such agreement providing for the operator to be responsible for hiring the crew, who were paid from his or her share;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Landed from that vessel at least 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) of red snapper per year in 2 of the 3 years 1990, 1991, and 1992; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Derived more than 50 percent of his or her earned income from commercial fishing, that is, sale of the catch, in each of the years 1989 through 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Data Collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed submittal of red snapper landings data to NMFS was requested by vessel owners, operators whose earned income qualified for the vessel permit, and historical captains who are interested in learning of their possible preliminary shares for planning purposes. This information will help fishermen determine their most likely level of participation in an individual transferable quota (ITQ) system, if adopted for the fishery. This also will help the Council and the industry decide whether to proceed with an ITQ system, as included in draft Amendment 8 to the FMP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

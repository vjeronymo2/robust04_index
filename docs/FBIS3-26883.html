			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Yu Haisheng (0060 3189 3932) and Wen Jihua </F> (2429 4949 5478)]    [Excerpts] Beijing, 12 Feb (XINHUA) -- While the Chinese  people were joyously celebrating the Spring Festival, diplomats  in Beijing's consular district were also sharing their holiday  joy.    There is still a chill in the air of Beijing in February,  but  the Friendship Palace of the Friendship Guesthouse is full of  spring. On the stage, students from the Central University of  Nationalities were displaying costumes and styles of China's  minority nationalities. [passage omitted] Among the audience,  Israeli Ambassador to China Ya'agov praised: "It's so beautiful!  The long history and splendid culture of China are  intoxicating."    It seems that China's achievements have even more impressed  the ambassador who has been here for a half year. He said: "I  am not long in China, but everything in China, particularly her  progress over these years, has surprised me." [passage omitted]  <H5>  The "Sinologue" "No Longer Recognizes China" </H5>   Speaking on China, Russian Ambassador to China Rogachev, who  has enjoyed the nickname of "Sinologue," looked a little  excited. He said: Since the founding of China, particularly  since the 1980's, China has changed so greatly that "I can  hardly recognize her." [passage omitted]    Rogachev said the greatest changes in China over these years  can be seen in people's attitudes, words, and behavior. He  said: "They are all very busy and have their own goals; they are  very optimistic, which is obviously the result of continuous  improvement in living standards."  <H5>  The Practical "New Generation" </H5>   Cheerful Cuban Ambassador to China Guerra maintained that  China's development over the decade or so is a "miracle."    Guerra paid his first visit to China in 1967, when the  "Cultural Revolution" was in progress. At that time, he said,  "People wore the same style of clothes, spoke, and behaved  almost identically; one could hardly tell who was man and who  was woman."    When he returned to Beijing in 1988, he found that Beijing  had "completely changed." People's clothes have turned from  dull blue, grey, and green to distinct colors; the wide streets,  skyscrapers, and incessant flow of traffic all display the  city's vitality.    From ordinary people's daily activities and codes of  conduct,  Guerra concluded: The most profound change in China is the  renewal of people's thinking -- the emergence of "a practical  new generation."  <H5>  The Large, Attractive Market </H5>   French Ambassador Presant [name as received] just returned  from Shenzhen. He had participated in the ceremony for putting  the No. 1 generator of the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant into  commercial operation there. In conversations, Presant showed  his joy for the successful operation of this project.    Although he has been in office for one month, he has deeply  sensed this country's vitality. He said: "Commercial complexes  stand in Beijing everywhere; the thick commercial air here seems  to match that in Paris." A two-day tour in Shenzhen allowed him  to witness an extraordinary development in China. He said: "It  is hard to imagine that Shenzhen was a small fishing village 15  years ago!"    Speaking on the prospects for economic cooperation, he said:  The trade volume between France and China accounts for only 1.8  percent of France's foreign trade; "France's share in the big  market of China does not match her position in the international  economy and does not correspond to the potential of both  countries. Presently, French enterprises in the energy,  transportation, and telecommunications sectors strongly desire  to cooperate with China, and the normalization of Franco-Chinese  relations is good news to these enterprises."   <H5>    "Difficulties in the Course of Development" </H5>   The ambassadors have also noticed some difficulties  confronting China, including transport and energy shortages,  unbalanced development among regions, the need to readjust the  industrial structure, and others.    "Take transport as an example; nearly one-third of  Russo-Chinese trade contracts could not be fulfilled in 1993  because of transport shortages," said Rogachev with regret.    As for the gap between eastern and western China, Guerra,  who  has inspected both Shanghai and Xinjiang, said: "They are at  different levels, but they are both advancing. It is like two  high jumpers -- one jumps to the two-meter mark from his  starting point at the one-meter mark, whereas the other jumps to  the four-meter mark from the three-meter mark. In one sense,  Xinjiang may be undergoing greater change, despite the fact that  it will still take a long time to catch up with Shanghai."    Indian Ambassador to China Dasgupta felt that China needs to  improve her basic education and occupational training. "As a  country with a large population, China and India are both facing  the problem of improving their population quality as quickly as  possible," otherwise the population will adversely affect their  "economic development and social progress."    Rogachev maintained: "There would be no progress if there  were no difficulties. China's difficulties are occurring in the  course of development; she will overcome all kinds of obstacles  and accomplish greater achievements."  <H5>  China's Progress Is "A Contribution to World Development" </H5>   [Passage omitted] Dasgupta maintained: As a country in  which one-fifth of the world's population lives, China's rapid  development will produce a profound influence on the whole  world; it will be "a contribution to world development" and will  inspire development in other countries.    Klara Meszaros is a female ambassador from Hungary; female  ambassadors have been rare in China. She said in fluent  Mandarin: "China is a country full of vitality and hope."  [passage omitted]    This female ambassador was infatuated with China's ancient  civilization, but she obviously showed more concern for China's  reform. She said: "I am very glad to see China's progress; it  will benefit the whole world."</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Observer: Turmoil analysis Having difficulty getting in touch with your favourite investment analyst? Don't despair. Ring Paris. Likely as not he or she will be attending this week's biennial congress of the European Federation of Financial Analysts' Societies. The last time the French hosted the event was bang in the middle of a financial crisis - the 1974 oil shock. This time the turmoil on the foreign exchange markets has pushed French short-term interest rates up to crisis levels. However, Jean-Guy de Wael, EFAS chairman and Paribas' research supremo, denies that Paris is jinxed as a site for such gatherings. He's confident that more than 700 of Europe's 10,000 analysts will put in an appearance, including a contingent from Hungary, the first east European nation to be admitted to membership of the federation. After all, what self-respecting analyst would turn down the chance of sitting through presentations by 33 of the 40 constituent companies of the CAC 40 stock market index.</p>

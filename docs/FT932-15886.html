			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Higgs &amp; Hill cuts final as loss is reduced to Pounds 11.6m HIGGS &amp; Hill, the UK construction and property group, yesterday halved its final dividend after incurring a pre-tax loss for the second year running. The loss for 1992 of Pounds 11.6m, however, was an improvement on the previous year's Pounds 16.7m. Mr John Theakston, chief executive, said there would have been a profit of Pounds 340,000 but for provisions of Pounds 12m against commercial and residential property operations. This followed a Pounds 20.9m provision in 1991 when trading profits were Pounds 4.22m. Turnover fell from Pounds 345.2m to Pounds 293.2m. The final dividend is cut to 1.5p, making a total of 2.5p (9p). It is proposed to transfer Pounds 22.5m from reserves following a Pounds 23.7m transfer in 1991. Mr Theakston said the year finished with net cash of Pounds 4.1m compared with net borrowings of Pounds 16.8m at the end of 1991. The construction division, which saw sales slip 19 per cent from Pounds 309.4m to Pounds 250.8m, incurred a Pounds 2.22m trading loss (Pounds 2.61m profit). Housing trading profits increased from Pounds 295,000 to Pounds 2.52m helped by higher sales - 262 units were sold against 235 - and better margins following previous write-downs. Despite the sale of a substantial office development west of Paris, commercial property made a trading profit of just Pounds 35,000 compared with Pounds 1.31m. Mr George Duncan, chairman, said: 'We are hopeful that 1993 will mark the turning point in the group's fortunes. There are now indications that the housing market may be improving.' COMMENT It is quite clear what value Mr Tony Pidgley, Berkeley Group's managing director, saw when he recently bought and sold 300,000 shares in Higgs &amp; Hill, making a nifty profit in the process. The strength of the company is its balance sheet; to have net cash at this stage of the cycle is admirable. The trading outlook, however, remains difficult. Contracting margins are likely to remain under pressure even though it is working hard to win better quality business. The housing operation will get some benefit from recovery but is relatively small. The company should break even or make a small profit this year. The share price of 58p understates the written down value of 156p. Buy for net asset value rather than for short-term earnings improvement.</p>

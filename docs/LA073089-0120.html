			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUDS 'N' BUCKS 'N' ROCK 'N' ROLL;  </P> <P> BEER COMPANIES' ROCK SPONSORSHIPS STIR CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> When the Who performs an all-star production of its rock opera "Tommy" on Aug.  24 at the Universal Amphitheatre, it will be a battle of the brands -- beer,  that is.  </P> <P> Michelob has a sponsorship deal with the Amphitheatre. Miller Genuine Draft is  bankrolling the Who's stadium tour. Budweiser is sponsoring the production of  "Tommy."  </P> <P> The disturbing irony in this sea of suds: A founding member of the English  band, drummer Keith Moon, died in 1978 of alcohol-related causes, and another  member, Pete Townshend, has acknowledged an alcohol addiction.  </P> <P> The "Tommy" example reveals the extent to which beer companies have become  involved in the financial workings of the pop/rock concert industry.  </P> <P> Approximately 75% of the nation's key concert facilities -- including the Greek  Theatre and the Pacific Amphitheatre -- have beer company sponsors, who pay  fees ranging from $100,000 to $500,000 a year for the privilege of plastering  their name around the venue and on the concert tickets.  </P> <P> The beer companies are happy to spend the money because it gets their message  to an audience of young, active, affluent consumers. From the vantage point of  the concert industry, the subsidies help protect their profit margins and help  hold down ticket prices.  </P> <P> But critics contend that the sponsorships promote alcohol consumption to large  numbers of concert-goers under the age of 21, which is the legal drinking age  in 33 states. They fear that the tie-ins may encourage impressionable,  music-loving young fans to start drinking or to drink too much.  </P> <P> Beer company sponsorship of pop and rock concerts is big business -- and  getting bigger. The beer industry spends an estimated $50 million annually to  subsidize concert venues and performers' tours. That doesn't count the amount  spent placing ads on TV and radio in which many of the same pop and rock stars  sing the praises of their favorite brew.  </P> <P> The $50 million outlay for music sponsorships is a drop in the bucket compared  to the $756 million the beer industry spent last year on all forms of media  advertising, but it's significantly higher than the amount the industry spent  in several individual advertising outlets, including consumer magazines ($18  million), newspapers ($19 million), outdoor billboard advertising ($22 million)  and cable TV spots ($34 million).  </P> <P> The business of beer and rock came to public attention when U.S. Surgeon  General C. Everett Koop attacked the practice at a Washington press conference  on May 31.  </P> <P> "I have received a lot of praise as surgeon general because of my strong stand  on AIDS prevention," Koop said. "I was never afraid to say the 'C word' --  condom. I am also not afraid to say the 'A word' -- advertising.  </P> <P> "Certain advertising and marketing practices for alcoholic beverages clearly  send the wrong messages about alcohol consumption to the wrong audiences."  </P> <P> Koop, who is scheduled to leave office on Sept. 30 but has vowed to continue  fighting for this cause as a private citizen, called the press conference to  announce 10 recommendations for reducing alcohol-related traffic fatalities --  the No. 1 cause of death among teen-agers.  </P> <P> Koop noted that more than 40% of deaths among 15- to 20-year-olds result from  motor vehicle crashes -- and that about half of these fatalities involve  alcohol.  </P> <P> In his remarks, Koop singled out the practices of using celebrities who have  strong appeal to youth, and sponsoring rock concerts and sports events.  </P> <P> "These practices tell youth that alcohol consumption leads to athletic, social  and sexual success," he said. "They send the message that drinking is a normal  and glamorous activity without negative consequences. And our young people are  believing these messages."  </P> <P> Micky Saboff, national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, echoed  Koop's concerns, though she stopped short of calling for a ban on alcohol  sponsorships.  </P> <P> "It's part of a whole package of influence, like the marketing of beer on  college campuses and at beaches during spring break," said Saboff. "It's part  of the whole issue of the content of alcohol advertising and the messages kids  get. But we don't have a position to discourage sponsorship. We recognize that  liquor companies have a right to sponsor these events, but they have no right  to sell to people who are under age."  </P> <P> Beer company spokesmen deny that their advertising practices -- including  concert sponsorships -- encourage young people to drink.  </P> <P> "Every study has concluded that advertising doesn't cause alcohol abuse and  underage consumption of our product," said Stephen K. Lambright, a vice  president at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis, the nation's top brewery.  "Advertising does what it's intended to do: influence a person to choose Brand  A over Brand B.  </P> <P> "We as a company are in no way trying to duck the issue of alcohol abuse,  underage consumption or driving under the influence," Lambright added. "We only  differ with the surgeon general on how you go about resolving the problem. We  don't agree with his conclusion, and we're not going to change the way we do  business simply because of this report."  </P> <P> Until about 10 years ago, most pop and rock stars wouldn't have considered  aligning themselves with a corporate sponsor. It would have been viewed as  "selling out" to corporate America.  </P> <P> Not that major companies were exactly besieging them with offers. Most  companies were -- and many still are -- leery of rock stars and rock music,  fearing that it projects the wrong image.  </P> <P> This started changing in 1977, when Rockbill Inc., a New York-based marketing  company, persuaded Anheuser-Busch to sponsor a concert series in Cape Cod,  Mass.  </P> <P> In the next few years, the dam burst. In 1981, the Rolling Stones signed a  $500,000 deal with Jovan cologne. In 1982, the Who signed a $1-million deal  with Schlitz beer. In 1983, Michael Jackson signed a $5-million deal with  Pepsi-Cola.  </P> <P> "It's really an '80s phenomenon," said Gary Bongiovonni, editor of Pollstar, a  weekly trade magazine that covers the concert industry.  </P> <P> "It's gotten to the point now in terms of big tours that it's far more common  to have a corporate sponsor than not to have one," he said. "A few acts, based  on principle, won't associate with corporate sponsors, but probably 75% of big  tours have them. I think everybody looks at it as extra money to put in their  pocket to help defray the expenses and risks of going on the road."  </P> <P> Rockbill president Jay Coleman notes that corporate sponsorships have become a  major part of funding for pop concerts.  </P> <P> "At a decent amphitheater, a sponsorship can mean anywhere from $250,000 to  $500,000 a season," Coleman said.  </P> <P> "It's become a very important part of the revenue stream for concert promoters  today. A lot of them rely on the money they receive from corporate sponsorships  to help ensure that they'll make a profit over the course of the season."  </P> <P> John Marx, vice president in charge of the contemporary music department at the  William Morris Agency, was even more emphatic: "Promoters and venues argue that  without those revenues, they couldn't be in business."  </P> <P> Larry Solters, a senior vice president at MCA Music Entertainment Group, which  oversees Universal Amphitheatre operations, said that it's becoming harder and  harder for venues to resist sponsors' advances.  </P> <P>  "In today's economic climate, if somebody approaches you and says they'll give  you a couple hundred thousand dollars to put up a sign and be in your  advertising, it's something you have to consider," Solters said."  </P> <P> In addition to easing the bottom line for concert promoters, corporate  sponsorships also help keep the cost of concert tickets down.  </P> <P> Rob Kahane, who co-manages George Michael, estimates that ticket prices would  go up by $2 to $2.50 per show without the sponsorship subsidy.  </P> <P> While a wide range of companies are involved in sponsorships, breweries are  especially active.  </P> <P> "Every major brewery has endorsements," said Gary Smith, vice president at  Pollstar. "And all the venues are trying to get endorsements whenever possible.  It's more than just a trend. It's just simply good business."  </P> <P> Demographics.  </P> <P> That's the main reason that breweries have become involved in rock 'n' roll.  </P> <P> The prime concert audience and the prime beer-drinking market overlap to a  degree that is a marketer's dream. The core consumers in both cases: 18- to  24-year-olds (though, of course, beer marketers insist that they target only  people of legal drinking age). The secondary market in both cases: young-end  baby boomers in the 25-to-34 range.  </P> <P> But it's not just the age of the fans at concerts that appeals to beer  marketers.  </P> <P> John Hellweg, vice president of marketing services for Stroh Brewing Co. in  Detroit, nearly drooled when he profiled a typical concert-goer.  </P> <P> "These are people who are active and outgoing, who have disposable incomes, who  are cognizant of what's hot and what's not," he said. "They are people who will  spend their money, who go out of their way to get out of their homes and  apartments. They're exactly our target customers."  </P> <P> Maile Buker, program manager of field marketing for the Coors Light Group in  Golden, Colo., agreed that pop music is one of the best ways to reach a young,  active audience.  </P> <P> "Music is integral to young adults' life style," she said. "It's a big part of  their life. We think it's a way to speak directly to our consumers."  </P> <P> Rather than sponsoring national tours by the biggest names, Coors sponsors 16  local and regional bands who play rock clubs around the country. Buker said  that one of the reasons is to transfer the intense loyalty that fans feel for a  favorite band to the brand of beer served at the club.  </P> <P> "Local bands are local heroes," she said. "They've got a captive audience that  we wish to try and access ourselves."  </P> <P> John Shafer, manager of consumer affairs for the Miller Brewing Co. in  Milwaukee, said that Miller sponsors artists and venues popular with fans in  the 21-to-35 age group, which is their target market.  </P> <P> "People who are under 21 also enjoy some of the same kinds of music, but our  sponsorship isn't intended to encourage them to buy our brand," he said. "I  doubt that any of our concerts are put on where we expect a majority of the  audience to be under 21."  </P> <P> And what is it about rock that appeals most to beer marketers?  </P> <P> "A lot of the 21- to 35-year-olds who drink beer also enjoy rock music," Shafer  explained. "If they enjoyed opera, we'd sponsor opera."  </P> <P> Some believe that artists are becoming more conscious of the need for  responsibility in this area -- or at least more aware of the repercussions of  associating with alcohol products.  </P> <P> "Musicians and athletes are taking a second look at whether they should promote  alcohol," said Pollstar's Smith. "If it's going to give them a negative image,  a lot of artists will stop doing it."  </P> <P> Jerry Hall, vice president/publisher of Live Concert Network, which publishes  handbills distributed at 50 venues nationwide, drew an analogy to tobacco  endorsements.  </P> <P> "It would be hard to imagine an artist these days aligning with a tobacco  company," Hall said. "In talking to artists and managers who are seeking  sponsorships, we don't even ask about tobacco sponsors, and now more and more  they're telling us that beer is a no-no."  </P> <P> Last month, Ringo Starr announced that he won't endorse an alcohol product on  his current tour -- and won't even allow any alcohol backstage. The ex-Beatle,  who did commercials for a wine cooler a few years ago, has admitted to past  alcohol problems.  </P> <P> Starr's sponsor on his upcoming tour: Diet Pepsi.  </P> <P> George Michael is another pop star who won't accept an alcohol company  sponsorship. His co-manager, Kahane, said that Michael turned down a  sponsorship deal with Michelob on the grounds that many of his fans are  underage.  </P> <P> "George won't touch anything that has to do with alcohol or cigarettes because  he has a tremendous amount of influence over kids and he doesn't want them to  think that it's cool because he's endorsing it," Kahane said.  </P> <P> Michael takes it a step further. When he is playing facilities that are  alcohol-sponsored, he demands that all alcohol signs in the building be  removed.  </P> <P> Performers aren't the only ones trying to exercise more restraint.  </P> <P> The beer companies say they are cautious about sponsoring any act known to have  a large underage following. They don't even want to give the appearance of an  association.  </P> <P> On their "Licensed to Ill" tour in 1987, the Beastie Boys used a giant replica  of a six-pack of Budweiser beer as a stage prop. Because the rap trio was then  one of the hottest acts in pop, Anheuser-Busch briefly considered entering into  a sponsorship deal with the group. But Ken Anderson, the trio's New York-based  lawyer, said that the discussions came to an abrupt halt as soon as  Anheuser-Busch executives saw the Beasties' show, which focused on their rowdy,  chug-a-lug image and drew a large number of underage fans.  </P> <P> Busch not only passed on the sponsorship, but filed suit to force the trio to  stop using the Bud trademark.  </P> <P> "Anheuser-Busch didn't think it was appropriate to be affiliated in any way  shape or form with the act," company spokesman Gary Pagano said. "To have the  prop on stage might leave the impression that there was a connection."  </P> <P> But occasionally there is a slip-up. Anheuser-Busch included teen heroes New  Edition in the lineup on its recent Budweiser SuperFest concert series.  </P> <P> Pagano contended that the group's target audience is in its early to mid-20s, a  characterization disputed by several people interviewed for this article. New  Edition's manager, Craig Fruin, declined to comment.  </P> <P> Lesa Ukman, editor of Special Events Report, a Chicago-based newsletter that  reports on sponsorship, suggested that demographic studies by an outside  company be required to ensure that at least 80% of a performer's core audience  is above the legal drinking age. If it's not, she said, a beer company  shouldn't be allowed to sponsor it.  </P> <P> "It's in the beer companies' interest more than anyone else's because the last  thing they need is having public sentiment turn against them," said Ukman.  "They saw how quickly things turned around in public tolerance for tobacco."  </P> <P> Key figures in the entertainment industry are split on the beer/rock issue.  </P> <P> Ron Weisner, whose management client Steve Winwood had a sponsorship deal last  year with Michelob, said that he is against government attempts to control what  an artist does.  </P> <P> "Once you start doing that it's almost a type of censorship," he said. "Where  do you stop? They could beat up the soft drink manufacturers because caffeine  isn't good for you. I think it should be every artist's individual decision --  not the federal government dictating what you can and cannot do."  </P> <P> But Danny Goldberg, who manages Belinda Carlisle, Sheena Easton and Bonnie  Raitt, was supportive of Surgeon General Koop.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure whether or not I agree with him, but I think his ideas have to be  taken very, very seriously," Goldberg said. "He comes from a medical point of  view, not a religious agenda or a demagogic political agenda."  </P> <P> Goldberg's position is surprising because he is an American Civil Liberties  Union activist and an outspoken critic of the Parents' Music Resource Center --  the Washington-based organization that advocates warning stickers on selected  rock albums.  </P> <P> "I have a lot more respect for Koop's concerns than I do for the PMRC or a long  list of cheap, headline-seeking politicians who are trying to give advice to  entertainers," he said. "I think it's time that people in Washington started  identifying alcohol as the biggest drug problem this country has. That leads  you into the true complexity of dealing with the drug problem as opposed to  simplistic phrases like 'Just Say No.' "  </P> <P> Many in the concert industry believe that a compromise can be worked out, in  which concert facilities would be allowed to keep the beer sponsorships if they  display messages urging young people to exercise moderation and responsibility  in their drinking.  </P> <P> "The first thing kids see when they walk into a venue should be signs saying,  'Pick a designated driver' and 'If you drink, don't drive,' " said Johnny  Podell, director of the East Coast contemporary music department at the William  Morris Agency.  </P> <P> "If they get that message from the time they start going to concerts, you  haven't just neutralized the issue, you've turned it into a positive. It brings  rock 'n' roll and safe drinking together, not where rock 'n' roll is cool and  safe drinking is something your parents tell you to do."  </P> <P> At his press conference, Koop expressed the hope that the alcohol companies  will exercise more responsibility.  </P> <P> "I am the nation's surgeon general, not the nation's chaplain," he said.  "Nevertheless, I think we should all pray that those who are caught between  their conscience and their pocketbooks on this issue make the right choice."  </P></p>

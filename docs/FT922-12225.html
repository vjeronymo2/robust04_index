			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Secret arms deals denied THE US said yesterday that some US military equipment sold to Saudi Arabia was later illegally transferred to Iraq, Syria and Bangladesh but denied it secretly allowed the transfers, Reuter reports. The State Department said the Saudis transferred equipment to Iraq in 1986 and in 1991 to Syria and Bangladesh, both of which were members of the US-led coalition against Iraq in the Gulf war. The department was responding to claims that the US administration secretly let Saudi Arabia supply US-made weapons to Iraq and other countries to avoid restrictions imposed by Congress.</p>

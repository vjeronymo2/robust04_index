			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Victory For Clinton: Boy from Hope who beat the odds - A lifelong passion for the workings of government has shaped the next president NOBODY becomes president of the US by accident or acclamation. Even those vice-presidents who have inherited the job by dint of resignation, natural death or assassination have been ambitious and successful enough to put themselves a heartbeat away from the Oval Office and thus to lay reasonable claim to the position. William Jefferson Clinton, born Blythe, still only 46 years old, has been running for president for a very long time. His has been a career never removed from politics and government and, if each step along his long road from a modest beginning in Hope, Arkansas, has not been entirely predictable, there is no question about his devotion to his chosen trade, nor about his ultimate goal. Mr Clinton's father was killed in an accident three months before he was born and his grandparents were influential in his early years as his mother earned additional nursing qualifications away from home. She remarried and he and his brother had a difficult relationship with their stepfather, who suffered from alcoholism. Bill was educated at state schools in Arkansas. His political interests were apparent early. As a teenager he shook hands in the White House with John Kennedy and preserved a filmed record. At 23 he wrote to his draft board that he was registering for military service because he wanted to preserve his 'political viability'. He was in the thick of the civil rights movement as an undergraduate in Washington, demonstrated against the Vietnam war in London, and helped organise Texas for George McGovern in 1972. He was attorney general of his state in his 20s and governor by the time he was 32, one of the youngest ever to assume such a position. Defeated after one two-year term, he went back to the drawing board, saw what he had done wrong and won re-election, a more pragmatic, less confrontational politician. He began to seek to change the balance of power inside the national Democratic party, mostly through his leading role in the resolutely centrist - and southern dominated - Democratic Leadership Conference. In the summer of 1987, when he announced he would not seek the Democratic presidential nomination the following year, he admitted he had his eye on the presidency some day. Until a surprisingly poor keynote address at the Democratic convention of 1988, he was considered one of the rising stars of his party. In 1989, he contemplated not seeking re-election as governor, so as to devote himself exclusively to a run at the presidency. In the back of his mind was undoubtedly the thought that although Arkansas had produced conspicuous figures on Capitol Hill - J. William Fulbright, legendary chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, and Wilbur Mills, doyen of ways and means in the House, for example - it had not placed anybody on a national ticket since 1928, and then in the junior position. There was also the feeling that Jimmy Carter had given obscure southern governors a bad name. But Mr Clinton stuck with his state. He is now the longest serving governor in the nation. He was not rated in the first tier of Democratic aspirants 15 months ago but, one by one, the party heavyweights declined to take on President George Bush, then immensely popular, leaving Mr Clinton the best prepared and the best organised of a disparate crew. By the start of this year, he had earned the position of front runner - some say he was 'anointed' such by a favourably disposed media - and the primary season demonstrated that the early judgment was not misplaced. His determination was more than evident as he overcame waves of charges about his personal behaviour. Both then, and during the campaign proper, he has been the subject of scrutiny to an unprecedented extent, to the point that it cannot be said of him, as it was of Mr Carter, that he comes to the presidency a closed or under-read book. This does not mean that it is possible to predict with great precision how he will perform and what he will do as president, but certain salient characteristics are apparent. His intelligence, for example, is not in dispute. Georgetown, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and Yale Law School constitute a substantial academic pedigree, particularly for a small-town youth from a state like Arkansas. His wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, from suburban Chicago, whom he married in 1975, is of a comparable intellectual stature: she was first in her class at Wellesley, also Yale Law School, and subsequently a successful advocate with the most influential law firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, and as a policy activist on issues such as children's rights. The common view is that she is more liberal than her husband. She was known socially and professionally by her maiden name until after Mr Clinton's first defeat in Arkansas. But it cannot be said, after all they have been through this year, that they do not form a formidable partnership. For political reasons, Mrs Clinton has taken a more deferential role in public in recent months but she is likely to be a power in the White House, perhaps along the lines of Eleanor Roosevelt. Though more legally qualified to serve as attorney general than was Robert Kennedy, appointed to the post by his brother, a cabinet position for her is unlikely. Both Mr Clinton and his wife are 'policy wonks' - they like to get into the interstices of policy, to argue fine points into the dead of night and to try to find the right mix of what may be contrary proposals. Mr Carter had similar tendencies, successfully deployed during Camp David. Mr Clinton, however, comes to the White House with much greater familiarity of most of the main issues of the day than could be said of Mr Carter 16 years ago, largely because of the reforms in education, training and health that he has introduced in Arkansas. He seems to like the presentation of different points of view and subsequent reconciliation of those differences. It may be a help that he clearly is beholden to few, if any, of the traditional power blocs inside his party, and saddled with little personal ideological baggage, beyond the conviction that government, properly applied, can be good for the nation. In this respect he is very much the product of his formative years - the 1960s - and the antithesis of the Reagan-Bush era. His southernness is an important ingredient in his make-up. There remains a neighbourliness to the south which requires politicians to keep their feet on the ground, particularly in smaller states such as Arkansas. It certainly was the case throughout the long campaign that Mr Clinton, far more than his Democratic rivals and President Bush, seemed able to understand and articulate the concerns of average people. Mr Clinton grew up in the south at a time of huge social and economic change. Like many of his generation from the region, he is at ease with minorities, especially blacks. He sends his daughter, Chelsea, to a thoroughly integrated state school. He sensed that to take on the Rev Jesse Jackson was not necessarily to sacrifice black support, a calculation that Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis, the previous Democratic candidates, never felt confident enough to make. The Baptist rhythms of his speech, when he is on form, are not an artifice. The contemporary southern heritage mixes social liberalism with financial conservatism. Mr Clinton has been obliged by state law for his 12 years as governor to balance the Arkansas budget. This does not translate into support for the constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget, but it does mean that he is accustomed to taking tough budgetary decisions and it does mean that he favours the 'line item' veto, whereby offending elements in an omnibus bill may be identified and struck out. The south's progress over the last 25 years has also been predicated on the creation of a favourable climate for the private sector, in which Arkansas under Mr Clinton's direction has been no exception. He prefers co-operation, not confrontation, between business and government and has praised the German and Japanese models in this respect. Conventional liberals are uneasy with his willingness to accommodate business at the expense, they allege, of the environment and the workforce. Southerners have also been traditionally 'conservative' on foreign policy issues, including support for a strong military. Mr Clinton obviously lacks formal foreign policy experience, and he did not exactly encourage discussion of foreign policy in the campaign, other than to pick holes in the Bush record where necessary and to support it where appropriate. But this does not denote either a lack of interest or knowledge in the world outside. Indeed he seems to understand that the end of the cold war offers the opportunity for new approaches, including the evolution towards a leaner, more flexible military. His foreign policy advisers have been noteably mainstream. As a Democrat, therefore, he is different in the sense that he does not appear to be either isolationist or protectionist, the prevalent trends in the party for much of the last dozen years. But this does make him easier to read. He certainly comes to the office having spoken volumes about every known subject but, perhaps because of the very profusion of his words, with some of the contradictions as evident as some of the consistencies. An Arkansas mafia has been with him over the years, but it is nothing like as large nor as central as Mr Carter's Georgian crew and is supplemented by his old academic friends, including several Rhodes Scholars, and by his political network. The style, therefore, that Mr Clinton may bring to Washington is likely to be eclectic. He likes popular music, answers to the nickname Elvis and has played the saxophone on late night television; he hits golf balls and goes running, the latter because of a tendency to gain weight; his taste in literature is said to be catholic: he likes a social drink and plays cards. But mostly he likes to talk and mostly about what makes government work - and very late into the night.</p>

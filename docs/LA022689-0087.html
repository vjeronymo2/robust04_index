			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Four San Jose men have been arrested as part of "Operation Polar Cap," a  continuing federal probe into a $1-billion cocaine money-laundering network.  Johnny Elias Chawi, 34; Emil Youssel Chawi, 45; Sadir Mouaflack Ajmeh, 32, and  Leon Elovits, 38, were taken into custody after allegedly making cash deposits  of less than $10,000 to banks to evade banking laws that require notifying the  Internal Revenue Service if more than $10,000 is deposited, the U.S. Attorney's  Office in San Francisco said. So far, as a result of the investigation, 37  people have been charged with taking in at least $1 billion through merchants  in Los Angeles, Texas, Florida and New York. The money eventually was sent to  Colombian drug lords, authorities said.  </P></p>

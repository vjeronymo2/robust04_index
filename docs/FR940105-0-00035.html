			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Northwest contends the Commission should not require pipelines to support the 2400 baud modem speed because any speed slower than 9600 baud will place too great a burden on the EBB communication network. It recommends each pipeline be able to choose the appropriate modem speed so long as it identifies the hardware necessary to access the EBB. Working Group 4 reached consensus on the principle that pipelines must support a minimum modem speed so all potential users will have reasonable access to the EBBs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission will not disturb the consensus, since Working Group 4's rationale is reasonable and the Commission has no data on the impact on user access of permitting pipelines to require higher modem speeds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Working Group 4 Report at 15.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission recognizes that modem speeds higher than 9600 are in use. The Commission is amending the protocols to provide that EBB operators supporting such higher modem speeds must comply with the recognized national or international standards governing modem communication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transco recommends changes to three of the communication protocols. First, it argues the Commission should clarify that the requirement for 24-hour EDI access (protocol ID) is subject to two separate contingencies, required periodic maintenance and unpredicted downtime. The Commission sees no need to change this language from what was proposed by Working Group 4; the possibility of unforseen events causing computer problems is well understood and need not be addressed separately. Second, Transco contends the Commission's proposed language on advance authorization for third-party access to commercially sensitive data (protocol IIIA) is unclear because it does not specify that the pipeline's customer must provide the authorization. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 44 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission agrees that the customer must authorize access to commercially sensitive data and will modify this principle accordingly. Third, Transco asserts the Commission's proposed language for log-on scripts (protocol IVB) does not reflect the principle put forward by Working Group 4, because it fails to make clear that the script for customized software packages is part of the customized package, not a separate software code. The Commission will modify this protocol to reflect this principle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 44 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A pipeline customer might want to authorize an agent to obtain commercially sensitive information about the customer, such as the customer's nominations, from the EBB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Common Codes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NOPR, the Commission found the post-Order No. 636 business environment and the computerization of capacity release transactions required the development of common, standardized codes in two areas: Codes to identify companies; and common transaction point codes to enable shippers to use a single coding structure to identify pipeline points, particularly interconnect points between pipelines. Working Group 5 had identified, but had not finalized, a process for developing both sets of codes. In the NOPR, the Commission stated that it expected Working Group 5 to finalize its proposal for common company codes by February 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For common transaction points, Working Group 5 proposed an approach in which a third-party (code assignor) would prepare a computerized cross-reference table correlating pipelines' proprietary codes (as verified and updated by the pipelines) to a common code. Those wanting to use the common code would maintain the cross-reference table on their computers and could convert proprietary pipeline codes to the common code, and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> vice versa. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission was concerned about the feasibility of this process, at least in the short term, because Working Group 5 had not worked out the details of the approach (such as how to select a code assignor, pay for the costs of the initial assignment and continued maintenance, or distribute the code) and had suggested this process be undertaken by a yet undeveloped gas industry standards board. Due to the importance of this issue, the Commission gave the Working Group until October 1, 1993, to finalize this approach or reach another consensus approach. If no consensus was reached, the Commission proposed to select a common code and require the pipelines to make the translation to the common code. The Commission requested comments on whether it should adopt the PI&hyph;GRID code developed by the Petroleum Information Corporation or another common code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters support the development of a common code and the selection of the PI&hyph;GRID code if consensus on an alternative is not reached. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 45 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Columbia Distribution and Exxon contend the pipelines, not the users, should make the translation. Pipelines contend that requiring them to make the translation to the common code would increase costs significantly, because it would affect all their computer operations, such as those for accounting, scheduling, and management, which are based on the use of proprietary codes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 46 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  They assert Commission selection of the common code could impede the cooperative efforts of the industry to date and recommend the Commission permit Working Group 5 to continue its efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 45 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Power Generators, NYMEX/EnerSoft, WEV, IPAA, Destec Energy, FMA, NGSA, Edison, WEV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 46 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Columbia Gas, Enron, INGAA, KGPL, Natural, Transco, Tenneco.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 12, 1993, Working Group 5 filed its report which detailed its consensus agreement on a code assignor process along the lines of its previous proposal. As discussed below, the Commission is adopting the Working Group's proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The common code structure proposed by the Working Group would consist of two components. The first would be the code number itself, a 16 digit number, which according to the Working Group, would provide the user with some information about each point. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 47 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The second is a common code data base consisting of data elements that will be associated with each common code. These data elements include such information as the name of the point, the owner operator of the point, a flow indicator showing the direction of gas flow at the point, and a point locator (e.g., geographic coordinates, survey coordinates, or line number or mile marker) to be provided when the information is available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 47 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, for each non-well facility point, the first two numbers indicate the state; the second three, the county; the next five a surface location within the state; the next two, the facility code; the next two, a sub number identifying components of certain types of facilities (e.g., gas plant inlets from tailgates); and the final two, a detail number identifying multiple facilities at the same location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposal, PI&hyph;GRID will be the code assignor and will provide a copy of the data base to any requestor at a price reflecting only its distribution and handling costs. The Working Group also proposes that various Code Distributors will enter into agreements with PI&hyph;GRID to distribute the code. These agreements would provide that the Code Distributors would not be able to charge for the data base itself, but would be able to charge for other ``value added'' services, such as selective extraction of information from the data base. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 48 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 48 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Working Group envisions a series of contracts, beginning with a master agreement between PI&hyph;GRID and a consortium of the gas industry. If a gas industry standards board eventually is developed, it would then take over this contract. PI&hyph;GRID would enter into contracts based on the master agreement with Code Distributors, and the Code Distributors would enter into agreements with users specifying the services Distributor will provide. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

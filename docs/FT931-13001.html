			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / First Guatemalan refugees return SOME 2,500 Guatemalan refugees, the first batch of a total of 45,000, arrived in Guatemala City over the weekend, ending more than a decade of exile in Mexico. The refugees who fled army-backed atrocities in the early 1980s were welcomed by more than 10,000 sympathisers in the capital's central square. Mr Jorge Serrano, Guatemala's president, said their return 'marked a new era in the direction the country will take'. The peaceful return of the refugees is seen as a crucial test of the government's willingness to end the country's 30-year-old civil war. But the repatriation of the remaining refugees could still be postponed, as the government has suspended its guarantee of their safety, after differences with refugee leaders. Last week Mr Serrano presented the United Nations with a plan for 'peace in 90 days' to end the civil war. The small band of left-wing rebels with whom the government is trying to make peace agreed to discuss the proposal, but insisted on an immediate ceasefire, and a 50 per cent reduction in the size of the army. Mr Serrano dismissed the rebel counter-offer. The peace plan was partly overshadowed by publicity given to the president's visit to Stringfellows, a topless bar in New York. Mr Serrano, who is an evangelical Christian and pastor of two Protestant churches, said he only went to 'take a bowl of onion soup'.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Management: Bringing equality into the open - Lucy Kellaway shares a sandwich from the canteen with Ian Gibson, the man in the driving seat at Nissan Ian Gibson does not have an office. The man who manages 4,000 people at Nissan in Sunderland sits at a small desk in a big open-plan space. He wears a mid-blue uniform with the Nissan logo on one lapel and a Queen's Award for Exports badge on the other. From where he works he can see scores of identical desks and chairs occupied by identically-clad people. The only sign that Gibson is the boss is the couple of extra feet of space that surround his desk. Everything else about him - appearance, conversation, what he eats and where he parks his car - shouts the same message. At Nissan privilege is out; equality and accessibility are in. Gibson reckons that Nissan has outdone the Japanese at their own game. With relish he explains how the first MD - a Japanese - had his own office. But once he left, the British directors decided to move out with everyone else. 'In Japan there is a more layered culture,' he says. 'We get a lot of resistance from our Japanese visitors - they feel more comfortable in a private room.' For them and for the more sensitive of the politicians, suppliers and customers who make the journey to the Sunderland car plant, there is a private meeting room. This contains a plain table and a sofa and chairs, arranged in formal Japanese fashion. Gibson views such private sessions as a dieter would regard a cream cake. 'I don't like to give in to the visitor syndrome,' he says. 'It is very easy to lay on lunch in the visitors' dining room, but I prefer to talk to them out here, and take them to lunch in the canteen.' The British subsidiary has also taken a stand against the cult of the personality. Two small photographs of the chairman and managing director of the Japanese parent company are barely tolerated in the otherwise unadorned visitors' room. 'We may be able to get rid of them soon,' Gibson says. In the annual report there is no picture of the managing director; his statement does not even bear his name. 'I do not like glory hunters and do not want to be one,' he says. Indeed, Gibson is so self-effacing and so intent on promoting the team that he tends to reply in the plural, whatever the question. What does he think of the uniforms and the open plan space? 'For the first six months, most people said it was difficult to adjust to the open plan office,' he replies. 'But we all liked the idea of the uniform as it shows we are trying to be more equal.' He - or rather they - did draw the line at the company song and company exercise sessions: 'We did not feel comfortable with that'. What about personal effects? Wouldn't he like to have a few of his own things on his desk, which by company rules has to be cleared every night? No, he says, he has just what he needs. He moves over to the desk, (which he makes a point of never sitting behind when he has visitors, using instead a plain table surrounded by four chairs), and indicates a modest collection of belongings. 'There's a picture of me missus, a clock given out when I was at Ford, my pipes, ashtray - that's about it.' To anyone used to working in complicated hierachies with colourful characters and pushy egos, there could seem something a little bland, depressing even, about Nissan's well-regulated atmosphere. In the entrance lobby area are notices declaring the group's determination to cherish its people and certificates extolling its training policies. The reception area doubles as a communal meeting room with little tables and chairs. At one, the lady in charge of the lavatories is talking disinfectants with a supplier. Upstairs everyone is quietly getting on with their work. At lunchtime, many of the workers do what the boss himself does, and pick up a couple of canteen sandwiches to eat at their desks. Gibson works hard, and expects others to do likewise. His office day starts soon after 7am, and would continue until after 6pm, were it not for his charitable work. This means about two meetings a week for Business in the Community, universities and local charities. To help him, he has one secretary, who spends much of her time heading a 'kaizen' group on continuous improvement in Nissan's administration. The phone rings and as the secretary is not there, he answers it himself. With no unnecessary preliminaries, he asks what it costs to sponsor a race. Those who think that the efficient, caring set-up at Nissan sounds too good to be true would be heartened by a book* published this week arguing that it is a sham: the company is taking advantage of high unemployment to extract more than its pound of flesh from its workers. Gibson shows no defensiveness at the mention of the book. 'I don't know how to put it . . .' Always understated, he is being particularly careful. 'They wrote the book without ever coming here. If you read it, it is about political class struggle . . . I believed that was something that had died out in British industry.' Maybe it has at Nissan, but then Nissan will waste no time in telling you that it is ahead of the game. *The Nissan Enigma by Philip Garrahan and Paul Stewart. Mansell Publishing</p>

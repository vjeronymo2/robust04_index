Reports say the Pakistani decision came after its delegation  realized that there was no prospect of the resolution being  carried. Leading the way, Iran appealed to Pakistan not to  press for the resolution just before the voting was scheduled to  begin. The Iranian move was supported by China. Immediately  after, delegate after delegate of the developing countries,  including Syria and Indonesia, appealed to Pakistan to withdraw  the resolution. Majority of the countries indicated that they  would abstain from voting. They said the issue should be  resolved through bilateral talks between the two sides.    The leader of the Indian delegation, Mr. Atal Behari  Vajpayee, and the minister of state for external affairs, Mr.  Salman Khurshid, have expressed the satisfaction at the  withdrawal of the resolution and called it a vindication of New  Delhi's principled stand.    The leader of the Pakistani delegation said that Islamabad's  move followed high-level consultations between Iran and Pakistan  and the views of the majority of member countries.    The external affairs minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, has thanked  Iran and China for prevailing upon Pakistan to withdraw the  resolution. In a statement in New Delhi, he expressed the hope  that Pakistan will now be ready for bilateral talks under the  Simla Agreement and desist from misleading the international  community through false allegations of violations of human  rights in India.    The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has complimented  Mr. Vajpayee on phone for the excellent work done at the UN  Human Rights Commission in Geneva.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FUNDS FROZEN BY U.S., NORIEGA'S 4 ATTORNEYS WANT TO WITHDRAW;  </P> <P> NORIEGA LAWYERS ASK TO PULL OUT  </P> <P> Attorneys for Manuel Noriega said today that they are filing a motion to  withdraw from the case because the U.S. government has frozen all their  client's money.  </P> <P> "There are millions of dollars in bank accounts that are frozen, even though  under the government's contention, they are not subject to the forfeiture law,"  said Jon May, one of Noriega's four attorneys.  </P> <P> "We are not asking for any funds that would be tainted."  </P> <P> May said the defense has received only "a few thousand dollars" for expenses  since Noriega's capture, and nothing in fees.  </P> <P> He said the defense now needs money to travel, take depositions and do research  but lacks the resources because of the frozen bank accounts. "But the  government is refusing to even negotiate," he said.  </P> <P> He emphasized that the attorneys' motion to withdraw is not automatic, and must  be approved by U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler.  </P> <P> May blamed the Bush Administration for the decision to freeze all of Noriega's  accounts, rather than the U.S. attorney's office in Miami.  </P> <P> "The government is spending $20 million to $30 million on their case," said  another defense attorney, Steven Kollin. "We don't need anywhere near that  amount, but we may need $5 million to defend Gen. Noriega."  </P></p>

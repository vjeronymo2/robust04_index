			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Brothers" page] </F>   [Text] Informed Sudanese sources have affirmed that Dr.  Hasan al-Turabi [leader of the National Islamic Front] is  personally involved in triggering the civil war in Yemen. The  same sources say that some time ago al-Turabi met with  'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, a representative of the Islamic Reform  Group; and 'Abd-al-'Aziz Yasin, a representative of the Muslim  Brotherhood in Yemen. He persuaded them to reject the Pledge  and Agreement Document signed by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 'Ali  Salim al-Bid in Jordan.    The sources note that al-Turabi claimed to some Yemeni  forces  that the continuing political crisis in Yemen will eventually  lead those he called "the Islamic forces" to control power both  in northern and southern Yemen.</p>

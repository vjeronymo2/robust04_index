			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 16, 11-17 April </F> 94]    [Text] According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Statistics,  Ukraine's inflation rate in March was 105.7 per cent, the lowest  mark since September 1991.    The averaged cost of vital foods in the consumer basket was  431,500 karbovanets in prices charged by state-run and  non-state-run shops. The gap between the consumer basket's  minimal and maximal costs widened to 45.5 per cent with the city  of Sevastopol and the Kirovograd region forming two poles with  536,000 krb. and 368,500 krb., respectively.    In urban collective farm market prices the basket weighed as  much as 523,000 krb. to exceed the state-run retail trade's  prices by 21.2 per cent.    Food prices grew by 3 per cent in March, on the average, and  were virtually unchanged for dairy products, sunflower seed oil,  margarine, rice, buckwheat, sausages, mayonnaise, and yeast.  Prices for meat, pork fat, eggs, citrus fruits, vodka dropped  by 8 per cent, on the average.    Prices grew, however, for certain manufactured goods, such  as  children's clothes (by 11 per cent) and footwear (by 21 per  cent), pharmaceutical products (by 21 per cent), books,  newspapers and office materials (by 14 per cent).    The 23 March - 5 April period witnessed a steeper price  growth versus the preceding 10-day period; food prices in  state-run shops and co-ops grew by 2.1 per cent, and collective  farm market prices by 1.4 per cent versus the previous 10-day  period's figures of 1.2 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.    Food price growth rates were the highest in Crimea (by 11  per  cent), while in Ukraine's 12 regions (Zhitomir, Transcarpathian,  Zaporozhye, Poltava, Ivano-Frankovsk, Kiev, Rivne, Kherson,  Khmelnitski, Cherkassy and Chernigov) the price growth rates  were between 3 and 4 per cent.    Bread products baked from first and extra brands of flour  became sizably more expensive with prices for them having grown  by 72 per cent in Crimea, by 20 per cent in the Cherkassy region  (in both cases higher prices were imposed by the republican and  regional administrations), and by 18 per cent in the  Transcarpathian region, by 28 per cent in Ivano-Frankovsk  region, by 12 per cent in the Kirovograd region, by 20 per cent  in the Lvov region, and by 9 per cent in the Ternopol region  because of flour prices raised by suppliers.    Inter-regional wide variations persisted in prices for  certain food products. Thus, prices for cheeses with low fat  content varied by as much as 6.8 times (2,778 krb. per kg. in  the Chernigov region and 18,930 krb. per kg. in Kiev city),  farina prices by 5.6 times (1,800 krb. per kg. in the Ternopol  region vs 10,000 krb. per kg. in the Volyn region), flour  prices by 3.5 times (2,390 krb. per kg. in the Kirovograd region  and 8,480 krb. per kg. in the Kiev region), prices for rolled  oats by 3.2 times (3,180 krb. per kg. in the Rovno region and  10,200 krb. per kg. in the Nikolaev region).    Food price hikes were the steepest in the Kherson (by 16 per  cent), Rovno (by 8 per cent), Kirovograd and Volyn (by 7 per  cent) regions. Vegetables were most affected by price growths,  while beef, pork and pork fat prices were largely immune to  these. Dairy products and butter, sunflower seed oil, potatoes  and eggs were slightly cheaper (prices for them dropped,  respectively, by 1 per cent to 2 per cent, 4 per cent and 9 per  cent).    It should be noted that urban collective farm markets  witnessed a two-times lower price growth for basic foods, as  compared with state-run retail trade, with some food products  sold by farmers at lower prices than what government-owned shops  charged for similar foods.    Prices for manufactured goods charged by state-run shops  grew  by 25 per cent in the Transcarpathian region followed by the  Kirovograd (by 17 per cent), Rovno (by 13 per cent) and  Ivano-Frankovsk (by 10 per cent) regions, over the last ten-day  period.  <H5>  SOME ASPECTS OF UKRAINIAN INDUSTRIES' PERFORMANCE IN 1993 </H5>   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |March 1993        |1st quarter of 199|1st quarter of 199|  |                  |                  |3                 |4                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Aggregate industr-|52,927.9          |158,171.1         |6,233.3           |  |ial output -- exp-|                  |                  |                  |  |ressed in active  |                  |                  |                  |  |wholesale prices  |                  |                  |                  |  |set by enterprise-|                  |                  |                  |  |s, billion Ukrb.  |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Expressed in comp-|39,462.1          |115,469.6         |187,300.6         |  |arative wholesale |                  |                  |                  |  |prices as of Janu-|                  |                  |                  |  |ary 1, 1994, bill-|                  |                  |                  |  |ion Ukrb.         |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industrial output |                  |- 38.4            |- 4.8             |  |decrease rates (i-|                  |                  |                  |  |n comparable pric-|                  |                  |                  |  |es)               |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Percent, x\ versu-|                  |----              |----              |  |s the previous    |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year's respective |- 42.6            |- 43.0            |- 15.0            |  |period            |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Averaged daily in-|2,219.7           |2,125.7           |84.0              |  |dustrial output (-|                  |                  |                  |  |in active wholesa-|                  |                  |                  |  |le prices), billi-|                  |                  |                  |  |on Ukrb.          |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |x\ The numerator shows the reduction rate based on enterprises' reports ab-|  |out their output in comparable prices; the denominator shows estimated pro-|  |duction figures in kind.                                                   |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

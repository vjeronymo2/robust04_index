			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PRIEST OF PORN' IS ARRESTED;  </P> <P> CRIME: SUSPECT WANTED IN LOS ANGELES IS ARRESTED IN SPOKANE, WASH. POLICE SAY  HE LED A RING THAT PRODUCED CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.  </P> <P> A former Roman Catholic priest sought by Los Angeles police on child  pornography charges has been arrested by sheriff's deputies in Spokane, Wash.,  authorities said Wednesday.  </P> <P> John Bauer, 53, who Los Angeles police said led a four-man ring that produced  pornographic videos of boys in Hollywood and Mexico, was arrested late Tuesday  night.  </P> <P> Authorities said Bauer is being held without bail on federal charges that he  fled California to avoid prosecution. He probably will have an extradition  hearing next week.  </P> <P> Spokane County sheriff's deputies stopped Bauer and a friend on an interstate  highway on the outskirts of the city, said Sheriff's Detective Mark Henderson.  A source had informed deputies that Bauer was in town for a day and was  apparently headed to Seattle, Henderson said.  </P> <P> Bauer may have gone to Spokane -- where years ago he ran an adult bookstore --  to borrow money, police said. Bauer's companion, who deputies identified as "a  long-time friend," was not arrested.  </P> <P> Henderson said Bauer told authorities that he had been "bouncing around"  several Western states and Mexico since he fled Los Angeles following a  drug-related arrest in August, 1988.  </P> <P> That month, Los Angeles police served Bauer with a search warrant and  confiscated marijuana plants and more than 100 videotapes from his apartment.  </P> <P> Police then arrested Bauer on marijuana cultivation charges and he was released  on $1,000 bail.  </P> <P> Authorities later reviewed the tapes, which showed Bauer and three other men  committing sex acts on boys, ages 8 to 14, the detective said.  </P> <P> By the time police realized that the videos contained evidence that  incriminated Bauer in a child pornography ring, the former priest had fled Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Bauer is charged with production of child pornography, conspiracy to produce  and distribute child pornography and conspiracy to commit child molestation.  </P> <P> The three other men were charged on the basis of evidence contained in the  tapes.  </P> <P> Two of the three -- David Negrette, 26, of Huntington Beach, and Jerry  Houchens, 49, of Santa Ana -- were arrested in March. Negrette is currently on  trial on child molestation charges in Orange County. The others await trial.  </P> <P> Police are still searching for the fourth member of the alleged pornography  ring, Victor Feliciano, 29.  </P> <P> Bauer -- referred to as the "Priest of Porn" in a 1984 interview published in  Chic magazine -- was an altar boy in the fourth grade and later led a Montana  parish as an ordained priest, police said.  </P> <P> Between 1963 and 1970, Catholic Church officials tried unsuccessfully to have  Bauer removed from the priesthood. After opening a lucrative adult bookstore in  Bozeman, Mont., he was finally dismissed.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, he continued to wear his priestly garments and introduce himself  as Father Bauer, police said. In calling attention to his businesses -- which  eventually spread to Washington and included a sex shop called Miss Kitty -- he  became "quite a media figure," Henderson said.  </P> <P> "He wasn't shy of publicity," the detective added.  </P></p>

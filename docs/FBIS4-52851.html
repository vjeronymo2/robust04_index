			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  and select cabinet ministers will huddle Tuesday [17 May] to  consider ways to promote deregulation, Chief Cabinet Secretary  Hiroshi Kumagai said Monday.    The meeting comes after Hata and six members of his cabinet  agreed last week on the need to come up with powerful steps by  the end of June to ease economically restrictive government  regulations.    Hata's government has vowed to thrash out full-scale  deregulatory measures before this year's summit meeting of the  Group of Seven major industrialized nations as part of efforts  to spur domestic demand and boost imports.    The session is scheduled to convene before a regular cabinet  meeting on Tuesday morning, the top government spokesman told a  news conference.    In addition to key cabinet ministers, the planned  get-together will invite heads of ministries and agencies that  dictate regulations, Kumagai said.    Participants will include Hata, Kumagai, Foreign Minister  Koji Kakizawa, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International  Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, Management and  Coordination Agency chief Koshiro Ishida and Economic Planning  Agency head Yoshio Terasawa.    The others will be heads of ministries of health and  welfare,  farm, transport, posts and telecommunications, construction, and  home affairs, as well as the national land agency chief.    The head of the Fair Trade Commission will also attend,  Kumagai said.</p>

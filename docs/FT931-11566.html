			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Observer: Putting heads together One of the more fascinating sub-plots in the hunt for the next boss of IBM is that it has thrown together the world's two top headhunters - Tom Neff and Gerry Roche. If it were any other company than IBM, it would be hard to imagine two of the world's most competitive headhunters being asked to bury their differences and share their contact books. It is highly unusual for a firm to advertise its use of headhunters and even more unusual to hire two. However, IBM has announced that it has retained Heidrick &amp; Struggles and Spencer Stuart, two of the top four US-based headhunters. The advantage of having two firms is that it proves to investors that everything is being done to find the right man. It also overcomes the problem of headhunters who are barred from poaching executives of firms they have recently worked for because of self-imposed off-limits rules. Even headhunters have ethics, it seems. If IBM is going to find a wunderkind, then these two should be able to do it. The downside is that they are fiercely competitive. Heidrick &amp; Struggles' Roche is the acknowledged king of the headhunters. He was the man who found Apple's John Sculley, for example. However, Spencer Stuart's Neff is said to be coming up fast and has his eye on Roche's crown. Jim Kennedy, editor of Executive Recruiter News, describes him as 'the young bull challenger to the old smoothie Roche'.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Miners concede Frickley closure Miners at Frickley colliery, near Pontefract, West Yorkshire - one of the pits 'reprieved' by the government earlier this year - yesterday voted to accept its closure. Production at the pit, where 740 people work, will end today. Miners voted by 301 to 27 not to fight the closure. Production will also cease today at Rufford colliery, near Mansfield, Notts, which employs 300. Miners at Hatfield, near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, will meet at the weekend to vote on whether to accept the colliery's closure.</p>

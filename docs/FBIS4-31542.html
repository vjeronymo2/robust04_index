Will you please  say whether you would vote for each of the following possible  coalitions?"    Coalition                        Yes            No            Do Not Know   Democratic Union                 23             65            12  [DU]-Christian Democratic  Movement [KDH]-Democratic  Party [DS]-National Democratic  Party-[NDS]-Party of  Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen  [SZP]   Movement for a Democratic        32             58            10  Slovakia [HZDS]-Slovak  National Party [SNS]-Farmers  Party   KDH-SZP                          19             69            12   Party of Democratic Left         34             53            13  [SDL]-Social Democratic Party  in Slovakia [SDSS]-Green Party  in Slovakia [SZ]-Farmers  Movement   DS-KDH                           17             71            11   Coexistence-Hungarian            11             80            8  Christian Democratic  Movement-Hungarian Civic Party    DU-DS                            24             62            14   SDL-SDSS-Association of          35             53            12  Workers of Slovakia   SZP-DS                           20             66            14      The results of the survey reveal that Slovak citizens are  ready, to a large degree, to accept possible or already existing  preelection coalitions of political parties and movements. The  voters base of each of the possible coalitions monitored is much  wider than the simple sum of the votes that, according to the  same survey, would be won by individual parties and movements  making up the coalition.</p>

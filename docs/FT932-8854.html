			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Management: Rubbing out the dividing line - The differences between blue- and white-collar employees are disappearing The recent management buyout of Leyland Daf's truck plant in Lancashire has been accompanied by sweeping changes in its labour practices. In return, however, shopfloor inequalities are ending with the introduction of a common car park and replacement of the weekly wage with annualised salaries for all. At Imperial Chemical Industries harmonising manual and staff benefits has proved crucial in securing workforce acceptance of radical productivity agreements. While recent deals at Power Gen, National Grid and National Power, as well as at the regionally based water companies, have included new integrated pay structures, a commitment to performance-related pay and standardised terms and conditions of employment. Eradicating the differences in treatment between blue- and white-collar employees has become an essential ingredient in the current wave of company restructuring. The trend towards harmonisation has not yet become an irresistible workplace revolution - but no comprehensive shake-up in any large- or medium-sized industrial enterprise now seems complete without such changes being contemplated. Non-manual work in Britain has traditionally meant not just higher social status than that enjoyed by manual jobs. It has also implied better job security, longer holidays and a shorter working week, more generous pension and sick-pay provision, incremental pay scales and greater chances of promotion. Archaic class attitudes of 'them' and 'us' have served to accentuate such distinctions and made them more durable than in other countries. Commercial pressure, changing technologies and trade union influence are all behind the harmonisation trend. 'This development is not happening because employers have suddenly decided it is morally wrong to treat their manual workers as inferior to their staff,' explains Helen Murlis at Hay Management, the consultancy group. 'It is cost driven as companies become more competitive and need the co-operation of employees in the often drastic changes at work which they need to make to survive.' Argues Robert Price at the Economic and Social Research Council: 'Market pressures are calling into question the logic of the traditional status divisions within the enterprise based on 19th century conditions and outdated assumptions about the nature of work.' But other factors are at play. Harmonisation is also being encouraged by microprocessor-based technological innovation in manufacturing. This has heightened the demand for more flexible multi-skilling team-work and the removal of old demarcation lines and restrictive labour practices. While recent moves stem mainly from managerial initiatives among companies under global competitive pressure, trade unions have been pressing hard as well. The Transport and General Workers Union, for example, launched a campaign at Shell demanding 'equality of opportunity for all' with what it called the 'removal of out-dated divisions between blue- and white-collar workers'. Fred Higgs, the TGWU's chemical industry officer, says this was 'a pre-emptive move' to persuade the company not to individualise employment contracts and scrap collective bargaining. It showed the union was ready to embrace and not resist greater job flexibility. The AEEU engineering union is enthusiastic about the greenfield single union deals it has signed since 1988. Its electrical section - once the EETPU - has also pressed hard for an end to workplace status divisions in its recruitment offensive in the electronics sector. The current batch of company restructuring agreements, however, presents a mixed picture. In some areas there has been substantial progress, but in others there has been much less and in some cases gaps in status may have widened. Price warns that harmonising may not make much advance outside large- and medium-sized companies in manufacturing. The commitment in management time can be expensive and may take years to show any return in performance. Smaller companies often lack the financial resources or the will to introduce harmonisation. Moreover, the deregulation of the labour market with the growth in contracting out of services is a countervailing trend. New forms of workplace inequalities threaten to emerge between workers in the core and those working on the margins. The following is a summary of recent trends: Pay. Many recent agreements have introduced integrated wage systems that unify all employees around a common pay spine from management to office cleaners. Individualised arrangements. Payment by results, bonuses and merit money are rare across the company spectrum. The government's latest commissioned workplace relations survey, for example, found that 31 per cent of secretarial and clerical staff and 46 per cent of middle and senior management were receiving merit pay. But only 10 per cent of unskilled manuals and 22 per cent of skilled manuals were offered such remuneration. But 47 per cent of skilled manuals received some form of incentive pay (mainly payment by results) against only 38 per cent of clerical and secretarial staff and 28 per cent of unskilled manuals. Method of payment. Unpublished data from the government survey reveals a significant decline in the number of workers paid in cash each week. In 1980 only 6 per cent of blue-collars were paid monthly and a mere 21 per cent by either a cheque, giro or bank transfer. Ten years later 23 per cent of manual workers were paid monthly and 72 per cent did not receive their wages in cash. Hours of work. More companies are increasing flexibility for manuals and replacing the standard five-day, 37- or 40-hour week, plus overtime with a variety of seven- or six-day shift systems and annualised hours. But manual workers still work longer hours than staff. As many as 59 per cent of white-collars work less than 37 hours a week, against 20 per cent of manuals. By contrast the latest Hay survey of employee benefits shows that 44 per cent of manual workers work more than 38 hours a week, against only 3 per cent of non-manuals. Timekeeping. Traditionally manual workers have had to clock on and off at the workplace. In some recent pay deals time measurement has been dropped or modified. The government's workplace survey found that 80 per cent of private manufacturing establishments insisted their manuals signed on and off at work, the same figure in 1990 as in 1980. Over the period the number of white-collar staff required to do so rose from 8 per cent to 13 per cent. Holidays. The latest CBI survey in 1992 found little variation between workers in their entitlement. In companies employing between 5,000 and 20,000 workers, 41 per cent of manual dayworkers received 25 days and under, compared with 45 per cent of white-collar staff. Health care. The Hay survey shows 41 per cent of manual workers in health discount schemes and 22 per cent of manuals in deals where the company pays part or all of the cost of health care. This contrasts with 33 per cent of white-collars who are covered in discount plans and 47 per cent where the company pays all or part of the cost. Pensions. Occupational pension schemes are increasing. But the latest General Household Survey reveals continuing disparities. While 26 per cent of employers and managers have an occupational and personal pension, the same applies to only 3 per cent of unskilled manuals, 19 per cent of skilled manuals and 10 per cent of clerical staff. The Hay survey shows only 9 per cent of manuals are covered by a non-contributory pension scheme, against 15 per cent of staff. Sundry items. Single-status canteens and car parks are more common. Profit-sharing and share-ownership schemes have also moved outside the ranks of management.</p>

			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Ashdown reshuffle creates 'leadership team' Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday reshuffled his Westminster team in a bid to raise the party's morale after its poor performance in the European elections, James Blitz writes. In a reshuffle that was marred by moments of confusion, Mr Malcolm Bruce, the MP for the Scottish constituency of Gordon, took the key job of economic spokesman from Mr Alan Beith. Mr Menzies Campbell, the party's defence spokesman, is to combine his present role with the brief on foreign affairs that was held by Sir David Steel. The creation of the new line-up, which should be unaltered up to the next election, was accompanied by a new leadership team, the 'leader's committee,' which will contain the party's main spokesmen. This body will try to meet Mr Ashdown's concern that his party is sometimes seen as a 'one-man band'. However there were signs yesterday that the re-organisation of the party leadership had not gone as smoothly as could have been hoped. Party workers were unsure whether any member of the leader's committee would have responsibility for education policy. One senior party figure was uncertain whether he was in the leadership team or not. There was immediate criticism, too, that Mr Ashdown had failed to include any of the party's three women MPs in the top leadership team. Mr Bruce, a member of the Commons trade and industry committee, was described by Liberal Democrat workers last night as having a similar ideological outlook to Mr Ashdown. The MP, who has set up his own industry think-tank in the city, believes in a deregulated labour market and is opposed to the statutory minimum wage. Mr Campbell, a QC and former Olympic runner, is regarded as one of the party's strongest Commons performers. But Mr Charles Kennedy, the party's departing president, will take sole charge of European affairs. He is widely seen as a future Liberal Democrat leader and his retention in the post underlines Mr Ashdown's belief that the debate on Britain's role in the EU will dominate the next election. Mr Beith, who has been the party's Treasury spokesman for seven years, was thought to be disappointed to be moving from the post. He will now take over the home affairs brief and remain deputy leader of the party.</p>

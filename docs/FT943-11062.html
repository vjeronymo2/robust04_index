			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Aircraft outlook remains stable Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer controlled by the Dasa unit of Daimler-Benz, yesterday said it expected 3,500 aircraft with 40 to 125 seats to be sold by the industry in the next 20 years, Reuter reports from Amsterdam. Its market outlook for the period 1993-2013 - little changed from a year ago  -sees demand for 1,300 aircraft with 40 to 69 seats and 2,200 aircraft with seating capacity of 70 to 125. The US and Europe will be the main markets where 36 and 30 per cent of the new aircraft will be sold respectively. Half of the demand for the smaller aircraft results from growth in air traffic, the other half from replacement needs. Of the new 70-125 seaters, 25 per cent will be sold to meet growth. Demand for 70-125 seaters such as the Fokker 70 and the Fokker 100 fanjets will peak at around 140 in 1997. After the year 2000 the market will stabilise at an annual 100 aircraft.</p>

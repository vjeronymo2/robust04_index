			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Man of the people throws down the gauntlet: President Boris Yeltsin may be risking all in calling for a referendum on Russia's future Mr Boris Yeltsin is in battledress once more: his enemies are clear and his standard raised. Once more, he stood yesterday morning before the hostile Congress of Russian People's Deputies - as he had before the Communist party central committee and the Soviet parliament on his road to power - and, in his stentorian voice, laid down the lines of his defiance. In such situations in the past, he has gambled and won. Now, however, he is putting not just his career on the table, but his country as well. His call yesterday for a referendum to decide whether the president or Congress should rule Russia appears to destroy at a stroke the weeks of negotiations and concessions to the central ground. Where he had been careful to present himself as a president of all the people, and had seemed to lean heavily towards the centrist Civic Union in a search for a broader base, he has now abruptly broken with the politics of interest group manoeuvre in favour of a direct appeal to the people. Why did he change course? According to deputies close to Mr Yeltsin, his advisers since the last Congress met in April have presented him with the option of going over the heads of the obstructive Congress and its permanent body, the Supreme Soviet. Until now, he has said that he did not want to provoke a battle with the deputies. When Mr Yeltsin met a group of supportive deputies on Saturday morning, before the vote on a series of constitutional amendments which would have sharply reduced his authority, he indicated that he was ready for such an appeal if the package passed. In the event, the most damaging amendments were narrowly defeated. But the vote on Wednesday which blocked Mr Yeltsin's attempt to confirm his acting prime minister, Mr Yegor Gaidar, as the permanent premier seemed to have provided a substitute trigger. Mr Yeltsin and the Congress reached their impasse for two reasons. First, the Congress, which had opened last week, voted for a motion which roundly condemned his economic reform programme as 'against the people's interests' and demanded changes to economic policy far more sweeping than those Mr Yeltsin and his government were prepared to contemplate. These included a demand for a release of more credit to industry and an immediate end to Russia's fall in production. Such demands were of particular concern because of the constraints which Mr Yeltsin's reform programme is already facing. He has been forced by the power of the industrial lobbies and the fear of mass unemployment to extend financial support to the ailing state enterprises. This, and his disagreements with the central bank, have added to strong inflationary pressures. The second - and the more pressing - reason for the current impasse is the constitutional mess in which the country has wallowed since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Unusually among post-communist states, Russia has neither a new constitution nor a newly elected assembly. Its constitution is a patched-up version of Soviet law, and the 'parliament' preserves the two-level Congress and Supreme Soviet. In both, deputies were elected by popular vote in 1990. Most of the candidates were selected by the Communist party and its various front organisations. In this uncertain situation the powers and responsibilities of the president, legislature, government and judicial authorities are unclear. Indeed, much of the business of the current legislative session has been an attempt by the Congress to gain control of the government. Mr Yeltsin has now chosen to break this impasse. By doing so he has plunged Russian society into a conflict which his opponents were saying yesterday would be bloody and which will certainly lead to further political polarisation. General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, made clear in a tense speech to the Congress yesterday that he had broken with the president, and in doing so was implicitly putting himself at the head of the opposition to him. Together with his colleagues in the Civic Union, he appealed for a compromise to which a president who has shown himself to be most uncompromising may refuse to agree. Having made his choice, Mr Yeltsin is faced with several urgent questions. First, how solid is his base? His radical support is smaller than it was when it stood for the cause of Russia against the crumbling Soviet Union. His personal stock has fallen with the people as the economic crisis has deepened. His government, well supported abroad, has shallow roots at home and has only recently sought to build relationships in industry. Where before there was no obvious alternative, now at least Gen Rutskoi is a potential challenger. This does not mean that Mr Yeltsin is doomed to fail or to agree to a humiliating climbdown, but the path he has chosen promises to be the most difficult. Second, how strong is his opposition? In the Congress, it is overwhelming. All of his opponents among the deputies cannot be dismissed as reactionaries or unbowed communists. Some are against him because their constituents are suffering from the effects of reform - and they are beginning to feel answerable to them. In the security apparatus and the army, there is a strong tug of loyalties. Mr Victor Barannikov, the security minister, yesterday gave a speech which included alarmist passages about the external threat from foreign security services and the interior threat of organised crime. In the context, it sounded like a warning from the Soviet past. However, the opposition is also deeply divided. The centre ground, on which Gen Rutskoi and his fellow leaders in the Civic Union are seeking to stand, claims to be interested in reform and stability. The hardliners, clustered around the National Salvation Front, with its patriotic and communist sympathies, appear interested in neither. The two groupings have had talks but failed to reach any agreements. However, figures such as Mr Nikolai Travkin, leader of the Democratic party, could act as compromise leaders. Finally, can reform be continued? Mr Gaidar, who Mr Yeltsin said would remain in office, was typically businesslike yesterday, saying that talks would continue with the international financial institutions, and that the privatisation and other reform programmes would proceed as planned. Yet he knows better than any other how flickering reform's flame is, and what a gust it is now having to withstand as, once again, Russia is plunged into crisis. Mr Yeltsin has, therefore, significantly raised the stakes in the contest for political power. But he has not wholly cut himself off from retreat. Last night, Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a close aide and a deputy prime minister, was negotiating with Mr Yuri Yarov, a deputy speaker of the parliament, on the possible grounds for compromise. In the confrontational world of Russian politics, it is possible that Mr Yeltsin acted as he did in order to frighten the Congress into acquiescence. But he has vastly strained the fragile system by doing so. Resolution by compromise would now seem to demand the humiliation of either Congress or the president. If neither backs down, the stage is set for a winter of political struggle which puts economic reform, political resolution and the fate of the country itself at hazard, once more.</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT;  </P> <P> NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> Bye-Bye Birdies -- Theories abounded among local birders earlier this season to  explain the exceptionally low numbers of migrating birds passing through the  county. Had the escalating destruction of wintering grounds in the tropics  taken a sudden and devastating toll?  </P> <P> But a late rush of migrating land birds started early this month and reached a  big peak a couple of weeks ago. On one day in Huntington Central Park, for  instance, the avian display included a count of 125 yellow warblers and 100 to  150 Swainson's thrushes. "It was really impressive," said Doug Willick, who  keeps track of rare local sightings for American Bird magazine. "That was  encouraging after a very disappointing April."  </P> <P> Along with the usual Pacific Flyway travelers have come a number of vagrants  that strayed from other migratory paths. A number of rare fall vagrants that  are very rare as spring vagrants in the county have been spotted in recent  weeks. Some highlights:  </P> <P> Tennessee warbler (three different individuals), May 17, 20 and 24.  </P> <P> * Indigo bunting (two individuals), May 4 to 6 and 18.  </P> <P> * Northern waterthrush, May 3.  </P> <P> * Black and white warbler, May 29.  </P> <P> * Gray flycatcher, April 15.  </P> <P> * Summer tanager, May 20.  </P> <P> * Franklin's gull, May 14.  </P> <P> On May 20, a spotted redshank was seen just south of Orange County on Camp  Pendleton. The Asiatic shore bird, a rare vagrant in the United States outside  of the Aleutian Islands, has never been seen before in Orange County.  </P> <P> Making several appearances in recent weeks on the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh  Reserve in Irvine has been an American bittern, a member of the heron family.  "They didn't use to be rare, but numbers in Southern California have really  dwindled," Willick said. At one time, the birds bred in Orange County.  </P> <P> While the passage of spring migrants through the county is now waning, the  number of rare and unusual vagrants should pick up for the next several weeks.  These birds are probably straggling, Willick said, because they are lost far  from their usual migratory paths. The vagrants provide an added challenge to  avid birders and can make for additions to life lists (a birder's list of birds  seen).  </P> <P> Quail Hill Update -- The city of Irvine has already announced plans to preserve  Quail Hill, the spot where thousands of migrating Canada geese spend the winter  each year. Now it's time to decide what will happen to the land behind Quail  Hill.  </P> <P> On both the city and county plans it is part of William R. Mason Regional Park.  It has not been developed, however, and is now open space and strawberry  fields. The land is leased from the Irvine Co., and if the county wants to keep  that arrangement it has to show improvements on the property by 1991.  </P> <P> The county pitched a plan to build a golf course and hotel on the property but  met a less-than-enthusiastic response from the City Council. Some Irvine  officials, meanwhile, would like to restore the area to something approaching a  natural state, with native plants and trees and winding trails.  </P> <P> Plans to that effect are being drawn up by a city administrative aide.  </P> <P> New Checklist -- UC Irvine's Museum of Systematic Biology has published a new  "Checklist of the Vascular Plants of Orange County, California," the first time  the list has been updated since 1968. Fred Roberts of the museum compiled the  work, which will serve as the framework for the first-ever complete flora for  the county, due to be published sometime after 1990.  </P> <P> The checklist includes all native, introduced, naturalized or escaped species  of vascular plants that have become established or persist as part of the  county's flora. As presently known, the flora of Orange County includes 1,157  species of vascular plants with an additional 99 subspecies or variations, for  a total of 1,256 taxa. Of the total, 806 are native to the county.  </P> <P> Copies of the checklist are available at several locations, including the  Museum of Natural History and Science in Newport Beach.  </P></p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Survey of Aluminium (6): Alloy] alloy] - LME launches scrap metal contract ONLY 12 MONTHS ago the chances of a contract in aluminium alloy getting off the ground were put at just 50-50 by some members of the London Metal Exchange. The subject was a hot potato, arousing passionate debate between the industry and the exchange for more than two years. The contract, for trading in alloy made from recycled scrap, has now been running for three weeks , and it looks as though the LME's cautious approach and painstaking ground work will pay off. The exchange has a lot riding on the new contract. Leaving aside the high grade aluminium contract (which replaced the initial aluminium contract) and the relaunched tin contract, the aluminium alloy contract is its first new product for 13 years. The arguments against the contract are familiar. 'It will open the market up to speculators and gamblers, which is not in our best interests,' said one US alloy producer. The Organisation of European Aluminium Smelters and the Japan Aluminium Alloy Refiners Association said were flatly against the contract. But events have shown that they cannot afford to ignore it. Traders were already making money from the contract before the market officially opened on October 6. 'Interest is very high,' said Mr Hans Murmann, jointmanaging director of Metallgesellschaft's London subsidiary. We have traded many thousands of tonnes.' He pointed out that the LME's timing - all important in the launch of a new contract - looked good. 'Secondary aluminium smelters are losing money because of the poor state of the economy and they are pleased to let the LME have metal for ready cash.' Mr Ralph Kestenbaum, chairman of the LME's aluminium alloy committee, said that on the unofficial market in August and September alloy had been traded at a Dollars 10 a tonne premium to the primary aluminium contract, and also at a Dollars 65 discount. This showed that the primary contract was not a satisfactory proxy for alloy and the new contract was needed. The first fortnight of trading has been slow, but this is hardly surprising given the depressed state of the base metals markets. Mr John Wolff, LME chairman, said: 'It will take time to bed down. But it is a very large market and growing.' Secondary aluminium production is about 4.5m tonnes a year, mainly of automotive grade alloy. The motor industry uses more than 70 per cent of production. By the time of the contract launch 47 alloy brands had been registered by producers, between them accounting for about 2m tonnes a year output. The contract specifies three grades for delivery - German DIN 226, Japanese AD12.1, and US A380-1. These represent the basic - or in the words of one trader 'bog standard' - die-casting specifications in Japan, Europe and the US, the three main consuming regions. Although the three chosen grades vary slightly they are designed for the same function - automotive die-casting - and consequently in practice there is little difference in their prices. The contract is in US dollars, covers lots of 20 tonnes and can be traded 15 months forward. Hitherto, pricing in the industry has been archaic, according to Mr Martin Abbott, the LME's director of marketing, and some people felt it was hindering the development of the industry. Prices were assessed and published by the trade and the trade press - a system unsuitable for a large volume business with many aparticipants. The industry tended to ignore the published price and offer discounts. There was no hedging for forward fixed price contracts, said Mr Abbott. Hedging against the exchange's primary aluminium contract was ineffective, as the secondary market was driven by different factors and price movements could diverge. Smelters have had to pay for their scrap metal purchases by the end of a calendar month. They have been selling their aluminium alloy to consumers who should pay within 60 days. But in present economic conditions consumers often keep suppliers waiting 90 days. Now smelters - always seen as the key to the success of the new contract - can hedge against movement in both aluminium scrap and aluminium alloy, locking in firm futures prices for both. The LME regards itself as a risk management forum, with delivery of metal to one of its warehouses as a system of last resort. Storage of aluminium alloy has been one of the most contentious issues surrounding the new contract. Some suggest that the alloy - which contains some copper or zinc - oxidises in a few days. So far the LME has authorised 12 warehouses for aluminium alloy, spread between France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK and the US. All have the necessary temperature and humidity control equipment so that the onset of oxidation can be minimised. What effect the contract has on the industry remains to be seen. Some traders suggest that the impact will be profound as it threatens the price cartels alleged to exist in Japan and Germany. The Japanese, however, point out that none of their production reaches the free market as it is all sold under contract on a long-term basis. If the contract takes off, the industry will certainly never be the same again.</p>

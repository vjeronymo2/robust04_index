			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Dark deals at the borders Sir, Regarding the article 'Drugs claim on Gibraltar border' (December 3-4), while the Spanish government's apparent concern about illicit smuggling into Spain is admirable, its own efforts to control a substantial black economy and, in particular, illegal money laundering activities via the Franco-Spanish frontiers is shameful. What is remarkable is the extent to which this activity has fuelled a mini-property boom in neighbouring Biarritz in the midst of a deep economic recession. Richard Isola, General Arrando 28, 28010 Madrid</p>

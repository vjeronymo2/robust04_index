			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Germany to probe leaks of data affecting markets The German economics ministry is probing leaks of market-sensitive data, following a complaint from a foreign bank that German rivals had prior knowledge of industrial orders figures published yesterday. Federal bond prices slipped as accurate reports of the stronger-than-expected data circulated before the official publication time. It also emerged yesterday that leaks of monthly orders and industrial production figures, both the responsibility of the economics ministry, had been occurring for some months. 'This is now a normal thing with economics ministry figures,' said Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, an economist at UBS in Frankfurt. 'Our futures traders regularly come in to us with 'rumours' that turn out to be exactly right. The only fair way is for us all to be told at the same time,' he said. 'It happens rather a lot,' said Mr Stephen King, an economist with James Capel in London. 'Whether it's serious or not depends on who is doing it and if anyone is making any money out of it. 'But things are a complete mess. Look at the quality of the data,' he added, referring to industrial output figures, issued on Wednesday, which carried a warning that a preliminary 0.2 per cent decline in output was likely to be revised upwards by at least two full percentage points. Analysts said the economics ministry should start the leaks probe in its own offices, since other key indicators such as money supply and inflation figures issued by the Bundesbank or the federal statistics office were never leaked. Raw numbers generated by the statistics office were first passed to the central bank for seasonal adjustment and then transmitted to the ministry for publication. Yesterday's information was reportedly released 45 minutes early by a German news agency, since rebuked by the economics ministry, but the source of industrial production figures, circulated prematurely on Wednesday, was not known. Selected news agencies are routinely provided with advance copies of important statistics under strict embargo conditions.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Mutual hostility in Gaza pullout The Middle East has a long way to go before it can expect peaceful co-existence between Arab and Jew. Israeli soldiers, trying to complete their military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip yesterday, spent the last minutes of occupation battling angry stone-throwing youths. Even as the last military convoy of jeeps sped out of Gaza City youths lobbed bottles and stones at the Israelis and taunted them with insults. The farewell clashes were an important reminder of the violence and hostility which still characterises Arab-Israeli relations. Palestinian and Israeli leaders may have signed an interim peace accord but decades of hatred and suspicion on both sides will take years to overcome. Although the 14-day transfer of power in Gaza and Jericho has gone smoothly potential violent flash points are everywhere, particularly in the rest of the West Bank which will not come under Palestinian control until elections are held. There has been tit-for-tat violence in Hebron and in Jericho armed Jewish religious students threaten conflict with the new Palestinian security forces by refusing to surrender their weapons or enter the synagogue unarmed. The potential for continuing violence remains high because of the very limited way in which the interim peace agreement meets Palestinian aspirations. The bulk of Palestinian demands - removal of Jewish settlements on Arab lands, the right to establish a state, the right of return of all refugees and, at the least, shared control of Jerusalem - have all been shelved to a later date. So long as the 125,000 Jewish settlers, protected by Israeli soldiers, remain untouched in Gaza and the West Bank extremist groups preaching and practicing violence will continue to flourish. 'The settlements are a time-bomb in the peace process,' said Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian leader. 'Expecting Palestinians to live next to settlers who are illegally occupying their land is like putting a flame next to dynamite.' Religious and secular Palestinian factions opposed to the peace process have vowed to continue their struggle against Israel until, as a minimum, the Jewish state withdraws behind the 'Green Line' - the disputed border before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Hamas, a disciplined and well organised underground movement responsible for the most devastating recent attacks, wants to go further and wage a religious war against the Jews until all of the land of Palestine is liberated under Islamic rule. 'Violence will continue so long as occupation and stealing of Palestinian land remains,' said Dr Omar Farwana, a Gaza City Hamas sympathiser. 'Resistance and struggle will go on until the last day of the liberation of Palestine. Anybody saying something else is lying. All Palestinians feel the coming days will see more intense and violent struggle against the settlers and the soldiers because we think the main reason why Israeli soldiers left Gaza was our resistance.' The ability of Palestinian extremists to continue violent attacks against Israel will depend on how the incoming Palestinian security forces deal with the extremists. The PLO have said they intend to disarm the factions and confiscate up to 20,000 weapons in Gaza alone. Yesterday the ten factions opposed to the peace accord warned such a move might provoke an internal Palestinian civil war. 'If the Palestinian police try to disarm our people they will be subjecting themselves to grave dangers,' said Mr Abu Mohammed Mustafa, a Hamas spokesman in Damascus. 'Our men. . . will kill anyone who tries to deprive us of the right to confront the enemy.' Israel hopes that trust may grow between Arab and Jew during an interim period of Palestinian self-rule. But Palestinians say until Arab grievances such as settlements and Jerusalem are resolved the Middle East will remain a region of violence.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- Today's Czech dailies  report on the arrival of U.S. President Bill Clinton in Prague,  on NATO's acceptance of the American Partnership for Peace  initiative and on tomorrow's meetings between Clinton and the  heads of the Visegrad Group states (Czech Republic, Slovakia,  Hungary, and Poland).    The independent daily MLADA FRONTA DNES carries a commentary  on the NATO summit, which ended in Brussels today, writing that  it "changed the security situation of the Czech Republic more  than many citizens and politicians will admit."    The Prague government has already accepted the conditions of  military cooperation contained in the Partnership for Peace  initiative, the paper writes. "Now Czech military and security  experts must prove what they can do and how they can contribute  to the community of interests of at least 38 countries of Europe  and North America." Over the next five years, the paper writes,  the Czech Republic must learn to live and cooperate with NATO  and its other partners.    The paper also points out the obligations the Czech Republic  will take on in joining the Partnership for Peace. "Not only  joint maneuvers, exercises, and financing of the future  participation of the partners in international joint units for  special missions will be planned, but before long also their  engagement. And this already concerns the lives of our soldiers  in fulfilling peace missions in crisis areas of Eastern Europe  under the auspices of the U.N. or the European Union," the paper  writes.    CESKY DENIK also comments on the Partnership for Peace,  which  should bring the countries of the Visegrad Group closer to NATO.  "The American Partnership for Peace plan came at the very moment  it became clear that the European allies of the United States  were not capable of taking any coordinated steps in Eastern  Europe," the paper writes. The Partnership for Peace is the  most that the Central European countries can obtain from today's  political situation, and is a fundamental breakthrough in the  surviving hegemony of Russian generals over the Central European  regions, writes CESKY DENIK.    The independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY turns its attention to  the same topic, writing: "NATO is extending a helping hand --  but only in such a way that the outreached hand will not be  grasped too tightly. As with the Balkans, it does not want to  allow the possibility that it could be drawn into such a  conflict." The paper notes that even the Czech Republic is  acting with circumspection and that "it may be expected that the  two careful betrothed ones will wait quite a while for the  fruits of their love."

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / PM plans further export-drive trips to boost jobs MR JOHN MAJOR is planning further overseas trips with UK businessmen as part of efforts to boost exports in an attempt to tackle unemployment at home. His initiative follows a trip to India, begun at the weekend, which shows signs of winning business for British industry. Mr Major is understood to consider such visits, where a delegation of senior executives travels with the prime minister, as useful in attracting orders. Privately, Mr Major has talked of a 'new language' between industry and government. Senior businessmen have been asked to travel with Mr Major to Japan later this year, the second such foreign trip he will have undertaken since becoming prime minister. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said the programme of economic reform adopted by India offered great potential for British business. Stressing the significance of Mr Major's presence, he described a meeting between Britain's delegation and eight of India's most senior civil servants as 'unprecedented'. 'That would not have happened - or nothing like it - were it not for the fact that the prime minister was here.' Mr Major dismissed as 'misguided' criticism that he should have stayed in the UK to concentrate on domestic problems. 'Exports abroad mean jobs at home,' he said. The prime minister will today oversee the signing of a double taxation treaty between with India, preventing profits of companies trading in both countries from being taxed twice. He has also told businessmen accompanying him that government-supported export credit insurance to India will be reviewed, possibly by the start of the next financial year. The 17-strong team of UK businessmen met Indian counterparts and government officials yesterday as it emerged that British companies were close to completing contracts worth more than Pounds 100m for power station projects. Separately, Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery, food and soft drinks group, is to increase its investment in India by about Pounds 6m, reversing past divestment precipitated by India's now-abandoned regulations on foreign ownership. Other projects are expected to be announced by British Gas. But little, if any, headway, appeared to have been made in assuaging UK companies' fears over exchange convertibility and India's labour laws. British businessmen have also floated the idea of establishing a new Anglo-Indian partnership to help regain some of the ground lost in recent years to US and Japanese competitors.

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Technology: 'A computer in every pocket' 'CALL BILL', you scrawl on the screen. Your personal digital assistant displays the telephone numbers of all the people you know called Bill. Choose one, by pointing with a pen, and the machine dials the number. Bill agrees to meet you for lunch next Thursday at noon. 'Lunch with Bill, Los Angeles, Thursday, noon,' you write. Up pops your diary opened to the appropriate date with a tentative entry saying 'noon, lunch with Bill'. 'Is that correct?' the machine asks. 'OK,' you respond. 'Fax Geoff' is your next command. 'Join me for lunch with Bill on Thursday,' you write. Point to Geoff's fax number and the message is sent. But where to eat? Pull out your electronic restaurant guide and look for a quiet, moderately-priced French restaurant within five miles of your office . . . This is real life in the mid-1990s, according to the computer companies whose ambitions have grown beyond the desktop to put a 'computer in every pocket'.</p>

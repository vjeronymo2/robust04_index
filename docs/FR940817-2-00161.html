Joy, Pennsylvania; Proposed Exemption <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Application No. D&hyph;9698]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 406(b) (1) and (2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the sale of a certain parcel of real property (the Property) from the Plan to New Standard Corporation (the Employer), a party in interest with respect to the Plan, provided that the following conditions are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The fair market value of the Property is established by a real estate appraiser independent of the Plan and the Employer;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Employer pays the greater of $115,000 or the current fair market value of the Property (excluding site improvements) with the enhancement value for an adjoining owner as of the date of sale;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The sale is a one-time transaction for cash;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Plan pays no fees or commissions in regard to the sale; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Employer pays any applicable excise taxes to the Internal Revenue Service under section 4975(a) of the Code resulting from its use of the Property since October 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Facts and Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Employer is a metal stampings manufacturing concern with offices in Mt. Joy and Hellam Township, Pennsylvania. The Plan is a defined benefit plan which had approximately 66 participants and total assets of approximately $1,083,139 as of the time of filing of the exemption application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Plan purchased the Property in April 1978 from unrelated parties for a purchase price of $22,689 in cash. The Property is a vacant lot of about 2.51 acres located in Hellam Township adjacent to property of the Employer. The adjacent property includes a one-story manufacturing and warehouse complex utilized by the Employer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost to the Plan of acquiring and holding the Property since the time of purchase has been only the original purchase price. All taxes and other costs related to the holding of the Property by the Plan have been paid by the Employer. A small portion of the lot was recently paved at the expense of the Employer to provide an additional parking opportunity to the Employer, and certain other improvements to the Property (including storm sewer installation and driveway access) have been financed by the Employer. The Employer has expended a total of $72,260, including taxes, on the Property since the time it was acquired by the Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The applicant obtained an appraisal on the Property dated April 14, 1994, from B. Daniel Wagner, MAI (Wagner) of Associated Appraisers in York, Pennsylvania. The applicant represents that Wagner is independent of the Plan and the Employer. Wagner states that he is aware that the Employer is the owner of contiguous property and is the prospective buyer of the Property. In Wagner's opinion, the fair market value of the Property (excluding site improvements which were constructed at the expense of the Employer) to an adjoining owner and including the enhancement value for such adjoining owner was $115,000 as of the date of the appraisal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Plan now proposes to sell the Property to the Employer. The Employer will pay the greater of the current fair market value of the Property (excluding site improvements) for an adjoining owner, based on an updated independent appraisal, or the total amount the Plan has expended on the Property as of the date of sale. The sale of the Property will be entirely for cash, and the Plan will pay no fees or commissions in regard to the transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant represents that portion of the Property which was paved for parking has been utilized by employees of the Employer. This parking area contains 48 spaces and was completed in October 1993. A supplement to the above described appraisal, prepared by Wagner on June 20, 1994, estimates the total fair market rental for such usage to be approximately $350 per month. The Employer will compensate the Plan in that amount for the period of time the Employer has utilized the parking area from October 1993 to the date of sale of the Property. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 27  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The applicant recognizes that the use of a portion of the Property for parking purposes of the Employer may have constituted prohibited transactions under section 406 of the Act and section 4975 of the Code. Accordingly, the Employer will pay the Internal Revenue Service any excise taxes that are applicable under section 4975(a) of the Code within 90 days of the publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  of the grant of this proposed exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (1) The fair market value of the Property will be established by a real estate appraiser independent of the Plan and the Employer; (2) the Employer will pay the greater of the current fair market value of the Property (excluding site improvements) for an adjoining owner or the total amount the Plan has expended on the Property; (3) the Plan will pay no fees or commissions in connection with the sale; and (4) the sale of the Property will be an all cash transaction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Paul Kelty of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department, telephone (202) 219&hyph;8883.

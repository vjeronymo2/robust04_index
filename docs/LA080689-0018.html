			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THIS IS LONDON BY EDWARD R. MURROW (SCHOCKEN: $8.95)  </P> <P> Edward R. Murrow's dispatches from London at the beginning of World War II  remain models of concision, 50 years after he delivered them over CBS radio. He  summarizes the "hard news" of diplomatic crises and parliamentary debates  clearly, but is at his best reporting the human side of the struggle. He talks  to people in air-raid shelters during the Blitz, watches firemen battle  incendiary bombs, praises the unassuming courage of "Cherry Brandy," the Dutch  prime minister-in-exile and captures the mood of the city in a few pithy  sentences. Unlike the inane "sound bites" of contemporary network news, the  ideas in these incisive reports are distilled, rather than diluted.  </P> <P> Also available in the "Witness to War" series, marking the 50th anniversary of  the outbreak of World War II, is "Orwell: The War Commentaries," edited by W.  J. West (Schocken: $8.95). During the early '40s, George Orwell wrote a series  of weekly essays on the conflict "as seen through Eastern eyes" -- for Indian  announcers to read over the BBC to counter Axis propaganda in British India.  (Transcriptions of sample broadcasts by the collaborator William Joyce, usually  referred to as "Lord Haw-Haw," are included in an appendix.)  </P> <P> Longer, drier and more detailed, Orwell's essays lacks the terse immediacy of  Murrow's reports. But his participation in this duplicitous war of words  provides an intriguing background to the newspeak disinformation campaigns in  "1984."  </P></p>

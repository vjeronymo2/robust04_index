			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Unit trust body backs down on retail regulation THE UNIT Trust Association has reversed its position on retail regulation in a revised paper submitted to the Securities and Investments Board. The move is a result of pressure from its life assurance company members. Five of the trade association's largest life assurance members resigned after it submitted a paper to SIB which criticised life assurance sales practices in unusually harsh terms. The five members contribute 10 per cent of the associations's revenues. In its most significant reversal, the new paper from the association no longer offers unequivocal support for the SIB proposal on 'depolarisation', which would have allowed unit trusts to be sold through more outlets than are presently available for life assurance products. Instead, the paper now simply says that while some members support the concept, others are opposed to it. Sales of all products are currently polarised - that is, they must be sold either through tied or direct agents selling the products of a single company, or through independent financial advisers selling the products of many suppliers. The association had argued that as charges relating to the sales of unit trusts are easily visible to prospective buyers, unlike those of life products, the consumer protection afforded by polarisation was unnecessary. The paper also climbed down on SIB proposals to require tougher disclosure rules in the sale of life products. The life assurance industry has been fighting many of these proposals, arguing that to give too much information to consumers would confuse many of them.</p>

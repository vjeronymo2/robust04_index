			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Appointments: RBS lands a big Fish The Royal Bank of Scotland is understandably proud of its latest US catch. It has landed Lawrence Fish, one of US banking's better-known trouble-shooters, to head Citizens Financial, its US banking operation. Larry Fish, a 47-year-old Harvard MBA, joins Citizens Financial as president, but will take over as chief executive when George Graboys retires at the end of the year. Raised in Chicago, Fish spent 18 years with the Bank of Boston, where he first made his name as an international banker with stints in Tokyo and Hong Kong. But since 1988 he has been trying his hand at rescuing troubled financial institutions, first with Columbia Savings and Loan on the west coast, and more recently with the Bank of New England. US bank analysts have a high regard for Fish's talents as a 'crisis manager'  -there is therefore some surprise that he has been recruited to run Citizens, whose financial health is considerably better than most of its com-petitors. It is a much smaller institution than either Columbia or the Bank of New England and it is hard to see how it can prove as big a challenge. There must be a worry that Fish may be tempted to move yet again if a more tempting offer is made, or that he will try and expand Citizens Financial too quickly - the commonest reason why so many foreign banks in the US have lost money. The new top management at RBS obviously feels it is a risk worth taking.</p>

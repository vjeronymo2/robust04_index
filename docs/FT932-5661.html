			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Merloni plans more disposals to cut gearing MERLONI Elettrodomestici, the Italian white goods group, is planning further asset sales and tighter controls on working capital to reduce its gearing, said Mr Gian Oddone Merli, chief financial officer, in London yesterday. Merloni, which is best known for its Ariston, Indesit and Scholtes brands, had net gains of L8bn (Dollars 5.4m) on the disposal of fixed assets last year. But, as the company reported in March, it also suffered foreign exchange losses of L21bn, and group net profits fell from L11.7bn to L1.6bn. Merloni's debt-to-equity ratio peaked at 1.76 in 1989, following the acquisitions of the value-for-money Indesit range in Italy and the high-end Scholtes in France. The ratio was unchanged last year at a relatively high 0.92, in spite of L86bn of capital spending. Mr Merli, who became chief financial officer in February, said that the company could dispose of further assets, such as warehouses, and would be introducing more 'just-in-time' working in order to reduce stocks of raw materials. He said that the company was now benefiting from the devaluation of the lira which produced heavy foreign exchange losses last year. Merloni had moved some of its debt into the lira, and was also trying to keep foreign-denominated debt only in currencies in which it was generating revenues, Mr Merli said. The exchange losses spoilt an otherwise better performance last year. Operating profits jumped 50 per cent to L62.4bn and the operating margin rose from 3.5 per cent to 4.8 per cent. Mr Merli said that a 6 per cent margin was achievable this year because of Merloni's internal restructuring and productivity drive.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Second wave of sell-offs due next month Preparations are under way for Russia's second massive privatisation programme to begin next month in an effort to restructure Russian industry through investment. Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation, revealed the plans in Stockholm over the weekend and expressed hope he would guide the privatisation through its next phase following his role in the introduction of economic reform. The early part of the first privatisation issued free vouchers to Russia's 150m men, women and children. Government legislation made privatisation compulsory for large and small companies and cut into Russia's vast state sector more deeply than any efforts exerted by other former communist states. Mr Chubais said that 'the main goal of privatisation has been achieved. The distribution of vouchers has changed the distribution of political power. The level of change makes the process of reform irreversible.' He said that by the end of this year around 70 per cent of property would be in private hands, 70 per cent of workers would work in the private sector, 40m people would hold shares in industry and 1m people would own small businesses. The next phase, said Mr Chubais, would involve the sell-off of the rest of the state companies and residual state ownership of most of the companies already part-privatised. This will mean: a transition from giving away shares for vouchers to selling shares for money. fewer privileges for workers and managers in the privatised companies compared with the incentives which marked the first stage. two new ways in which companies can be privatised: the first giving 25 per cent of all non-voting shares to workers and managers, with the remainder sold at auction; and the second giving 10 per cent of voting shares away free, a further 10 per cent at a nominal price (fixed at June 1994) with a 30 per cent discount, and the rest sold at auction. 51 per cent of the income raised from privatisation will go into the company, rather than to the state budget. Other issues to be tackled in the programme, which is at least as ambitious as the first stage, will be privatisation of land on which enterprises are located. This issue is fraught with legal uncertainties. The privatisation of agricultural land remains mired in the bureaucracy. Another plank of the programme will be restructuring at enterprise level by giving shareholders more rights to change management. In addition, the extensive social provisions from enterprises will be transferred to local administration and a working securities market is to be created. Though a start has been made on all of these matters, they represent a vast agenda which even Mr Chubais acknowledges will take up to the end of the century. The deputy prime minister said that this programme had already been approved by the government and should be published before the end of June. However, he warned of obstacles and dangers which he described as 'the price of success' and which the next phase must tackle. The main issue, he said, is that the speed of privatisation had left no time to develop institutional investment by Russian and foreign companies. However, financial companies had built up reserves and expertise and would now be encouraged to invest. Mr Chubais said that he expected to be blamed for encouraging foreign investment and for the 'sell-off of Russian industry.' Since that was the case, he said, he would appeal to foreign companies to come as quickly as possible. Mr Peter Aven, the former trade minister and now chairman of Alpha Bank, part of one of Russia's largest financial groups, said: 'This will now be the period of Russian investment in Russian industry. We are ready for it.' Hard slog for Russia, Page 17</p>

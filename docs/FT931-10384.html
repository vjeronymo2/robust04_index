			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / France threatens to fine Hoover THE French government yesterday stepped up the political pressure on Hoover by threatening to fine the US domestic appliance company for its decision to switch production from its plant at Dijon in eastern France to Cambuslang in Scotland. Ms Martine Aubry, employment minister, said the Labour Inspectorate would fine Hoover for breaching French employment law. She claimed that the company, whose closure plans involve the loss of 600 French jobs, had failed to notify the company's works committee before announcing a plant closure. 'The very least a company should do is to respect the laws of the countries where it operates,' said Ms Aubry. 'Hoover did not conform with French law.' She said she also intended to check whether Hoover had broken European Community legislation, although this is unlikely. Hoover's action has been condemned by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president who is also Ms Aubry's father. However, the Socialist government, acutely aware of its poor record on employment, is trying to keep the Hoover issue in the spotlight in the run-up to next month's legislative elections.</p>

The victims were shot as they tried to disarm the police,  who  were firing in the air to scare away the mob. According to the  police commander in Iganga, over 800 stick-wielding and  stone-throwing taxpayers converged on Nambale Police post to  demolish it and get hold of the subcounty chief of Nambale, whom  they thought had taken refuge there. They accused him the chief  of overassessing them.    Meanwhile 77 rioters who were arrested from the subcounties  of Nabitende, Nambale and (Namungabe) have appeared in the  court, charged with inciting people against payment of tax.  Twenty of them pleaded guilty and were sentenced to 12 months  imprisonment. Those who denied the charge were remanded.    Agitation against payment of the graduated tax started last  Monday [24 January] in Nabitende Subcounty and later spread to  Nambale, (Namungabe), and later to (Ivukwa) and Bulange in  Busika County, also Bukoma in Luka County and (Namulemba) in  Bugweri County.</p>

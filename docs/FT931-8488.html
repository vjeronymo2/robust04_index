			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Mitsubishi Heavy in job cuts MITSUBISHI Heavy Industries yesterday became the latest Japanese company to announce a big cut in its workforce in response to the worsening Japanese economy. The company, Japan's largest heavy machinery manufacturer, said it would reduce the number of employees at its Mihama plant in Hiroshima by about 10 per cent, or close to 400 workers, to meet an equivalent fall in demand for products made at the plant. Last autumn, the company sent a number of employees working at its machine-tool plants temporarily to Mitsubishi Motors, a fellow-member of the group. Mitsubishi Heavy said it aims to curtail its Mihama workforce over two years through natural wastage, reduction in graduate intake, and by transferring staff to affiliated companies. The move highlights the spreading impact of the slowdown in Japan's economy on the nation's workforce. The prolonged downturn has not yet led to huge redundancies, but Japanese companies have been restructuring their workforces by encouraging older employees to retire early, transferring staff to affiliated companies and restricting graduate intake. A phone hotline for employees sponsored by a group of lawyers specialising in labour relations has received nearly 500 calls, many of them from white-collar workers. Japanese newspapers report that a majority of the calls to the hotline were from manager-level employees facing pressure to take early retirement or redundancy. The social stigma still attached to corporations which resort to drastic redundancies has led most companies to stress that the decision to leave is entirely up to the individual. IBM Japan, for example, which launched a second career programme for people aged 50 or older, said it had no target for staff reductions, although 3,000 employees would be eligible for the financial support offered under the programme.</p>

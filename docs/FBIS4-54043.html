			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- A senior Japanese Trade  Ministry official Tuesday expressed appreciation for  Washington's commitment not to use "numerical targets" as a tool  to gauge U.S. access to Japanese markets.    Yoshihiro Sakamoto, director general of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry's [MITI] International Trade  Policy Bureau, told a press conference that the United States  had "clarified" its stance not to seek any numerical targets in  future bilateral trade talks. He made the comment after Japan  and the U.S. agreed earlier in the day in Washington to reopen  the stalled trade "framework" talks, ending a three-month  stalemate in the negotiations. "The restart of the framework  talks will form a basis for further strengthening Japan-U.S.  ties," Sakamoto said in a reference to the soured bilateral  relations on the economic front since the rupture of the trade  talks in February.    Sakamoto also said the accord between "the world's two major  economic players" will have "not a small impact" on the global  economy. "The latest accord marks Washington's confirmation that  it will pursue free trade at a time when the global community is  prepared to enforce trade measures pledged under the recently  concluded Uruguay Round multilateral trade talks," Sakamoto  added.    The talks to establish a new trade framework were launched  after the July 1993 summit between then Japanese Prime Minister  Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. But the talks  came to a standstill during the Feb. 11 meeting between then  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Clinton when Tokyo  and Washington failed to bridge differences over the definition  of the "objective criteria" to be used to gauge the openness of  Japan's markets.    Sakamoto said both parties during the latest  subcabinet-level  meeting in Washington refrained from defining "numerical  targets. We are satisfied with Washington's first official  pledge not to seek numerical targets," Sakamoto said. "What is  more important than wording or definitions is to get the stalled  talks rolling again," Sakamoto said. "Tokyo's understanding is  that objective criteria will include a set of measuring  yardsticks and they will be used on a sector-by-sector basis in  order to gauge only how Japan has done in the past," he said.    He said Japan's failure to achieve certain goals would not  lead to any trade sanctions. "If something wrong is found, we  are ready to remove it to improve the situation."</p>

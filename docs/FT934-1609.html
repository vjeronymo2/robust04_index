			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Motorola shake-up puts Weisz in chairman's seat Motorola, the US electronics group, announced top management changes in the wake of the departure of George Fisher, former chairman and chief executive, who left in October to become chairman and chief executive of Eastman Kodak. William Weisz, formerly vice chairman, was appointed non-executive chairman. Mr Weisz, 66, was chief executive from 1972 until his retirement in 1989. Previously, Motorola's chief executive was board chairman. The company said that under its new structure the chairman will become the primary link between the board and the chief executive office. Gary Tooker, 54, formerly president and chief operating officer, was elected chief executive and vice chairman. Christopher Galvin, 43, grandson of the founder of Motorola, was elected president and chief operating officer. Mr Galvin had been senior executive vice president and assistant chief operating officer. Messrs Tooker and Galvin will form a two-person chief executive office, with total responsibility to manage the company's affairs, Motorola said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interviewees expressed little concern that the newly acquired ability to compete could force one GSE out of business, thus triggering some Federal response. However, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are a duopoly for the market they serve. Between the two, they clearly control the single-family housing, conventional loan secondary market_an enormous market to begin with_which shows every sign of continued growth. Because of the nature of the market, its size, its growth, and the limited number of market participants, vigorous innovation and competition are not surprising.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the work group's analysis, the FCA Board concluded that the FCA's current policy of granting exclusive charters, with limited exceptions, has been generally effective in facilitating the delivery of agricultural credit and related services to eligible customers. However, the FCA Board also recognizes that its current position does not provide for consideration of competitive charters, even if such charters would provide customers with lower cost or higher quality agricultural credit. Consequently, the FCA Board proposes to modify its current policy on competition to authorize the issuance of competitive charters when doing so would enhance, beyond the status quo, the availability of the highest quality, lowest cost credit and credit service, on a safe and sound, financially sustainable basis, to eligible customers. The FCA Board invites your comments on the following statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Policy Statement on System Institution Activities Involving the Potential for Nonexclusive Territories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Competition between Farm Credit System institutions can potentially occur as a result of the Farm Credit Administration's (FCA) authority to issue nonexclusive charters and, in some situations, by regulation. As a general rule, the FCA grants charters and issues regulations which do not provide for intra-System competition. The FCA Board continues to endorse this general practice of noncompetitive territories as being reasonable for a cooperatively owned enterprise that competes with a variety of other credit suppliers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, the degree to which the FCA's authority can influence the level of territorial exclusivity is guided by the overall purposes and, in some cases, the specific direction of the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (Act). Briefly stated, the Act seeks to provide for a customer-owned system of cooperative lending institutions that can provide sound and constructive credit and credit services for agriculture, certain types of rural housing, and utilities while maintaining high levels of safety and soundness as measured by sustained financial viability. If a System institution were to propose a territorial structure or lending authority different from current practice, the FCA's response would be based on how the new proposal meets the purposes of the Act. There may be limited circumstances under which some form of competition would result in higher quality, lower cost service to customers, on a safe and sound, financially sustainable basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this policy statement is to provide a consistent framework within which the FCA may respond to issues that involve the potential for competition as a result of either charter, regulation, or other request submitted by System institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA Board recognizes that System institution boards may occasionally seek to alter their charters or expand authorities beyond current boundaries to enhance efficiencies or to provide better service to customers. Prior to formally submitting requests, the FCA encourages the adjacent institutions involved to resolve any territorial disputes that may result from the request in a fair and amicable manner. Considerable guidance is provided in FCA regulations concerning routine charter amendments, territorial transfers, and out-of-territory lending. Additionally, the FCA Board encourages the development of innovative proposals to address territorial and competitive issues that are not covered by existing regulation. These may range from one institution granting permission for the other institution to lend to its customers, to reciprocal agreements to compete in each other's territory, to providing some form of compensation for ceded territory, or to enter into some form of joint venture. The FCA will provide assistance, upon request, to enable System institutions to reach agreements on such matters. Naturally, such innovative agreements must be consistent with the Act and FCA regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event agreements are not reached, based on the purposes of the Act, the standard for addressing each request involving territorial issues with the potential for intra-System competition is consistent with what is used in deciding all charter requests, that is: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Determine whether or not the proposal will enhance, beyond the status quo, the availability of the highest quality, lowest cost, credit and credit service on a safe and sound, financially sustainable basis to eligible customers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining whether or not the above standard is met, the FCA will analyze a range of factors, as each is deemed relevant to the situation, as outlined in the following categories:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Arts: Quality and popularity - Television On Sunday, BBC2 showed an excellent 'Screen Two' called The Last Romantics in which writer Nigel Williams and director Jack Gold managed the difficult trick of combining a play of ideas (the old and new theories of literary criticism as represented by Quiller-Couch and the Leavises) with a conventional drama of personalities in which a young political activist challenged FR Leavis with much the same cruelty, though less of the intellectual impact, that Leavis himself had used early in his career when he challenged 'Q'. The irony was that Leavis (played by Ian Holm) ended up feeling defensive about his old adversary while his frightening wife, Queenie (one of the best performances I have seen from Sara Kestelman, who gets better and better) became more vituperative than ever about Q and the old school. It was a subtle and engrossing work in which the seemingly rarified matter of literary criticism was shown to be central to the lives of those involved. No drama could convey the whole of the Q-Leavis-CP Snow debate about culture which occurred in Cambridge between the 1920s and 1960s without becoming didactic or absurd, but this production went a remarkable distance quite safely down that road. Towards the end, Q (Leo McKern) said to Leavis: 'The issue is whether we share a culture, isn't it, and I have only to look out of my window to know the answer. Just over that wall, even in Cambridge, there are ordinary people, and I cannot believe that they see things much differently than they did in Shakespeare's day, or that they are so very different from you and me, or that they can't be expected to understand poetry'. At which point Leavis said: 'They inhabit a different world'. Q responded: 'If I really thought that was the case how could I stand upon my hind legs and talk about something called literature? Because if literature is in as bad a way as you make it sound, it is little more than a private language, and you know what happens to private languages: they grow stale, they die, and they are for gotten'. I quote at length because it seems to go to the heart of a debate which has been proceeding since last October when Michael Ignatieff interviewed David Hare on The Late Show about his play Murmuring Judges and led Hare into a discussion about 'relativism' (though the word was not mentioned): the question of whether, since the 1960s, there have been any widely accepted standards left in the arts in Britain. Hare asserted that, contrary to views which supposedly became popular in the 60s, especially on television, Keats is a better poet than Bob Dylan. Hare's main points seemed to be that the people involved in television arts programmes, especially programmes like The Late Show, treated the arts in an indiscriminate and amoral way, and encouraged destructive criticism from people who had themselves never created anything of value. That second argument was settled by Dr Johnson 200 years ago when he responded to Boswell's breast-beating about some earlier criticism of a play by Mallet ('How vain should either of us be to write one not near so good') with: 'You may scold a carpenter who has made you a bad table, though you cannot make a table. It is not your trade to make tables'. However, the first part of the argument has continued within The Late Show and on various arts pages, especially in the Guardian, where Patrick Wright summarised the new approach as 'carrying out elaborate cultural studies on the everyday world, decoding advertisements and drawing up lifestyle audits on each other'. The debate is scarcely new, of course. There have always been those who looked on programmes such as the famous edition of Arena on the Ford Cortina as a surrender to philistine values. No doubt the defenders of the old faith will have despised Arena's two most recent programmes, on Chi-Chi, the famous panda in London Zoo, and on the fiction of Armistead Maupin, the gay writer whose column 'Tales Of The City' became such a hit in the San Francisco Chronicle. Above all they will have loathed last week's edition of 40 Minutes called 'Farewell Fab 208', which offered a showerbath of nostalgic sights and sounds for those who grew up with Radio Luxembourg, 'Your station of the stars'. I found all three fascinating, and informative. Many people, probably a majority of the regular readers of this page, would argue that the value of Radio Luxembourg to society is a tiny fraction of the value of, say, the Royal Opera House, because the experience of listening to, say, Placido Domingo singing 'Your tiny hand is frozen' is vastly superior to that of listening to Max Bygraves singing 'You need hands'. With that particular comparison, who could disagree? But you do, surely, have to be very particular: what about Frank Sinatra at the peak of his career singing Cole Porter, as compared with one of our many lesser tenors singing in one of Covent Garden's flops? Even Hare admitted to Ignatieff that Raymond Chandler is a better writer than many of those who, in his day at Cambridge, were required reading. I suspect that what is happening here is that, for the first time in history, there is a universally available means of mass communication (television) which is able and willing to investigate and celebrate popular art before history has had time to sort out good from bad. Even the rigorously elitist Leavis in his best book, The Great Tradition, acknowledged the quality and value of Dickens' Hard Times, and how did that first reach the public? As weekly episodes in Household Words, its appearance more than doubling the magazine's circulation. In other words it was the soap opera of its day, appearing in the populist medium of its day. It is hard to avoid the feeling that the debate now advancing under the impressive device 'relativism' is actually just a variation on the familiar snobbish attitude towards television among the British intelligentsia, and it is not hard to see why. If you work in the theatre what can you hold up in your own medium, from the past five or six years, which bears comparison with Edge Of Darkness, The Singing Detective, A Very Peculiar Practice, Tutti Frutti or Talking Heads? (And that ignores adaptations). Even more to the point, what can the theatre produce to compare with Minder? Naturally the standard has varied, but at its best Minder can easily bear comparison with Dickens, and its audience is even larger than his was. Obviously a book, theatre production or programme is not good merely because it is popular, as anybody with a minimum of judgment and taste can tell by looking at a Mills &amp; Boon paperback, The Mousetrap (not long ago I checked: it is appalling) or any edition of Neighbours. More importantly, however, anyone who looks at Amis's novels, Ayckbourn's plays, and a host of television programmes from Attenborough's to Alan Bennett's can also establish that a book, theatre production or programme is not bad merely because it is popular, and that is the point which those marching under the 'relativism' banner seem to find so very hard to accept.</p>

			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / London service sector sees jobs fall The outlook for employment in London's service sector has grown gloomier in the last three months, according to a survey by the London Chamber of Commerce. The proportion of service-sector businesses that say employment has risen, compared to those who say it has fallen, has dropped to a negative balance of 13. In the last quarterly survey in March there was a positive balance of 28 in the proportion of companies reporting a pick-up in employment. Meanwhile, the proportion of service-sector businesses expecting employment to pick up in the next three months has also dropped significantly, to a negative balance of three. This decline took place even though export optimism in the sector rose sharply in the last three months. Overall business confidence is now at its highest level for five years in the sector. The report, which surveyed 344 business employing about 330,000 people in greater London, notes that export confidence in manufacturing also rose. However domestic deliveries fell and overall business confidence dipped slightly, although the balances in both sectors remained positive. The balance of manufacturing companies reporting increased employment has now risen to zero, up from a negative balance of minus five in the last quarter.

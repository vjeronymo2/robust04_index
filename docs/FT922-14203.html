			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK impact on EC social policy 'limited' BRITAIN'S attempt to impose Thatcherite employment policies on the European Community in 1986 was never expected to achieve more than short-term political success and the government knew that the Brussels bureaucracy would block it, according to an independent research body. The unpublished assessment of the impact on EC social policy of the UK's presidency of the Community in 1986 implies that its action programme for employment growth created a backlash and led indirectly to the European Social Charter, which the Conservative government has opposed. The report was written by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research for the Department of Employment. The UK is due to assume the presidency of the Community again in July this year. The case was seen as a textbook example of how the European Commission neutralises proposals it opposes. UK-style flexibility and deregulation of the labour market, was hailed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, then paymaster-general and now education secretary, as 'a milestone in tackling the problem of Europe's 16m jobless'. Eighteen months after its adoption it was virtually forgotten, according to the assessment. The UK programme was a short-term political success because all EC social-affairs ministers were seen to back UK domestic policy, the institute says. The initiative by the government put unemployment high on the EC agenda and showed a workable alternative to the European Commission's approach. Yet the programme did not achieve its aim of changing the course of EC social policy. Department of Employment officials failed to lobby hard for Commission action after the programme was adopted. They knew any attempt to oppose Commission policies would fail, the report concludes.</p>

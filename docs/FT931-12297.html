			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Legislators act over port system LEGISLATION to modernise the Brazilian port system was passed by Congress on Wednesday night after two years of negotiation, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro. Port workers began a national strike yesterday in protest against the legislation, which requires approval by President Itamar Franco. The new law is the first step towards privatisation of the system, which the Brazilian Exporters' Association claims to be the most expensive and inefficient in the world. Although the legislation reduces the power of the stevedores' union, it does not go as far as business would like. Port users will still have to contract labour from the union, but the number of workers for each job, hours and wages will be set by a new port authority. Workers' representatives will comprise a third of the port authority and business the remainder.</p>

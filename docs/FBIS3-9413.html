			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Veljko Knezevic, head of the office of the </F> Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Zagreb, by an unidentified  correspondent; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Prior to his departure to Zagreb tomorrow,  Veljko Knezevic, head of the office of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia in Zagreb, was received by Federal Prime Minister  Radoje Kontic. After the talks, Mr. Knezevic made a statement  for the Radio and Television of Serbia and TANJUG.    [Correspondent] What did you discuss with Prime Minister  Kontic?    [Knezevic] My trip to Zagreb tomorrow. Prime Minister  Kontic spoke about the importance he and thus the Yugoslav  Government attach to the beginning of the process normalizing  relations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and  Croatia. He expressed a certain optimism that this  normalization would occur even quicker than presently thought.  I would like to see this happen.    I am also optimistic to some extent that the normalization  will take off regardless of the delays and possible difficulties  that will arise, as our relations are naturally very complex and  very [word indistinct].    [Correspondent] In which segments [words indistinct] do you  expect this normalization to be established first?    [Knezevic] I think that normalization will begin in the  already designated, as you said, segments. As you can see, we  are trying to establish PTT [post, telephone, and telegraph]  links to start solving and resolving the complex humanitarian  problems.    I think that the nature of things will be such that it will  in fact be economic relations that will lay the foundations for  everything, that these relations will perhaps move the fastest  toward some kind of normalization, on the basis of mutual  interests. When and how the complete political solutions will be  found remains to be seen.</p>

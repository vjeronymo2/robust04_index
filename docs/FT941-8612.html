			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Loblaw survives price war to lift net profits by 17% Loblaw, Canada's biggest food distributor, overcame the recession and regional price Wars in Canada to post a 17 per cent gain in profits for the fiscal year ended January 1 1994. Loblaw, controlled by the George Weston Group, reported net profit for the year of CDollars 93.4m (USDollars 69.2m), or CDollars 1.07 a share, up from CDollars 79.8m, or 88 cents, a year earlier. Consolidated sales rose 1 per cent to CDollars 9.36bn. At the operating level, the results were strong in both eastern and western Canada. Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 26.1m, or 31 cents, down from CDollars 28.8m, or 33 cents, on sales of CDollars 2.2bn, a decline of 8 per cent. The impact of a long strike in the US supermarket unit was taken mostly in the fourth quarter. Cineplex, a North American cinema operator and film distributor controlled by the Montreal Bronfmans, reported its first annual operating profit since 1987. However, after a special charge of USDollars 7.3m, there was a final loss of Dollars 7.4m, or 7 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 41.3m, or 48 cents, in 1992, on sales of Dollars 546m, against Dollars 519m.</p>

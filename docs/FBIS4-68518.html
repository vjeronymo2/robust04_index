			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Malyutin and Irina Matveyeva: </F> "Americans Undertake to Outfit the Russian Skies"]    [Text] Among the largest American corporations whose  activities in the Russian market have so far gone practically  unnoticed is the Westinghouse electronics company. However,  events this past week that became known just yesterday, since  they were not advertised by the company, indicate that  Westinghouse has revised its attitude toward Russia. The company  took its first steps in the Russian market with truly American  sweep, concluding two major agreements at once. The firm signed  a memorandum on the principles of cooperation with the Russian  Ministry of Atomic Energy and an agreement on its participation  in an international consortium established to carry out a  project for the modernization by 2005 of the unified air traffic  control system in Russia. The project's approximate cost is $5  billion.    Many foreign aircraft companies have not yet made up their  minds to begin active business in Russia, since they consider  flights on Russian airlines to be less than safe. According to  official statistics, the level of safety on Russian airlines is  three times lower than in the United States and two times lower  than in West European countries. The level of training of air  traffic controllers and the equipment with which they work do  not meet world standards. In addition, international airlines  are overloaded beyond permissible norms. Because of all these  problems, not only do passengers suffer every possible  inconvenience and discomfort, but the state budget loses foreign  exchange that it might earn from foreign airlines whose planes  flew over Russia's territory.    Last April the Russian government passed a decree "On the  Modernization of the Unified Air Traffic Control System in  Russia" (and that was when the first negotiations with  Westinghouse began). The decree provides for the establishment  of an international consortium with the participation of leading  Western companies that have experience in organizing air traffic  control. At that time the Russian-Italian Buran Joint Venture  established by the State Scientific Research Institute for Air  Navigation, the Proton Research and Production Association, the  All-Russian Research Institute of Radio Automation Equipment and  the Italian Aleniy company was working in a similar area, but on  a smaller scale.    Buran's experience was taken advantage of, and an  international consortium is presently being established (its  name has not yet been determined) that will include, in addition  to Aleniy, Westinghouse, The French Tomson-CSF company and the  recently established Russian Scientific and Technical Center for  Air Traffic Control--as the general contractor on the Russian  side. Negotiations are continuing with a number of other large  foreign companies. As the center's director Sergey Novikov  indicated, "the road to the consortium has not been closed to  new investors." According to Mr. Novak, the ultimate value of  the project will be determined in April, after the pertinent  federal program has been adopted. The Russian side's share in  the consortium will be 51 percent.    Until the federal program is adopted, the amount of foreign  investments in the large-scale project is not being made public.  However, there is no doubt that it will come to hundreds of  millions of dollars. When it makes its contribution, the  Westinghouse corporation will immediately become one of the  Western electronic companies--such as ABB or Siemens--that have  invested sizeable funds in Russia. According to REUTERS,  Westinghouse President Gary clark is also counting on the  company's playing a substantial role in modernizing vitally  important sectors of the Russian economy. Mr. Clark expressed  the desire not only to help Russians realize their dreams for  "normal flights," but also to take part in modernizing Russian  nuclear-power enterprises.    As a KOMMERSANT correspondent was told at the Ministry of  Atomic Energy, for a long time this agency was unable to find a  common language with Westinghouse: "It seems that the company  had little interest in Russia." However, in this area, too,  things have started moving--at any rate, a memorandum on  principles of cooperation has already been signed.</p>

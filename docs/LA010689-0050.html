			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  SUPERVISORS OPPOSE PLAN TO BLOCK LANDFILL  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors has voted to strongly oppose a pending city of Los  Angeles development plan that would block the use of three Westside canyons as  a regional landfill.  </P> <P> The board, on a 3-1 vote, directed its staff to argue at City Council hearings  against a provision in the proposed Mulholland Scenic Parkway Specific Plan  that prohibits development of Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons for garbage  disposal.  </P> <P> Last May, three of the five supervisors -- Deane Dana, Mike Antonovich and Ed  Edelman -- said they either opposed a landfill in the canyons or that they  would consider it only as a last resort to solve long-range garbage disposal  problems.  </P></p>

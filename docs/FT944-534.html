			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Weak rebound predicted for Japanese economy Japan's economic recovery was confirmed by statistics released by the government yesterday, although a fall in consumer prices, indicating lingering deflationary pressures, reinforced predictions of a weak rebound, Emiko Terazono writes. Industrial production for November rose 2.7 per cent from the previous month, and 5.9 per cent from a year earlier on an unadjusted basis, thanks to output growth in sectors including electrical machinery and steel. Industrial shipments rose 2.8 per cent from the previous month while the inventory index dropped 0.2 per cent. Labour conditions showed a slight improvement, with the unemployment rate for November at 2.9 per cent, the first fall in seven months, down from October's 3 per cent. The ratio of job offers to applicants remained flat for the third consecutive month at 0.64, indicating 64 offers for 100 candidates. Strong November construction order figures reflected a recovery in private sector capital spending. The figure rose 20.8 per cent from a year earlier, with private sector orders rising 13.9 per cent and public sector orders advancing 31.8 per cent. The Construction Ministry said housing starts rose 4.5 per cent from the previous year to 136,983 units, up for the second consecutive month. However, consumption figures indicated continuing downward pressures on prices. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said large retailers' sales last month rose 0.3 per cent from a year earlier, the first rise in four months. Sales at department stores rose 0.1 per cent, the first increase in 33 months. Meanwhile, the December consumer price index for the Tokyo metropolitan area, a leading indicator for the national figure, fell 0.5 per cent from the previous year, due to lower prices on clothing and other manufactured goods. For the whole year, the CPI for Tokyo rose 0.7 per cent, the first increase of less than 1 per cent since 1987.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: PARIS TROUT BY PETE DEXTER (PENGUIN: $7.95)  </P> <P> Anger hangs like a pall over this brooding story of interracial murder in a  small Southern town during the '50s. The coldly amoral Paris Trout feels no  remorse when he inadvertently shoots a black teen-ager and wounds her guardian,  but his trial releases tensions hidden within the social fabric of Cotton  Point, Ga.  </P> <P> As his problems intensify, Trout darkens the lives of everyone unfortunate  enough to come in contact with him: his abused, sensual wife, Hanna; his  lawyer, Harry Seagraves, a prominent, civic-minded hypocrite, and Carl Bonner,  an earnest young man, burdened with the fame he earned when he became the  youngest Eagle Scout in the state's history.  </P> <P> As an evocation of the claustrophobic, racist society of the rural South before  integration, Pete Dexter's National Book Award-winning novel is matched only by  Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird."  </P></p>

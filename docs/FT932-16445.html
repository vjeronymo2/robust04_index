			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): French students step into work - In a Nutshell The Shell Technology Enterprise Programme (Step) has been placing students with small and medium-sized companies for eight-week summer vacation projects for the past seven years. This year it will give UK companies the choice of a French student for the first time. In a pilot project confined in its first year to London, undergraduates from French universities will take part. Companies keen to expand their activities in France or elsewhere in the single market would be particularly suitable, Step said. A total of 1,000 students from UK universities are expected to take part in the Step programme this year. The host employer pays half their weekly salary of Pounds 100.

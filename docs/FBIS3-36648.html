			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian </F> Liberal Democratic Party, by unidentified reporter; place and  date not given: "God Has Dictated That We Be Friends"]    [Text] [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] Mr. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, what  do you feel when you think about Germany?    [Zhirinovskiy] When I think about Germany, whether during  the day or during the night, then I feel respect and a certain  affinity. My heart tells me that our peoples are very similar  and belong together as friends. Reason tells me that long-term  peace can be secured in Europe if both Germans and Russians want  that and will not allow themselves to be set against each other.  My understanding of history also tells me that the lesson that  is to be drawn from two murderous wars in which the Germans and  Russians inflicted horrific losses on each other can only be to  return to traditional German-Russian friendship, which was a  blessing for our peoples in all areas for hundreds of years.    [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] The media, especially in Germany, are  overjoyed that criminal proceedings have been instituted against  you in Russia for "war-mongering."    [Zhirinovskiy] Some people filed reports with the  authorities  and there are, of course, forces that want to eliminate me. My  friend Dr. Frey has had criminal proceedings instituted against  him 600 times and has never been sentenced. I have done nothing  wrong. The Russian people and the Russian Army know that I  adhere to the law and that I serve the interests of the Russian  people, its right to exist with all my strength.  <H5>  Gutter Journalism </H5>   [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] The press, radio, and television in  Germany have been trying to outdo each other in a concerted  campaign aimed at turning opinion against you. You are depicted  as an enemy of Germany.    [Zhirinovskiy] Over the past 50 years, Germany has seen many  foreign politicians who have been anything but friends of the  German people. The more some people stirred up hatred against  Germany, the more humble and submissive was the response. I  cannot recall one foreign politician who has thought or  expressed himself about the Germans in a friendlier or warmer  fashion than I.    I do not agree with de Gaulle's words that "the Germans are  poor bastards, because they have been ruined." However, I do  get the impression that the brain-washing of re-education, which  has been going on for almost 50 years, has caused psychological,  even pathological changes in many Germans. For example, Mrs.  Thatcher writes in her memoirs in an epic manner about how she  and Mitterrand sought to prevent the unification of the Federal  Republic and the GDR, and for some people in the FRG, they are  considered prototypes of modern Germany's friends. However,  when I talk of reaching agreement on a settlement of the East  Prussia issue in a way that will be to the advantage of Germany  and when I also say that history has not said its last word  about the terrible injustice of the Oder-Neisse line, which I  believe can be revised through peaceful negotiations, then I am  portrayed as some evil demon from hell and a fanatical enemy of  Germany.  <H5>  Is National Masochism Something Attractive? </H5>   [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] The media are really producing a  surfeit....    [Zhirinovskiy] ....of gutter journalism. However, in the  Russian parliamentary elections, which were held in December,  every fourth person who cast a valid vote voted for me, and the  Liberal Democrats, whom I lead, are by far the strongest party  in Russia. The sick, fantastic stories that are being spread  about me by the media outside Russia will not stop one single  Russian from voting for me. In fact, it will have the opposite  effect. The international media outside Russia can indeed  poison the political climate, but they can in no way influence  the course of things in Russia. The Russian people and the  Russian Army are behind me, and I have become the strongest  element in free elections. That is something that cannot be  said of Brezhnev or Honecker, regardless of how much one may  want to. Nevertheless, the West German media and West German  politicians sang the praises of both of them -- men who wanted  Germany to remain divided forever, and they thoroughly enjoyed  continually dropping to their knees and making gestures of  submission. Is that not strange?    [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] It is indeed strange, but at the same  time, it is indicative of the prevailing attitude of the media,  which want to undermine German confidence through a one-sided  approach to dealing with the past, by developing ideas of  "collective responsibility" and "collective liability" that also  apply to Germans who have not been born yet.    [Zhirinovskiy] I do not understand how the great German  people can accept that. Is national masochism that attractive?  Why should such masochistic exercises apply only to one people  on this planet, while the rest of the international community  would not even dream of being prepared to make prisoners of  themselves in a similar way?  <H5>  No One Can Be That Stupid </H5>   From the very outset, I and my friend Dr. Frey agreed that  we  would not level accusations at each other concerning guilt and  that we would trade no such charges regarding the past. Dr.  Frey was born after the Nazi seizure of power and I was born  after World War II. There are many horrific and difficult  problems to be dealt with at the present time. We cannot change  the past, but we can try to make the present better and to  master the future. That entails a good German-Russian  relationship in every respect. What I would also add to the  relationship is a rapprochement in the sense of the Bismarckian  Reinsurance Treaty. In my case, Germany's reinsurance treaty is  Gerhard Frey.    [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] Much of the German media has sought to  create the impression that at the joint news conference at the  Duma on Wednesday of last week, there were all kinds of attacks  against Germany.    [Zhirinovskiy] As everyone knows, there exists a sincere  friendship between me and Dr. Frey. We discussed all the issues  that interest us in a spirit of harmony during Dr. Frey's visit  to Moscow at my invitation from Tuesday to Thursday of last  week. How stupid must one be to believe that Gerhard Frey, who  has fought for the good of Germany all his life and suffered  exceptional persecution as a result, would appear with me at  news conference in Moscow or anywhere else and listen to or  accept the slightest negative remark about the German people.  There cannot be anyone that stupid on this planet! If there is  an idiot who believes that anywhere, then he should seek  treatment from a psychiatrist as quickly as possible.  <H5>  They Want Germany To Be Bound </H5>   At the news conference, which lasted almost two hours and  took place before dozens of TV crews and hundreds of journalists  from all over the world, Dr. Frey and I staged a real fireworks  display of pro-German projects and policies of the kind that has  certainly never been seen at the U.S. Congress, the British  House of Commons, or the French National Assembly. I have  proposed a joint German-Russian project for the construction of  a highway linking Berlin and Moscow via Koenigsberg  [Kaliningrad], that German should become the principle foreign  language taught throughout Russia, that our students should  participate in large-scale exchange programs, and that there  should be a free cultural exchange between our countries. I have  proposed that Germany play the leading role in the extraction of  our mineral wealth, in our industry, and in joint defense  projects.    [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] You always say in German and in Russian:  Germans and Russians -- friends forever. You said that at the  DVU [German People's Union] rallies and press conferences in  1992 and 1993, at the Liberal Democrats rallies and news  conferences in 1992 and 1993, and now you have said so again.    [Zhirinovskiy] If I perhaps said that 20 or 25 times at our  joint news conference at the Duma last week, then that will make  me mortal enemy number one for the anti-German media in Germany.  There are evidently forces outside Germany who are interested  in preventing German-Russian friendship by every possible means.  Germany should be bound, and remain deprived of its full  sovereignty.    However, if the two greatest and strongest nations in Europe  stand together as brothers, then security and peace are  guaranteed. That is essentially so simple, so clear, so obvious,  and irrefutable that anyone of goodwill must comprehend it. I  said that just as clearly at the DVU rally in the  Nibelungenhalle in Passau. There is a video of the rally --  "Passau '93: Germany Must Live!" -- which contains my entire  speech. Anyone who listens to that speech and still doubts  whether I am a great friend of Germany must be mad in the best  case and is more probably an enemy of Germany.  <H5>  Con Men Without Scruples </H5>   [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] Our media are spreading all kinds of  fantastic stories about how you want to address a small splinter  group at the so-called European Congress in Cologne.    [Zhirinovskiy] People all over the world want to jump onto  the bandwagon now. Some unscrupulous con men tell press  agencies and other media that I will attend some event organized  by them. In accordance with current "political standards," the  press does not take the trouble to consult my colleagues, but  diligently spreads the false report. I would not deal with such  people in my wildest dreams, to come to Cologne and so on. I  have also ignored other invitations, some were for the middle of  January. I have discussed a whole series of further, sometimes  large-scale events organized by the Liberal Democrats and the  DVU with Dr. Frey.    [NATIONAL-ZEITUNG] Along with Dr. Frey, you laid flowers at  the monument to those who died in the struggle against French  imperialism in memory of our comradeship in arms and our  national heroes in liberating Europe from Napoleon I.    [Zhirinovskiy] We must recall the great periods in our  common history and thus show Russians and Germans symbols for  the present and the future. God has dictated that we be friends.</p>

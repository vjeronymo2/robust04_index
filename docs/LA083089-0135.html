			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RIGHT WING SEEN GAINING IN BID TO BAN SCHOOL TEXTS  </P> <P> Religious extremists and members of right-wing organizations are gaining in  their battle to ban or censor library books and to restrict sex education in  schools, an anti-censorship group said in a survey released today.  </P> <P> "I want to emphasize that what is at stake in the battles being fought in  communities across the nation is more than just the fate of a few novels or a  textbook or two," said John Buchanan, chairman of People For the American Way,  founded by television producer Norman Lear.  </P> <P> "We are witnessing in these skirmishes the clash of two competing views of  public education in America. The censors see efforts to teach our children  about the world around them as a threat; the rest of us see it as a way to  broaden our children's vistas and opportunities."  </P> <P> The survey found censorship and other ideological attacks on public education  occurred in 42 of the 50 states. It focused on 172 incidents that occurred  during the 1988-89 school year.  </P> <P> The West led in total number of incidents this year, 61, and California  accumulated more incidents than any other state with 23.  </P> <P> Sex education remains a major target of the far right, which "already scored  some damaging victories" during the last school year, the report said.  </P> <P> In South Carolina, for example, the report cited statewide restrictions that  forced school textbook publishers to delete information on the use of condoms  to prevent the spread of AIDS.  </P> <P> The report said school libraries were the target of significantly more  censorship attempts during the last school year.  </P> <P> The main targets of such challenges were literary classics such as John  Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" and J. D. Salinger's "The Catcher in the Rye," as  well as plays by Arthur Miller and Aristophanes, the report said.  </P></p>

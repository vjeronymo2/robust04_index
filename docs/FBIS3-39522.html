			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 1 February Lisbon weekly O DIABO  notes that over 20,000 Chinese immigrants from the PRC and Hong  Kong may arrive in Portugal from Macao. Once in that territory,  which does not have a Chinese consulate, these individuals can  legally obtain a Portuguese special passport for foreigners, a  tourist document of a different color that does not bear the  inscription "European community" and entitles the bearer to a  90-day stay in Portugal with a right of renewal. The paper  expresses the fear that members of the "Triade," the Oriental  Mafia involved in gambling, prostitution, and money laundering,  may be included among the immigrants, as has already occurred in  Italy and Spain. It also notes that both Portugal and a number  of European governments are concerned about the easy entrance  into Portugal of such immigrants, who can then travel  uncontrolled to other parts of Europe.</p>

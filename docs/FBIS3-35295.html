			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij has affirmed  that resistance is a result of the occupation. Lebanon has not  violated the rules of the game, he said.    The interior minister denied that Katuysha rockets were  fired  at northern Israel. This might have happened and might not, he  retorted. He wondered why Israel is not brought to account for  firing shells at south Lebanon.    In an interview on Radio Free Lebanon's "Responsible Talk"  program, Mirhij said that Israel is trying to put pressure on  the Lebanese people and state to adjust Lebanon's political  stand to Israel's interests. We support any action our people  undertake in support of the resistance on their land, he said;  adding: This is a natural right.    Asked if it is likely that Israel will launch a large-scale  military operation in Lebanon, Mirhij said: Everything is  possible. We are preparing for all possibilities. So far, signs  coming from Israel's direction are certainly not peaceful, he  said.    The interior minister added: We insist on having  understanding and coordination with Syria. We will not deviate  from that course, because it enables Lebanon to adopt the right  attitude. Mirhij believes that Israel was not comfortable with  the Geneva summit because it emphasized Syria's regional power.  [passage omitted]    Asked if it will be possible to guarantee the necessary  security for the Pope's visit, Mirhij said: If we were not  capable of doing that we would not have taken the initiative.  [passage omitted]    Asked about Palestinians in Lebanon, Mirhij affirmed that  they have rights as Arab subjects living on Lebanese territory  against their will. Until they return to their homeland, they  will be treated as brothers and Arabs, he said. [passage omitted]</p>

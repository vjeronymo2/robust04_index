			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iceland faces call for 40% cut in cod catch ICELANDERS FACE bleak economic times if their government follows new advice and orders a sharp cut in fishing for cod, its most important foreign exchange earner, reports Reuter from Reykjavik. An advisory committee of the International Council for Exploration of the Seas said yesterday that the cod stock around the North Atlantic island could collapse unless the annual catch quota was reduced by 40 per cent in 1993. 'This is the worst news that the Icelandic fishing industry has received, ever,' said Mr Thorsteinn Palsson, the fisheries minister. Iceland, with a population of 250,000 and gross domestic product per capita of Dollars 25,000, relies on fish exports for more than half of its foreign currency earnings. If the cod catch is cut by 40 per cent GDP could fall by 4 to 5 per cent in 1993, the state-run National Economics Institute estimated. Earlier the NEI had forecast a 1 per cent median rise in GDP for the next three years. Foreign currency income would fall by 10 per cent in 1993 if the council's advice was followed, the institute said. 'We are going to have to re-examine our economic policies in this light,' said Mr Thordur Fridjonsson, head of the NEI. Mr Palsson has until the end of July to decide on quotas for 1993. He is expected to make up his mind after Icelandic experts have given their advice. Cod constitutes 40 per cent of Iceland's fish exports, which in turn make up 80 per cent of national exports. Despite a rigid quota system designed to conserve the stocks, the cod stock has been decreasing steadily over the past three decades. Iceland's trawlers are expected to catch a total of 250,000 tonnes of cod in 1992. The ICES committee recommended that the catch be lowered to 150,000 in 1993.</p>

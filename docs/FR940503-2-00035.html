			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the extremely unlikely event of an accidental fire at sea in which a cask was sufficiently damaged by the fire to release its contents, members of the ship crew near the fire would be exposed to the released radioactive material. However, any crew member close enough to the fire to suffer a significant radiation dose likely would be more severely injured from the fire than the radiation dose. If crew members were to survive the fire, radiological impacts would be similar to those resulting from a severe accident in port, which would result in a maximum exposure to workers and the public of approximately 0.21 person-rem. This exposure would result in an approximately one in 9,500 chance of one additional cancer in the entire exposed population. If such an accident were to occur at sea, however, there would be essentially no exposure to members of the public, and all released activity would be deposited in the ocean. Assuming that the spent fuel cask lay on the ocean floor where it slowly released its radioactive inventory, the peak doses to biota residing on the ocean floor in or near the uppermost sediment layer are estimated to be 0.11 rad (radiation adsorbed dose) per year for fish, 0.17 rad per year for crustaceans and 7.3 rad per year for mollusks. The radioactive material would be expected to disperse and to be diluted due to the influence of ocean currents. Since deleterious effects of chronic irradiation have not been observed in natural populations at dose rates of less than 365 rad, no significant impacts would be expected. Further, uranium, the major constituent of the spent fuel, has not been found to bioaccumulate in fish and bioaccumulates only slightly in crustaceans and mollusks. No significant chemical hazard would be expected from the release of the contents of the spent fuel elements into the open ocean.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spent fuel casks are designed to withstand at least a 15-meter immersion, and it has been demonstrated that the cask seals will remain intact at much greater depths. Further, damaged and undamaged casks can be recovered readily from water up to 200 meters deep. Recovery from depths of up to 2,000 meters may be possible, but would be costly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an extreme situation, where the accident occurs in coastal wasters, the spent fuel is not recovered, and both the spent fuel and cask are damaged, the peak dose to an individual is estimated to be 11 millirem per year. This individual is assumed to reside near the shore and to eat seafood (fish, mollusk, seaweed) harvested from the area in the immediate vicinity of the spent fuel cask.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event of the most severe port accident (major mechanical damage, fire, oxidation of 100 percent of the fuel, and release of radioactive material from a cask containing 33 spent fuel elements), the dose to a maximally exposed individual, i.e., an individual assumed to be standing outside approximately 100 feet away from the event and remaining there for 24 hours, would be 25 rem. At such close distance, it is highly probable that the individuals, if not evacuated, would be harmed more by the explosion and fire engulfing the cask than by the radiation dose. If the individual were inside a building approximately 100 feet away and remained there for 24 hours after the accident, the dose would be reduced to 0.22 rem. At a more likely distance, where an individual may be located outside for a period of 24 hours after the accident, the dose at 0.6 miles would be 0.21 rem. If the person were inside at the same distance, the dose would be 0.002 rem. When considered in conjunction with the unlikely probability of occurrence (approximately 1 chance in 7.7 million), the accident has an extremely small risk. For example, the risk of developing a single fatal cancer for the most severe case, i.e., individual outside, 100 feet away for 24 hours receiving 25 rem, is about 1 chance in 600 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event of an overland accident, assuming the surrounding population remains there for a 24-hour period, the estimated population dose risk is 0.0000015 person-rem for transport from Savannah, 0.0000018 person-rem from Charleston, 0.0000028 person-rem from Wilmington, 0.0000024 person-rem from Jacksonville, and 0.0000035 person-rem from Sunny Point. While there would be slightly different risks among the different ports, no significant impacts would result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four hypothetical accidents at RBOF were evaluated that could potentially release radionuclides to the atmosphere. These accidents include: (1) A nuclear criticality incident; (2) a fire and explosion at RBOF; (3) accidental cutting of fuel element cores; and (4) rupture or failure of fuel elements during underwater storage. The maximum dose was attributed to the unlikely accident of 1000 foreign fuel elements rupturing during storage at RBOF. This event would result in an 8.3 millirem maximum dose to the individual at the site boundary and a 70 person-rem dose for the offsite population. The probability of such an accident occurring, however, would be less than one in 2000 years. When the probability is taken into account, there would be an additional 1 in 500 million chance that the individual at the site boundary would develop a fatal cancer, and a 1 in 55,000 chance that a single fatal cancer would occur in the exposed populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AMATEUR BASEBALL DRAFT;  </P> <P> TITANS' FLENER SIGNS WITH BLUE JAYS  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton pitcher Huck Flener Friday signed a contract with the  Toronto Blue Jays and will join Titan teammate Matt Watson next week at St.  Catharines, Canada, one of the organization's Class-A affiliates.  </P> <P> Flener, a junior left-hander who was a ninth-round pick, will leave for  Dunedin, Fla., Sunday to participate in a one-week mini-camp before reporting  to St. Catharines of the New York-Penn League on June 16.  </P> <P> Watson, a junior right-hander who was a 14th-round pick of the Blue Jays,  signed Wednesday. He also will report to St. Catharines.  </P> <P> "It's super that Matt and I will be playing together," said Flener, a graduate  of Armijo High School in Fairfield, Calif. "He's one of my closest friends on  the team. There will still be tons of people to meet, but it's somewhat  comforting knowing I have a friend there, in another country."  </P> <P> Flener, one of the Titans' top three starters this season, went 8-1 with a 3.80  earned-run average. He struck out 89 and walked 49 in 128 innings. He was the  winning pitcher in Fullerton's 6-3 victory over Creighton in the NCAA Central  Regionals.  </P> <P> When Toronto made its first contract offer Wednesday, Flener said he was  wavering between turning professional and returning to Fullerton for his senior  season. But the team came back Friday with a bonus that was about double the  original offer, Flener said, making his decision easier.  </P> <P> "I don't want to go into detail, but they came back with something  substantially higher than the first offer," Flener said. "The first offer  wasn't close to what I thought it would be, but I'm happy with this."  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell lost another player when Donnie Harrel,  a power-hitting catcher/infielder from Taft College who had signed a letter of  intent with the Titans, signed with the Kansas City Royals.  </P> <P> The Titans are also in danger of losing John Ingram, a left-handed pitcher from  Harbor College who was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the fourth  round.  </P> <P> "We've talked, but he hasn't made his decision," Cochell said.  </P> <P> However, Jason Hutchins, a right-handed pitcher from Golden West College who  was drafted by the Royals, has informed Cochell that he will attend Fullerton.  </P> <P> Last year, Cochell lost four outstanding players, Jason Friedman (Cypress  College), Mark Loeb (San Bernardino Valley College), Craig Paquette (Golden  West) and Mark Charbonnet (Gahr High School), to the professional draft before  they played for the Titans.  </P> <P> Cochell is still awaiting word from junior second baseman Mate Borgogno and  junior shortstop Kevin Farlow, who were drafted by the San Francisco Giants and  San Diego Padres, respectively. Both are expected to make their decisions by  Monday.  </P> <P> Junior center fielder Domingo Mota was picked by the Dodgers in the 29th round  but is expected to return to Fullerton. Junior designated hitter/catcher Frank  Charles, who as of Friday hadn't heard from a professional team, said he will  return to Fullerton for his senior season.  </P> <P> Cochell said junior catcher Matt Hattabaugh had not been contacted about the  draft by Friday, but Cochell isn't sure if Hattabaugh will attempt to sign with  a team as a free agent or return to Fullerton.  </P> <P> Three more community college players were drafted.  </P> <P> Infielder Doug McConathy of Cypress was taken by Baltimore, pitcher Jay Hassell  of Rancho Santiago was taken by the Angels and outfielder Steve Grack was  picked by San Diego. Rounds they were chosen in were not disclosed.  </P></p>

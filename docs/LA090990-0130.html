			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEW RULING LIFTS VEIL OF SECRECY IN CIVIL CASES;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: CONTENDING PRIVATE ACCORDS WERE KEEPING 'DAMAGING INFORMATION' FROM  THE PUBLIC, THE SAN DIEGO SUPERIOR COURT IS IN THE FOREFRONT OF A NATIONWIDE  MOVEMENT WITH ITS ACTION.  </P> <P> When James and Patricia Miller went public with the news that the Ford Motor  Co. was paying them $6 million to settle a lawsuit, their disclosure was the  exception rather than the rule.  </P> <P> Ford had wanted to keep secret the terms of the agreement ending the  $23-million suit -- which the Millers had brought in San Diego Superior Court  over a car crash on a country road near Carlsbad.  </P> <P> The Millers, who live in Carlsbad, had agreed to keep quiet -- but only if the  company would notify its customers about what the family claims is a need to  fit the rear seats of Ford autos with shoulder harnesses and lap belts, not  just the belts.  </P> <P> Ford declined, contending that a damage suit settlement was not the way it  wanted to debate seat belt policy -- and so, last April, when the deal was  done, the Millers told all about the $6 million.  </P> <P> The family's action marked a departure from the secrecy that increasingly has  enveloped court cases fought over product and environmental hazards and over  medical malpractice.  </P> <P> In San Diego, however, it no longer is the exception to make public the details  of civil settlements such as the one the Millers negotiated with Ford. It is,  in fact, the rule.  </P> <P> In a first for a California court, the San Diego Superior Court has enacted a  rule that does away with secrecy agreements in most civil cases. It came about  after the court's former presiding judge complained that secrecy agreements  were being used to keep "damaging information" from other victims in all kinds  of cases, but especially those involving hazardous products.  </P> <P> The rule, which took effect July 1, goes well beyond settlements. It includes  the other documents in the court file on the case and any exhibits, too.  </P> <P> Under the rule, a court file can remain secret only after a three-part test  proves that secrecy is "in the public interest," the material contains trade  secrets or other privileged material and disclosure "would cause serious harm."  Everything else remains open.  </P> <P> The court's presiding judge, Judith McConnell, said the rule is likely to be  controversial because it had become so common for lawyers, especially defense  attorneys, to seek confidentiality.  </P> <P> Lawyers had sought to keep secret information that could be damaging. But, just  as routinely, they would seek to stifle material that was just plain  embarrassing. Even they concede there were abuses.  </P> <P> David E. Monahan, a San Diego lawyer, said it got to the point that "you would  wind up with something about as confidential as a laundry ticket being marked,  'Attorneys' Eyes Only.' "  </P> <P> Still, defense attorneys said, there can be legitimate reasons for secrecy.  </P> <P> During a case, a corporation might have a genuine business reason for keeping  material from a rival who is able to peek into the court file, said Wayne  Boehle, a Santa Monica lawyer and president of the Assn. of Southern California  Defense Counsel.  </P> <P> And, when it's over, the company might not want to release the amount of a  settlement for fear it will be inundated by thousands of other lawsuits, only  some of which may have merit, Boehle said. Going to court, if only to file  dismissal papers, takes time and money, and the public already is frustrated  with clogged courts, he said.  </P> <P> "Without further clarification and some indication as to how this (rule) is  going to be utilized, I would hope it does not filter its way up into the Los  Angeles court system," Boehle said.  </P> <P> But, given the San Diego court's reputation for innovation -- it was the first  court in California to experiment with a fast-track system that pushes civil  cases to trial speedily, a plan that since has spread throughout the state --  McConnell said she suspects the rule may be copied.  </P> <P> And, she said, the court's judges, who enacted the rule by themselves and  without outside lobbying, are sure it's the right rule.  </P> <P> "If you're going to use public courts, you have to be willing to expose  yourself to public scrutiny," she said.  </P> <P> That sentiment is the precise motivation behind a movement emerging around the  nation to keep court files open to the public -- despite lawyers' efforts to  the contrary.  </P> <P> In the past few months, Texas passed a court rule and Florida enacted a law  calling for open files. A similar rule is under consideration in New York. And  a Virginia law that took effect in July, 1989, allows attorneys in separate but  similar personal injury cases to share information.  </P> <P> However, in Rhode Island, an open files law that passed the legislature earlier  this summer was vetoed by Gov. Edward D. DiPrete after pressure by a lobbyist  with ties to General Motors and by defense lawyers from around the nation.  </P> <P> The new rules shift control over secrecy from partisan lawyers to impartial  judges -- requiring the judges to grant secrecy only when it is justified under  the rules or as a matter of law.  </P> <P> The fight over secrecy signals that the legal system is "in the throes of  completely changing the perception of a civil lawsuit," according to George  Washington University law professor Mary Cheh.  </P> <P> With the government unwilling or unable to look at harm being caused by unsafe  products or other dangers, lawsuits are replacing consumer protection agencies,  she said.  </P> <P> In an interview last week, Cheh said tension always has been inherent in the  court system, because the courts are publicly funded yet provide a forum for  suits between private parties.  </P> <P> "We never really thought about the implications of that until we realized that  lawsuits sometimes were the only way to vindicate serious harms by large  corporations or other aggregates of power," she said.  </P> <P> Consumers and government regulators might remain unaware of a safety hazard  until it becomes the focus of a high-profile lawsuit, she said. The suit, and  the public attention it sparks, then serves as the vehicle for change, she  said.  </P> <P> But lawsuits bring change, she said, only if the results reach consumers, who  then can shun an offending product; manufacturers, who can opt to stop  producing it; and the government, which can regulate the field.  </P> <P> Texas Supreme Court Justice Lloyd Doggett, the author of the openness rule in  that state, concurs.  </P> <P> "There are a number of cases in which the general public health and safety is  seriously undermined by secrecy," he said, because problems are handled case by  case rather than as an overall problem affecting many people.  </P> <P> According to the Assn. of Trial Lawyers of America, a national organization  that serves plaintiffs' lawyers, the use of secrecy practices in civil cases  has jumped "steadily and significantly" since the mid-1970s. Specific figures  on the number of cases kept secret are not available.  </P> <P> Typically, the secrecy process is initiated by defendants, judges and lawyers  said.  </P> <P> That's because, under the wide-ranging questions that both sides pursue under  court authority in preparing for a trial, called "discovery," a plaintiff can  demand all information that a defendant has about the cause and circumstance of  an injury.  </P> <P> Under a protective order, issued by a judge, a party to a suit is legally  barred from distributing information received from the opposing side to others.  In a 1987 manual produced for defense lawyers, the attorneys were urged to  routinely seek protective orders in all complex products liability cases.  </P> <P> Most civil cases are settled before a trial. Under a confidentiality agreement,  a plaintiff promises, in return for a favorable settlement, to keep quiet.  </P> <P> That paid-for secrecy is often too attractive to pass up for a plaintiff --  especially if the plaintiff is handicapped or elderly or has a fixed income --  or for a cash-strapped plaintiff's lawyer, who probably operates on a  contingency fee.  </P> <P> After commonly waiting two or three years since filing the suit, the choice  then becomes to accept the immediate cash or "wait another year to go to trial  and risk that they may not win," said Michael C. Maher, an Orlando, Fla.,  attorney and the current president of the trial lawyers' group.  </P> <P> "They can't afford that risk. Literally."  </P> <P> But, in the process, the public is denied vital truths on health, safety and  the environment that could protect people from injuries and even death,  plaintiffs' lawyers claim.  </P> <P> According to the trial lawyers' group, secrecy has kept the public and  regulators from learning about such hazards as automobile fuel systems that  could ignite upon impact, exploding cigarette lighters, defective heart valves  and chemical leaks.  </P> <P> Since the Miller settlement with Ford became public knowledge, it has generated  intense press attention over the safety of lap-only rear seat restraints, said  Craig McClellan, the family's San Diego lawyer. His office has collected an  inch-thick collection of newspaper clippings on the case.  </P> <P> The suit stemmed from a 1988 head-on collision that killed one of James  Miller's 11-year-old twin sons and left the other a paraplegic.  </P> <P> Both boys were seated in the rear of the family's 1986 Ford Escort and were  wearing lap belts. The parents, who were seated in the front, wore shoulder  belts and escaped with bruises and broken bones.  </P> <P> "We felt that, if we kept quiet about this that it wouldn't help anybody else  in the future," said James Miller, 45, a pressman.  </P> <P> "It didn't matter how much money they offered," he said. "We weren't going to  keep quiet."  </P> <P> Ford's San Diego lawyers declined to comment on the case or could not be  reached. The company has denied any liability in connection with the accident.  </P> <P> Defense lawyers, meanwhile, claim that an avalanche of additional suits is not  the sole product of widespread publicity about settlements.  </P> <P> They said that widespread publicity about settlements can make it more  difficult for any company to obtain a fair jury in a future case. And, they  said, a settlement in one case may mistakenly indicate the value of claims in  another case.  </P> <P> In addition, defense lawyers said, some plaintiffs' lawyers are too interested  in publicity for themselves and distort the nature of cases and reasons for a  settlement.  </P> <P> "The question is whether it's the public's right to know or a special interest  group wanting to be able to get information for litigation in subsequent cases,  whether that's an overriding interest," said Edward D. Chapin, a San Diego  defense lawyer.  </P> <P> Judge Michael I. Greer, the former presiding judge of the San Diego Superior  Court, said that the defense concerns have validity. But, he said, the San  Diego rule came about at his urging after he "became acutely aware of the  widespread abuse" of secrecy practices.  </P> <P> In a memorandum he sent last December to the court's approximately 70 other  judges, Greer said confidentiality agreements and protective orders were "being  used to conceal damaging information from potential plaintiffs in a wide  variety of cases."  </P> <P> "Suppose I have a case against XYZ Products Co.," Greer said in an interview.  "XYZ answers (questions in the case), but the court says those answers can be  used only for this lawsuit and may not be passed onto other lawyers, just  because XYZ contends they're trade secrets.  </P> <P> "But we've got 200 other lawsuits against XYZ in the court. Are we going to go  through that 200 times?"  </P> <P> McConnell, the current presiding judge, said the new rule still allows for some  secrecy. Tax returns in domestic cases, psychological evaluations in custody  cases and cases that the law keeps confidential -- such as juvenile and  adoption cases -- will remain secret, she said.  </P> <P> The rule does not define when or how secrecy is "in the public interest."  </P> <P> Defense attorneys said judges' busy calendars might prove the ultimate flaw  with the San Diego rule.  </P> <P> "If the court is confronted with issuing an order permitting a confidential  agreement or running some risk of not settling the case, I guarantee you the  judge is going to issue the order permitting the agreement and settling the  case," said Douglas M. Butz, president of the San Diego Defense Lawyers, a  defense bar group.  </P> <P> Michael I. Neil, a San Diego attorney and a past president of the Assn. of  Southern California Defense Counsel, the nation's largest group of insurance  defense lawyers with about 2,300 members, said he thinks the rule may be a  mistake.  </P> <P> "I'm not so sure that's in the best interest of the litigation process," he  said. "Courts are inundated with suits right now. I think we ought to be doing  everything we can to encourage settlements. If that proves to discourage  settlements, it's not in the best interest in my opinion of the judicial system  or taxpayers."  </P> <P> Still, Butz said, "I don't envision any massive uprising in response to this  rule."  </P> <P> Cheh, the law professor, said she could envision several ways for inventive  lawyers to get around the rule.  </P> <P> The case could be brought in any other county in California but San Diego, she  said.  </P> <P> Or settlements could be reached before the case ever makes it to the courthouse  door, she said.  </P> <P> Or, she said, a case could be taken out of the mainstream court system and into  the increasingly popular rent-a-judge market, where the two sides agree to have  it heard by a private judge.  </P> <P> Or, since the whole point of having a settlement agreement signed by a judge is  to make it enforceable as a court judgment, defense lawyers could simply insist  that the judge never sign off on the deal -- a likely prospect if a check is  presented with the proposition.  </P> <P> McConnell even conceded that there are ways around the rule.  </P> <P> "It's one of those things that, if a party clearly wants to keep a settlement  confidential, they can do it," she said. "It doesn't take a great deal of  intelligence to figure out."  </P> <P> But, she said, "We are going to take them one case at a time." She added, "And  the courts are supposed to be open to the public unless there's some reason to  be closed."  </P></p>

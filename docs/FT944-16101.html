			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (6): Environment has been transformed - Three Geneva-based institutions produce 96% of all published standards There are more than 200 organisations in the world writing international standards - but over 96 per cent of all published standards come from three Geneva-based institutions, the International Organisation for Standardisation (Iso), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). In broad terms, the ITU, a United Nations specialised agency, handles telecommunications and broadcasting; the IEC deals with the electrotechnical sector including electronics; and Iso tackles everything else. Iso's catalogue of more than 9,400 technical standards ranges from paper sizes and film speeds to the thickness of machine-readable plastic cards and the symbols on car dashboards. Increasingly, however, the three work together on new technologies such as multimedia for which the traditional demarcations make no sense. Unlike the ITU, Iso and the IEC are independent non-governmental organisations; Iso groups 107 national standards bodies while IEC's 49 members are national committees representing private and public sector interests. Their standards are voluntary: the need for a particular standard is identified by members, the details are worked out between them on the basis of consensus and there is no compulsion on industry to adopt the standard once published. However, the pressures of regional economic integration and global interdependence are increasingly making the use of international standards essential for doing business. These pressures, and rapid technological change, have transformed the environment in which Iso and the IEC operate. Some countries have simply abandoned writing new national standards and gone straight for international ones. The European Union's standards organisations now work in close co-operation with Iso and the IEC. More than 90 per cent of standards published by Cenelec (the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation) are based on international standards. For CEN (the European Committee for Standardisation) the figure is more than 40 per cent. Interest in standards has also been reinforced by provisions in the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. New rules on lowering technical barriers to trade call on Gatt's 120-plus members to use international standards where possible and take an active part in international standard-setting. Growing demand for international standards has required a restructuring of operations to handle a greater through-put of standards and cut delivery times. At the same time, Iso and the IEC have had to rethink their role in standard-setting. In the past, they acted mainly as co-ordinators of initiatives from national standards bodies. Now, they are being called upon to lead from the front in identifying where international standards are needed and what form they should take. Industry is demanding standards that are market-related, cost-effective and timely. Providing these is no easy task. Iso and the IEC have always relied on their members to do most of the work in developing standards, with the central organisation co-ordinating their activities and publishing the results. Iso, with 157 headquarters staff, has some 2,800 technical groups on the go involving about 30,000 people in any one year. The IEC's 100-odd staff keep tabs on about 1,000 technical bodies involving up to 20,000 people. Measures to streamline this highly decentralised system, including greater use of information technology, have succeeded in producing more standards faster. The IEC and Iso have doubled their output of standards since 1988; the IEC produced nearly 400 new and revised standards last year, Iso 764. Mr Lawrence Eicher, Iso secretary-general, reckons that production levels of standards and services 'could easily increase by 30 to 50 per cent by the end of 1996'. Simultaneously, the IEC has reduced average development time from more than 80 months five years ago to less than 30 months in the first half of 1994. Since 1988, Iso has cut 2 1/2 years off delivery times to 54 months in 1992, while the number of technical pages produced has risen by 20 per cent a year. Nevertheless, the average remains well above Iso's goal of 'three years start-to-finish'. The type of standard being demanded has also changed. Attention has increasingly focused on the environment, quality management systems, services, multimedia and emerging technologies more generally. There is a growing emphasis on performance-based and cross-product 'horizontal' standards rather than conventional standards based on design specifications. In the information technology sector, for example, standards have focused on ensuring compatibility of interfaces and performance requirements, leaving companies free to develop competing devices and systems within those parameters. The IEC has also established a specialised group on future technologies to try to keep abreast of developments and anticipate the need for standards, including standards for systems rather than individual products. New areas being eyed by Iso include developing standards for services, especially consumer services such as tourism - for example, a common star system for rating hotels. Other potential areas for international standardisation include data protection and privacy, financial transfers and credit reporting. Among 'horizontal' standards, by far the best known is Iso's astonishingly successful Iso 9000 series of quality management standards, used by thousands of businesses in more than 70 countries. Following that success, Iso has set up a new technical committee to develop environmental management standards and another on requirements for health care products. The IEC has a group looking at ways of integrating environmental considerations into product standards on a life cycle basis, from design to disposal. It also has standards on electrical product safety that cover all types of electrical equipment. Another potential growth area for both organisations concerns assessment of conformity with international standards. One of the biggest applications will be in quality management where Iso and the IEC are developing a joint voluntary scheme known as QSAR (Quality System Assessment Recognition) 'for worldwide recognition of Iso 9000 quality management system registrations'. The aim is to ensure that a certificate granted in one country will be acceptable worldwide, avoiding a situation where companies are obliged to undergo multiple costly audits to satisfy customers in different countries. The IEC already runs two separate certification schemes, one on the safety of electrical equipment and one for electronic components. It also plans to introduce a certification scheme for hazardous-area electrical equipment.</p>

Bolat Ahmadgaliyev, from the  Kazakh president's office, spoke about this to journalists. It  is known that after the breakdown of the former [Soviet] Union  the leaders of the Central Asian republics took a number of  steps to begin cooperation in the economic field and in many  other fields. The difficulties of transferring to a market  economy, leaving the problems of monetary unity in the republics  untackled, the breakdown of economic ties, and other reasons  hindered the process of economic cooperation between the Central  Asian republics from fully forging ahead.    The situation has now changed. The problems in the process  of development are now clear. If Uzbekistan is to introduce its  own national currency in July then another possibility will be  found. The cooperation now taking shape between the republics of  Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan must be expanded. The  meetings between the leaders of the three republics have started  to show results, particularly in the economic field.    At their scheduled summit meeting the presidents of the  three  countries will examine the possibilities of expanding  cooperation in the agro-industrial field and providing for  capital and labor forces.</p>

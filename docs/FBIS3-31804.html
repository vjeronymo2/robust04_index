It was announced  on 20 February that [Defense Minister] Lajos Fur had been  elected party chairman. At the end of the National Meeting, Fur  said in his closing speech that the competition will be decided  between the left-wing bloc and national Christian forces. What  is at stake is nothing other than whether the development of  democracy will continue. He warned that the left-wing danger  must not be underestimated. We asked various politicians to  comment on this issue.    For the Social Democratic Party of Hungary [MSZDP], General  Secretary Istvan Podkoniczky said that they do not consider this  fear justified because, in their view, a left-wing bloc does not  exist. Although, he immediately added, in balanced politics,  the left wing has a role in the same way as the right wing does.  It is quite certain that "the continuation of pure democracy"  is not possible without social justice, solidarity, and equality  of opportunity. Social and even economic difficulties can be  increased if these three important elements are ignored.  Regarding the emphatic section of the MDF's election program  urging the preservation and improvement of public security, the  MSZDP's view is that crime can be reduced mainly through social  measures rather than with a strong police.    Left and right wings are obsolete notions, as people do not  divide themselves into sides; the Independent Smallholders Party  [FKGP] does not think in these terms, either: It wishes to be  the party of the Hungarian people, a modern European people's  party, Mrs. Agnes G. Nagy, deputy chairman of the party, said at  a news conference in Kaposvar, where Somogy county's Smallholder  candidates were introduced.    According to Tamas Deutsch, deputy chairman of the  Federation  of Young Democrats [Fidesz], Lajos Fur's statement that the  elections will be decided between the left-wing bloc and  national Christian forces only indicates that the MDF's new  chairman values his party's election chances highly. In the  Fidesz's view, the MDF and the current coalition will obtain  less support at the elections than in 1990. However, it is far  from true that only the current coalition can call itself a  national force because it is difficult to dispute that other  parties, including the Fidesz, are nationally committed.    According to Zoltan Gal, parliamentary group leader of the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], the speeches at the MDF's  National Meeting indicate that a right-wing populist is the  party's new chairman, while, in this peculiar division of labor,  Prime Minister Peter Boross strengthens the MDF's pragmatic  image. The National Meeting confirmed the MSZP's expectations:  The MDF cannot boast about its performance over the past four  years, and so it is trying to push the problems of the present  into the past and to blend the MSZP with the past, the former  interior minister thought.    Bela Csepe, parliamentary group leader of the Christian  Democratic People's Party [KDNP], said that the parliamentary  group had sent a greetings telegram to Lajos Fur on the occasion  of his election. This greeting indicates that the parliamentary  group does not consider the functions of MDF chairman and  defense minister irreconcilable. (In an MTI statement on 20  February, KDNP Deputy Chairman Laszlo Varga said that at a time  when it is completely uncertain how the south Slav events will  end, the same person cannot hold the positions of party chairman  and defense minister.)    According to Attila Karoly Soos, deputy of the Alliance of  Free Democrats [SZDSZ], Lajos Fur is dreaming if he thinks that  only the left wing can be the opponent of the current right-wing  parties. A strong liberal center is also present on the  political scene and this group will also have a say in forming  the next government coalition.    Pal Dragon, deputy of the United Smallholders Party, said  that he agrees with Lajos Fur's statement. In his view, this  coalition has managed to lay the foundations of a democracy that  is able to function. With this, the Hungarian Government has  achieved a unique performance in Europe that no one else can  boast about. "I am proud that the United Smallholders Party,  the former Group of 36, has preserved its original principles  and fought throughout the four years together with the MDF."</p>

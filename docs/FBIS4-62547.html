			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Historical Sciences Irina Zhinkina, </F> member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of the  United States of America and Canada: "The Aim of the  Maneuvering over the ABM Treaty"]    [Text] The Clinton administration is making increasingly  strenuous efforts to have the provisions of the 1972 ABM Treaty  reviewed. The intensive hearings on this problem that are being  held in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee provide evidence  of the fact. Recently, for example, it examined once more the  White House's proposals to lift the restrictions on the number  of ABM systems capable of destroying missiles with an  operational range of up to 2,000 miles.    In this connection it should be noted that a law on ABM  defense went into force in the United States back in December  1991. It incorporated the old approaches of strategic nuclear  deterrence and new ones which reflect the trend toward the  regionalization of U.S. military policy. The law obliged the  defense secretary to step up the development of theater ABM  systems with a view to the subsequent selection of the most  promising options for deployment in the mid-nineties, using cost  and efficiency as the criteria.    The law also talks about the creation of ABM systems to  protect the country's territory against limited ICBM strikes,  including those resulting from accidental and unauthorized  launches, as well as missile attacks from Third World countries.  It should be noted in this context that under the 1972 ABM  Treaty both the USSR and the United States are allowed to have  only one ABM complex each -- around Moscow and at the Grand  Forks air base respectively. Nevertheless, the U.S. ABM law  envisages the modernization of the complex at that air base as  an initial step in the deployment of an all-embracing ABM system  for the continental United States in the near future. But that  is nothing less than a clear departure from the 1972 Treaty.  The Clinton administration has not only confirmed its readiness  to implement these amended Reagan plans but even, by all  accounts, intends going further in that direction.    Thus the law leads one to conclude that the United States is  trying to split ABM defense into two parts and "separate"  strategic ABM defense from theater ABM defense. It is doing  this, on the one hand, to retain greater freedom in case Russia  insists on the precise observance of the 1972 Treaty and returns  to the old principle of the comprehensive examination of  offensive and defensive arms. On the other hand, some of the  strategic tasks formerly assigned to strategic nuclear arms are  being "reassigned" to nonnuclear systems, which will then be  dispersed and stationed where possible outside U.S. territory.  And finally, while continuing the program of creating an ABM  defense system in this new interpretation, the United States  retains the lead in the sphere of the latest military  technologies.    But why did the idea of ABM deployment not disappear into  the  past along with the end of the Cold War? The threat of  communism seemed to have been "dispelled." Russia and China are  taking the path of market reforms and the democratization of  society, and the main U.S. adversary -- the USSR -- has  disintegrated. Treaties on unprecedented reductions of  strategic offensive arms have been signed. The 1994 accord on  the mutual non-targeting of nuclear weapons against  installations in the United States, Britain, and the CIS is  being implemented. The nuclear weapons remaining outside  Russia's territory are gradually being dismantled and there are  prospects of further progress in this direction. Thus the issue  is not solely one of communism and the "Soviet threat."    For the United States one problem now is how to maintain  and expand its sphere of influence in the world and how to  ensure the further promotion of U.S. interests and capital in  the absence of the old consolidating factor -- the threat to the  West from the communist camp. It is no coincidence that, with  the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact and the USSR, U.S. experts  began trying to foist on world public opinion a new "scare" to  the effect that Moscow could not control its own missiles and  nuclear weapons and that they would now be sold off and  proliferate around the world.    Of course, it may be conceded that these fears are to a  certain extent justified. But that problem could have been  settled in the process of bilateral relations without a  clamorous worldwide propaganda campaign. You cannot help  suspecting that this campaign has been undertaken for the  purpose of preparing public opinion for the possible deployment  of new U.S. arms systems, including theater ABM defense. In any  event the Pentagon is already modernizing the ground-launched  Patriot missile and the sea-launched Aegis missile right now for  use against short-range missiles. Work is also in progress to  create an ABM complex to destroy high-altitude targets or THAAD,  as it is known.    A quite specific question arises here: In that event, what  is Russia supposed to do? It must be stressed here that,  whereas previously the USSR was still able to link the ABM  problem to the question of reducing strategic offensive arms,  Russia no longer has that ability now. In 1989, first E.  Shevardnadze at the meeting in Wyoming and then M. Gorbachev in  Malta agreed, under pressure from the Americans, to abandon the  comprehensive examination of the problem of strategic offensive  weapons and ABM defense. Admittedly, in the event of a  full-scale American deployment of a strategic ABM defense system  we can announce our withdrawal from the START treaties. But  from the military viewpoint that will probably be too late, and  from the political viewpoint it will not be very productive.    It may also be assumed that the United States will try to  share the blame for breaching the ABM Treaty with Russia by  offering it some participation in its own program, with  appropriate rewards. Such attempts are already being made.  However, let us not flatter ourselves about the results.  Suffice it to recall how the United States treated the British  at the dawn of the nuclear era: The Americans made use of their  interim achievements in the creation of nuclear arms and then  broke their promise to share the end results of that work.    Nevertheless, it would be wrong to think that Russian policy  is ready to let the ABM question slide. Our country is  conducting a fairly intensive negotiation process with the  United States in which it is upholding the inviolability of the  1972 ABM Treaty. Its position is also based on the opinion of  those American politicians and specialists who believe that the  revision of that treaty's provisions could undermine the  international efforts to ensure the nonproliferation of  especially dangerous types of armaments.    As for theater ABM defense, this problem must be resolved in  two areas, in my view. One is to work with the United States to  define the criteria for this type of armament and formulate them  in, for instance, an additional protocol to the ABM Treaty. The  other is to discuss at international level the possible  consequences of the deployment of new U.S. regional weapons  systems, including theater ABM defense. It probably makes sense  to propose holding talks on these problems with those countries  on whose territory they might appear first. Efforts must be  made to prevent the emergence of new ABM systems -- which would  undoubtedly provoke countries to create arms capable of  overcoming them. In practice this will lead to a new round of  the arms race.</p>

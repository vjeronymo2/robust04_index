			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id </F> al-Shahhaf's Statement on Iraqi Television on 15 March 1994;  "al-Shahhaf: Resolution 706 Contains Traps and Snares To Shackle  Iraq and To Continue Imposing the Blockade; There Is a  Treacherous Game in Applying the Resolution Aimed at Avoiding  Fulfillment of Obligations"]    [Excerpts] Iraqi Television last night carried an interview  with Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Shahhaf in which he  reviewed the provisions of the resolutions that were issued the  UN Security Council, Iraq's positions on them, and the lack od  any justifications for these resolutions now that Iraq has  fulfilled its obligations.    The Minister remarked that this subject needs to be  explained  and clarified in detail in view of the conspiracies and intrigue  that the enemies of Iraq and Arabdom have woven around it.  [passage omitted]    The minister said: The key point of Resolution (687), to  which the leader president referred in his speech, is Section  (C). This section includes Paragraphs (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and  13). Paragraph (14) is an explanation saying if Paragraphs 7-13  are applied successfully to Iraq, it would be the beginning of  their application to the entire Middle East to turn it into a  zone free of weapons of mass destruction. They have not yet  done anything on this score.    The minister said: Regarding Section (C), which includes the  paragraphs I just mentioned, they said: We know that you Iraqis  have weapons of mass destruction. These weapons exist in the  following fields: the nuclear field, the chemical field, the  biological field, and the delivery systems field; that is  missiles. They also said: We have Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,  12, and 13 to apply and we will set up a UN Special Commission  for that. There is also the International Agency for Atomic  Energy, which specializes in these matters. The Special  Commission and the agency have been instructed to work out a  plan with you. You will tell them the weapons and missiles you  have. Teams from the Special Commission and the agency will  come to inspect them, and the existing arsenal will be  destroyed. We will inspect the sites where you manufactured and  installed the machines and plants which produce these weapons.  We will remove parts of these machines so that they would no  longer be able to produce chemical weapons or missiles with a  range of more than 150 km.    The minister added: They wanted us to reveal all that we had  and to destroy it. They wanted us to destroy the weapons, which  were banned under the provisions of this resolution, and also  the machines and factories connected with their production.  Once these steps were taken, Iraq would have nothing left and  would be in no position to produce anything.    The minister said: They said: But in order to make sure that  you Iraqis -- and we know you are a clever and dynamic people --  will not go back to producing these weapons, we will set up a  future monitoring system. They mentioned in Section (C) of  Resolution (687) that the monitoring system would last for one  year.    The minister said: Since they accepted the resolution, one  would presume that based their acceptance on the principles of  law, international relations, and the UN Charter, meaning,  first, that whatever they requested under Section (C) would not  prejudice Iraq's national sovereignty and independence, its  ability for development, and its right to self-determination,  which are basic for any society and country. We presumed that  our dealing began on the basis of the provisions and principles  I mentioned.    The minister added: We have been following Section (C) since  the cease-fire in 1991. The leader president said: Tell us  what you want so we can sit together, discuss it, and destroy  some machines and plants to make them unserviceable. And in  order to reassure everyone we will also set up a monitoring  system. This has been going on since 1991. We did more than we  promised. For the sake of precision and to prove to our people,  I will mention some of the documents which we deposited with the  United Nations and which are now considered documents of the  Security Council. They asked us to begin with the nuclear field  first, and we did. They said we want Iraq to announce its  commitment to the Nonproliferation Treaty, we said: Fine, we  have the following: six letters which were sent by the foreign  minister containing Iraq's adherence to the Treaty on the  Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 16 messages and statements  confirming that Iraq does not possess nuclear weapons and that  it does not produce these weapons or any substance that goes  into their production, 62 letters containing Iraqi declarations  on nuclear positions, and 23 nuclear teams. Then they said:  Tell us about the components of the Iraqi nuclear program. We  told them what we had: 547 tonnes of natural uranium [yuraniyum  tabi'i] and 50 kgs of highly enriched fuel. They took them and  transported them outside Iraq. We said also that we had 1,850  kgs of a fairly enriched uranium, 6 kgs of plutonium for  scientific research, and 6 tonnes of uranium waste. That was  all.    They carried out a thorough inspection. Then, they said: We  want to know the stages of your nuclear program. So, we told  them that our stages are as follows: Extraction of uranium from  ore and its transformation into uranium compounds. We have  electromagnetics, chemicals, and central [word indistinct]. All  this is for research. We also process fuels. This framework,  as you can see, is very normal. We have nuclear reactors we  bought from you. We have an electro-nuclear power project,  plants to retrieve depleted (wasted) nuclear fuel, and a plant  for the treatment of radioactive waste. We have scientific  research efforts that are connected to the program. Our  position is the same as that of any other nation or state that  is conducting research. It is all scientific research for use  in medicine and agriculture, as part of the development  programs. Finally, we have agricultural and medical  applications, to which we have already referred. Of course, we  have a nuclear safety system, nuclear safety measures, and the  engineering support for them.    The minister said: They saw and thoroughly inspected what we  had. Talks with [UN chief inspector] Ekeus began in July 1993.  They continued in September, October, and November of that year,  and in New York, as well. In his capacity as the representative  of the International Agency for Atomic Energy, he wrote -- we  have the document because it is a now Security Council document  -- saying: There are no more secrets in the Iraqi program. Iraq  has approved Resolution 715 concerning permanent monitoring. We  believe Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations.    The minister said: Regarding the chemical field, we followed  the same line. We told them what we have. I will mention some  figures, because we have them in our records and they are also  documented with the Security Council.    The minister continued: Some 12 large chemical inspection  teams came, under Paragraph 9 of Section C, to see the records,  visit the sites, and obtain samples. We detailed our stockpile:  10,780 pieces of missile hardware ['atad sawarikh] for 122-mm  missiles, 1,776 shells [qanbarah], 12,634 artillery shells, 30  al-Husayn missile warheads and 2,000 mortar shells. We said you  can visit the sites where this hardware is produced, and the  development laboratories, as well. They inspected them. Then  they asked: Where are the simple materials [al-mawad  al-basitah]? We told them that the stockpile of active  materials [al-mawad al-'awamil] is 280 tonnes, and the simple  materials stockpile is 75 tonnes. They asked to see the  canisters. We told them here are 45,000 canisters for 122-mm  missiles and 5,000 shells for 250-mm missiles, and here are the  24,000 that were destroyed in the bombing. They were all  destroyed in the bombing. They saw it all, including the scrap  metal. Then, they began inspecting. Later, they said: We want  to see the documents.    The minister added: We gave them the nuclear documents,  which totaled more than 60,000 pages. Then they asked for the  documents on chemical weapons. We told them they were destroyed  in the bombing. Then they told us: We want you to remember  everything and write it down on paper. Iraqi experts exerted  great efforts and wrote down everything in order to eliminate  any excuse. Ekeus wrote on a piece of paper: I find this to be  satisfactory, meeting all requirements. Ekeus then heard the  statements by the official in charge of the Iraqi and Gulf  Section in the U.S. State Department and by the U.S. National  Security Council adviser. He became suspicious after hearing  these statements, although we had a signed document between us  in which he said that what he saw was satisfactory and met all  requirements.    When he heard those people speaking in this way, he decided  that he wanted more information and that what we had given him  was not enough. Some 12 large chemical teams came. They left  nothing unearthed. They analyzed water and soil. They carried  out air inspections. They were very provocative, but the Iraqis  restrained themselves and remained very patient. The behavior  of the others was really bad and provocative.    The minister said: Iraq did not have anything in the  biological field. Actually, what we had was just scientific  research. We did not have any secrets. The so-called  reinforced microbes [mikrubat mujahhadah] were purchased from  the United States for purely scientific research, not for  biochemical weapons. Several experts came and saw them. Then  they said: We want to see the laboratories, even in those in  Iraqi universities. They also asked if there were any private  sector laboratories.    Regarding the missiles, we told them: This is what we have.  Here are the al-Husayn missiles. Here are the Scuds we got from  the Russians. We gave them details. During this period, they  brought in 21 teams, if not more, consisting of missile  specialists.    The minister said: The United States continued to play the  same tune, i.e., that Iraq hid some missiles. So, they launched  a new search campaign. I call it a search campaign, not an  inspection campaign. They brought in helicopters and gamma ray  spectrometers to discover what Iraq might have hidden  underground. They then toured the country. They stayed for  several weeks. The American lie was exposed.    The minister added: Finally, they asked for the records  about the disposal of missiles. We gave them the records. Then  they said: We want to see if these documents are original or  recent. They brought in a team to inspect the documents. Then  they said: The documents are original, but we will take them to  Europe for further inspection by more sensitive instruments,  although we are sure they are original. We will take them to  inspect them. We patiently said: Take them. Then we said:  Fine, we have covered all fields under Paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10,  11, 12, and 13 of Section C. Nothing has been left uninspected.    I will now mention how far they have gone in their behavior.  They said: We want to go to the southern marshlands, because we  received information about possible leftover chemical weapons  that were used there. We said: This is very ridiculous. They  said: Still, we must go. We took them to the south. They wore  protective suits against chemical weapons. They were flat on  the ground while helicopters hovered over their heads. They  located an object stuck into ground. They walked over  cautiously, tied a rope round it, fearing it might explode.  When they pulled it out it turned out to be used mortar shell.  I still remember how some of them shook their heads shamefully,  and others said: These people -- meaning the Americans -- are  making a mockery of us.    The minister said: We knew right from the start that it was  an intentional thing. This was one of hundreds, if not  thousands, of examples that Iraqis have patiently endured since  1991.    The minister added: You may not have heard some of the  remarks made about the Ministry of Agriculture, which turned out  to be theatrical, since they did not find any of the things they  claimed were inside the Ministry. Actually, there was nothing  in the Ministry. But since they had nothing to say, they wrote  in their report: We found in one of the rooms "a scratch" on a  wall caused by a chair. Apparently, the employee using this  particular chair placed it against the wall, causing the  scratch. They said in the report: We saw the chair but its  back was not as high as the scratch. So, it was not the chair  that caused scratch. This means the chair that made the scratch  was replaced. They included that in the report as evidence.  The report was referred to the UN Security Council. You know  how tense relations were with the Security Council, which wanted  any justification in order to deceive the world about the  aggressive threats being made by peoples' hangmen.    The minister said: As you can see, I am only citing examples  and completely avoiding any personal comment. I dealt with this  person, Ekeus, right from the start. I recall that during our  meeting together during his last visit here in February 1994, we  asked him certain specific questions. I asked him: Why this  delay? What more is asked of us? We explained what we have.  You also know what we destroyed. I also gave you figures.  Then they said they wanted whatever we mentioned in writing.  They said: Actually, we saw the destroyed ammunition, and the  picture you presented to us was clear, but please remember  everything and put it down in writing. They wanted us to sit  down, remember everything, and commit it to writing. We had to  think and remember what happened in a certain month or a certain  year, what empty shell, magazine, or simple weapon was used, and  for what purpose.    The minister said: Iraqi technicians sat down and very  patiently searched their brains so as to eliminate any excuse.  They produced a full record for Ekeus. He was astonished by  the results. He said: What you have written down from memory is  sufficient and meets the purpose. We recorded it in our joint  minutes. But the Western henchmen said it was not enough. We  could not accept their haphazard remarks. We told Ekeus: Sit  down. You said the record was sufficient and met the purpose.  Therefore, this change in attitude is politically motivated in  order to prolong the blockade of Iraq. Some Western henchmen  say this is not enough. To be honest, most members in the  Security Council are against the extension of the blockade on  Iraq, because they have begun to see the irrefutable facts. But  the Americans are known for influencing and blackmailing others,  and Ekeus knows that. During the last meeting in February  regarding the monitoring, Gart [name as transliterated] produced  a chart and reminded me of Resolution 706, which provides for  exporting oil worth $1.6 billion. The world knows only that oil  is to be exported. But it does not know the traps and snares  inherent in this resolution designed to shackle Iraq. All these  traps and snares are actually intended to make us approve the  monitoring system details.    The minister said: Fine, you have worked out everything.  Ekeus said: Well, I cannot say that. I said: Fine, why don't  you find out? You have the Special Commission and the  experience. You have used everything, including espionage  aircraft. And now you say you do not know anything. How can  that be? He said: We do not have the capability. I said:  Fine, when the Americans wanted to support Iranian claims that  Iraq used chemical weapons in the Gulf, you made a big uproar.  A working team was immediately dispatched to the south. Fine,  let us talk about monitoring. Iraq and its people have been  very patient with you since 1991. Yet, you now say that you do  not have the capability. This is unacceptable. We ask you, in  fact, it is our right -- or, to be more precise, it is our  minimum right -- to work out a timetable to apply to what  remains, if you have something new to be monitored. Practically  speaking, the monitoring began in December 1993, it is in  progress, and the inspection cameras have been mounted at  missile sites and nuclear establishments. The inspection teams  also continue to operate in the factories. They even marked  some machines with tape, saying they must not be used. Ekeus  came to us saying: There are machines in some factories that  must not be used until the monitoring system has been installed.  So, he produced some tape and stuck it on the machines,  although they are ordinary commercial machines that the Iraqi  could have used for months. Tape was stuck on machines, cameras  were installed in two places, to inspect missile engines and in  the nuclear sector. Iraqi laboratories are under inspection and  all the monitoring measures have been taken, yet Ekeus comes and  says: But our capabilities are limited. This is an obvious  lie. Its purpose is to waste time and to continue the blockade  of the Iraqi people. We told Ekeus in February: This is our  minimum right. We have been patient with you until now.    The minister said: We said let us work out a timetable. He  evaded the subject. We pressed him. We held three meetings  that continued for hours. But he prevaricated like a fox in the  forest, as the leader president said. He said: We must have a  protocol, or a record, for each factory specifying the type of  monitoring being conducted in it. We should also set up logs.  Although this was completely unacceptable, we told him: Let it  be, although we are not 100-percent convinced that you have the  capability. We know what your capabilities are. We know what  the Americans have placed at your disposal. We ask you: How  many Iraqi engineers and experts do you want? Two hundred?  Take 200. They will help you accomplish your work quickly,  according to this timetable. As far as we are concerned, we  believe monitoring began in December 1993. Ekeus said: If I  agreed to that, they would say I was cooperating with the  Iraqis. What a weak excuse! So, he completely avoided  committing himself to a timetable, which is our minimum right.

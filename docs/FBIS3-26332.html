The full text of the speech  is as follows:    Ladies, gentlemen, friends, and comrades:    Thw Number 1 generator set of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power  Plant officially started its commercial operation on 1 February  1994. Today, we gladly gather together to celebrate the  completion of Number 1 generator set. First of all, on behalf  of the State Council, I would like to express warm  congratulations and sincere gratitude to the friends of China  Light &amp; Power Co. in Hong Kong who have been sincerely  cooperating for many years, to the domestic and overseas  suppliers and contract undertakers participating in the  construction of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, to the Chinese  and foreign experts and workers working hard day and night on  the construction site, and to all friends and comrades who  supported and cared about this construction project!    The beginning of the commercial operation of Number 1  generator set in the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant indicates that  the nuclear power industry in our country had taken a new step.  The Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant is the first medium-sized  nuclear power plant built in our country on the basis of our own  researches and with our own designs and equipment made in China,  while the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is the first large-sized  nuclear power plant we built by introducing foreign funds and  advanced equipment and technology. The construction of these two  nuclear power plants play an important role in starting our  country's nuclear power industry, training the technical  contingent, and mastering nuclear power technology.    The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is a product of reform and  opening up. In 1979, shortly after our country adopted the  reform and opening up policy, the Ministry of Power Industry and  Guangdong Province worked out the plan for using foreign loans  to build a power plant and then selling electricity to repay  debts by making use of the favorable geographical conditions of  Shenzhen, thus opening up a new road of using foreign funds to  launch a large-scale infrastructural project in our country.  The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is the largest Chinese-foreign  joint venture to be set up in our country recently. A modern  enterprise management system was set up according to  international practice, with the adoption of the general manager  responsibility system under the leadership of the board of  directors. Thus, enterprise operation was separated from  government functions; responsibilities were clearly defined and  assigned; and management was effected scientifically. In the  process of building the nuclear power plant, the competition  mechanism was introduced, and the tender invitation system was  adopted. Thus, the outstanding Chinese and foreign suppliers  and construction enterprises were selected to participate in the  power plant's design, construction, testing, and consulting  services. The valuable point of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power  Plant is not only the introduction of advanced foreign equipment  and technology but also the adoption of the advanced foreign  experience in organizing and managing a construction project,  thus substantially enhancing our own level of modern  construction.    The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is a project always cared  about and supported by the party central leadership and the  State Council. The State Council held many meetings to discuss  and assess this project. In 1985, when the joint venture  contract of Guangdong Nuclear Power Corporation was signed,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping personally received Lord Kadoorie, the  joint venture's Hong Kong-side founder and chairman of China  Light &amp; Power Co., and expressed full affirmation and support  for this new product of reform and opening up. Comrade Jiang  Zemin was also deeply concerned about the nuclear power plant  work and personally came to the site to give instructions. At  crucial junctures, the central leading comrades personally  attended to the project, which helped overcome difficulties in  the process of construction and ensured the smooth development  of the project. The Ministry of Power Industry, the Nuclear  Industrial Corporation, Guangdong Province, and Shenzhen City  also did a great deal of work to create conditions for the  construction of the nuclear power plant, and gave effective  support to the project. The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is  also a product of the policy for giving play to the initiative  of both the central and local authorities. It should be pointed  out that the French company, Famatong [3127 7456 6639], which  supplied the nuclear- island equipment for the Daya Bay Nuclear  Power Plant, the British company, General Power [tong yong dian  qi 6639 3938 7193 3049], which supplied the conventional  generator set, and the French Electric Power Company, which  undertook the contracts of designing and testing the equipment,  carried out effective cooperation with the Chinese design,  construction, and testing institutions in the prolonged process  of construction. We express heartfelt gratitude and respect for  their cooperation.    At present, number one generator set of the Daya Bay  Nuclear Power Plant has been put into commercial operation, and  the testing of number two generator set is going on smoothly.  The whole project is expected to be completed and put into  operation within this year. It is hoped that the Chinese and  foreign suppliers, contract undertakers, and all Chinese and  foreign personnel on the construction side will, as usual,  continue their efforts and continue to make contributions to the  full completion of the nuclear power plant project in good  quality and with high efficiency. We shall not only properly  build such a modern nuclear power plant, but will also properly  manage it. In a certain sense, it is even more difficult to  manage it well than to build it well. Therefore, in the future  operation of the nuclear power plant, the entire personnel must  always carry out the principle of "quality first, safety first,"  and perfectly ensure that electric power is unceasingly  generated and supplied in a safe way and in good quality to  Guangdong Province and the Hong Kong region, thus serving the  economic prosperity in these areas.    Our country has a great demand for electric power, so when  making great effort to develop thermal power and hydropower  generation, we also need to appropriately develop nuclear power  generation in suitable locations. The construction of the Daya  Bay Nuclear Power Plant has provided successful experience for  the development of the nuclear power industry in our country,  and has also trained a large number of nuclear power experts.  At the same time, favorable conditions for the second-phase  project in the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant have also been  created. At present, our nation is further comprehensively  carrying out the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and  is deepening the reforms and expanding opening. Foreign  investment in China also keeps an upward momentum, as the  investment environment is being continuously improved and the  scope of investment is being broadened further. We welcome  foreign companies to participate in our construction projects in  the basic industries and in the field of infrastructural  facilities, and warmly welcome friends from various countries to  further the economic and technical cooperation in the field of  nuclear power generation.    Now, I propose a toast to the completion and commercial  operation of Number 1 generator set of the Daya Bay Nuclear  Power Plant, to the friendly cooperation of Chinese and foreign  constructors, and to our friendship!    Thank you very much!    5 February 1994</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / BCCI liquidation accelerates: High Court order opens worldwide sale of assets to repay creditors THE WORLDWIDE liquidation of Bank of Credit and Commerce International yesterday moved into full swing as the High Court in the UK issued a winding up order against one of the group's two main operating arms. That allows liquidators to begin the process of selling off the group's assets and repaying creditors some of the Dollars 20bn owed. The court order also triggers the UK's deposit protection scheme, by which sterling depositors can claim 75 per cent of their deposits, up to a maximum of Pounds 15,000. A similar winding up order against the other substantial part of the group was expected to be issued later in the day in the Cayman Islands. It also emerged yesterday that BCCI's liquidators hope to conclude a compensation deal with Abu Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholder, by the end of this month. The deal is expected to involve the Gulf emirate in paying the group's depositors between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 4bn. In return, the liquidators would give up certain rights to sue third parties, including Abu Dhabi itself. The High Court in London issued a compulsory winding up order against BCCI SA, the Luxembourg arm of the group which controlled the bank's branches in various countries, including the UK. Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice chancellor, said that the bank was 'plainly and hopelessly insolvent'. Earlier applications for a winding-up order, made by the Bank of England, had been adjourned to allow time for the provisional liquidators, from Touche Ross, to reach an agreement with Abu Dhabi about compensation. In court yesterday, Mr Michael Crystal QC, counsel for Touche Ross, said that the liquidators hoped to conclude a deal by the end of the month. Details would be revealed when the terms are put to the court subsequently for approval. Yesterday's application, brought nearly two weeks after BCCI SA had been put into liquidation in Luxembourg, was not opposed. Hearings in the Cayman Islands and Scotland yesterday, and in the Isle of Man today, had been arranged to coincide with the UK hearing, in order to move the worldwide operations of BCCI into liquidation at the same time. The liquidation of the Luxembourg-registered holding company is not expected until April. The High Court in London granted legal costs to the provisional liquidators, the Bank of England, the depositors' group represented in court and former employees of the bank, to be paid out of money recovered in the liquidation.</p>

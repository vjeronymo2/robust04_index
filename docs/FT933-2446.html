			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Portugal's rally ignited by lower interest rates - Emerging market funds have also been taking a closer look at the equity market After a startling rise from a low of 1,707 in mid-May to a peak of 2,688 on September 10, Lisbon's Bank of Totta &amp; Acores (BTA) share index fell to 2,459 yesterday, as the market continued its correction following its biggest advance since 1987. Analysts are convinced that this downturn will be limited. 'Unless their is a disaster outside the country, the index should remain pretty stable until the end of the year,' says Mr Rodrigo Marques Guimaraes, director of Midas, the independent brokers. The main factor behind Portugal's equity boom has been interest rates, which have fallen considerably more sharply than in the rest of Europe. Prime bank lending rates have fallen from around 20 per cent at the beginning of the year to 13.75 per cent, while the Bank of Portugal's main absorption rate has lost 400-basis points over the same period, falling to 10.8 per cent. 'The fundamentals were all there. We were just waiting for something to ignite the market,' says Mr Joaquim Luiz Gomes, a manager at Midas. 'Interest rates were the spark that lit the fire.' Another key influence has been the growing interest of emerging market funds in Portugal. The country is now included in the IFC index for emerging markets. 'These funds follow the Portuguese market on a continuous basis and have brought in a great amount of liquidity,' says Mr Luiz Gomes. 'Being included in a core index has been a tremendous boost for Portugal. Foreign investors are no longer just moving in and out when the pickings are not so good elsewhere.' Today, Portugal has to be compared with markets such as Turkey, Jordan, Greece and Thailand. And market operators believe that the conditions in Portugal compare very favourably with other emerging markets in terms of the sophistication of the trading system, investor protection, ease of settlement and the availability of information. Another reason for the surge is the medium-term outlook for the economy. 'International organisations like the OECD and the EC are forecasting positive growth for Portugal in 1994 and investors are discounting that growth now,' says Mr Rui Martins dos Santos, chief economist of Banco Portugues de Investimento. Even companies with poor half-year profits are selling well on the basis of this expected growth. But eventually companies will have to deliver. 'Eventually investors will stop focusing on interest rates and start looking at the fundamentals of individual stocks,' says Mr Luiz Gomes, 'that is when they will want to see the better economic environment translate into better earnings.' Mr Martins dos Santos believes that investors are finding Portuguese shares cheap. But he points out that many shares, except in the banking sector, are now overvalued. Domestic investors are also moving strongly back into equities as bonds yields have fallen from 18-20 per cent to around 10 per cent. It is estimated that the value of institutional investment in Portugal is around Esc1,300bn (Dollars 7.9bn), of which 5 per cent is placed in equities. 'Even a one per cent swing of institutional investors towards equities makes a tremendous impact on liquidity,' says Mr Marques Guimaraes. The liquidity of the market is a telling indicator of how it has progressed over the past year. In January, the average daily turnover was Dollars 2-2.5m; today it stands at Dollars 10-15m. From 1989 until the present rally the country suffered from being the worst performing market in Europe. An additional factor is the very low liquidity of some companies. They are so easily manipulated that a rally in the market can increase their price by 100 to 200 per cent almost overnight. Industrial Portugal has clearly out performed the banking sector in the recent boom. If prices have risen some 40 per cent overall, analysts say that the industrial sector has grown about 70 per cent and the financial sector only 30 per cent. This has a lot to do with how foreign investors perceive Portugal. 'Non-resident fund managers tend to see the country as an infrastructure story, with growth based on construction fuelled by huge inflows of EC structural funds,' comments Mr Marques Guimaraes. Investors are more wary of the banking sector, where they fear that falling interest rates will hurt profits and are also worried about a rise in non-performing loans. But market watchers believe that banks have a bright future as investors take profits after the recent boom and begin to rearrange their portfolios. Bank credit will grow as the economy picks up and products new to Portugal, such as mortgage lending and consumer credit, are introduced. Even on a profit decline of 40 per cent, BPI has shown a 17 per cent return on earnings, with inflation at 5.6 per cent. Indicating the reach of the current correction, Soares da Costa, a leading construction company, has already lost some 20 per cent after peaking at Esc4,900 in August, for example. Although it must be taken into account that the share price has doubled since the beginning of the year. Analysts believe there will now be some profit-taking and repositioning of portfolios. 'Investors will be choosing their equities on a more selective basis but the medium- and long-term outlook for the market remains bright,' Mr Luiz Gomes believes.</p>

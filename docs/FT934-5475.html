			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Abu Dhabi firm on BCCI payout The government of Abu Dhabi, majority shareholder in the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, appears to have ruled out any increase in payments it would make to compensate creditors. It yesterday rejected any suggestion that it was preparing to raise its payments as part of a negotiated settlement with the liquidators to the bank. Speculation has surrounded the shape of new proposals since the unexpected decision of the Luxembourg Appeal Court at the end of last month to reject an agreement between Abu Dhabi and the liquidators. Abu Dhabi is believed to have ruled out any increase in its contribution from between Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn) and Dollars 2.2bn, which it would have paid in exchange for a waiver of legal claims against it. It said it was 'considering options to overcome the technical problems thrown up' by the court.</p>

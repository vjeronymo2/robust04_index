			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH OF WRITER EDWARD ABBEY  </P> <P> I was very sad to read in your paper that author Edward Abbey ("Thoreau of the  American West") had died (Part I, March 16). In your detailed obituary, I was  astonished that no mention was made of his book, "The Brave Cowboy."  </P> <P> I came across a paperback edition of this book around 1960, and was deeply  moved. I bought the movie rights and finally persuaded Universal to allow my  company, Bryna, to make the film, which was brilliantly written by Dalton  Trumbo and produced by Eddie Lewis. In the cast with me were Gena Rowlands,  Walter Matthau, and William Shatner, and introducing Carroll O'Connor in a  small role. They all gave marvelous performances.  </P> <P> In the opening scene, I played Jack Burns (Edward Abbey), who rides across a  wide plain and comes up to a large wire fence. I get off my horse, taking a  pair of pliers, cut the fence and ride on. In your article you quote Abbey: "I  am the one who loved un-fenced countries."  </P> <P> I never met Mr. Abbey, but we wrote to each other several times. I apologized  to him that the studio insisted on changing the title of "Brave Cowboy" to  "Lonely Are the Brave."  </P> <P> In the more than 80 films that I've made, this is my favorite. I am very  pleased when I get a letter, or someone comes up to me saying it is also their  favorite.  </P> <P> Hollywood was capable of transferring the feelings of this great  environmentalist to film. People will always be able to see as well as read the  beliefs of this great man in "Lonely Are the Brave."  </P> <P> KIRK DOUGLAS  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

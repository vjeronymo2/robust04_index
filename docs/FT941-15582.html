			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / BAe plans another 580 job cuts British Aerospace plans to cut a further 580 jobs in its Avro regional jet activities at Woodford, near Manchester, to reduce costs and improve competitiveness after the setback in its partnership negotiations with Taiwan. The cuts will reduce the company's regional jet workforce of about 3,000 by nearly 20 per cent. At the peak three years ago there were about 8,000 workers at Woodford and Hatfield, Hertfordshire. BAe has since shut down Hatfield and concentrated regional jet activities - which involve the production of RJ Avroliners and BAe 146s - at Woodford. The company said this had led to savings of about 30 per cent, but it is now seeking to cut costs further after difficulties in negotiating a regional jet joint-venture agreement with Taiwan Aerospace. Talks have now been suspended, although BAe yesterday said it was maintaining a dialogue. The company has held talks with other manufacturers over possible collaboration in the regional jet sector, which is suffering from overcapacity in a depressed market. BAe made a Pounds 750m after-tax provision in its 1992 accounts to cover its loss-making regional jet activities. For the past 12 months it has tried to reach a joint-venture agreement with Taiwan to secure the future of its regional jet operations. The company told unions before Christmas that in spite of the suspension of talks it intended to pursue its regional jet activities on its own as a result of the productivity gains and cost savings from concentration of production. But the latest job cuts suggests the company is having to intensify its drive to cut costs in the face of continuing pressures. The Avro regional jet activities delivered 17 aircraft last year compared with a peak production of about 40 three years ago. It also won orders for 11 aircraft last year.</p>

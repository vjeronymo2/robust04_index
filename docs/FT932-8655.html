			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Drugs prices THE DRUG industry's fat profit margins have made it an easy target for the Clinton administration in its struggles to find a way to bring US health care costs under control. Allegations of profiteering, combined with threats of price curbs, have taken their toll on pharmaceutical company share prices. And, though mandatory price controls now seem less likely than a few months ago, the industry has felt a need to respond by proposing a voluntary price cap. Price controls, whether of a mandatory or voluntary kind, are not the way to bring prices down. They would probably prevent drugs bills from falling as quickly as they could. They would also endanger research into new drugs. Instead, as Mrs Hillary Clinton's health task force puts the final touches to its blueprint for reform, it should rely on competitive market forces to deliver better value for money. In industries characterised by monopoly - such as gas, telecommunications, electricity and water - price regulation is unavoidable if consumers' interests are to be protected. The pharmaceutical industry is not such an industry. Patent protection gives companies a limited monopoly. But, when drugs come off patent, generic competitors are usually available at a fraction of the price. Even while patent protection continues, most drugs have rivals which, although not exact copies, are equally effective. The problem is not one of a lack of competing products but of the failure of purchasers to shop around. Prescription decisions too rarely take account of prices, because doctors consider it their job to cure patients rather than control costs, leaving insurers and taxpayers to pick up the tab. Such limited price sensitivity has allowed drug companies to get away with what have sometimes been sharp price hikes. Introducing price controls in such a market would be damaging. On the one hand, there would be a danger of imposing controls which were too harsh. This would have the effect of disrupting research into drugs to tackle illnesses such as Aids, Alzheimer's and cancer. But controls could be too lax, with the result that patients' interests were sold short. Even if controls were miraculously just right, they would have the effect of stifling the development of a more competitive market and the dynamic efficiency gains that would flow from it. There is scope for cost savings in all the drug companies' activities, but introducing price caps could very easily turn the industry into a government-licensed cartel. A better way to control costs is to encourage purchasers to shop more diligently. This is already happening among health maintenance organisations and other 'managed care' providers, which take an active interest in whether the drugs their doctors prescribe are good value. Since they are only prepared to pay for drugs that meet that test, they are able to pick and choose between rival companies' products and often receive substantial discounts. The Clinton administration is well aware of these benefits and is keen to extend them to the whole population through an overall approach to health care, dubbed managed competition. Such an approach would not only deliver better value for money in the short run. It would also give the industry a spur to greater efficiency, so holding out the prospect of better value in the future, while maintaining the incentive to develop new drugs. Combining this policy with price caps would be unnecessary. It would also undermine the idea of a competitive market.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Travel Books: In the oases of stasis THE BATTLE FOR ROOM SERVICE by Mark Lawson Picador Pounds 14.99, 291 pages TRAVEL WRITERS are a competitive lot, forever flinging themselves in search of the exotic, the perilous or the obscure. Mark Lawson, on the other hand, appears to be a gentle soul and, for a journalist, an honest one - a self-declared tourist and coward who has nursed, all his life, a profound need to put himself in the presence of safety. As a result, his latest book is subtitled Journeys to All the Safe Places - New Zealand, Australia, Middle America, Alaska, Canada, Luxembourg, Brussels, Switzerland, Milton Keynes, Disneyworld, Expo '92 and Center Parcs. As he says, courage is normally what publishers want. Yet commissioning editors, comically unaware of his wimp status, seemed only too happy to take him out for pleasant lunches and then, over the sambucca, to suggest he go there on a camel, or here without a map, or into such and such a territory with only two pairs of knickers and a tube of Polo mints in his rucksack. Lawson fended them off. What he wanted to write about was the quiet world - places of tranquillity, stability and conventionally civilised values. 'I stress this,' he says, 'because the idea somehow got around in a few of the countries I visited that this project was an examination of the world's most boring countries. Untrue. If such judgments must be made, I prefer to follow the modern practice of linguistic sensitivity, or political correctness, and refer to these destinations as 'activity-challenged', 'differently-interesting', or 'places of calm'.' He claims that his journeys had the ghost of a serious purpose: to discover whether there was such a thing as a safe country in a way philosophically beyond the definition of one in which nothing much currently goes on. 'Could the Ayatollah Khomenei have produced in the inhabitants of Timaru (New Zealand) or Ottawa or Milton Keynes the reactions he won from those in Tehran? Lenin lived briefly in Zurich but, had he been Swiss, could he have led a revolution there? Do some nations have anaesthetic temperaments and environments which render them immune to demagoguery and revolution?' Lawson sets about his mission in splendid style, by starting in New Zealand and having some harmless fun with the Kiwi accent. When he tells a hotel receptionist in Christchurch that he is heading for Timaru, she tells him that the people in Timaru are 'funny little pipple.' Why? asks Lawson. 'Hard to say,' she replies. 'We had a nuclear accidint in Ni Zilland in '64, and pipple reckon something got into the water over there . . . ' He also produces some appalling yet lovely jokes. Example: New Zealand is 'probably the only country in the world in which people flocked to see The Silence of the Lambs believing it to be a public information film about oesophageal blockage in new-born sheep.' But there is more to Lawson than quips about accents and bitter-sweet jokes. He does his homework. He has a good ear and eye. He is a rewarding companion and guide. And his humour is always studiously unforced. After a year spent in the quiet world, Lawson concludes that the safe zones are receding, that there are no islands any more - no opt-outs, anywhere, from poverty, joblessness or, most strikingly, some variety of violence. Perhaps, he says, it was no coincidence that in each of these former oases of stasis there was also a crisis of belief in leaders. In the year in question, in nearly every nation of the quiet world except Australia, a leader had been retired, rejected or in some way humbled, partly because the prevalent political pressure to reduce taxation had left these countries struggling to fund the lifestyles to which their electorates had become accustomed. History has not ended - not even in the boring world.</p>

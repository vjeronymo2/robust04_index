The decisions included in this ROD have been made in consideration of the Homestead AFB Disposal and Reuse Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), which was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on February 18, 1994, and other relevant considerations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Homestead AFB was realigned on March 31, 1994, pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act (DBCRA) (Public Law 101&hyph;510) and recommendations of the Defense Secretary's Commission on Base Realignment and Closure. This ROD documents the Homestead AFB disposal decisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The methods which will be utilized to dispose of the approximate 2,014 acre closure portion of the base are: public airport conveyance (approximately 1,880 acres), homeless assistance public health conveyance (approximately 75 acres), transfers to U.S. Departments of Labor (approximately 40 acres) and the Treasury (approximately 19 acres). The bank and credit union will be provided the opportunity to purchase the land underlying the buildings they have constructed. Base utilities will be disposed of separately. Not yet resolved is whether the Florida Army National Guard will require property for an armory. That matter is under consideration at the Department of the Army and will require Department of Defense approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The uses proposed for the property by prospective recipients of property under the ROD are consistent with the community's redevelopment plan for the base. Data County prepared the plan, with the assistance of the broader community, and further refined the plan through the County's proposed Airport Master Plan, which it submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ROD announced that any potential environmental impacts would result directly from reuse and redevelopment by others. Likewise, most of the mitigations of environmental impacts would be the responsibility of future owners and developers. The Air Force has tried to take all practical measures to avoid or minimize environmental harm that may occur as a result of its disposal action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to Mr. Patrick W. McCullough, Program Manager, Southeast Division. Correspondence should be sent to AFBCA/SE, 1700 N. Moore Street, Suite 2300, Arlington, VA 22209&hyph;2809. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Patsy J.

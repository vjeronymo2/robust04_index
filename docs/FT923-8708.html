			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Letter: Economic cure Sir, The learned treatise by the pharmacist Mr Barry Riley (The Long View: 'Secrets of the drug culture', August 1) concerning the various drugs which have been used to treat the long-term illness of Mr Brit Economy was very interesting. However, having been intimately acquainted with this sick gentleman for 80 years it is obvious that to avoid terminal decline, it is essential now to administer large doses of pragmaticol and comonsenserin.

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Credit Lyonnais to get French taxpayers' cash Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, yesterday confirmed that the government plans to restructure Credit Lyonnais, the loss-making bank, by injecting capital and floating part of its property loans into a state-controlled shell company. Details of the rescue package will be announced on Thursday afternoon when Credit Lyonnais, which has been badly affected by the economic recession after aggressive expansion in the late 1980s, will disclose a heavy net loss for 1993, estimated by analysts at between FFr2.5bn (Pounds 280m) and FFr5bn. The rescue has been the subject of intense negotiation between the government and Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the French financier appointed chairman of Credit Lyonnais. The package is expected to include a FFr4bn capital injection and the removal from the banks' balance sheet of FFr25bn-FFr40bn of non-performing property loans which will then be guaranteed by the government. Asked whether this operation, coinciding with French requests for approval for large amounts of state aid to Bull and Air France, might not be too much for the European Commission to swallow, Mr Alphandery said that in the case of Credit Lyonnais, 'the government will be carrying out its normal role as shareholder'. He said taking property loans off Credit Lyonnais' balance sheet 'is a classic operation' of the kind carried out for 'other French and foreign banks'. He would not take a final decision on Credit Lyonnais' recapitalisation until he had seen its 1993 figures - to be presented to the bank's board on Thursday. Still at issue is how long the state will guarantee the property-related loans before reintegrating them into the bank's balance sheet. Lex, Page 24</p>

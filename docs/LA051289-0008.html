			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Illinois Atty. Gen. Neil Hartigan filed a federal lawsuit to halt the closure  of 86 military installations throughout the country, calling the process by  which the closings were ordered "absurd." Hartigan's complaint contends the  government's Base Closure Act is unconstitutional and seeks to enjoin Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney from implementing any of the recommendations of the  Commission on Base Realignment and Closure. The House last month voted not to  block the recommended closures, which were announced late last year.  </P></p>

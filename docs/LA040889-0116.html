			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: FILING LATE TAX RETURN MAY BE COSTLY LUXURY UNDER  THE NEW LAWS  </P> <P> Haven't filed that dreaded 1040 yet? You're not alone. About half of the  nation's taxpayers procrastinate until the last two weeks to file their tax  returns, the IRS says. Some go even beyond that by filing for extensions -- or  simply not filing at all.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, if you are thinking about getting an automatic extension by  leaving the country, the rules have been tightened considerably this year. And  penalties can be stiff if you fail to file or don't pay all you owe. Also,  taxpayers who file late tend to make more mistakes; and if your tax preparer  commits the boo-boos, you're still liable.  </P> <P> Here are answers to some common last-minute questions about filing deadlines,  extensions, penalties and common mistakes made by procrastinators:  </P> <P> Question: When do I have to file?  </P> <P> Answer: This year, because April 15 falls on a Saturday, you don't have to file  until midnight, April 17 (that means you have all day Monday, April 17, to  file). That is also the deadline for making individual retirement account  contributions for 1988, or Keogh contributions for plans you opened by the end  of last year.  </P> <P> Q: What if I can't file on time?  </P> <P> A: You can send in Form 4868 before the April 17 deadline to get an extension  until Aug. 15. But you still must estimate your tax liability and enclose a  check with the form if you expect to owe more tax.  </P> <P> If you fail to make that payment, you may be subject to a monthly late-filing  penalty of 5% of the unpaid balance, up to 25%, plus interest charges currently  set at 12%. That is because your extension could be disallowed.  </P> <P> An extension, however, cannot be granted for making your IRA contributions for  1988. But you can extend the deadline for making contributions to an  already-opened Keogh plan.  </P> <P> Q: Can I still file late if I don't expect to owe any money?  </P> <P> A: Sure, but if you don't file within three years, you could lose any refund to  which you are entitled, IRS spokesman Robert Giannangeli says. And if you don't  file and end up owing money, you will be subject to the 5% late-filing penalty,  plus interest.  </P> <P> You also could face penalties for not filing certain returns. For example, if  you make non-deductible contributions to an IRA, but fail to file Form 8606 to  account for such contributions, you are subject to a $50 penalty ($100 if you  and your spouse each made non-deductible contributions).  </P> <P> Q: Can I get an automatic extension if I am out of the country on April 17?  </P> <P> A: You used to get an automatic two-month extension on filing, as well as  paying, if you were out of the country on the deadline date. No more.  </P> <P> Under new, tougher IRS rules that began this year for 1988 returns, you only  can get an automatic extension if your residence and primary place of business  both are located outside the United States. Otherwise you must file Form 4868.  </P> <P> "You can no longer just go across the border for lunch" and get an extension,  says Julian Block, tax expert with Prentice Hall Information Services and an  attorney in Larchmont, N.Y.  </P> <P> Q: What if I owe but don't have the cash?  </P> <P> A: File anyway and pay what you can afford. You will be assessed a  failure-to-pay penalty of 0.5% per month on the unpaid balance, up to a 25%  maximum, plus interest. But that is a lot less than the 5% failure to file  penalty, plus interest.  </P> <P> If paying is a real hardship, call the IRS' toll-free number, (800) 424-1040,  and ask for the accounts section. They may work out an installment plan and may  waive penalties.  </P> <P> Q: What happens if my preparer makes a mistake?  </P> <P> A: This is a well-justified worry, as a recent Money magazine survey showed  that more than half of 50 preparers asked to compute tax owed by a hypothetical  family made significant errors.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, you are still liable for penalties and interest, even if a  preparer made the mistake. "You're in no way off the hook, so at least take a  reasonable look at what's been done for you to see if anything is obviously out  of line," tax adviser Block says. "If there is any question, ask the preparer."  </P> <P> Q: Where can I get last-minute advice or forms?  </P> <P> A: Many certified public accountants, enrolled agents and other professional  preparers are swamped now and cannot properly handle new clients. However, the  IRS and state Franchise Tax Board are offering extended weekday and Saturday  hours to answer questions.  </P> <P> If you still need forms, it may be too late to get them by phone or letter. You  may have to go directly to an agency office or to your local library, where  forms might be available to be photocopied.  </P> <P> Q: What are the most costly errors made by last-minute filers?  </P> <P> A: One of the most common is forgetting to sign your return. That can delay  your refund, because the IRS will send back your return for your signature.  Another common and possibly costly error: failure to include a check for any  money you owe. That could subject you to the 0.5% late payment penalty, plus  interest.  </P> <P> Other frequent boo-boos include math errors and failure to include your W-2  form. They also could delay your refunds.  </P> <P> Q: When can I expect my refund?  </P> <P> A: If you had filed earlier in the year, you could have received it within five  to six weeks. But now, at this late date, don't expect a refund for at least  eight to 10 weeks.  </P> <P> However, if you file electronically through a tax preparer offering the  service, you still could have it within three weeks, IRS spokesman Giannangeli  says.  </P> <P> If 10 weeks have passed and you haven't received your refund, call the IRS at  (800) 554-4477. A computer will check the status of your refund. But make sure  you have a copy of your return, because the computer will ask for your Social  Security number, filing status and the refund you expect.  </P> <P> If you don't receive your refund within 90 days, the IRS owes you interest  payable at an annual rate of 11%.  </P> <P> Q: Will filing closer to the deadline, or filing for an extension, decrease my  chances of being audited?  </P> <P> A: Some tax preparers say it does. But the IRS contends that the timing of your  filing makes no difference in your chances of being audited. That is because  the actual selection process for returns to be audited doesn't start until at  least a year after the filing deadline, the agency says.  </P> <P> Q: When will I know if I'm going to be audited?  </P> <P> A: The IRS has three years from your filing date or due date (whichever is  later) to audit your return. If you file for an extension, that extends your  filing date or due date. But generally, if you haven't been served an audit  notice within two years after you file, chances are you won't be audited at  all, tax expert Block says.  </P> <P> There are some exceptions to the three-year rule. You may be subject to an  audit within six years if you omit income from your return equal to more than  25% of the total income you report. And you can be subject to audit  indefinitely if you don't file, or if you file fraudulent returns that omit  significant income or overstate deductions.  </P> <P> Q: How long do I need to keep records?  </P> <P> A: Generally for three years, the period in which you generally can expect to  be audited. Many taxpayers believe that getting a refund means the IRS has  approved their returns, and thus they can toss their records. Not so.  </P> <P> "All a refund check means is that the IRS has checked the math on your return,  and they sent what you show," Block says. "In no way does that mean your return  has been audited and you can throw your records away."  </P> <P> Some records, such as purchases and improvements on your home or investments in  stocks, should be kept longer.  </P> <P> Bill Sing welcomes readers' comments and suggestions for columns but regrets  that he cannot respond individually to letters.

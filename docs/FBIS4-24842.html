			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Billy Adams] </F>   [Text] Corrupt senior mainland officials may expect to get  away with abusing their power in Hong Kong after 1997, a top  anti-corruption officer warned yesterday.    "With the passage of 1997 we know China is worried about how  some of its senior officials use of their official positions,"  Tony Scott, the director of corruption prevention at the  Independent Commission Against Corruption, said. "They might  say, `We can go and do the same thing in Hong Kong'. That could  be a worry and one which I have heard expressed by people on the  mainland."    Scott was confident that any top-level corruption would be  unlikely to spread.    "If they do behave in that way (abusing power) then that  could happen," he said.    "Hopefully the Special Administrative Region and our  regulatory controls will ensure it doesn't happen. They are  quite good at finding out when people are doing things which are  wrong, unethical, criminal or outside the rules, and putting it  right.    "It is an area which I think is potentially more worrying  than the growth of ordinary corruption in Hong Kong.    "At this point I would say it is a slightly larger threat  than Hong Kong people turning to corruption."    Scott said corruption complaints in the territory jumped  from  1,542 to 1,940 in the first three months of 1994, compared with  the same period last year.    He was sure the amount of graft would not change  significantly after the handover of sovereignty.    Scott claimed China was serious about tackling corruption,  citing recent wideranging laws with heavy penalties for state  officials.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / World Trade News: Atlantic flights free-market plan - A look at the prospects for new Anglo-US airline treaty THE COUNTDOWN to a possible revolution in transatlantic air travel began this week. Britain and the US have given themselves a year to scrap a 16-year-old treaty governing air transport between the two countries and to replace it with a free-market alternative that promises more choice and convenience while keeping a lid on fares. 'It is an ambitious timetable,' said Mr Federico Pena, US transportation secretary. His UK counterpart, Mr John MacGregor, confirms 'there will be difficult decisions by both sides'. A new treaty may also trigger changes between the US and other countries, especially France, Germany and Japan, which are unhappy with their own bilateral arrangements. The rulebook that the US and UK want to scrap, the 140-page Bermuda 2 agreement, was signed in 1977. It replaced the post-war Bermuda agreement and specifies, for example, that only two named US carriers, American Airlines and United Airlines, can land at the world's busiest international airport, London's Heathrow. The question of access to Heathrow will be central to the US position in talks with the UK. Washington has long argued that British Airways controls most of the landing slots at the best times of day, preventing efficient competition between the two countries' carriers. But the UK is likely to be wary of taking steps that would undermine the position of BA, one of the country's most successful companies. Opening up Heathrow might also allow in US carriers operating under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code which shields them from paying debts. Even solvent US carriers have argued that compet-ition from Chapter 11 rivals such as TWA and Continental is unfair. The UK's biggest concern is that its airlines cannot fly beyond a handful of US 'gateway' cities, their first and only landing points. Nor can they buy control of US carriers to reach the vast domestic US market; US law prevents foreign control of airlines. These mean that someone who wants to go to Britain from any but the largest US cities has little choice but to fly with a US carrier, both for the domestic and transatlantic flights. Yet the Clinton administration may find it difficult to introduce more competition into a market where almost everyone loses money. Only one US carrier made a profit last year, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines. Washington may also pre-empt the talks on foreign control of US airlines. This is one of the areas to be addressed by an airline commission, initiated by Mr Pena, which is scheduled to report its findings by late summer. Air transport officials in Paris, Bonn and Tokyo will watch closely the progress of the US-UK talks. France has abandoned its own bilateral agreement with the US and wants tight limits on US market share of the routes between the two countries: Air France's market share has fallen to one-third. Without the framework of the agreement US and French officials will have to meet every six months to discuss the next season's services between the two countries. Mr Pena said he hoped that rapid agreement between the UK and US 'would encourage France and the US to come to the negotiating table'. The German bilateral agreement is set for renegotiation this autumn, but positions are already hardening. This month Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chairman, said that existing rules gave US carriers an unfair advantage. Tokyo is locked in a dispute with the US over whether US carriers travelling to south-east Asia and Australia via Japan should be allowed to pick up large numbers of Japanese citizens on the way. 'We have had discussions with the Japanese. We have not made significant progress,' said Mr Pena. If Bermuda 2 is replaced by a free-market alternative, it could strengthen the US case in these debates with France and Germany. But it will not be an easy task to draft a full treaty agreeable to both London and Washington in a single year. Mr MacGregor is already talking of signing an interim deal if necessary, one that perhaps postpones some of the more difficult decisions.</p>

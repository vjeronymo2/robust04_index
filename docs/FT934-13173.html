			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Strength of dollar hits pharmaceutical groups THE depressing impact of a strong dollar on international sales was reflected yesterday in the third-quarter results of Schering-Plough and American Cyanamid, two US pharmaceutical companies. Schering-Plough posted a 17 per cent rise in net income to Dollars 199.4m, or Dollars 1.03 a share from Dollars 174.5m, or 88 cents a year earlier. Sales rose 4 per cent to Dollars 1.06bn. The company said sales would have risen by 8 per cent excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange. American Cyanamid blamed the strength of the dollar against major European currencies for the 4 per cent fall in third-quarter sales from continuing operations to Dollars 899m. Earnings from continuing operations declined to Dollars 50m, or 55 cents from Dollars 53m, or 59 cents in the same period of 1992. Cyanamid recently announced a restructuring including 4,000 job losses. The company reported the results of Cytec Industry, its chemicals business which is to be spun-off, as a discontinued operation. Cyanamid is also taking an after-tax charge of Dollars 100m for remediation expense related to the chemicals business. Including these charges, Cyanamid had a net loss of Dollars 363m, or Dollars 4.04 against net earnings of Dollars 61m, or 68 cents the previous year. Sales and operating earnings from Cyanamid's medical group fell during the quarter.</p>

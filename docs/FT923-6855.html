			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Expansion policy fails to pay off / A look at turmoil in European insurance markets as cross-border takeover activity slows down The decision by Hafnia, Denmark's second-largest insurance company, to seek protection from its creditors, highlights the problems faced by the European insurance industry. Hafnia's failure to transform itself into a pan-Scandinavian financial group capable of competing in the newly liberalised European insurance market coincides with a deterioration in trading conditions and a sharp slowdown in cross-border merger and acquisition activity by leading insurers. Although few companies face problems quite as acute as those of Hafnia, European insurers confront straitened circumstances. Over the past two years they have incurred rising underwriting losses. Returns on capital gains - derived from the appreciation of property and other assets - have also declined. The going could get even tougher as companies adapt to the liberal regulatory framework enacted by the European Commission earlier this year and the more competitive environment it will help foster. The example of Hafnia is instructive. Mr Per Villum Hansen, Hafnia's former chairman, was an exponent of the idea that big is beautiful. He believed the company was simply too small to compete in a liberalised Europe. Although big in the tiny Danish market, Hafnia would be vulnerable to takeover from much larger competitors from France and Germany. So Mr Hansen turned to Baltica, Denmark's biggest insurer, to try to form a large financial conglomerate. 'He wanted to refashion corporate Denmark,' said one observer. With the Baltica management unresponsive, Mr Hansen paid DKr3.8bn (Pounds 350m) for a 34 per cent stake in Baltica in an effort to force co-operation. Last year he switched his attention to Skandia, joining forces with UNI Storebrand, the largest Norwegian insurer, to buy a combined 42 per cent stake of Scandinavia's largest insurance company. But the deals left Hafnia overextended. Total investment in Baltica and Skandia was equal to nearly twice the value of its own capital base. Worse still Hafnia was exposed to the worsening conditions of the Scandinavian insurance markets, with insurance investments representing about a third of its total equity holdings. As the share price of Skandia and Baltica drifted downwards Hafnia was left with substantial investment losses, which have depleted its assets. On Wednesday, the company said its liabilities exceeded assets by DKr100m. Nowhere in Europe has an expansionist strategy come so visibly unstuck. For other insurers, Hafnia is a warning of the dangers of overambition. However, few of the mergers, acquisitions and alliances agreed in the run-up liberalisation of the market are proving successful, industry observers suggest. Acquisitions in the growing Spanish and Italian markets have proved particularly troublesome. The experience of Guardian Royal Exchange, the fifth-biggest UK company, which lost more than Pounds 70m in Italy after buying two small southern Italian insurance companies, is not unique. Mr Claude Tagger, director of international development for Assurances Generales de France, the French company, says: 'We saw lots of victory communiques in the late 1980s. Someone had bought a pearl in Spain or Italy. But many of these decisions were wrong. The acquired companies were in bad shape and their new owners lacked the capital to do anything about it.' Mr Alan Badanes, an American banker who is managing director of Chase Manhattan European insurance group, says: 'The big successful acquisition has been the exception rather than the rule. Few if any are going well.' He likens the pre-1992 takeover enthusiasm in European insurance to that in the City of London before Big Bang's deregulation of share trading, when foreign banks competed to buy securities houses. Many of the deals were conceived in the bull markets of the late 1980s and the prices paid sometimes bore little relation to either earnings or assets of the target companies. Mr Simon Rudolph, an industry observer at Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, says AXA, UAP and Allianz overpaid when they bought Equity &amp; Law, the UK life company, Toro of Italy and Vie/Rhin et Moselle of France respectively. Mr Rudolph says '1992 fever' meant that insurers rushed to establish footholds in the growth markets regardless of cost. Investors' fears about the wisdom of the recent overseas expansion of Allianz, the German group which is the largest insurer on the continent, help explain a recent 10 per cent fall in the group's share price. Allianz reported a worse than expected underwriting loss of DM1.78bn for 1991 last month, partly because of poor performance by overseas underwriting subsidiaries. During the 1980s the company spent some DM10bn making acquisitions abroad. Deutsche Versicherungs, the former state monopoly of eastern Germany acquired by Allianz in 1990, is not expected to make a profit until the late 1990s. Sharply higher underwriting losses are also undermining enthusiasm for expansion elsewhere in Europe . The losses have been most acute in the UK, because of the sharp slowdown in the housing market and the severity of the recession. Domestic mortgage indemnity claims - in which insurers cover lenders against losses on the sales of repossessed properties - and recession-related claims for theft and arson have increased. However, insurers in other European markets have also had to contend with heavier claims. French and German insurers, for example, have seen an epidemic of car theft, with thousands of stolen vehicles ending up in eastern Europe. Mr Rudolph cites evidence that 40 per cent of cars on sale in Poland had been stolen from eastern Europe. Last year the numbers of cars stolen in France rose by 21.5 per cent to 311,000. Losses on commercial property insurance, where competition has depressed premium rates in recent years, have also been high. In France and Germany insurers have been paying Pounds 1.40 in claims and expenses for every Pounds 1 received in premiums. The decline in the values of assets such as property and shares has weakened balance sheets and depressed income from capital gains. In France, capital gains from real-estate appreciation have been an important source of profits. But operating conditions for many companies could deteriorate further as a result of the EC's programme of liberalisation. German, and possibly Swiss, insurers are particularly vulnerable because their insurance markets are more highly regulated and protected than elsewhere. For example, minimum price rules - which must now be scrapped - have guaranteed healthy profits for German motor insurers. German industry leaders expect competition in home and motor business to reduce traditionally wide margins and profitability. Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, chairman of Allianz, said in a recent interview that he is expecting 'short-term' slippage in profits from domestic operations after Germany implements the European directives. There are, however, signs that German banks and insurers are overcoming their traditional reluctance to compete with each other. Deutsche Bank's foray into the life insurance market with its purchase of 30 per cent of Gerling, the largest privately owned insurance company in Germany, serves notice that competition could heat up. Already there are signs that European companies are adapting to the deflationary climate of the 1990s by adjusting their strategies to conserve capital. French companies, the most aggressive expansionists in the run-up to 1992, are hinting that they will slow the pace of their acquisitions. Union des Assurances de Paris, Europe's second-biggest insurer in which the French government has a majority stake, increased its European premium income from markets outside France threefold between 1986 and 1990. But Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman, said at the company's annual general meeting this year. 'We will take a very long pause in our external growth. We have to organise and manage our operations and eliminate losses.' French companies are also starting to favour the development of long-term alliances, rather than outright acquisitions. Assurances Generales de France, which has also been aggressive in acquiring European business, doubled its non-French income between 1986 and 1990. It recently won a long legal battle to have voting rights recognised on its 25 per cent stake in one of Germany's top insurers, Aachener &amp; Munchener (AMB). The group says it is now committed to building a long-term relationship with its partner. Mr Tagger, the AGF director for international development, advocates the need for economies of scale and increased market share, the same view which informed some of the acquisitions that are now running into difficulties. He says AGF aims to have a stake of 5 to 10 per cent in all the markets in which it competes, but says this can only be achieved through alliances and possible mergers with groups of a similar size. Acquisition is 'simply not on the cards. You can't double your size by buying your competitor,' says Mr Tagger, adding that AGF would not have bought AMB even if it had been able to do so. 'We have to find new ways. Alliances are necessary,' he concludes. Other observers believe that insurers may reappraise strategies in a more fundamental fashion as companies increasingly make profitability a bigger priority than increase in market share. In the US many multi-line insurers (which sell the full range of life and non-life policies) have abandoned efforts to have a sizeable share in every insurance product and every state, preferring instead to develop strengths in a restricted number of markets where they have special experience and expertise. Mr Badanes of Chase says the pattern could be repeated in Europe. Although the market for reinsurance and large-scale commercial risks - the policies bought by multinational companies - will remain genuinely international, Mr Badanes expects the markets for smaller commercial and personal insurances, such as motor and home insurance, to continue to develop along national lines. He predicts that many of the larger groups could begin to break up in the 1990s. 'The unravelling is just beginning. The big groups won't breathe the word divestiture. but they'll quickly respond to any unsolicited offer for one of their subsidiaries.'

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Travel: A little country's clockwork charm - How Switzerland broke Nicholas Woodsworth's resistance HEATHROW: 10am on a drizzly autumn day. I am not a nervous flyer, but as I strap myself into my seat on Swissair Flight 831 I feel a growing apprehension. What bothers me is not the flight but what lies at the end of it - Switzerland. For me the allure of travel is the allure of the untowards. I like hopping on planes because it is the easiest way I have found of trading the known and repetitious for the surprises of the one-off. I enjoy travel because it never turns out the way I think it will. Hence my hesitation about Switzerland. For all I have heard of it, this is the land where the untowards never happens. Nor anything that is unorthodox, extreme, risky or likely to inflame the passions. The essence of Swissness, it is sometimes hinted, is blandness. Who, after all, I ask myself, invented muesli? The Swiss. Who invented orthopaedic shoes, Calvinism, fondue parties? Who plays the dreadful alphorns? Who are so precise, punctual and reliable that they have become the world's timekeepers? Who are so meticulously diligent that they are the world's bankers? Switzerland, I fear, might turn out to be a very dull place. ***** EARLY evening: the summit of Mont Vully. I have climbed my first Swiss mountain. Granted, it is smooth and grassy and only 653 meters high. But it has given me the elevation I need to see things clearly. I have changed my mind, turned 180 degrees. Switzerland, against all expectations, is a wholly untowards kind of place. The stories are true - this is a country of benign orderliness, efficiency, punctuality, conformity and hygiene. But it is precisely this stolid respectability that makes Switzerland so remarkable. Perched flat on my stomach over a serene landscape, I reflect on the world in its present limping state. In a world where everywhere the nasty and unexpected are now the norm, a land of no surprises is surprising indeed. In its very predicability, Switzerland has become an exotic and intriguing place. Tiny Switzerland's distinctive morals, manners and institutions are not without reason. It is artificially composed of disparate groups sharing no common language, religion or ethnic background. Its 800-year history is a litany of uncertainty, of bullying and invasion by large and aggressive neighbours. It possesses no natural resources and depends for its livelihood on markets over which it has no control. What has shaped it is an over-riding need for well-being and security. Nowhere is Switzerland's profound conservatism more striking than in the country's landscapes. Meticulously arranged and managed even in the wildest of areas, the land is the object of an aesthetic sense of order reflecting the nation's anxieties - the making of a safe, sure world. In transforming the threatening into the reassuring, the Swiss have created an astonishing beauty. For the visitor, Switzerland is, above all, a visual adventure. Little Mont Vully has nothing to do with the Switzerland of rearing peaks and gingerbread chalets and high alpine pastures. It sits between Lake Neuchatel and the modest lake of Murtensee in an area more reknowned for its market gardens and vegetables than anything else. But it is gorgeous. Geometrically precise rows of cabbages and corn are tended no less royally than the gardens of Versailles. To protect them from birds, the vineyards that slope down to the Murtensee spend the summer covered in what look like outsize yellow hair-nets. From barns to bakeries, buildings spill over with the countless red blooms of flower-box geraniums. Over on the other side of the Murtensee, medieval Morat, a toy-town of red spires and watch-towers, gilded town clocks and decorated fountains, floats on an evening mist building over the lake. Morat's streets, restored to their original finery, are immaculate. Walt Disney himself could not have done a better job. Everything depends on artifice and attention to detail, and, strangely enough, it all feels natural and right. In this highest of high-tech countries, not even the cows wandering over Mont Vully with ridiculous, old-fashioned bells around their necks seem in the least embarrassed. ***** Lake Lucerne: on board the ferry Unterwalden. I have spent years watching swans and ducks in London's parks, and never known how they fed or moved under that muddy water. Now I do. In the crystal-clear waters of Lake Lucerne, I see swans plunge their necks downwards and sweep the bottom with their bills, watch flocks of ducks use their wings to swim along under the surface as if in flight. It is an astonishing sight, and this one of the loveliest lakes in the world. I am usually reluctant to do corny tourist things like taking boat tours and riding miniature trains to mountain viewpoints. But Switzerland is fast breaking my resistance - such pursuits here are not so much corny as heart-stopping. Like the swans bobbing along beside it, the 90-year-old side-paddle steamer Unterwalden is all elegance above the water and furious effort below. Through an open-topped engine-room I watch polished pistons rise and fall and paddle-wheels thrash their way through limpid water. They take me past flower-laden lakeside villages basking in the autumn sun, chateaux perched on forested promontories, mountains soaring skyward from the lake's edge. At the little town of Vitznau I, too, soar skywards, in a cogwheel train that climbs impossibly steep grades. I sit facing backwards. In no time at all it is as if I am looking at the lake through the wrong end of a telescope. I travel nearly 2,000m to the Rigi Kulm, a mountain summit from which the entire country spreads out, tiny and unreal. Rigi has been famous for a long time. Mark Twain climbed it last century to see the sun rise over Switzerland. He got lost in the dark on the final ascent and waited anxiously until mid-morning before he realised that the glorious event had taken place on the other side of the mountain. Twain swore forever more that in Switzerland the sun rises in the west. ***** THE Hofbahnstrasse, Zurich. Not all Switzerland is a temple to nature. There are about 1,700 Swiss banking corporations, and most of them seem to have branches along the Hofbahnstrasse. These temples to money lend heavy, grey walls, lofty ceilings and a sense of dignified purpose to a street of busy trams and hurrying people. I am disappointed in the gnomes of Zurich. Who invented the phrase? In my mind I pictured them as strange, cunning creatures with identifiable signs - long ears or curling toes. They are like men in grey suits anywhere. My room at the Neues Schloss Hotel is another kind of temple, a temple to technology. There are a hundred minor wonders such as its electric window blinds. But the crowning glory is the Closomat - a fully automatic, high-tech toilet. It is so complex that it comes with a book of instructions. Once it is mastered, however, one literally sits back and enjoys it: warm water jets and air driers do all the rest. ***** MORCOTE, on the Swiss-Italian border. Can this still be Switzerland? In a short drive over the St Gotthard pass I have driven from a Norwegian- to a Spanish-style climate. Gone are the pine trees and the steep-roofed chalets. In their place on the sub-tropical shores of Lake Lugano are palm trees and ornamental bamboos, Italianate houses in rich ochre, sienna and magenta, huge lunch-time dishes of polenta and risotto. But I do not have to look at plants or houses or food to know that I am back on the edge of the real world. I only have to look at people and their behaviour. I have just seen a local driver reverse in the wrong direction down a one-way street. It is a sure sign that I am not far from the general disorder, confusion and non-conformity that makes up most of the planet. Swiss life, so sane and predictable, ends up being the oddest life of all. But once again it has reaffirmed my faith in travel, which never turns out the way one think it will.

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Eurotrack index warrants to trade on US exchanges STOCK index warrants on the new FT-SE Eurotrack 100 and FT-SE Eurotrack 200 indices are to be listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the American Stock Exchange (Amex) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the International Stock Exchange in London has announced. Trading of the warrants is expected to start this summer, subject to approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US watchdog. The warrants will allow US investors to manage their European equity portfolios more efficiently. The FT-SE Eurotrack 100, launched in October 1990 and comprising leading European stocks outside the UK, is calculated in D-Marks. The FT-SE 200, introduced in February this year, adds the FT-SE 100 index of UK stocks to the Eurotrack 100 and is measured in Ecu. Futures and options on the two indices are already traded on the London International Financial Futures Exchange, the London Traded Options Market and the CBOE.</p>

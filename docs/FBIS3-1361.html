The following is a  report on the meeting by Laurent Kagimbi:    [Begin Kagimbi recording] After an introductory speech by  the president of the Republic, the council first studied a draft  of the internal rules. The council then exchanged general views  on the state of security prevailing in the entire country,  particularly in Bujumbura. While discussing other business, it  examined the modalities of going on meet-the-people visits to  work toward a return to peace.    Concerning the internal rules, the council members examined  the proposed draft, contributed to it, and referred its adoption  to the next session.    On the problem of security in the entire territory, and in  particular in the capital, the security members studied the  issue in all its aspects and found that it was a priority  concern for the country's leaders and the population. The  council sadly noted that if peace and security were not restored  swiftly, the country would inexorably slip into perdition.    The council expressed its deep sympathy for the victims of  this destructive madness, which has befallen our dear motherland  since the coup attempt in which the elected president, Melchior  Ndadaye, was killed.    In order to restore security and peace in the country, the  National Security Council proposes to the government the  following:    First, all the institutions of the Republic and political  and  moral leaders of society must permanently speak the language of  peace and reconciliation. The spirit of solidarity must be  revived and reinforced so that the people, irrespective of their  ethnic affiliations, can cultivate a spirit of mutual help in  the face of danger, fighting together against criminals and all  types of wrongdoers, and reject the enticement of those who want  to once more drag them into ethnic violence and vengeance.    Second, all the institutions charged with public order,  whether magistrates, administrative leaders or security forces,  must carry out their tasks with discipline, work in permanent  consultation, and act with the utmost firmness to neutralize all  troublemakers and all wrongdoers who kill, loot, and destroy.  In this respect, the government must establish a crisis  committee which will meet daily to assess the situation,  identify those responsible for the tragic events we are  experiencing, propose strategies for fighting them, and report  daily to the president of the Republic. The crisis committee  will include the minister of state for the interior and public  security, the minister of national defense, the minister of  justice, and the general administrator in charge of national  documentation and immigation.    Third, concerning disarmament, the government must study  methods and appropriate working structures so that this  operation, which is indispensable, does not become an occasion  for confrontation but rather an operation which, with the  participation of everyone, aims to restore peace.    Concerning Bujumbura, the government must put in place the  following measures:    One, the establishment and revival of administrative  structures which must cooperate closely with the security  forces. To this end, every zone leader will be delegated an  Army officer charged with assisting him in security matters and  in the intervention of security forces.    Two, a patronage committee will be set up in every zone, and  will be charged with administrative problems and security forces  to restore the peace. The committee will consist of a  government member [as heard], a National Assembly member, a  National Security Council member, and a field officer of the  Armed Forces or the Gendarmerie.    Three, there will be a gradual reduction in military  checkpoints and a placing of intervention groups on alert in the  barracks, so that these forces can quickly swing into action to  rescue the populace at the request of the administrative  authorities, or in case of emergency.    Concerning some foreigners, particularly groups of young  Rwandans who sow insecurity, the government must strictly apply  the laws in force at the national and international levels.    In conclusion, the National Security Council called upon all  the Burundian people to commit themselves fully to the return of  peace and reconciliation. If this is not done, our motherland  will inexorably head towards its destruction. [end recording]</p>

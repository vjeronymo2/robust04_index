			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Groundlings Grounded?The long-running Groundlings improvisational comedy troupe  may be forced to shut down if $30,000 cannot be raised by the end of the year  to cover its financial difficulties. In the last 16 years, the Melrose Avenue  group has served as a launching pad for such stars as Pee-wee Herman, Cassandra  (Elvira) Peterson, Pat Morita and Jon Lovitz.  </P> <P> But with expenses exceeding income, the group's executive director, Andrea  Ladik, announced they are looking for a financial "miracle." Through  advertisements and personal appeals, the Groundlings are asking for donations  from the theater-going public. An honor roll is being installed in the theater  lobby to salute donors, and a one-night gala event, "The Best of the  Groundlings," will be held this fall. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

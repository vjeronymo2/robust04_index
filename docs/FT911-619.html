			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Observer: Costly Polly The heroic attempt to save Polly Peck International is fast becoming one of the most expensive insolvency operations ever mounted. In the first six months alone, the exercise has cost the group's creditors Pounds 5.5m. It is money they can ill afford to lose, given the gloomiest forecasts that they might end up seeing only about Pounds 230m of their Pounds 1.1bn returned. Not all of it has gone to the fat cats of the insolvency industry, this time hailing from Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, its insolvency arm Cork Gully, and Touche Ross. About Pounds 2.5m has been soaked up in legal and professional fees (much of it to fight a complex legal battle in northern Cyprus). Much more will have gone on the aeroplane tickets and hotel bills needed to keep teams of accountants and lawyers busily buzzing around the world. There is still some way to go to overtake the Pounds 15m running tally on the year-old insolvency saga at British &amp; Commonwealth. But B&amp;C's administrators over at Ernst &amp; Young have at least realised some Pounds 400m for creditors. Urbane, ubiquitous Michael Jordan at Cork Gully is telling Polly Peck's creditors they will have to wait years for any substantial returns.</p>

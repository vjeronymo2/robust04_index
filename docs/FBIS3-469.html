			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jimmy Seepe] </F>   [Text] There was increasing concern in ANC [African  National Congress] ranks this week following rumours that yet  another of the organisation's leaders was being targeted by  assassins.    Police this week dispatched a confidential communique to the  ANC saying that they had been told by an unnamed source that  former ANC Youth League [ANCYL] president Peter Mokaba would be  assassinated by disaffected members of the league.    Police named one of the alleged assassins, saying their  information suggested that he and 10 of his friends planned to  assassinate Mokaba.    "The reason for the planned action, according to the  anonymous caller, is that Peter Mokaba `sold out' members of the  ANCYL to the police," the police communique says.    Information relating to threats against Mokaba's life comes  just days after General Constand Viljoen is said to have  volunteered information about a plot to assassinate ANC  secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa.    Rapu Molekane, former deputy general secretary of the ANC  PWV  [Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] region and current  candidate in the regional legislature, told SUNDAY NATION that  the organisation had received information about the alleged  planned assassination of Mokaba.    "Mokaba knows about his plan," said Molekane. "As in the  past, we are treating the information very seriously".    However, Molekane said the ANCYL investigations had not been  able to establish whether in fact there was a person such as the  one named in the police warning to the ANC.    "No one in the youth league knows such a person," he said.    According to the police, the alleged assassin is said to be  attached to the Boksburg East Branch of the youth league.    But SUNDAY NATION's enquiries revealed that the branch did  not have anyone that answered to the name contained in the  police warning.    "Anyone can be an anonymous caller," Molekane said.    "We do not know whether this is simply more disinformation  from the police to try and cause confusion and panic in the  movement," he said. "Although we welcome any information from  the police, we cannot trust everything they say." He said  Mokaba was not surprised by this information since there had  been other assassination plots and attempts on his life since  the death of the SACP [South African Communist Party] general  secretary Chris Hani.    Two weeks prior Hani's murder, police issued a statement  alleging that Hani had hired people to rob a bank and  subsequently failed to give them their share and as a result,  they were planning to kill him.    ANC legal chief Matthew Phosa said in Hani's case, the  police  statement was clearly aimed at creating a smoke-screen for the  Rightwing to assassinate Hani.    He said this could be deduced from the fact that the  gangsters allegedly waiting to kill Hani were nowhere at the  scene of Hani's killing.    "The latest information smacks of a similar classical scheme  to assassinate either Mokaba or any of the ANC leaders in order  to derail the election process said Phosa.    Others in the ANC believe that the recent information about  assassination plots may well be aimed at trying to sow confusion  and panic in the ranks of the ANC leadership and that there  might well be a plot to kill someone.    Confusion and panic would make the task of the assassin much  easier, ANC leaders said.    They also point out that it is interesting that attempts  were  being made to revive rumours of Mokaba's alleged role as a  police spy. These rumours first emerged in 1990, soon after the  unbanning of the ANC.    But so far, no irrefutable proof has been brought forward to  support the rumours.</p>

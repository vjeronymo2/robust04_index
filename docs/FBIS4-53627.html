			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Fourth installment of four-part article by Shinobu Takeda </F> of NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN's Industrial News Department:  "Centennial Change in Construction Industry"]    [Text] The electric power industry invests 5 trillion yen,  which corresponds to 10 percent of the private sector's demand  for construction, in plant and equipment every year. In  particular, major general contractors (comprehensive  construction firms) stand unrivaled at the construction of  nuclear power plants. Any construction site is lined with the  company flags of Kajima, Taisei, and Shimizu. Large-scale civil  engineering technology and mechanized engineering procedures,  which have been developed through building the nuclear power  plants, are the driving force for those companies to lead far  ahead of other smaller companies, and they have enjoyed the  name, "super general contractors."  <H5>  Leading the Construction of Nuclear Reactors </H5>   Facing the Sea of Japan is the construction site of No. 6  and 7 reactors of the Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd.'s  Kashiwazaki Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant in Niigata. At the site  of No. 7 reactor handled by a joint venture [JV] led by Shimizu  Corporation, world's largest wheel crane lifts reinforcing rods  pre-assembled as a rectangular structure of several tens of  meters, and carries it to the construction site of reactor's  containment vessel.    Next to the No. 7 reactor is the construction site of No. 6  reactor, which is handled by a Kajima-led JV. All-weather  construction method is employed in which the entire construction  field is covered with a temporary roof and walls. Kashiwazaki  is a prominent area of heavy snowfall in Japan. In order to  overcome the delay in construction during wintertime, general  contractors invented an efficient method using large steel  assembled framework and all-weather construction method. These  methods are unique to Japan which cannot be found even in the  Western nations that are advanced in the nuclear power  technology.    The "Atomic Energy Office" was set up in Kajima Corporation  under the supervision of the fourth president (the late)  Morinosuke Kajima in 1956, one year after the Tokyo Electric  Power Co., Ltd. established the "President's Office Atomic Power  Plant Section", the first organization to bear the name of  "atomic power." Kajima's former Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama,  who was arrested in the general contractors' bribery scandal,  was the young hope of the company then. He was sent to the  United Kingdom to learn the technology of Calder-Hall Type No.  1, the world's first commercial nuclear power plant. That  "[he] studied so hard by visiting various places that his shoe  got a hole" is still talked about as a legend in the company.  Morinosuke Kajima did not allow to close the Atomic Power  Office even when its management accumulated a deficit, saying  [the investment in the office] was "prior investment."    The accumulation of knowledge at that time is now useful.  Tokyo Electric has started on the reform of bidding system from  4 April, and it has paved the way for domestic and foreign  entrants to bid for its projects. However, the construction of  a reactor's core is handled by the three super general  contractors. Obayashi Corporation is still the main force in  the construction projects of the Kansai Electric Power Co., Ltd.  and Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd.    Semi-major class contractors tried to absorb the  construction  technology through the JVs. Hitoshi Tobishima, adviser of  Tobishima Corporation says, "All the nine electric companies are  our clients," but, his company cannot attain the level of the  four leading companies. In expectation of the demand for  dismantling reactors after the year 2000, Maeda Construction  Co., Ltd. has developed its own technology to dismantle a  nuclear reactor by applying an electric current to the  reinforcing rods of the reactor's containment vessel. But a  case like Maeda is rare.  <H5>  Contractor's Own Research Laboratories </H5>   Hiroshi Kitamura, vice president of Taisei Corporation,  proudly says, "Japan's general contractors are the only ones  among other construction companies in the world which have their  own research institutes." Each leading company has a laboratory  that is capable of developing and designing antiseismic  structures, skyscrapers, and underground cities. However, even  the research and development expense of Kajima, which is the  largest, is 22 billion yen. The amount corresponds only to 1.3  percent of its sales. Taisei's R&amp;D cost is 15 billion yen,  which is 0.8 percent of its sales. These ratios are merely  1/10th of the level of Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation,  whose R&amp;D expenses amount to 8 to 10 percent of their sales.    Each company has a state-of-the-art supercomputer, and uses  it for structure analysis and various sorts of simulations. But  the reality is that "those computers were purchased in return  for contracts for the construction of semiconductor factories  and main office buildings," according to a major general  contractor. The purchase of supercomputers was for more of a  reciprocal trade than a genuine research and development.    The research and development ability of smaller general  contractors is poor. Japan's first JV was formed only by major  contractors in order to share the risks involved in the  construction of a U.S. base after the war. "The JV was so  powerful that it even asked the Fair Trade Commission whether it  violated the Antimonopoly Law," according to Kajima. But,  without one's knowing it, the nature of JV has changed to a  "convoy" in which small general contractors follow the big ones.  An executive of a major general contractor says, "The  productivity of construction industry is 80 percent of that of  general manufacturing industry," because the number of companies  with bad efficiency are not reduced while there are 530,000  construction companies in the nation. In order to catch up with  the super general contractors, major and semi-major general  contractors, such as Kumagai Gumi Co., Ltd., Tobishima, Hazama,  and Aoki Corporation, invested in real estate at home and  abroad, constructed golf courses, or acquired a hotel chain, but  it all ended in failure, and they are struggling to rebuild  their management. There is a persistent rumor that "Maeda  Construction, a company separated from Tobishima, will help  Tobishima's reconstruction." However, Maeda's head flatly  denied, "It is impossible for a child to swallow its parent."  <H5>  Sense of Crisis in the Ministry of Construction </H5>   Likewise, the super general contractors have diversified  their business, and took contracts worth more than 2 trillion  yen at the peak. Although the amount of contracts declined to  1.3 - 1.4 trillion yen due to the collapse of the economy,  Kazuhiko Kondo, managing director of Shimizu, is not  pessimistic. "Eighty percent of our contracts are taken from  the private sector, and 70 percent of the private-sector  contracts are special orders which are not possible for other  companies to handle." The situation is different from those  local construction firms which are fully dependent on public  works projects, and directly hit by the introduction of open  competitive bidding system.    At the beginning of this year, the head of a super general  contractor expressed a view in a magazine that, "Major  contractors will survive while small and medium ones will go out  of business," and was scolded by the Construction Ministry.  While his remark was certainly inappropriate, the view prevails  in the construction industry now that "the ministry's reaction  to the remark was the reflection of the Construction Ministry's  sense of crisis against the reorganization of the industry."</p>

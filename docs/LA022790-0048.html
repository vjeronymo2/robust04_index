			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAW SOUGHT ON SALES OF ZOO ANIMALS  </P> <P> A City Council committee voted Monday to draft an ordinance barring the Los  Angeles Zoo from selling surplus animals to dealers who supply hunting ranches.  </P> <P> The measure was prompted by a television report that the San Diego Zoo and Wild  Animal Park had sold surplus animals to two dealers who resell them to private  game farms, where they are shot by hunters for sport.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Zoo Director Warren Thomas told the Arts, Health and Humanities  Committee Monday that while the zoo has used the two dealers, there is no  indication that any of the zoo's animals ended up at hunting ranches. Thomas  said the zoo had checked out both dealers and found them to be "reputable."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Thomas said the Los Angeles Zoo has stopped doing business with  the dealers, Earl Tatum and Jim Fouts, on orders from Mayor Tom Bradley. The  dealings may be resumed after the American Assn. of Zoological Parks and  Aquariums concludes an investigation, he said.  </P> <P> Councilman Joel Wachs, who chairs the committee, said he also wants language  included in the ordinance that will require better tracking of animals after  they are sold by the zoo.  </P></p>

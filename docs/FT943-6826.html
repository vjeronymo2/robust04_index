			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: GE confirms interest in Lindner General Electric of the US yesterday confirmed that it was interested in acquiring a stake in Lindner, the German-based light-bulb maker. General Electric's renewed interest in the company followed a decision earlier this week by Germany's Federal Cartel Office to reject a proposed takeover of Lindner by Philips, the Dutch-based manufacturer of light bulbs. The cartel office argued the proposed takeover would strengthen Philips' dominant position in the German market. Along with Osram, a subsidiary of Siemens, Philips holds 80 per cent of the German light bulb market. Philips yesterday said the company had not decided whether to appeal against the decision at the Kammergericht, Germany's appeal court. The cartel office ruling could clear the way for GE. It said it had an interest in Lindner. Previous talks between the two ended by mutual agreement in October 1993. GE said Germany was a 'strategic and important market for all of General Electric'. Last year's turnover in the country's lighting market totalled Dollars 600m. General Electric Lighting, the German subsidiary of GE, has 9 per cent of the German market.</p>

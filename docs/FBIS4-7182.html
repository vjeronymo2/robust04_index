			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- New Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata formed his cabinet on Thursday to govern Japan with a  fragile minority government following the walkout of a key  coalition ally.    The cabinet formation came after the Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] spurned Hata's eleventh hour bid to  lure it back into the fold of the coalition following a fray  over a new parliamentary bloc.    Newly appointed Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai  announced the new cabinet lineup at a news conference.    Kumagai dismissed suggestions that the new cabinet is  dominated by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], led by Hata, a  core party in the coalition, while acknowledging that the new  government faces difficulties due to the withdrawal of the SDP.    The SDP's withdrawal makes the coalition a minority force in  both chambers of the Diet. The party had six cabinet posts in  the eight-month-long administration of former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa.    The strength of Shinseito shot up to nine portfolios from  five in the previous cabinet, while Komeito [Clean Government  Party] gained two more cabinet posts to six. The Democratic  Socialist Party (DSP) increased its cabinet strength to two from  one.    The pullout raises the specter of an early general election  if the SDP throws its weight behind a possible LDP move to table  a no-confidence motion against the Hata administration.    Hata, who was elected as premier by the Diet on Monday, was  ceremonially appointed prime minister by Emperor Akihito earlier  Thursday. He replaced Hosokawa, whose seven-party majority  alliance last August ousted the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  from 38 years of unbroken rule.    "We took pains in deciding upon the makeup of the new  cabinet, because the SDP pulled out of the coalition," Kumagai  of Shinseito said. "We followed the principle of appropriating  cabinet posts to the most suitable personnel and I believe  excellent people from each party have been nominated to the  important cabinet posts," he said.    Koji Kakizawa of the Liberal Party, an LDP splinter party,  became foreign minister, succeeding Hata.    Kakizawa told a new conference that of the urgent problems  to  be tackled, "Japan wants to improve Japan-U.S. economic  relations, while playing a responsible part in cooperation with  the United Nations to have North Korea clear up suspicions over  its nuclear arms development."    Shinseito held key posts in the cabinet. Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii retained his post. Mutsuki Kato assumed the post  of agriculture, fishery and forestry minister, replacing  Shinseito's Eijiro Hata, who was shifted to the post of minister  of international trade and industry, succeeding Kumagai.    Hajime Ishii assumed the office of home affairs minister,  while Shigeto Nagano assumed the office of justice minister,  replacing Akira Mikazuki, a nonpolitician. Both are Shinseito  members.    From Komeito, chairman Koshiro Ishida retained his portfolio  as chief of the Management and Coordination Agency and Nobuyuki  Futami assumed the transport portfolio, while Katsuyuki Hikasa  took the office of posts and telecommunications minister. Koji  Morimoto was appointed to the post of construction minister.    Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), also kept his portfolio.  Atsushi Kanda of the DSP was named the chief of the Defense  Agency.    Kunio Hatoyama, an independent and LDP defector, assumed the  post of labor minister.    Yoshio Terasawa, a House of Councillors member of Hosokawa's  Japan New Party (JNP) and former vice president of Nomura  Securities Co, was named to lead the Economic Planning Agency.  The post was the only one the JNP could keep in the cabinet.    The new cabinet will be formally inaugurated following the  attestation ceremony at the Imperial Agency in the presence of  Emperor Akihiro.    In a meeting between Hata and SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama  earlier in the day, Hata pleaded with Murayama to rescind a  decision to pull out of the coalition, coalition officials said.    "I apologize for the latest development," Hata was quoted as  telling Murayama. "It would be tragic if our joint efforts to  create a new era with the formation of the eight-month coalition  bogged down."    Murayama, emerging from the meeting with Hata, told  reporters  his party stuck to its decision to get out of the alliance. The  determination "has remained unchanged," he said.    The SDP walked out from the ruling coalition Tuesday after  being enraged by the abrupt establishment of a unified  parliamentary bloc by conservative groups, but excluding the SDP.    The parliamentary strength of the coalition, now without the  backing of the SDP, dropped to 182 members in the powerful  511-seat lower house -- far short of the 256 seats needed for a  majority.    The LDP, the primary opposition group, has 206 members,  while  the SDP has 74 and new party Sakigake, a party that belonged to  Hosokawa's coalition but has now chosen to support the Hata  administration from outside the cabinet, has 15 members.</p>

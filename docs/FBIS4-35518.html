			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 31 May (INA)--Vice President Taha Yasin  Ramadan has said that U.S. officials' nervous statements reflect  U.S. isolation at the UN Security Council and the fact that U.S.  misleading tactics have been exposed after the development of  the stands of most UN Security Council member states and their  calls for raising the issue of lifting the unjust blockade  imposed on Iraq.    During a meeting with a delegation from the Tunisian  commission for lifting the blockade imposed on Iraq under  'Izz-al-Din al-Shabi, the vice president added: America's  agents and slaves from among Arab and other rulers are suffering  the same isolation. He stressed that the children of Arabism  will avenge their nation and will punish those who turned Arab  land, waters, and wealth into tools to strike at great Iraq and  its independent revolutionary course.    Taha Yasin Ramadan said that the blockade will be terminated  thanks to the will of the Iraqi people, who set an example in  willpower, patience, jihad, and construction. He praised the  genuine pan-Arab stands of the Arab people in Tunis and  everywhere in the Arab world. He commended their endorsement of  the causes that Iraq has volunteered to defend and paid immense  sacrifices for their sake.    'Izz-al-Din al-Shabi praised President Saddam Husayn's brave  leadership, which has become a beacon exposing agents and  traitors. He stressed the free Arabs' love for Saddam Husayn  because his excellency has become a symbol of the Arab love for  freedom, independence, and progress and rejection subordination  and colonialism.</p>

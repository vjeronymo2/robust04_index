			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Sheffield Insulations gives court undertakings Sheffield Insulations Group's subsidiary, Sheffield Insulations, has given undertakings in the restrictive practices court not to give effect to certain agreements which related to the supply of insulation products in 1986. These agreements were alleged by the Office of Fair Trading to have been in existence for only a fairly short time at the end of that year and were said to have attempted to fix maximum discounts for the supply of certain insulation materials. Sheffield Insulations consistently denied that it had been party to such agreement, but accepted that there had been an agreement to continue the long-standing and accepted practice of quoting prices on the basis of variable discounts from list prices. The company said this was not effective to limit in any way the prices paid by the customer and it was on this basis that it gave undertakings to the court.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Good news for the Coke bottle - Analysis THE COCA-COLA bottle may largely have been replaced by the can in the UK, but its distinctive shape is still inextricably linked to Coke's name and brand image. However, that link is not recognised under UK law. The government's proposed bill on trademarks aims, through one of its measures, to remedy that. In future a distinctive-shaped bottle will be able to be registered in the same way as a brand name. The proposed reforms were welcomed yesterday by anti-counterfeiting campaigners, retailers and trademark consultants. The bill is almost certain to become law - it is unlikely that opponents to the principles of the reform will emerge, even if lawyers want to pick over the details. Mr Bill Bryce, head of trademarks at international drinks group Guinness, who chairs the Anti-Counterfeiting Group, said he was 'highly delighted' and that at last the law would reflect 'business as it is in this century'. The current trademarks act dates from 1938 and proposals for reform have been on the books for nearly 20 years. The act states that a mark 'includes a device, brand, heading, label, ticket, name, signature, word, letter, numeral or any combination thereof'. While the wording does not specifically rule out shape, a House of Lords ruling against Coca-Cola in 1986 made clear that the law as it stands now cannot allow a shape, however distinctive, to be registered as a trade-mark. Manufacturers have to resort to common law actions for 'passing off' if they want to prevent others stealing their designs - a difficult and time-consuming process, says Mr Bryce. Guinness will now be able to register its distinctive Haig's dimple and the Johnnie Walker square bottle. Ms Janet Fogg, managing director of trademark consultancy Markforce Associates, said the bill, by implementing a European directive on the subject, would also allow the move towards a Europe-wide trademark system. Beyond Europe, it would allow the UK to ratify an international treaty, known as the Madrid Agreement, which should eventually provide protection for trademarks more widely, particularly in the develop-ing markets of eastern Europe.</p>

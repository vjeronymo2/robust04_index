			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Western banks blamed for Bombay securities scandal Four foreign banks were accused by Indian MPs yesterday of being 'the originators' and 'the biggest players' in last year's Rs40bn (Pounds 850m) Bombay securities market scandal. An all-party committee of MPs said the banks - Standard Chartered of the UK, Australian-owned ANZ Grindlays, and Citibank and Bank of America of the US - should have their licences suspended. The MPs issued a damning report on the country's financial system and called for reform and for severe punishment of those held responsible for the affair. The report also rounded on Indian banks, stockbrokers, the Reserve Bank of India - the country's central bank - and the Ministry of Finance for failing to regulate and supervise the markets properly. It fell short of criticising Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, by name but said he was responsible to parliament for his ministry's shortcomings. Analysts in Delhi last night were busy digesting the 322-page document, which has taken more than a year to produce. The initial reaction was that political impact would be limited because Mr Manmohan Singh, the architect of India's economic reforms, would be most unlikely to resign, nor would any of the three present and former ministers named in the report. Government ministers were meeting late last night under the chairmanship of Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, to consider their reaction. Analysts said the government would have to take serious note of the committee's recommendations on financial reforms and on punishment for alleged wrongdoers, including the foreign banks. Standard Chartered said it was wrong to single out foreign banks for punishment when Indian banks were equally involved in the scandal. Suspension of bank was an 'extreme' punishment that would not square with India's planned globalisation of its economy. Citibank and BankAmerica were both guarded in their reaction. Citibank, however, hinted that it would be a mistake for India to throw out some of its biggest foreign banks. It said it could make a 'special contribution' to India's banking sector, especially with the development of services such as credit cards, automated teller machines, corporate finance and corporate cash management. Evidence emerged in April 1992 that funds were being illegally siphoned out of the banking system into the stock market through the collusion of brokers, banks and public and private-sector companies. As the huge scale of the abuses emerged, a cabinet minister resigned and about 20 people were arrested. Financial establishment savaged Page 4 Editorial Comment Page 11</p>

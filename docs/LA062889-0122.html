			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXCERPTS OF ROSE'S DEPOSITION APRIL 20-21  </P> <P> Excerpts of Pete Rose's deposition on April 20-21 under questioning by baseball  investigator John Dowd:  </P> <P> On Thomas P. Gioiosa, guns and cocaine  </P> <P> Rose was asked if he ever knew whether Gioiosa was carrying a gun.  </P> <P> Rose: I never seen him with a pistol or anything.  </P> <P> Dowd: Were you aware that he was carrying cocaine from Florida?  </P> <P> Rose: No, I wasn't aware of that.  </P> <P> Dowd: to Ohio?  </P> <P> Rose: I heard rumors about that and I tried to put two and two together. And I  can't honestly look you in the eye and say anything negative about (Paul)  Janszen, (Donald) Stenger, (Michael) Fry, Gioiosa, with cocaine. I mean I never  saw it around me.  </P> <P> On betting baseball:  </P> <P> Dowd: On baseball, Pete, did anybody in association with you bet on baseball or  talk about betting on baseball in 1984 to 1988?  </P> <P> Rose: I don't know what you mean talk about betting on baseball. No one bet  baseball around me.  </P> <P> Dowd: That's what I want to know. Did anybody discuss . . .  </P> <P> Rose: I don't understand what you mean talking about it.  </P> <P> Dowd: Discuss it. Did they say, "Hey Pete," you know, "should I bet on the Reds  today?"  </P> <P> Rose: No . . .  </P> <P> Dowd: "Should I bet on the Dodgers?" "Should I bet on the Yanks?" "What do they  look like?" "Who's pitching?"  </P> <P> Rose: No.  </P> <P> Dowd: Any . . . ever any discussion like that?  </P> <P> Rose: No. No way.  </P> <P> Dowd: Anybody ever ask you for advice or direction as to how they ought to  place bets on professional major league baseball?  </P> <P> Rose: No.  </P> <P> Dowd: And I take it you didn't offer it? You never volunteered it to anybody?  </P> <P> Rose: I wouldn't know how to do it.  </P> <P> Dowd: But you didn't do it?  </P> <P> Rose: Did not do it. I did not do it.  </P> <P> Dowd: Right, 1984 to 1988, you never did it?  </P> <P> Rose: No, I never did it ever. 1974. 1964. Never.  </P> <P> Dowd: Fine.  </P> <P> Rose: Not just '84 to '88. . . . That's why I was sort of surprised to read the  statements by Mike Fry in the Sports Illustrated. Or where in the hell he got  those statements at.  </P> <P> Dowd: And what statements were those, Pete?  </P> <P> Rose: That I . . . he quoted me as saying, well I like to bet on the Reds and I  like to bet on baseball. This would be a good day to bet. That's a bunch of  (expletive).  </P> <P> On Janszen and drugs:  </P> <P> Dowd: I take it you never had a conversation with him (Paul Janszen) about  drugs?  </P> <P> Rose: No. No. So I think that's why he probably started hanging with me so  close. . . . It kind of seems to me that those fellows were all trying to link  gambling to me because they were all in trouble with drugs. . . . Blackmail. He  said he was going to tell the commissioner I bet on baseball. He was going to  kill my wife. He was going to cripple my kids. . . . And I knew for a fact when  I went to spring training this year that he was going to go to the  commissioner's office.  </P> <P> On Reds owner Marge Schott:  </P> <P> Rose: Well, first of all, when I got 4,192, Marge Schott made it appear that  she gave me a Corvette. But she didn't give me the Corvette. General Motors  gave me the Corvette. If Marge would have gave it to me, I probably wouldn't  have sold it.  </P> <P> Dowd: Why is that?  </P> <P> Rose: Because she's the owner of the ballclub. She made it appear . . . you  don't know Marge Schott like we know Marge Schott. I mean she made it appear  that she gave it to me, the way she handled it.  </P></p>

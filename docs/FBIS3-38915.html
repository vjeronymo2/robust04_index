			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Asked how he explains the government's double  talk on Bosnia-Herzegovina, government spokesman Evangelos  Venizelos said the communique issued by the European Union [EU]  Council of Ministers, which conferred in Brussels yesterday,  does not contradict Greek positions. He said the firm Greek  view--not just the government's--that Balkan countries should  not get involved in any war remains firm. He added that Foreign  Minister Karolos Papoulias' handling of things was calm and  responsible. [passage omitted]    Asked whether the Greek presidency contacted the Serb  leadership immediately after the EU foreign ministers communique  was issued, Venizelos said Greece has the capability to contact  and pressure all sides for a solution. He added: This  capability is not limited to Serbia.</p>

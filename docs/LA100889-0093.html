			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: LAUGHING GAS?  </P> <P> Producer John Davis got a mixed message at a test screening of "Enid is  Sleeping" last week: The opening scene had some viewers laughing -- and others  marching out in disgust.  </P> <P> The scene in question: A little girl puts her baby sister into an oven and  turns on the gas, followed by a lingering interior shot of the infant as the  oven heats up. The black comedy -- which stars Judge Reinhold and Elizabeth  Perkins -- then reveals that both sisters have survived to adulthood.  </P> <P> Davis said the scene was included to show "the genesis of the sibling rivalry  between the two sisters."  </P> <P> "It may or may not end up in the picture," the producer added. "This is a very  preliminary cut . . . the whole movie could be different in two weeks."  </P> <P> Produced last year by now-defunct Vestron Pictures, "Enid" is currently looking  for a distributor.

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Slimmed-down Ropner shows sharp decline to Pounds 5.53m ROPNER, the Darlington based mini-conglomerate, reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 7.51m to Pounds 5.53m last year as it continued pruning its peripheral businesses. Property profits for 1990 were slashed to Pounds 394,000 (Pounds 5.02m). Engineering profits fell to Pounds 537,000 (Pounds 727,000) and contributions from shipping to Pounds 1.41m (Pounds 2.91m). The insurance brokerage side, since sold, suffered a loss of Pounds 979,000 following a loss of Pounds 954,000 the previous year. The lower profits were, however, in line with forecasts as the outcome for 1989 was boosted by an exceptional contribution of Pounds 3.6m arising from the disposal of investment property. The setbacks were partially offset by a surge in investment income to Pounds 2.11m (Pounds 105,000) and by a fall in interest payable to Pounds 815,000 (Pounds 2.09m). Turnover was down 44 per cent to Pounds 35.39m (Pounds 63.52m). The figures reflected both a slowdown in activity and the effects of withdrawal from several businesses. Following the disposal of its property development activities, the group sold Hozelock, its garden products division, in June. Ropner Insurance Holdings, its insurance broking business, was sold in April. The disposals leave the group with shipping, engineering and property investment as core businesses. 'We feel that we have now achieved the optimum profile of the group,' said Mr Roger Winter, finance director. The disposals - together with the sale of two ships - brought an extraordinary gain of Pounds 8.31m, and increased the consolidated net asset value of the group to Pounds 39.11m from Pounds 26.14m in 1989. Due to the restructuring, the group has about Pounds 17m in cash. This should further increase its investment income this year while the trading climate for engineering remains grim and no significant rises are expected in investment property or shipping, Mr Winter said. Earnings per share fell to 15.8p (16.8p) and a final dividend of 4.75p is recommended for a total of 8.25p (7.5p).</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE'S DAN MCGWIRE FACING TALL ORDERS NOW;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE 6-8 QUARTERBACK PASSED FOR 3,651 YARDS LAST SEASON, AND  HE EXPECTS CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT THIS SEASON.  </P> <P> The videos were a hit last fall. They featured the San Diego State-of-the-art  offense directed by the Aztecs' long, tall quarterback, Dan McGwire. They got a  thumbs-up from most of the critics.  </P> <P> McGwire was called the most underrated quarterback in the country in 1989 by  one publication. He has been highly touted by two others this year.  </P> <P> For the most part, the critics saw the videos -- in the form of game films or  television highlights -- and raved. But there are a couple who, although  impressed, think McGwire, the tallest quarterback in NCAA Division I at  6-feet-8, can deliver more. They are McGwire's toughest critics.  </P> <P> Their names are Al Luginbill, San Diego State's coach, and . . . Dan McGwire.  </P> <P> When the two flipped on the VCR in the Aztec football operations center and  plugged in game films last season, they both liked what they saw. But both  wanted more.  </P> <P> Yes, Luginbill, kept saying, Danny is a good quarterback. But he can be better.  </P> <P> When the season ended. McGwire took a couple of weeks to unwind. He reread the  statistical sheets, replayed a few games in his head and came to that very  conclusion. He had been a thrower, he determined, not a quarterback.  </P> <P> Yes, this was the same McGwire who had thrown for 3,651 yards in 1989, the  second-highest single-season total in school history and ninth-best for a  season in the pass-happy Western Athletic Conference -- and the same guy who  completed 258 of 440 passes for 57%.  </P> <P> He did all of that in what was basically an adjustment year for him, when he  spent much of his time answering questions about his transfer from Iowa and  about being the younger brother of Oakland Athletics star Mark McGwire.  </P> <P> "I thought he made the adjustment very well," Luginbill said. "I don't think  there are too many people in college football who threw for over 3,400 yards in  their first year. Ty Detmer didn't."  </P> <P> True. Detmer, the Brigham Young star, passed for 1,252 yards in 1988, his first  season.  </P> <P> So what's the problem?  </P> <P> "I'm a thrower," McGwire said, slowly. "I remember seeing (Detmer) on the field  last year, how he moved the chains. It's amazing how he is so precise and crisp  in his passing. He doesn't have a strong arm.  </P> <P> "Anybody can be a thrower. A quarterback is someone who can move the chains,  someone who makes the right decisions on the right downs. A quarterback has got  to be aware of all of that -- what down it is, what yardage he needs."  </P> <P> McGwire said he wasn't as aware of what he needed to do in certain situations  last season as he needed to be.  </P> <P> "Last year, there were times I'd force balls," he said. "That's not being a  quarterback. I'd get greedy.  </P> <P> "Example: BYU. I threw a touchdown pass over the middle. The next time, I tried  to go over the middle again, and it got picked off. I've got to take what they  give me. When they take the middle away, I've got to go over the top. I have to  be more aware of that than I am -- knowing down and distance."  </P> <P> McGwire discusses the things you would expect a guy starting his senior season  of eligibility to talk about, such as how badly he wants to lead the Aztecs to  a bowl game this season and what his prospects might be in the NFL draft. But  the conversation usually ranges back to the improvement he needs to make if  things are to go as he hopes.  </P> <P> He is the marquee player on a team picked by WAC coaches to finish fifth in the  conference. His height allows him good vision all over the field and a strong  arm gives him the ability to throw the football just about anywhere he wants.  </P> <P> "In practice, very few people I've been with can throw a seven-step deep  comeback route like he can," said Steve Fairchild, Aztec quarterback coach.  "I'm talking about a route where he's dropping back 10 yards and the guy is  running 20. Sometimes he throws 20 yards across the field and it doesn't arc at  all. It's just a rope, a flat rope.  </P> <P> "It's hard not to be impressed with the guy's arm strength."  </P> <P> The Aztecs finished 6-5-1 in 1989, their first winning season since '86, and  that was largely because of McGwire. They averaged 30.7 points a game.  </P> <P> But it was a learning experience in a couple of ways. Not only was McGwire new  to San Diego State last season, Luginbill and his staff were also in their  first year.  </P> <P> "Last year, there was a new coaching staff and a new scheme," McGwire said. "I  think people will see a new Dan McGwire this year."  </P> <P> To that end, he followed a special workout program this summer devised by David  Ohton, the team's strength and conditioning coach. The sessions, designed to  increase McGwire's foot speed and agility, lasted for six weeks.  </P> <P> "We have such a quick, drop-back passing game here," McGwire said. "Being a big  guy, I need to be quick."  </P> <P> Three days a week, for an hour a day, McGwire worked out in the sand. He ran  10-play series, working on his bootlegs, play-actions, handoffs and drop-backs  of various distances. He ran 40- and 15-yard sprints.  </P> <P> "He trained much like a boxer, soccer player or volleyball player," Ohton said.  "The first week, when he was jumping over cones laterally, he was like an  ostrich. Terrible. After a week, he went over the cones like they weren't even  there. In three weeks, he accomplished more than a lot of athletes. Not just  quarterbacks, athletes."  </P> <P> The goal was to do so many repetitions in the sand that McGwire would not even  think about foot placement as he backpedaled. Then, when he moved onto the  grass, it would come naturally and he would be quicker.  </P> <P> "You see a big man like that backpedal and you think he's slow," Ohton said.  "But he's not. He's 245 pounds and he is solid."  </P> <P> McGwire gained about 10 pounds during the summer and said he would like to  maintain a weight somewhere between 240 and 245 this season. Last season, he  said, he weighed about 235 at the start but lost about 15 by the time the  Aztecs were finished.  </P> <P> "I think it affected me," he said.  </P> <P> He is also stronger. His bench press is up to 325 pounds from 280.  </P> <P> "All of my lifts are improving," he said. "I feel really strong. I feel really  good as far as the physical part (goes)."  </P> <P> But McGwire is as concerned with the mental nuances of the game as with the  physical part this season. One of the things that bothered him in 1989 was his  yardage and touchdowns-to-interceptions ratio. He threw for 16 touchdowns and  19 interceptions. By comparison, Detmer, his WAC measuring stick who threw for  4,560 yards, had 32 touchdowns and only 15 interceptions.  </P> <P> "Mentally, it was a bad fall for me," he said. "That was (the coaches') big  key, and mine, during the spring. In the spring, I really worked on decision  making. I wanted to be a better decision maker."  </P> <P> Luginbill is happy with McGwire's progress.  </P> <P> "A quarterback uses his offense, moves the chains and is patient," Luginbill  said. "Dan has all of these qualities. Now, he needs to execute. He had two  interceptions in close to 200 throws in spring practice (during scrimmages),  and one of those was a tipped ball. Those are the kinds of things we're looking  for.  </P> <P> "I'm excited about him because of the progress he's made, and he should be,  too."  </P> <P> Said McGwire: "I thought I was doing all right, but when I go back and evaluate  . . . A lot of people say I had a good year numbers-wise but, if I made the  right decisions, the numbers could have been astronomical.  </P> <P> "I'm not a big-numbers guy. I want to move the chains on our way to putting  points on the board. For the team to win, I need to throw the ball. All of my  individual goals will come in team success on the field."  </P></p>

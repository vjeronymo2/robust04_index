			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUIT FILED TO APPEAL LIMITS ON ABORTIONS  </P> <P> Opening a new round in the legal battle over abortion, a coalition of civil  rights and women's groups Tuesday asked a state Court of Appeal to strike down  the Legislature's latest restrictions on state-funded abortions for low-income  women.  </P> <P> The action represents the first test of abortion rights in California since the  U.S. Supreme Court last week gave states more power to limit abortion without  violating federal constitutional standards.  </P> <P> The legislative restrictions, included in the 1989-90 budget signed last week  by Gov. George Deukmejian, would bar state funding for about 90% of the 80,000  abortions now being performed annually under the Medi-Cal program at a cost of  about $25 million.  </P> <P> Under the limitations, state-funded abortions would be permitted only if the  mother's life is in danger, the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, the  unborn child was severely deformed or when unmarried minors have notified their  parents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Right to Privacy Issue  </P> <P> Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups contended in  a suit filed with the appeals court that the restrictions violate the right to  privacy and other provisions of the California Constitution.  </P> <P> Similar abortion-funding limits have been overturned by state courts for the  last 11 years and have never taken effect. But anti-abortion forces have  expressed hope that their cause has been given new momentum by the U.S. Supreme  Court ruling, which, while not changing California law, did ease the way for  states to curb abortion.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, an attorney for the state Department of Health Services, one of the  defendants in the suit, said the state plans to cite the federal high court  ruling in its defense of the Legislature's restrictions on funding.  </P> <P> "This is a 12-year-old lawsuit and the issues aren't that different," said  William D. Lockett, assistant chief counsel for the department. "The only thing  that is different is the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. And we'll try to use that  to our advantage."  </P> <P> A liberal-dominated state Supreme Court held in 1981 that limits on Medi-Cal  abortions violated the state constitutional right to privacy. But in 1987, the  court underwent a dramatic philosophical realignment that put conservatives in  the majority, leading to speculation that it might take a new look at the  issue.  </P> <P> Since then, however, the justices have twice sidestepped the question, refusing  to review appeal court rulings invalidating abortion-funding restrictions. Nor  has the new high court had an opportunity in any case to set forth its views on  the scope of the state right to privacy.  </P> <P> At a news conference, lawyers for the groups challenging the new restrictions  on abortion rejected the suggestion that last week's U.S. Supreme Court ruling  could provide new incentive for the state high court to tackle the issue. Such  an opportunity could come within months in the form of an appeal from whatever  decision is issued by the appellate court in the abortion-funding case.  </P> <P> "All we can say is we hope and expect this court to be principled and obey its  own precedents," said Margaret C. Crosby, staff counsel for the ACLU of  Northern California. "I have no reason to fear the state Supreme Court."  </P> <P> The suit asked the appeals court by Friday to issue a temporary stay of the new  budget restrictions and bar state officials from notifying Medi-Cal recipients  of those limitations. Then, after briefs are filed, the court should  permanently block enforcement of the restrictions as it has in the past, the  suit contended.  </P> <P> The restrictions, the suit said, "would immediately result in a profound,  disastrous effect on the lives of the poor." Only about 10% of the low-income  women seeking state-funded abortion would be able to meet the new requirements,  it said.  </P> <P> The suit argued that the restrictions collide directly with the state Supreme  Court's 1981 ruling, violating the state provision to rights to privacy and  equal protection of the law.  </P> <P> Further, it said, the limitations conflict with another state constitutional  provision requiring that bills passed by the Legislature be limited to a  "single subject." The legislators improperly used the Budget Act, which  involves appropriations, to make substantive changes in separate laws  authorizing abortions in the Medi-Cal program, the suit said.  </P> <P> In the last two years, the state Court of Appeal has agreed with such a  contention, striking down abortion-funding limits as violating both the state  right to privacy and the legislative single-subject rule.  </P></p>

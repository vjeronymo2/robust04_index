			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Interior Ministry issued a sudden decision on  Thursday, 24 February, expelling two foreign correspondents, the  chief of REUTER, Cairo, and another Western reporter (believed  to be AFP's), to punish them for covering acts of violence and  publishing reports without checking out their validity.    The decision was made at the peak of police wrath at foreign  correspondents. A week ago, the Interior Ministry summoned the  AFP bureau chief and reproached him for circulating inaccurate  reports. He was accused of hostility to Egypt and threatened  with expulsion.    AL-SHA'B has learned that the Ministry of Information was  not  notified of the expulsion decision, but the information minister  learned of the matter at the last moment -- before the decision  was enforced -- from the foreign correspondents association. He  made immediate contacts that resulted in revoking the expulsion  decision.    Not only did Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif revoke  the  decision, he even met with the board of the Foreign  Correspondents Association last Saturday and voiced his  confidence in them. He assured them that his ministry and not  the Ministry of Interior, will be responsible for dealing with  foreign correspondents.    It is rumored that the information minister's decision has  created a crisis between his ministry and the Ministry of  Interior.</p>

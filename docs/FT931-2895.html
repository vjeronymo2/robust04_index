			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Grolsch climbs 3.6% over year GROLSCH, the Dutch brewery group, posted a 3.6 per cent rise in net profit in 1992, with the recession in the UK and the economic slowdown in Germany overshadowing more buoyant results in the Netherlands and on other export markets. Net profit increased to Fl 43.4m (Dollars 23.2m) from Fl 41.9m in 1991, when the rate of profit growth had totalled 10.6 per cent. Volume sales expanded domestically, in the US and in other export markets. But in the UK, where it acquired Ruddles, the brewer, in early 1992, the company faced reduced beer volumes and adverse currency movements caused by sterling's autumn devaluation. In Germany sales volume also fell under the combined influence of the economic downturn and the winding down of the 'B' brands of the Wickuler group, acquired by Grolsch in 1991. The annual dividend is to be raised by 3.8 per cent to Fl 5.40, which compares with the previous year's 10.6 per cent rise. The company also announced plans for a five-for-one share split. Group operating profit rose by 15.3 per cent to Fl 64.3m. But the acquisitions of Ruddles and investments in Wickuler added a net Fl 8.9m to interest charges. Overall, Grolsch incurred net financial expenses of Fl 3.6m, a reversal of the previous year when it had posted net financial income of Fl 5.2m. Results in 1993 are expected to match those for 1992, provided that there is no deepening of the recession or adverse movement in exchange rates, Grolsch said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This SNPRM focuses on two issues raised in the NPRM and addressed by the commenters: (1) The implementation schedule and (2) the wheels to be controlled by an antilock brake system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation Schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, NHTSA stated that its goal is to achieve significant improvements in braking performance at a reasonable cost to manufacturers and consumers. Based on the available information, NHTSA decided to propose the following implementation schedule: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=38 g=1 f=1 --> Truck Tractors <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 2 years after final rule (1996)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Trailers, including converter dollies <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 3 years after final rule (1997)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Single unit trucks <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 4 years after final rule (1998)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Buses <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 5 years after final rule (1999) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA believed that this implementation schedule is appropriate given the current state of ABS technology. The agency believed that it would provide the industry, ABS manufacturers, and maintenance personnel sufficient leadtime to prepare for the changes that will be required to accommodate the new technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to truck tractors, NHTSA stated that it was confident that ABS for this type of vehicle would be fully developed, performance tested, and field tested within two years after the final rule since ABS manufacturers have focused their initial efforts on developing ABS for truck tractors. The agency noted that ABS for truck tractors is currently available on a commercial basis in this country and throughout Europe. Nevertheless, a two year leadtime appeared to be necessary to ensure a smooth transition before the agency mandated this technology given the technical complexities and costs associated with ABS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to trailers, NHTSA noted that ABS manufacturers are currently marketing ABS for these vehicles. NHTSA stated that it expected its fleet evaluation on 50 ABS-equipped trailers to be completed in 1993. (This evaluation, titled ``An In-Service Evaluation of the Performance, Reliability, Maintainability, and Durability of Antilock Braking Systems (ABSs) for Semitrailers'' has been completed and is available for review in the agency's public docket room. The agency welcomes comments about the report.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to single-unit trucks and buses, NHTSA proposed leadtime of four years and five years, respectively, after the final rule's publication, resulting in an effective date in 1998 and 1999. NHTSA proposed effective dates that it believed would give the industry sufficient leadtime to develop, field test, and performance test ABS on straight trucks and buses. The agency also explained that ABS for such vehicles is still being developed, so these leadtimes appeared to be necessary to ensure that the technology would be reliable when it is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), which represents the eight major domestic truck manufacturers, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  recommended that the effective dates for the proposed heavy vehicle stability and control requirements and the previously proposed stopping distance requirements be ``synchronized for the various vehicle types.'' (58 FR 11009, February 23, 1993). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Chrysler, Ford, Freightliner, General Motors, Mack, Navistar, PACCAR, and Volvo-GM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  The February NPRM proposed that the stopping distance requirements take effect two years after the final rule for all applicable vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> AAMA recommended that the agency adopt the following effective dates for both the stability and control requirements and the stopping distance requirements, assuming that the two rules are issued before September 1994: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=38 g=1 f=1 --> Truck tractors <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 2 years after final rule (1996)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Trailers, including converter dollies <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 3 years after final rule (1997)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air-braked single unit trucks and buses <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 3 years after final rule (1997)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hydraulic-braked single unit trucks and buses <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 4 years after final rule (1998) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, manufacturers of brake components and antilock brake systems recommended that the implementation schedule for the lateral stability and control requirements be accelerated. Rockwell requested that the leadtime for air-braked single unit trucks and buses be shortened to three years after the final rule. The Heavy Duty Brake Manufacturers Council requested that the effective dates of the stopping distance rulemaking and the stability rulemaking be ``made coincident to allow the industry to maximize its efforts by effectively utilizing its limited resources.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

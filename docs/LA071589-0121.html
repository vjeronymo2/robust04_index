At John Wayne Airport, he will supervise a staff of 26  controllers. He said Friday that he might ask for one or two more controllers  later this year, when new air safety zones are scheduled to be implemented  around John Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> Takeoffs and landings totaled 533,484 at John Wayne Airport in 1988, compared  to 623,519 at Los Angeles International Airport.  </P> <P> Aircraft arriving and departing John Wayne Airport are controlled within a  five-mile radius by the FAA tower there. Beyond that radius, aircraft are  controlled by Coast TRACON.  </P></p>

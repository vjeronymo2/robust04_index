			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, May 31 (AFP) -- Serbs from the  self-proclaimed republic of Krajina in Croatia Tuesday [31 May]  blocked UN aid convoys destined for the north-west Bosnian  pocket of Bihac, the spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees, Peter Kessler, said. The Krajina Serbs have for the  past two weeks held up convoys destined for the south of the  Bihac pocket, which is controlled by the mainly-Moslem Bosnian  government army. On Tuesday they extended the ban to convoys  going to Velika Kladusa, headquarters of the maverick Moslem  leader Fikret Abdic whose forces are fighting the Bosnian army.    Until the latest move, convoys for Velika Kladusa could  leave  Krajina without authorisation. "The Serbs now want us to provide  authorisation for every convoy, one week in advance, from Knin,"  the headquarters of the Krajina Serbs, Kessler said. An  estimated 230,000 people living in Bihac, surrounded by Krajina  and Bosnian Serbs, depend on the UN delivering around 2,900  tonnes of food per month.</p>

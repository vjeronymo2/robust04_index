			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Radio Clyde falls 42% RADIO CLYDE Holdings, the Glasgow-based commercial radio company that recently merged with Radio Forth, was hit by a slump in national advertising in the first half of the year. Pre-tax profit fell by nearly 42 per cent to Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 1.2m) on turnover down 26 per cent to Pounds 3.46m (Pounds 4.68m) in the six months to March 31. National advertising revenue fell by 39 per cent, whereas the local decline was only 5 per cent. At the half-way stage, Clyde had Pounds 3m cash and had earned Pounds 220,000 (Pounds 180,000) in interest. Mr John Bowman, finance director, said the war chest was still intact after the all-share Radio Forth deal. The group's ambitions for growth extended to local radio south of the border as well as to a possible bid for the first national commercial station. It has taken a 40 per cent stake in Buzz FM a new statio in Birmingham, and increased its stake in Satellite Media Services to 28.6 per cent. Earnings per share fell to 7.3p (12.2p). The interim dividend is held at 3.25p, but cost goes up to Pounds 291,000 (Pounds 205,000) because of payments to former holders of Forth shares.</p>

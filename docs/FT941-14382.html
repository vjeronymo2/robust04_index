			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Volume surges on Budapest exchange Trading volume on the Budapest stock exchange rose by 450 per cent to Ft186bn (Dollars 1.85bn) in 1993 while the value of the market more than doubled to Ft441.8bn, the exchange said in its annual report. Government bonds and treasury bills made up the bulk of trading, accounting for 69 per cent of market value at the year-end. The capitalisation of Hungarian shares rose sharply in the last few months, closing 73 per cent higher at Ft81.7bn. The upsurge in equity values was helped by a wave of new issues which lifted the number of listed shares from 23 in January to 28 by December. The exchange expects a further eight to 10 flotations during 1994. Last year the exchange installed a VAX-based computer trading system and also set up a central clearing house and depository.</p>

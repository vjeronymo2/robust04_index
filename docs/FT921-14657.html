			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy The trouble with declining inflation is that it is a mixed blessing when nominal interest rates are stuck at a high level. Yesterday's UK producer price figures showed both a healthy decline - to a year-on-year rate of 3.8 per cent - in underlying output price inflation and a welcome 12-month drop in input prices. Admittedly the data only cover the manufacturing sector: services inflation is more stubborn, thanks to the likes of British Rail with its annual fare increases. But producer price trends still point in theory to a gentle economic stimulus from declining manufacturing costs and to scope for an eventual sharp fall in interest rates as decelerating wholesale inflation feeds through to the retail level. All the more so, since the annual rate of producer price increases should fall even more sharply next month as last January's exceptionally large 1.2 per cent rise falls out of the equation. Unfortunately membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism means UK interest rates are affected less by domestic inflation than by their differential with those of Germany. Recent French experience suggests that is unlikely to change even if headline UK inflation falls below that of Germany in February or March. With a showdown over wages looming in the German steel industry, the Bundesbank is unlikely to start cutting rates soon. Until it does, declining inflation in the UK will simply mean higher real interest rates. That in turn is likely to negate any economic benefit from weak commodity prices.</p>

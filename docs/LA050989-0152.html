			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> BRIDGES ROBBERY CHARGE DISMISSED  </P> <P> A Compton judge dismissed armed robbery charges today against actor Todd  Bridges, who was accused of trying to steal his own car without paying a $500  repair bill.  </P> <P> Bridges is charged in another case, however, involving his alleged attempt to  kill a man in a shooting in a cocaine rock house. Acting on a defense request  after the prosecution said it was unable to proceed with the car case,  Municipal Court Commissioner Bob Bowers today dismissed the armed robbery case  against Bridges, 23, the former child star of NBC's "Diff'rent Strokes." It was  not immediately known why prosecutors were unable to go forward with the case.  </P></p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Race is on to beat deadline for VAT on domestic fuel British householders are paying electricity and gas bills in advance - in one case, for 21 years - as they race to beat the deadline to avoid paying value added tax on domestic fuel. By last night, the UK's 15 suppliers of electricity to households had received more than 240,000 payments and British Gas had taken in 66,000. Numbers paying in advance of April 1, when VAT is imposed, have more than doubled in the past week and by last night total receipts had reached Pounds 150m. That figure is expected to be dwarfed by next Friday - the day by which most companies say they need to receive cheques in order to clear them in time. The VAT rate on domestic fuel will be 8 per cent for the first year, before rising to 17.5 per cent in April 1995. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, will next week ask Offer and Ofgas, the electricity and gas industry watchdogs, what they intend to do about the 'windfall cash' being built up by domestic fuel suppliers. The companies, many of which are cash-rich after a better than expected performance since privatisation, will earn considerable amounts of interest on the pre-payments. They say they have not encouraged pre-payment and that they have had to spend money to cover costs of customers paying in advance. Eastern Electricity, based in Ipswich, says it will need to take in between Pounds 25m and Pounds 30m to generate enough interest to cover extra staffing, telephone and computer costs. It has already received close to that amount. Most power and gas consumers, who have elected to pay in advance, have forwarded the equivalent of between one and two years' bills. But Manweb, based in Chester, says one customer has paid the equivalent of 21 years' bills and Seeboard, in Hove, says another has paid a sum equal to 18 years' usage. East Midlands says it has received a cheque for Pounds 7,500, although it does not specify how long this may cover. The average annual household electricity power bill is about Pounds 300. The gas bill of an average three-bedroomed house with gas central heating is about Pounds 380. British Gas has seen a north-south divide. In the North Thames region, which takes in central London, 14,000 customers have made some form of pre-payment. This compares with just over 3,500 customers pre-paying in British Gas's north west region, its largest, which encompasses Manchester and Liverpool. Among individual electricity companies with high receipts are Bristol-based Sweb with 40,000 paying Pounds 18m and Manweb, where 38,000 have paid Pounds 14.5m. Dodge that VAT, Weekend Page V</p>

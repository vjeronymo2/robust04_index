			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Authorities still hazy over review  -Local Taxation Reform ALTHOUGH the government's proposals for the new council tax are well documented in its consultation paper, details of how the review of local government will be carried out remained hazy yesterday. Officials of the Associations of District Councils, County Councils and Metropolitan Authorities met Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, yesterday for an hour-long briefing, but said little detail had emerged beyond what was published in the government's consultation paper on the structure of local government on Tuesday. Mr Roy Thomason, chairman of the Association of District Councils, which welcomed the government's announcement that it intended to move towards more unitary authorities in England, said it was unlikely that the proposed Local Government Commission would be set up until after the second reading of the bill. Depending on whether there is a general election, that is likely to be early in the next session of parliament in the autumn. He said the local-authority associations had made clear to Mr Heseltine that they felt they should be closely consulted about the composition of the commission. It is not known how many members the commission will have, or who will chair it. According to the consultation paper, the review commission will take over the functions of the Local Government Boundary Commission. Mr Thomason said he had proposed that the Boundary Commission should suspend making any new decisions that might affect the local-government review until the review body has been set up. Plans for the local-government review seem to be considerably less advanced than those for the council tax, and the Department of the Environment emphasised yesterday that it was keen to hear the views of authorities before proceeding further. Councils have been invited to put their views to the DoE by June 14.</p>

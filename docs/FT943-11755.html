			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Components groups study link Valeo, the French automobile components company, and Siemens, the German electrical engineering group, yesterday announced they were studying a merger of their automotive air-conditioning operations and small motors activities. Total annual sales of the combined activities would be about FFr6.6bn (Dollars 1.2m). The venture would be one of the most significant moves in the restructuring of the European automotive components sector, creating an alliance between two of the industry's leaders. They plan to create two separate companies - one in automotive heating and air-conditioning systems which would have annual sales of about FFr4bn, the other in electric motors, with annual sales of an estimated FFr2.6bn. According to Valeo, the plan would allow the companies to take advantage of their respective strengths in the two market segments. Valeo, which would contribute about FFr3bn of the sales in the automotive heating and air-conditioning business, would hold a majority share in this company. Siemens, by contrast, would hold a majority stake in the small motors business and contribute about FFr2.4bn of the combined annual sales. The motors would be used in automotive applications, such as air-conditioning and windscreen wipers and in domestic appliances. A spokesman for Valeo said the merged activities would complement each other in geographical and technological terms. He added that the European market for climate control and air-condition-ing had strong growth prospects. About 15 per cent of European cars have air-conditioning systems, he said, compared with about 90 per cent in North America. The companies hope to conclude the merger study by the end of the year. Legal details would then be negotiated.</p>

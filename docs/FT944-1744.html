			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Management: A testing time in the job market - Motoko Rich and Richard Donkin examine the controversies provoked by psychometric assessment How do you think you would react if you had to view corpses and accompany them to the airport? Visit prisons? Live in areas where disease is an everyday problem? Such questions may seem bizarre but they are routine for applicants to the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Before filing an application, would-be diplomats complete a 'self-assessment questionnaire' which is meant to test their suitability for the sort of professional and social life they can expect while working for the foreign office. Candidates score themselves, and if they reach a designated threshold, they are invited to proceed with the application. If not, they are told to consider another career. Customised psychometric tests of this kind are not just used to identify the flexible types required to defend and advance British interests. Their popularity is rising in the UK and some estimates suggest the majority of larger companies have used the tests to assess personalities and abilities for recruitment, career development, team-building and, in some cases, redundancy selection. The tests are not without controversy. Several cases recently have highlighted the varying quality of test providers and the dangers which can arise if they are sold for the wrong purpose or fall into the wrong hands. These have led to calls from occupational psychologists, personnel managers and, most recently, trade unions for better administrative standards. Testing is not new. Intelligence and personality tests were first used on a large scale by the US army to determine who could handle the stress of trench warfare in the first world war. In the 1950s and 1960s, interest in the UK was fuelled by the growth of graduate trainee schemes in large corporations, when employers used the tests on inexperienced candidates. Experts say it is important to distinguish between ability tests, which measure numeracy and verbal skill, and personality tests, which measure people's perceptions of their own behaviour. If properly used and designed to evaluate skills relevant to the job being filled, many psychologists agree that ability tests can be highly effective. The use of personality tests, however, is more controversial. Unison, the public service union, has raised questions about the use of personality tests when Anglian Water decided it needed to shed 900 staff as part of a big reorganisation. All staff were given a personality test to help managers decide who would be given new jobs. According to Unison, the company said the tests would only influence 30 per cent of the decision. But Unison says the tests must have had more weight in the process. The union also claims the company determined the competences the test would identify before it had determined what characteristics or skills were needed for the jobs. In the US, a court in California awarded Dollars 1.3m (Pounds 800,000) damages against a supermarket chain which had used a personality test to recruit security guards. One of the recruits complained that the questions were intrusive and bore no relation to the job he was being required to do. Similar complaints have been voiced by UK employees who lost their jobs at Southwark Council in London after personality tests were used to decide who was made redundant in a job-shedding exercise earlier this year. Unison is taking up the Southwark incident in an unfair dismissal case before an industrial tribunal. It may take one of these cases to remove the veil of statistical and psychological jargon that characterises academic debate and salesmanship in psychometrics. The excessive use of jargon is one reason why psychometric tests are so open to abuse. Management neglect is another issue. Because tests are used mainly as a recruitment tool, senior executives have often been content to leave their adoption and use to personnel specialists who, some critics believe, have been too ready to embrace psychometrics as another 'boy scout badge' in the field of human resources. 'There is a lot of black magic around psychometric tests,' says Steven Blinkhorn, co-director of Psychometric Research &amp; Development, a consultancy which develops custom-built tests. 'It gives personnel managers a sort of cachet because it gives them something they can do that others in the organisation cannot.' That said, many psychologists and personnel managers argue that psychometric tests can add value to a company's selection or career development processes and that they are better guides to a candidate's potential than the interview, references, letters of application and other traditional selection methods. 'The same kind of critical criteria that are applied to tests are not applied to the interview as a selection method,' says Clive Fletcher of Goldsmith College, London University. 'The interview does not predict future performance at all and it is a marvellous vehicle for bias.' Blinkhorn and his consultancy partner Charles Johnson have written that such tests can often 'bamboozle an unsophisticated public with pseudo science' and that tests 'play fast and loose with statistical methods, and . . . make claims that do not stand up to close inspection.' Steve Sefton, manager of ASE, the business psychology division of test publisher NFER-Nelson, is not as critical but concedes the tests have their limitations. 'Tests are really designed to be predictive of people's behaviour, rather than their job performance,' he explains. Along with the other leading test publishers, however, he insists that personality tests can be helpful tools in selection if used and understood correctly in conjunction with other recruitment methods. Many psychologists, however, believe no test should be used in isolation or for redundancy purposes. 'Tests should be used as a part of a battery of selection techniques such as interviews, group discussions and application forms,' says David Bartram of Hull University, and a member of the test standards committee at the British Psychological Society. Saville and Holdsworth, the UK's largest test publisher, with a turnover of Pounds 30m worldwide, publishes hundreds of tests, including the Occupational Personality Questionnaire, which is one of the most respected on the market. Other reputable tests include the 16PF, published in the UK by ASE, and the Myers Briggs, which was developed by two Americans in the 1960s. There are more than 5,000 tests in the English language on the market, some of which, say the BPS, are of dubious validity. The Institute of Personnel and Development has developed a code of conduct for its members and the six leading test publishers have issued guidelines for test publishers and users. But none of these bodies has regulatory clout; nor can they vouch for the effectiveness of test methods. In an attempt to introduce some standards into the field, the BPS has devised certificates of competence for those administering ability tests; equivalent qualifications for personality tests are expected sometime next year. To obtain a certificate, company personnel officers have to enrol in BPS training courses run by chartered psychologists. The courses train non-psychologists to distinguish between types of tests, analyse statistical data, identify the abilities or characteristics that need to be tested, and judge if a test is valid for a company's needs. Leading publishers are also attempting to police their own tests and improve training - though their motives may not be entirely altruistic. Users of Saville and Holdsworth's tests, for example, must attend week-long courses before being allowed to purchase any of the materials. Such training is expensive: users can expect to pay more than Pounds 4,000 for a course. The requirement to attend in-house training before tests can be bought, though, means the publishers may be 'milking the market', according to Pauline Grant, business director of IARC-Ashridge, a consultancy. The respectable publishers, however, are not the main problem. Price often influences choice and cheap, quick-fix tests that claim to be easy to operate are often run on computers and probably have as much to do with objectivity as the 'Are you the world's best lover?' quizzes in teenage magazines which have proved highly popular. Research dating back to 1958 shows that poor tests are about as good as star-sign columns in Sunday magazines. A psychologist tested 68 personnel managers and later gave them each identical reports describing their personality. In what is known as the Barnum effect, half of them described the report as 'amazingly accurate', and 40 per cent of them said it was 'rather good', while the other 10 per cent thought it was 'half and half'. Before any test is adopted, employers should conduct a thorough job analysis. 'The first thing you need to do is identify the task demands of the job,' says Blinkhorn. 'Ask if people need to bring those skills ready-made or if some of these skills are in part learned on the job.' Recruiters needed to talk to people already doing the job, as well as supervisors and management. Once the skills and characteristics genuinely needed for the job are identified, then an employer is better placed to choose the best test to evaluate them. Perhaps the most important thing for potential test-users to remember, however, is that the tests have their limitations. When assessing personality, Grant says 'people with very different personality characteristics could both do the same job very well'. Bartram also says employers need to decide whether they want to measure personality at all before they decide which test to use. All too often, he says, the debate is focused on the quality of the test rather than the question of whether personality is relevant to the job at all. If a company does decide to use psychometric instruments, he says there is no justification for choosing inappropriate tests, just to save a few pounds. 'In the long run, companies who use unreliable, cheap tests are going to lose out by doing that. They will be picking people who are not the best for the job.'</p>

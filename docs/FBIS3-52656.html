In his meeting this morning with the media leaders, he said  that the revolution's serious work to implement the principles  of independence was what instigated others to adopt a hostile  attitude in their dealings with Sudan, a matter which instigated  us to be even more committed to our independence. In this  context he pointed out that opening al-Tahadi [defiance] road  was a confirmation of independence.    Lieutenant General al-Bashir stressed the need for numerous  similar great projects in order to get Sudan out of the state of  inherited poverty. He stressed the importance of constructing  al-Hamdab dam, which will provide 1.250 million mw of  electricity in addition to irrigation water. [passage omitted]</p>

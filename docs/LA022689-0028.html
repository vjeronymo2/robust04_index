			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: DATELINE MOSCOW  </P> <P> Paul McCartney's rock oldies collection isn't the only new album Russian fans  will hear before it reaches American stores. "Rainbow Warriors," the upcoming  Greenpeace compilation of rock hits, is due out in the Soviet Union early next  month. To herald the event, a platoon of popsters will host a Moscow media  event March 6, highlighted by the obligatory press conference, a record signing  event at Melodiya (Moscow's answer to Tower Records) and an evening at the  Bolshoi Ballet. So far, the rock contingent includes Chrissie Hynde,  Eurythmics' Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart, Peter Gabriel, U-2's the Edge, David  Byrne and Jerry Harrison, World Party's Karl Wallinger and the Thompson Twins.  Soviet TV also will air a video promoting Greenpeace and the album, complete  with an introduction by Lennox warning of mankind's continuing destruction of  our global resources. The album will be released here April 17, with profits  divided between Greenpeace (the most potent international environmental  pressure group) and the International Foundation for the Survival and  Development of Humanity.  </P></p>

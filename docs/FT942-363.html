			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Clinton shares fall on profit warning Shares in Clinton Cards fell sharply yesterday after the specialist retailer warned that profits were unlikely to exceed last year's Pounds 3m. The group, which claims 7 per cent of the UK greetings card market, also said that its seasonal loss for the first half to end-July would be 'significantly higher than last year's Pounds 1m.' An interim deficit is normal, as the chain is dependent on Christmas trading. The shares lost 31p to close at 105p. Sales in the core business of cards and wrapping paper had been flat, the group said. However, sales of gift products and ancillary lines have been significantly below last year. Mr Barry Hartog, finance director, put this down to a lack of fresh products based on popular characters such as Garfield and Mr Blobby. Like for like sales have fallen by 4 per cent, although overall sales have risen 3 per cent on the back of an increase in the number of outlets. The group is now trading from 279 shops, compared with 273 last year, and further branches are planned. In March the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.02m on sales of Pounds 75.9m, ex-VAT, up from Pounds 2.3m on sales of Pounds 68.2m. At the time Mr Don Lewin, chairman, said that consumer confidence seemed to be 'rather fragile, fuelled perhaps by worries about personal tax increases'.</p>

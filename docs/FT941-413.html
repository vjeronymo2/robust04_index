			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Ice cream wars The Monopolies and Mergers Commission seems largely oblivious to the realities of Britain's membership of the European Union, to judge by yesterday's report on the use of exclusive freezer cabinets to sell ice cream. The report skates over the fact that EU competition authorities are currently investigating the identical issue in Ireland. Nowhere does it hint that the MMC considered conferring with Brussels before reaching its own conclusions. This is no minor oversight. The separate inquiries into ice cream distribution clearly create the potential for a jurisdictional clash between EU and national competition laws, and between the regulatory authorities charged with administering them. There is no certainty that Brussels' eventual decision and that of the MMC will concur. If they do not, regulatory uncertainty will be in prospect. If they do, it will be due to coincidence. That is no way to run a competition policy. The MMC's insistence that it must consider the issues 'solely in the circumstances of the UK market and in the context of domestic legislation', while technically correct, is myopic. The fact is that when EU and national law conflict the former prevails. Even if conflict is avoided this time, it is increasingly likely to arise in future restrictive practices cases. As markets grow more competitive and product lives shorten in most industries, manufacturers everywhere are seeking advantage by tightening control over marketing and distribution. That increasingly requires competition authorities to define the line between legitimate commercial strategy and anti-competitive behaviour. Simultaneously, the single market is prompting more companies to supply all of Europe from fewer plants. As the resulting flow of products across borders grows, more competition cases will fall within EU law, which takes precedence when trade between member states is in question. Brussels is seeking to lighten its workload by encouraging national courts to judge more cases on the basis of EU law. That seems a sensible aim, in line with the broad principle of subsidiarity. But jurisidictional confusion will only increase unless the domestic laws applied by national competition authorities are also aligned with those of the EU. The longer the British government delays doing so, the less seriously will be taken its protestations that it wants effective competition policies and its complaints about interference from Brussels. The role of the MMC also needs to be re-thought. It has already surrendered to the EU much of its authority over mergers. Recent trends point to a similar decline in its monopolies workload. The government could usefully ask whether the MMC's current resources are justified, and whether it should not be co-ordinating more closely with Brussels, where power over competition policy increasingly lies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jairo Gomez from the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>   [Text] There was an unexpected meeting between President  Cesar Gaviria and Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff at Narino  Palace this afternoon. This newscast has learned they shared a  peace pipe and the president and prosecutor resolved their  differences, which have been aired by the national media.  Despite their differences, they sat down to discuss the  possibility that 2,000- 7,000 prisoners might go free because  their legal situation has yet to be resolved. The president and  the prosecutor will meet again next week when there will be a  meeting among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.</p>

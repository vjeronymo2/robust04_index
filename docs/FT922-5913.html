			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: BP Chemicals sets up alliance with EniChem BRITISH Petroleum Chemicals and EniChem, the Italian chemical group, yesterday announced the formation of a broad strategic alliance. The groups have formed a study team to discuss possible synergies in their polystyrene and styrene businesses with a view to setting up a joint venture. Both groups are small manufacturers in a sector which offers considerable economies of scale. Together the companies would have a capacity of about 300,000 tonnes a year, according to Chem Systems, the chemical industry consultants. That would place them fourth in Europe, behind BASF of Germany, Dow of the US and France's Elf Atochem. Yesterday's agreement will allow EniChem to go ahead with a new plant at Brindisi employing BP Chemical's gas process to produce 200 tonnes a year of high and low density polyethylene. The agreement ends a long search by EniChem to find a technology partner in the field and marks a further success for BP Chemicals which has already sold 17 different licences of its gas process. EniChem has already tried to set up agreements with other companies in number of product areas, including ICI of the UK in vinyls and Arco of the Netherlands in engineering plastics. EniChem had considered in addition to BP an arrangement with its old rival Montedison. Through its US subsidiary Himont, Montedison has developed exciting but unproven technology for the production of polyethylene. Another strategy considered by EniChem was a broad alliance with Union Carbide allowing this US group a significant foothold in Europe. But this now seems less likely, EniChem opting instead for sectorial international links. EniChem recorded a loss of L742bn (Dollars 619m) in 1991, blamed on weak prices, slack demand and heavy financial charges. A 1991-4 business plan - rationalising both plant and the work force - was held up by political objections to job losses and lower investment in the south. A watered down version was only approved late last year and EniChem remains well behind its main international rivals in reacting to the changing conditions of the chemical-petrochemical industry.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK apple growers hope to turn back French tide A group of English apple growers has decided to take on the powerful French Golden Delicious by producing its own, home-grown variety. 'Le Crunch', which has been heavily promoted in Britain and tends to undercut English varieties on price, has an estimated 20 per cent share of the market. But about 24 per cent of consumers feel chauvinistic enough about apples to avoid buying French varieties, while 57 per cent say they prefer to buy English apples, according to an opinion poll by Research Surveys of Great Britain. So the English Fruit Company, a Kent-based co-operative of 300 growers, has developed an English Golden Delicious, which is from the same family as the French variety but has a different cell structure. This makes it sweeter, smaller and crisper. It is also slightly greener than the yellow French apple. 'We're trying to develop something which has the edge on flavour,' said Mr Michael Green, the company's sales director. 'I don't think we'll ever have the French tonnage per hectare, because we don't have the climate to cope with that.' A quarter of a million 40lb cases of the new apples are being promoted by a superstore chain, Asda, for two weeks this month. If they prove a success, the fruit growers plan to market the Golden Delicious on a wider scale next year. English apple growers complain their traditional varieties, such as the Cox, are being forced off the market by an influx of apples from low-cost producers such as Chile and South Africa and from a glut of apples in the EU.</p>

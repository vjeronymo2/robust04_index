			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The new director general  of the Japan Defence Agency recently told a press conference  upon his assumption of office that, depending on the tensions  growing on the Korean peninsula, they should "cope with it even  by altering an interpretation of the Constitution". Earlier,  the new Japanese Prime Minister, Hata, raved that "a  constitutional debate should be made in the direction of  recognizing Japan's exercise of the right to collective  self-defence in case of `emergency' so as to provide against the  nuclear issue of North Korea".    A NODONG SINMUN analyst today says this shows that the  Japanese reactionaries are scheming to justify their moves  toward a military power and nuclear armament on the pretext of  the DPRK's "nuclear issue" and, at the same time, to use it as  an excuse for military reinvasion of Korea.    The news analyst goes on:    The Japanese reactionary ruling quarters' talk about  "constitutional debate" and "legislative measures" to cope with  "emergency" on the Korean peninsula is intended to lay a legal  foundation for military aggression on Korea on the pretext of  the DPRK's "nuclear issue".    In other words, they are intending to malrevise the present  constitution and the "self-defence forces act" on the pretext of  "coping with" the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK and thus to stage  a comeback to Korea militarily without any restrictions and give  a semblance of legitimacy to it.    Noteworthy is that the Japanese reactionaries openly  revealed  their scheme to stage a comeback to Korea at a time when the  United States has become all the more undisguised in its  anti-DPRK campaign.    The Japanese reactionaries are further strengthening their  collusion and tieup with the United States and the South Korean  puppets, unusually becoming undisguised in their anti-DPRK  moves. It is not fortuitous that confabs were held recently  between the military brasshats of the United States and Japan  and between those of Japan and the South Korean puppet army to  "cope with North Korea's nuclear issue" and agreements were  reached between them on strengthening military cooperation.    All this proves that the Japanese reactionaries' scheme for  military reinvasion of Korea is being promoted at a dangerous  phase. The Japanese reactionaries, however, will get nothing  from their policy hostile to the DPRK and moves for military  re-aggression.    They must ponder over grave consequences to be entailed by  their policy hostile to the DPRK and stop running recklessly.</p>

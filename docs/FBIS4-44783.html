			<p>Million   <F P=102>   94WS0286A Munich ELEKTRONIK in German 22 Mar 94 pp 24-26 </F> <F P=103> 94WS0286A </F> <F P=104>  Munich ELEKTRONIK </F> <F P=105>  German </F> CSO     [Text] Bonn is making 600 million German marks [DM]  available until 1997 for projects in microsystems technology.  Strongly product-oriented plans are at the center of the funding  program.    Although in past years the microsystems periphery has also  profited from Bonn's money, up until 1997 allocated funds will  be put exclusively into microsystems technology. The Federal  Ministry for Research and Technology (BMFT) has added five  measures to its project requirement specifications to which it  wants to pay particular attention: a number of institutes are to  be funded, such as the two nuclear research centers in Karlsuhe  and Juelich as well as the Fraunhofer Society. Joint industrial  projects in which at least two companies and one research  facility are involved are also enjoying the financial infusion.  Also being taken into consideration are basic research; the  funding of scientific cooperation with other countries; and the  deep involvement with qualifying measures, organizational  development and the marketing of technology.    Funds in the amount of DM600 million are going in  approximately equal parts to the funding of joint [projects] in  which companies and institutes cooperate and into the pockets of  large research facilities. The latter, however, may only use the  money for research in microsystems technology. With the new  [funding] concept, attention is no long being paid to  indirect-specific funding in which individual companies were  also sponsored. A not insubstantial portion of the money for the  joint [projects] funding benefits projects which already  received the go-ahead within the last three years and where the  first products have been partly developed.    One example: a fiber-coupled interferometer based on  integrated-optical waveguide structure, primarily useful in  positioning in mechanical engineering with precision processing  machines and manufacturing equipment for microelectronics. The  firms of IOT -- Integrated Optics Technology -- and Euchner took  part in this project.    New Sensor Technologies Predominate    It is notable that the majority of the projects in  microsystems technology lead into new sensor technologies. Thus,  the University of Magdeburg worked with three other firms in  developing mass-sensitive sensors for environmental and process  analysis. The Freiburg Fraunhofer Institute for Physical  Metrology together with 13 medium-sized companies and one  Russian cooperating partner worked out tin oxide gas sensors in  thin-layer technology which is useful for the quantitative  identification of CO[.sub]x[/], NO[.sub]x[/],  CH[.sub]4[/], C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH, H[.sub]2[/]  and NH[.sub]3[/] in complex gas mixtures. Magnet-resistive  sensors for length and current measurement are the result of  cooperation between the Wetzlarer Institute for Microstructure  Technology and Optoelectronics (IMO) and seven medium-sized  companies. The high degree of participation of research  facilities and companies from East Germany is notable. In all,  companies from the nine German states participated in at least  70 percent of all projects and received 20 percent (DM48.4  million) of the BMFT funds.   <FIG ID=JPRS-EST-013L-02A>      The second BMFT Microsystems Technology Funding Project runs until 1997: Approximately DM260 </FIG>    The link between the Bonn ministry and the companies  interested in funds is the Teltower VDI[Association of German  Engineers]/VDE[Association of German Electrical Engineers]  Technology Center Information Technology. Responsibilities range  from theme verification to application. Since the founding of  the Center, 4,600 projects have already been taken care of by  its 100 colleagues. Christoph Stoppok, Program Director for  Microsystems Technology in the Teltower VDI/VDE Center, points  out that matters which concern the initiators of the funding  concept include "making the results of [funded work] accessible  to everyone, since the projects were after all funded by public  money." Thus, companies could also participate indirectly in the  BMFT's financial beneficence.    Dr. Hans-Peter Lorenzen from the BMFT mentioned at the  presentation of the new funding program that "meanwhile there  are perhaps already too many institutes in this country working  on microsystems technology." He is trusting to market mechanisms  to take care of this excess. The new concept should above all  concentrate on supporting pre-competitive joint projects  following the model of the Japanese concept of promoting  economic development.    Was Is Microsystems Technology Anyway?    With all its good plans and intentions, the BMFT certainly  still has problems with the definitions of microsystems  technology. For Lorenzen it is the integration of sensor  functions, signal processing and actuator structures. To this  extent it is not surprising that microsystems technology in  Germany primarily means sensor technology. The VDE/VDI  Technology Center Information Technology, like Prof. Anton  Heuberger, Director of the Berlin (the future Izehoer)  Fraunhofer Institute for Silicon Technology, expands the  definition somewhat: accordingly, microsystems technology is the  integration of microelectric and other functions (such as  optical, electromagnetic, mechanical, chemical and biological)  in a miniaturized solid-state system.    Criticism of Funding    Disparaging words regarding BMFT funding could be heard  especially from Prof. Heuberger. He is critical that there are  still delays at the intersection between technological  developments and the translation [of such advances] into  products. It is not least for this reason that he--in contrast  to the naive prognosis of the BMFT, which still speaks of a  leading roll for Germany--sees that the true potential for  microsystems technology has already moved to Japan.    The number of Germany's missed opportunities, following  microelectronics and precision engineering, could continue with  microsystems technology. Not least [in significance is that]  with microelectronics the Japanese industry dominates the most  important prerequisite for microsystems technology. How could  the industrial landscape here [in Germany] escape from this  dilemma? Heuberger finds the philosophers' stone in so-called  technology brokers. These could be facilities, institutes or  companies which slip into the roll of being service providers  while at the same time taking responsibility for the product to  be produced. A good understanding of the landscape of  international suppliers of technologies and services is required  here. Similarly as with ASIC production, these technology  brokers are concerned not only with the design but also with the  production and assembly of the microsystems technology products.  In contrast to the Fraunhofer and other research institutes, the  brokers refer to all internationally available technology and do  not limit themselves only to in-house developments. Heuberger  forcefully urges the support of a German supplier of software  tools, without which the microsystems technology industry in  this country would be made dependent on foreign suppliers.    Convert Results Rapidly and With Determination    It is certainly hopeful when Research Minister Paul Krueger,  viewing the annual distribution of funds after 1994, considers a  drop indefensible and announces corresponding measures. What  will be decisive in the future, however, will not be the funds  from Bonn's cornucopia but rather the functioning cooperation  between institutes and industry and the rapid conversion of  results into marketable products.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Letter: Gilts indexed to wage rates would aid UK pension funds Sir, I refer to Barry Riley's article, 'Too many eggs in one basket' (November 11), on the proportion of the assets of UK pension funds held in equities. As a trustee of a pension fund, I have been dismayed by the preoccupation of the investment management industry with its performance relative only to its other members, and not relative to the liabilities of its customers. Liabilities of a pension plan with defined benefits rise in line with pay, but I have been unable to find an investment manager willing to have his long-term performance judged against wage growth. Mr Riley observed: 'In fact pension schemes that are immature can continue to stick quite safely with equities, almost whatever happens.' I wonder if that will prove to be true. If mature schemes move large amounts of their funds from equities into bonds, the resultant sharp drop in UK equity prices could invalidate the historical observations on which his comment was based. Also, as he observed elsewhere, it is crucial that the sponsoring employer remains solvent in the long term. A prudent trustee has to ensure that the fund can meet its liabilities both in the long term and on an unexpected near-term winding up. The faction which believes mature funds are over-invested in equities suggests a move to fixed interest bonds. But this is only sensible if one believes that inflation will not rise significantly. Index-linked gilts would be a risk-averse alternative but, here again, there are potential problems. If we ever get a single European currency, index-linked gilts would be re-denominated in Ecu, and the indexation would therefore presumably be changed to a pan-European inflation rate. UK wage rate growth has traditionally exceeded changes in the RPI by 2 per cent a year, but if the inflation index becomes Europe-wide, then UK wage growth may become uncoupled from it for material periods. Trustees are, therefore, left with no ideal investment. They can, of course, reduce the risks through a mixture of investments. More likely they will elect to move away from defined benefit schemes, and adopt defined contribution plans. The risk of investment performance is then transferred from the fund to the pensioner - which seems to be undesirable in social terms. I am therefore proposing to the chancellor that the government should issue gilts indexed to UK wage rates. The gilts would be issued with a spread of maturities, and would work in the same way as the existing index-linked gilts, with the indexation being to average wages, rather than to the RPI. Economically, this is not a great leap for the government from issuing RPI-linked bonds. Politically, it allows it to do something for the pensions industry; socially it could avoid the demise of the defined benefit plan.

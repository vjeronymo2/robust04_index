			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The allowance of 60 days from the date of receipt of the notification of an application for a permit action for the governmental entities identified at 30 CFR 773.13(a)(3) to submit written comments or objections is a reasonable time frame and is consistent with the time frames allowed for in SMCRA. Therefore, the Director finds this proposed revision to be no less effective than the Federal regulation in meeting SMCRA's requirements and is approving it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reapplication requirements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Iowa proposes to revise its rule at IAC 27&hyph;40.31(14), dealing with the review of permit applications, to require that the following sentence be added at the end of incorporated 30 CFR 773.15(a)(2): ``In case willful suppressing or falsifying of any facts or data is identified, the division may require the applicant to reapply for the same area.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Iowa's proposed revision conflicts with SMCRA, the Federal regulations, and other provisions of the Iowa program. Section 510(b)(1) of SMCRA and section 30 CFR 773.15(c)(1) of the Federal regulations provide that no application for a permit or permit revision shall be approved unless the application affirmatively demonstrates and the regulatory authority finds in writing on the basis of information set forth in the application or from information otherwise available which will be documented in the approval, and made available to the applicant, that the permit application is accurate and complete and that all the requirements of this Act and the State or Federal program have been complied with. Counterpart State provisions to section 510(b)(1) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 773.15(c)(1) can be found in the Iowa program at section 207.9(2)(a) of the Iowa Code and IAC 27&hyph;40.31 (incorporating 30 CFR 773.15 by reference). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, under SMCRA, the Federal regulations, and the Iowa program, in the event willful suppressing or falsifying of any facts or data is identified, the regulatory authority would have no discretion and would be required to deny the permit. Therefore, the Director finds Iowa's proposed added language at IAC 27&hyph;40.31(14) to be less stringent than SMCRA, less effective than the Federal regulations in meeting SMCRA's requirements, and inconsistent with approved Iowa program. Accordingly, the Director is not approving it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director also notes that under the Federal, as well as the State, program, anyone who knowingly makes any false statement, representation, or certification, or knowingly fails to make any statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, report, plant, or other document filed or required to be maintained under the program, is subject to criminal penalties, including imprisonment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section 518(g) of SMCRA.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 207.15(6) of the Iowa Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 14. IAC 27&hyph;40.32, Revision; Renewal; and Transfer, Assignment, or Sale of Permit Rights <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Revisions and amendments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Iowa proposes to revise its rule at IAC 27&hyph;40.32(1) by adding an introductory provision that explains that the term ``revision'' is used to describe ``a change to a permit that constitutes a significant departure from the original permit. Any change to an Iowa permit that does not constitute a significant departure from the original permit is called an ``amendment'' to the permit in the context of these rules.'' The introductory provision continues by requiring that the public notice, public participation, and notice of decision requirements of 30 CFR 773.13, 773.19(b), and 778.21 apply to all revisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Iowa proposes to revise IAC 27&hyph;40.32(1) by clarifying that ``[s]ignificant departures, including incidental boundary revisions, shall be treated as revisions.'' Significant departures include any change in the permit area, mining method or reclamation procedure, which would, in the opinion of the regulatory authority, significantly change the effect the mining operations would have on either those persons impacted by the permitted operation or on the environment. At IAC 27&hyph;40.32(3), Iowa clarifies that, unless it qualifies as an incidental boundary revision, any change in permit area must be treated as a new permit application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA PROTESTS U.S. CRITICISM OF ITS HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD  </P> <P> China issued a strong protest Thursday against criticism by President Bush of  its human rights record, saying it is resentful and has made its views known to  Washington.  </P> <P> Beijing also accused the human rights group Amnesty International of  interfering in its internal affairs by publishing a report condemning China for  secret executions, torture and unfair trials.  </P> <P> "We have all along been opposed to interfering in China's internal affairs,  smearing and attacking the Chinese government by the U.S. Congress under the  pretext of freedom and human rights," Li Jinhua, spokeswoman for the Foreign  Ministry, said.  </P> <P> "Now the U.S. government has gone so far as to issue the public announcement at  the request of Congress," she said. "We are extremely resentful of this and  hereby express our strong protest."  </P> <P> President Bush, who had taken controversial steps to preserve ties with China  since last June's bloody crackdown, last week sharply criticized Beijing's use  of deadly force to suppress a campaign for democracy.  </P> <P> Signing a proclamation making May 13 a national day in support of human rights,  he said the force used on protesters "went far beyond the legitimate  requirements of law and order."  </P> <P> Washington says China has made only minimal improvements in human rights since  suppressing the democracy movement, and some members of Congress are calling on  Bush to end most-favored-nation status for Chinese imports.  </P> <P> China announced last week that it had released 211 people detained in  connection with the demonstrations. It said 431 were still under investigation.  Analysts believe thousands are still held.  </P> <P> Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Communist Party, said in an interview  with ABC's Barbara Walters that 42 university and college students are among  those still held.  </P> <P> In the interview, to be shown tonight on ABC's "20/20" program, Jiang said it  might have been possible to avert the army crackdown last June if Beijing had  adopted "resolute measures," such as barring gatherings in Tian An Men Square,  when the demonstrations began. He said authorities had learned from "our  mistakes" and now have made "adequate preparations in terms of strengthening  the police force and storing of non-lethal weapons."  </P></p>

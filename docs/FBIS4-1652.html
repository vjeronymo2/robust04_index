			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "China To Build Southwest Mainlines of </F> Communication; Cost of Railway Construction To Exceed 20 Billion  Yuan"]    [Text] Beijing, 30 March (LIEN HO PO) -- During the Eighth  and Ninth Five-Year Plans (1991-2000), the Chinese mainland will  inject a huge amount of funds into construction of the mainlines  of communication in southwest China, including railways and  highways, of which over 20 billion yuan will be invested in  railway construction.    Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi are involved in the  projects which were planned to be built in the Southwest.  According to the plan, by the end of this century, more than  3,000 kilometers of railways will have been built or rebuilt in  the abovementioned region. The projects have now started  construction. The projects, which are scheduled to have  completed construction before 1995, include the northern  thoroughfare of the Southwest or the multiple- track  Yangpingguan-Chengdu section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the  eastern thoroughfare or the Daxian-Chengdu Railway, and the  western thoroughfare or the Guangtong-Dali Railway in Yunnan.  Moreover, the 2.6 billion-yuan electrification reconstruction  project of the Chengdu-Kunming Railway also has started  construction. The Chongqing-Daxian Electric Railway, the  Wanxian-Daxian Railway, and the Neijiang-Kunming Railway will  begin construction one after another, and they are expected to  be completed by the end of this century.    In road construction, some 5,000 km of arterial highways  will  be built and rebuilt. Sichuan Province will invest 1.13 billion  to build and rebuild high-grade arterial highways that fan out  to other parts of China -- with the Chang Jiang as the backing,  key ports as the linking point, and Chengdu and Chongqing as the  center -- and to link cities, prefectures, and counties with  roads of grade-2 and above so as to form a coordinated  land-and-water transport network in which expressways are linked  with water transport carried out with other parts of the  country. The project of the Shanghai- Chengdu arterial highway,  as planned by the Ministry of Communications, will run through  Chengdu, Chongqing, Wanxian in Sichuan, and expand from  Chongqing, Guaiyang, Nanning to a sea port in Beibu Bay.  According to the ministry's plan, in the first step, 800 km of  high-grade arterial highways will be built and some 2,000 km of  regional arterial highways will be built and rebuilt.</p>

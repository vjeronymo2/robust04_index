			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: RMC strengthen Building specialists gave an immediate thumbs up to the merger of RMC's two German operations, Readymix AG and Readymix Berlin, which they said would give a substantial boost to the company's earnings, cash flow and costs in that country. A series of broker upgrades are said to be in the pipeline. RMC shares spearheaded a general surge in the building materials sector, closing 34 stronger at 675p, the highest level since September 1991, albeit on disappointing turnover of only 1.5m shares. Redland, also heavily involved in the building materials market in Germany, lifted 13 to 445p.</p>

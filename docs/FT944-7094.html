			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Eight die in Palestinian gun battles: Fighting in Lebanese refugee camp over Mideast peace deal Gun battles between supporters and opponents of Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, left at least eight Palestinians dead yesterday in Lebanon's biggest refugee camp. The day-long fighting with machine guns and anti-tank rockets has sparked fears of an eruption of internal Palestinian violence among the 400,000 Palestinian refugees camped in Lebanon. The fighting marks the spread of tension between Palestinians supporting and opposing Mr Arafat's peace agreement with Israel, and the anger about last Friday's killing of 12 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by Mr Arafat's Palestinian police force. It also exposes the deepening divisions within Mr Arafat's Fatah faction and more widely within the PLO, traditionally dominated by Fatah, and the mounting challenge to Mr Arafat's leadership. Fighting broke out before dawn when 400 pro-Arafat guerrillas seized six military posts manned by 200 dissidents in the Ain el-Hilweh refugee camp near the southern port of Tyre. The dissident group is led by Lt-Col Munir Maqdah, the former military head of Fatah who was dismissed by Mr Arafat last year after he called for the PLO chairman's resignation over the peace agreement. 'The traitor Arafat has to move away from our Palestinian people,' Lt-Col Maqdah was quoted as saying yesterday after he described last Friday's clashes as 'massacres' committed by Mr Arafat. Armed Palestinian factions backed by Syria and opposed to the peace deal have a strong presence in Lebanon's 12 refugee camps and many refugees feel the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement has permanently ended the right of return to their homeland which has been the central rallying call of the PLO for decades. Neither Lebanon nor Syria has so far tried to move into the camps to disarm the guerrillas. Syria, which maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon, has also publicly criticised Mr Arafat's peace agreement with Israel. 'Syria is anxious to prove that Arafat's problems are not localised to Gaza but spread across the Palestinian diaspora nation and across the entire Arab world,' said a Beirut observer. In Gaza the militant Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement, which has blamed Mr Arafat for last Friday's killings, postponed a large rally until today. Hamas, which leads the Palestinian opposition to the peace process, said it expected 20,000 people to attend the rally to demonstrate the strength of opposition to Mr Arafat's peace deal. Earlier in the week up to 10,000 supporters of Fatah demonstrated in Gaza. In Israel, the prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, said carrying out a death sentence given yesterday by an Israeli military court to a Palestinian guerrilla from the Hamas group would be a 'blunder'. Mr Rabin said he opposed execution of a Palestinian sentenced to death for carrying out a bus bomb attack in April that killed six people. 'To this day Israel has not put a single Palestinian terrorist to death and I think this was correct,' he said. Leaders of Hamas said the death sentence would only encourage further Islamic suicide attacks against Israelis, not deter them as the military court argued.</p>

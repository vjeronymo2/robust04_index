			<p>BFN     [Text] Partial strike was observed throughout the country  today on the call of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and  Industry against the budgetary proposals. Most of the business  concern belonging to big businessmen and industrialists remained  closed. However, small markets and shopping centers generally  remained open. Petroleum dealers and transporters did not pay  heed to the strike call. Fruit and vegetable markets,  restaurants, utility stores, mohallah [petty] shops, and general  stores and vendors also continued their normal business  activities. Some traders continued their business with their  shutters half closed. The stock exchanges of the country also  remained open as usual, but trading was poor. The industrial  sector responded to the strike call as most of the units  suspended their activities. Most of the small traders condemned  the strike and said the big businessmen always fleece masses  with a big profit margin. They should make some sacrifice for  the nation and avoid creating problems for the people. They  were of the view that the strike call is politically motivated  as these elements wanted to create hurdles for the government  which is making efforts to streamline the country's economy in  order to provide relief to the common man. [words indistinct]  some traders told our representative that they are not in favor  of the strike, but kept their premises closed for fear of  Chamber's desperadoes. They said the strike is not in the  national interest.</p>

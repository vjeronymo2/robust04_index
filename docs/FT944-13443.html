			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Logging costs check MacMillan Bloedel MacMillan Bloedel, the western Canadian forest-products group, benefited from strengthening paper markets and favourable exchange rates in the third quarter, but profits were held back by rising logging costs, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. Earnings recovered to CDollars 58.1m (USDollars 43.30) or 44 cents a share, from a CDollars 20.7m loss, or 19 cents, a year earlier. The latest figure includes an after-tax gain of CDollars 20.8m from the sale of the Harmac pulp division. Sales advanced to CDollars 1.04bn from CDollars 828m. Mr Bob Findlay, chief executive, said higher stumpage fees, rising labour costs and the expense of implementing new, government-mandated environmental practices contributed to increased costs in the British Columbia logging operations.</p>

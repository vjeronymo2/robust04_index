			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by V. Cvetkovska: "11 Enterprises Fully Privatized"] </F>   [Text] The privatization in the state has formally  started. Although not yet officially, Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] has gotten its first 11  state enterprises transferred to private ownership. These are  mainly small and medium-sized enterprises which started the  ownership transformation under the old federal laws (the law on  state capital and the law on personal incomes from the time of  Prime Minister Ante Markovic). Here are the names of the  enterprises: Solun, Gevgelija; the copyright agency Tutun,  Skopje; the Agricultural Combinat, Skopje; Metal, Skopje;  Makmarket, Skopje; Skolit, Skopje; Gradinar, Skopje; Economic  Press, Skopje, as well as two more cooperatives, one from Kicevo  and the other from Skopje (which, according to nonofficial  information, have been liquidated in the meantime).    These enterprises started privatization according to Ante  Markovic's law, by buying up the enterprises through internal  shares and making payments to the former Development Fund.    As the manager of the financial sector of the Privatization  Agency Evgeni Zografski explained, although the privatized  enterprises have not yet received an official report on the  accomplished privatization, the ownership is known and the owner  defined. On the other hand, at the time they started the  ownership transformation (in 1990) they applied the legal  procedures of that time, which means that their accountancy was  calculated (as the laws required then). They were denied the  discount allotted by the law on state capital and on the other  capital subject to privatization, the shares were issued and  bought with money paid to the former Development Fund (the  purchase sale contract was done between the enterprise and the  Fund), and later on they were registered as private enterprises.    Most of them were exposed to the control of the former  Government Auditing Office in order to see whether the capital  of the enterprise and the discount allotted to the buyers under  the old laws were accurately calculated, and whether the taxes  for the internal shares were paid in cash.    According to the agency there are some enterprises that have  really given cash money for the shares, but there are also  others which have just made accounting transactions by  purchasing the shares according to Article 4 of the law on  salaries (of that time). If they do not do it in a defined term,  they will not be entitled to that part of the privatized  capital. However, as Zografski says, that is not going to  happen, because there is just a small amount of money to be  paid, and they will certainly do it. Namely, since they are  truly private companies (which means that the present law on  limitation of salaries is not valid) the income they realize can  be transferred to payments for the shares, thus the owners will  definitely buy up the company.    As far as the values are concerned, the capital is  calculated  in the value of that time (the so-called accounting value of the  company), valorized for the period that has passed after the  issuing of the shares until the day the tax payments were made  (today it is 290 times greater than it was in December 1990).  According to the present Privatization Law that money must be  paid in three months' time after the Government Auditing Office  control.    These companies are still waiting for the reports on their  privatization also because of some other unsettled formalities,  as is the public disclosure of the former owners, which will  remain in the competence of the agency until the  Denationalization Law is enacted.    As we were informed by the Privatization Agency, the first  100 privatized companies will be known in June (those that have  started privatization under the old federal laws), and they are  on the list of the 1,468 companies which entered the first phase  of privatization under the new Macedonian law on transformation.    Besides these 11 enterprises, the mixed companies -- foreign  Macedonian (from the former Yugoslav republics) will be the  first in their turn, and they have until 28 June to decide about  their transformation, like the contract organizations. There  are some 50 to 100 companies of mixed capital -- foreign and  domestic, which will be transformed immediately, because their  owners are known. All they have to do is make previous  agreements on transformation with the foreign owner and make  their privatization legal. If they themselves do not do it  before June, the Privatization Agency will have to do it,  according to the law.</p>

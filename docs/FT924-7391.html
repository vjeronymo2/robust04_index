			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Contractors protest over bridge bids: Heseltine is urged to intervene BRITISH steelwork contractors have asked Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to intervene after two Italian companies submitted the lowest bids for bridge contracts worth Pounds 30m. The steel contractors, which claim unfair competition, say the contracts include steelwork for the Pounds 300m privately financed second Severn bridge. The British Constructional Steelwork Association said Cimolai, an Italian contractor which has worked in Britain since the early 1980s, had submitted the lowest tender for the Severn bridge. It also said that Beghini Steel UK, a subsidiary of a Verona-based company, had submitted the lowest bids for the steelwork for the Thelwell viaduct across the M6 in Cheshire and for bridges across the extension of the M3 near Winchester. The association says the three contracts could provide 3,000 jobs for UK contractors. Mr Allan Collins, the association's president, says in a letter to Mr Heseltine: 'This is a very serious undermining of the policy to stimulate UK construction activity.' The letter asks the secretary of state to call an immediate meeting with main contractors involved in the bridge building programme to discuss the problem of cut-price tenders from overseas suppliers. It adds: 'This is not a case of just bleating because we are about to lose. 'We, as an industry, are being battered to death, yet we are without doubt the most efficient producer of fabricated steelwork in Europe. 'This begs the question of how the Italians are getting in with prices up to 20 per cent below our own suppliers'.' Dr Derek Tordoff, the association's director, said yesterday: 'We believe that many Italian fabricators receive hidden subsidies and that they have been targeting Britain and other international markets in order to make up for a decline in Italian construction activity.' According to Dr Tordoff more than 100 UK steel contractors have ceased trading or gone into receivership since 1989. Numbers employed have fallen by 40,000 to 60,000. Four of the largest publicly quoted companies in the sector - Graham Wood, Ward Group, Conder and Henry Barratt - have seen all or part of their businesses go into receivership since the spring. Dr Tordoff warned that further job losses were inevitable, with the industry still suffering from over-capacity in spite of the recent closures.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Rexrodt presses for deal on E German steelmaker MR Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, today will try to cajole the European Union's industry and competition commissioners into agreeing plans for the future of Ekostahl, the east German steelmaker. The Treuhand privatisation agency wants Riva, the private Italian steelmaker, to buy 60 per cent of Ekostahl, and invest in the construction of a hot-rolling mill. But Mr Karel Van Miert, EU competition commissioner, is understood to be insisting on further cuts in capacity at Ekostahl to offset the addition of the new mill. Mr Van Miert and Mr Martin Bangemann, who is in charge of industry policy, are keen to limit state subsidies to publicly owned steelmakers and to cut capacity to relieve pressure on the industry throughout the member states. They will meet Mr Rexrodt in Brussels today to discuss their difficulties with the Ekostahl case. A spokesman for Mr Van Miert said yesterday that the full Commission would consider both the Ekostahl case and the Italian authorities' plans for restructuring of Ilva, the loss-making state steel producer, at their meeting today. But it is almost certain there will not be enough time to prepare for a formal decision on the controversial subsidy cases at the meeting of EU industry ministers on Thursday next week. Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, added to the confusion yesterday when he threatened to press ahead with restructuring of Ilva if the Commission was not more flexible. Mr Savona told the Italian parliament the government would complain to the European Court of Justice if the EU did not make concessions on capacity cuts.</p>

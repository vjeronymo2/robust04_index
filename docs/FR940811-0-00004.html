			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.09 per pound for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, which is a $0.01 increase in the assessment rate from the previous fiscal year. The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 1,727,388 pounds, would yield $155,464.92 in assessment income. This along with $8,000 in interest income and $65,240.08 from the Committee's authorized reserves will be adequate to cover estimated expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major expense categories for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year include $94,200 for salaries, $30,000 for market development, and $20,000 for travel. Funds in the reserve at the end of the fiscal year, estimated at $169,166.84, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An interim final rule was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [59 FR 18948, April 21, 1994] and provided a 30-day comment period for interested persons. One comment was received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment states that the interim final rule should be revised to comply with Executive Order 12770 directing preferential use of the metric system of measurement by Federal departments and agencies. Projects or programs that directly affect individual farmers or farm programs have been granted a general exemption from this directive. The Department has determined that Marketing Agreements and Orders fall under this exemption. The industries involved do not use the metric system in the marketing of their products. To convert their trading practices to the metric system would disrupt trade and inflate costs. Changing order regulations to accommodate the metric system would not benefit the industry or consumers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, for the reasons stated, the Department is not making any changes in this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year for the program began June 1, 1994. The marketing order requires that the rate of assessment apply to all assessable oil handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as an interim final rule. One comment was received concerning the interim final rule that is adopted in this action as a final rule without change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 985 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing Agreements, Oils and fats, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Spearmint oil. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 985 is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 985_MARKETING ORDER REGULATING THE HANDLING OF SPEARMINT OIL PRODUCED IN THE FAR WEST <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

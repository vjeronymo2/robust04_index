			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Chinese candidates line up for HK listing - The flotations which will add a new dimension to the colony This year some of China's largest state-run industries will be listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, adding a new dimension to a stock market that has long been driven by local political and property influences. The potential for Hong Kong is enormous, and the pull for advisers has been similarly compelling. More than 40 merchant banks have lined up to fight for the mandate for the flotation of just one of the companies, Qingdao Brewery, which produces one of China's best-known exports, Tsingtao beer. Shanghai Petrochemical, which is the largest and probably the first of the flotations, is set to raise as much as HKDollars 3bn (USDollars 388m). In total, analysts believe the nine short-listed companies will raise more than HKDollars 7bn. If successful, there is an enormous supply of further candidates from among the country's financially stretched state industries, which are keen to tap international capital flows by developing a strong Chinese element to what will in five years become a Chinese-owned stock market. However, there are sizeable obstacles to be overcome before these Chinese flotations can be smoothly launched in Hong Kong. Not least of these is a need for re-education of the companies' management. Only recently, Chinese company directors would have been jailed for releasing commercial information to foreigners. Now they are going to be obliged to provide even more detailed disclosure than under the old state system. Management freedom comes at a high price. It will have to cope with the dislocation of facing up to market forces and having responsibility to a new body of shareholders. This compares with the undemanding quota systems that they are used to. Potential investors will also need educating, as these companies represent an entirely new business concept. 'These corporations are like industrial revolution style company towns, where everyone owes their soul to the company store,' said one merchant banker. Shanghai Petrochemical, China's sixth largest petrochemical company, is an entire city. The company oversees everything from the law courts to the fire service, and employs an estimated 63,000 people. The general manager is like a mayor, and drives around 'his' city with a red flashing light on the top of his car. Merrill Lynch was awarded the role of global co-ordinator for the flotation, but despite having a June target for the public offer, there is no decision yet as to what can actually be listed. It is clear that the corporation's social responsibilities will be unacceptable to a new shareholder base, but an alternative structure has yet to be conceived. Senior representatives of the Hong Kong stock exchange met China's Securities Committee - the new regulatory body for China's capital markets - in Nanjing this week to wrestle with some of the technical problems presented by the listings. One international corporate lawyer pointed out that a Chinese enterprise has to complete a share offering in order to become a separate legal entity. As a result, some issues of B shares - shares available only to foreign investors - on the Chinese stock markets have been for companies that did not legally exist during the subscription period. The Hong Kong stock exchange will want to address this. The Chinese government wants all nine industrial companies to be listed by the end of the year, and there is already rumoured to be a second batch of 12 companies ready for flotation in early 1994. 'When the Chinese top leaders want to do something, they put a lot of effort into it and they get it done very quickly,' said Mr Tommy Wong, of Kwan Wong Tan &amp; Fong, a local accountancy firm which is handling two of the Chinese flotations. Accountants agree that the process is aided by the level of detail in state company records. As Mr Wong says: 'They shoot people for economic crimes.' However, translating Chinese accounting systems into a set of internationally accepted accounts is proving complex, with major differences in the treatment of equity accounting, foreign exchange translation, and stock-taking. The revised accounts will bear little resemblance to the current profit claims of the companies. But an unprecedented number of merchant banks are prepared to take up the challenge. Corporate financiers have been cutting documentation fees to the bone in order to fight for mandates, which are due to be announced before the end of February. Mr Ambrose Lam, managing director of corporate finance at Standard Chartered Asia, said: 'It is recognised not to be very profitable, but it is worth it to get the recognition, and hopefully to have a better chance with the next batch of issues.' The Securities Committee is taking an active role throughout. The committee is led by Zhu Rongji - a member of the Communist party's most powerful decision-making body - which emphasises the importance that China is attaching to this programme. The committee has decided to focus on Chinese incorporated listings in Hong Kong, rather than allowing companies to incorporate and be floated further afield - such as the New York listing of Brilliance Automotive. Beijing must be heartened by the fact that the HKDollars 403m offer for Hong Kong registered Denway Investments, the Chinese car manufacturer, is understood to have attracted more than HKDollars 200bn in subscription funds. The response suggests a quite extraordinary level of demand for China shares in Hong Kong. The use of leading international houses such as Merrill's will enable future issues to tap an even broader investor base. The managing director of a local corporate finance house said: 'Knowing the pent-up demand by Chinese companies for capital, it would be inconceivable that they would float less than 20 state companies per year, after the first batch. Therefore they understand the importance of getting it right first time.'  ----------------------------------------------------------- CHINESE CORPORATIONS TO BE LISTED  -----------------------------------------------------------                                               Employees  ----------------------------------------------------------- Shanghai Petrochemical                          63,000 Yizheng Joint Corporation of Chemical Fibre     19,000 Kunming Machine Tool                            25,000 Guangzhou Shipyard                               8,000 Qingdao Brewery                                  2,700 Maanshan Iron and Steel                        100,000 Dongfang Electric                                3,000 Tianjin Bohai Chemical                          29,000 Beijing Renmin Machinery                         5,600  ----------------------------------------------------------- Source - Sinoprosper International  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

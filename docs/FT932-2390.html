			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Clayform doubt Analysts were quick to pour scorn on rumours about Clayform Properties, the company that has seen its share price leap this week after Mr Martin Landau's arrival as a significant stakeholder raised suggestions that he may use Clayform as a bid vehicle for a larger group. Clayform has gone from 16p last Friday to its present price of 37p, having gained 4 yesterday as its name was linked to possible moves on Slough Estates or MEPC. But property specialists refused to be stirred, one describing the proposition as 'completely implausible'. The company has a market capitalisation of Pounds 11.6m, compared with Pounds 792.3m for Slough Estates and Pounds 1.54bn for MEPC. One analyst said the only ace in Clayform's hand was its exposure to retailing through Stead and Simpson, but that could not be expected to sway shareholders. Slough Estates moved up 3 to 209p amid the speculation but that was broadly in line with a firm property sector. British Land rose 4 to 313p. Hammerson put on 3 at 369p and the 'A' stock 9 at 338p. Derwent Valley announced a Pounds 10.3m property portfolio acquisition on the back of a Pounds 16.9m placing of shares on open offer. Its price held at 493p.</p>

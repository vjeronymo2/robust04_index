			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Delors attacks 'wildcat' devaluations: EC's floating currencies accused of threatening the future of the ERM MR JACQUES DELORS, European Commission President, yesterday launched an attack on 'wildcat' devaluations which were undermining confidence in the European exchange rate mechanism. Without naming the UK, Mr Delors said he believed that a system of relatively fixed exchange rates - like the ERM - offered greater advantages than floating exchange rates. Currencies which left the discipline of the ERM and floated freely raised 'serious questions' about the future of the European monetary system. At a news conference in Brussels, Mr Delors stressed that there was nothing wrong with realignments within the ERM, if there were fundamental economic divergences between members. But it was important that adjustments were carried out within the ERM in the presence of EC finance ministers, rather than 'a wildcat act done at the drop of a hat'. The European Commission president's comments underline lingering resentment in Brussels over Britain's unilateral withdrawal of sterling from the ERM during last September's currency crisis, and concern over the unsettling effect of a floating pound on other currencies in the ERM. However, Mr Delors declined to back charges in Bonn and Paris that Anglo-Saxon financial institutions were engaged in a plot to undermine the ERM and prevent the creation of a single European currency to rival the dollar. 'I have no information, but that does not mean to say others have no information. I cannot confirm or deny.' Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany accused unnamed forces last week of seeking to 'torpedo' the EC's drive for a monetary union by the end of the century by speculating against individual currencies. Mr Raymond Barre, former French finance minister, said last week that certain people in economic and financial circles were determined to prevent the creation of European economic and monetary union and 'blow up' the EMS. Mr Delors said he had studied closely the recent turbulence in the currency markets. His conclusion was that the ERM needed to be strengthened, and the second stage of Emu leading to fixed exchange rates for currencies meeting strict economic convergence criteria should be prepared very carefully. Mr Delors again ruled out the option of a small group of strong currencies led by France and Germany moving on a 'fast-track' to Emu outside the Maastricht treaty. EC members agreed that the process including all 12 countries moving together, he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yo'el Marcus: "A Creeping Putsch?"] </F>   [Text] Israel is more or less divided in two: tall people  and short people, fat people and thin people, and Rabin's men  and Peres' men. Under this division, politicians have been  dragging the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to a place where it  does not belong: the arduous road of internal political  struggle.    The question is not what is the professional opinion voiced  by the chief of staff and his subordinates in internal forums  discussing the peace process but who is leaking the chief of  staff's views and for what purpose. Last Friday, YEDI'OT  AHARONOT -- which, according to the aforementioned division,  gets its leaks from the tall people -- carried a front-page  report that "the chief of staff is trying to create a crisis  with 'Arafat." Five days have gone by, and we have not heard of  the IDF spokesman issuing any denial. To make sure, I  officially approached the spokesman and asked him whether he  could deny the report, which I consider serious. After all, it  is not every day that a chief of staff plans to sabotage a move  decided upon by the government. The spokesman said he did not  participate in the meeting and, consequently, could not issue a  denial.    I pursued my inquiries with a higher level and found that  there are no plans to issue a denial. I was told: "We do not  deny every report appearing in the press." Although this  refusal in no way constitutes confirmation of the report, I got  the impression that the Army top brass is not really sorry that  its reservations about the Davos understandings are getting so  much publicity. One need not be an erudite political  commentator to realize that the chief of staff -- and definitely  the prime minister -- are not averse to the leaks.    The wave of reports about the Army's reservations has a  purpose: to rein Shim'on Peres in. "There is a man who is very  displeased with the rapid progress in the negotiations with the  Palestinians, and he systematically leaks information against  the agreement," says a man close to the foreign minister -- and  we can only guess who he is referring to. Others look for the  psychological angle. They think that to this day, the chief of  staff has been unable to forget that he was not let in on the  Oslo agreement. He has been very critical of the loopholes in  the agreement and now wants to approve every comma and period.  Into his fourth year as chief of staff and in view of his  ambition to have a far-reaching political career, Baraq cannot  afford to fail in the implementation of the agreement on Gaza  and Jericho, those people say.    The chief of staff, however, is not the main protagonist in  the affair of the Army's public involvement. The main  protagonist is the defense minister, who is disturbed by Peres'  hyperactivity.    In the meeting of the "peace team forum" held on the morning  of 27 January (attended by Rabin, Peres, Baraq, Shahaq, Dayan,  Sagi, Haber, Yatom, the head of the Shin Bet, and three senior  Foreign Ministry officials), Peres found himself in the minority  in the face of the criticism of the Army top brass. From that  day on, but mainly after Peres and 'Arafat were seen holding  hands and bursting with joy, there have been systematic leaks  about the Army's opposition to the Davos agreement, including  reports about this confidential meeting. Indeed, the signing in  Davos was torpedoed successfully. Peres was forced to travel to  Cairo with new demands.    The General Staff's reservations may or may not be relevant,  but that is not the point. The point is the way in which the  IDF was ushered into the political decisionmaking process.  Rabin's dominance as prime minister and defense minister,  coupled with his disregard for his cabinet ministers and his  suspicion of Peres, created a situation where Ehud Baraq became  his confidant and his close adviser. The inner cabinet has been  replaced by a group of senior officers trusted by Rabin and  Baraq. And, somehow, the fine line dividing the executive  branch from the elected level has been blurred. Suddenly we  find Army officers negotiating peace or sitting on either side  of Rabin in meetings with statesmen. Thus the Army finds itself  siding with one minister against another and involved in  decisions that are the exclusive prerogative of the elected  level.    A military putsch, if you forgive my expression, comes in  many forms. It does not necessarily entail usurping a  legitimate government by force. Excessive involvement of the  army in government bodies, even if solicited by the highest  level, is a type of putsch. Perhaps a creeping putsch. Those  who want to uphold checks and balances, the separation of  powers, and the subordination of civil servants to elected  officials should put the Army back where it belongs as an  apolitical entity.</p>

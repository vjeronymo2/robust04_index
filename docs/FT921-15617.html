			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Technology: Growing pains - Louise Kehoe assesses Sematech's ambitious five-year plan Can Sematech, the controversial US government-funded chip makers' consortium, live up to its promise to 're-establish American pre-eminence in semiconductor manufacturing technology'? As Sematech leaders seek support for a second five-year phase of operations, the achievements of the research consortium are coming under closer scrutiny in both industry and government circles. Sematech is also being closely watched as an experiment in precompetitive, generic research and development that may provide an important model for other sectors of the US manufacturing industry struggling to maintain or reassert their international competitiveness. This week's withdrawal of one of Sematech's founding member companies, LSI Logic, has raised new questions about the effectiveness of collaborative ventures among companies with differing technology and financial objectives. To date, it has been difficult to assess Sematech's achievements. Many of the consortium's research projects have been shrouded in what the group's executives acknowledge has been 'excessive secrecy' aimed at maintaining maximum competitive advantage for member companies. But now Sematech is boasting about its achievements and has recently published a summary of the results of some of its research projects. 'By the end of 1992 we will have achieved parity with our (Japanese) competitors,' claims William Spencer, Sematech president and chief executive. By the end of 1992 Sematech expects to show that it can make integrated circuits with features measuring just 0.35 microns (millionths of a metre) in width, about half the size of today's most advanced devices. This will put Sematech on a par with leading Japanese chip producers. More significant is that Sematech aims to achieve this advance in chip process production technology using all American-built equipment. When Sematech was formed, in 1987, its member companies expected to purchase less than 40 per cent of their production equipment for the next generation of 'sub-micron' chips from American suppliers. Actual purchases by US chip makers now average over 70 per cent American-made. For Sematech this is one of the most important measures of its success to date. Although the consortium originally planned to focus on the production process rather than the manufacturing of equipment, the emphasis changed. Well over half of Sematech's budget has been dedicated to R&amp;D contracts with US semiconductor equipment companies to create new equipment or to improve the performance of existing products. Sematech highlights, for example, its work with GCA, a US manufacturer of photolithography equipment, that had seen its market share dwindle in the late 1980s. GCA's latest lithography equipment matches the performance of the best that Japanese companies can offer. Not all of Sematech's member companies were pleased with the shift of emphasis. 'Preserving the US equipment industry is a laudable goal, but it was not Sematech's charter,' complains Wilfred Corrigan, chairman of LSI Logic. Sematech has prepared a lengthy summary of its technical accomplishments, detailing improvements in the performance of US-built semiconductor production equipment as well as programs designed to standardise equipment testing and establish standards for equipment interfaces. But Sematech's most important achievements, according to industry executives, are intangible changes in the relationships between US chip makers and production equipment suppliers - from adversaries to partners. Sematech cannot prove that it is responsible for an improvement in the competitiveness of the US chip industry, or of US production equipment suppliers. While both segments of the industry have achieved some success in world markets, these results can be explained by external factors. US chip makers, for example, reversed their declining share of the world semiconductor market in 1991. This is largely explained, however, by a sharp decline in the price of memory chips made in Japan. Similarly, some US semiconductor equipment producers have increased their foreign sales, but might well have done so without Sematech's support, according to industry analysts. Under pressure to establish its value in order to obtain continued funding, Sematech may be 'sugar coating' its record; glossing over the difficulties of maintaining a consensus among companies with differing goals and expectations. Sematech might do better to admit that it is only now getting into its stride. Although the industry group was incorporated in August 1987 it was almost another year before the appointment of Robert Noyce as chief executive. Only in early 1989 did Sematech begin operation of its prototype chip plant in Austin. After a significant re-evaluation of the direction of Sematech, it began to take shape in the second half of 1989 but was still beset by concerns over federal funding. The sudden death of Noyce in mid-1990 left Sematech bereft of a leader. William Spencer, the current chief executive, has had only one year at the helm. Thus while Sematech is being judged as a five-year old it is really little more than a toddler, still wobbly on its feet but determined to prove its abilities. Sematech's plans for the next five years are just as ambitious as those mapped out for its first. They include the development of computer-integrated manufacturing software for automated chip plants and a new emphasis on flexible manufacturing. Sematech aims to accelerate the development of new generations of semiconductor technology by 25 per cent. 'Sematech's proposals are without precedent,' Spencer claims, 'but five years ago Sematech was without precedent.'</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Iran-US relations ease despite hardliners' anger THE FIRST US supplies of clothes and blankets for Kurdish refugees arrived in Iran this week, to be greeted by the hardline Tehran newspaper, Jomhuri-ye Islami, as Aids-infested rejects which should be returned. This is in stark contrast to the official position of President Hashemi Rafsanjani's government which has been to welcome international aid, including any from the US, while the country remains swamped by the sudden influx of over 1m refugees. President George Bush called the Iranian decision to receive the US supplies as 'a new and welcome thing'. The delivery came in the second US aircraft to land in Tehran since the 1979 revolution - the first carried a chocolate cake brought by Mr Robert McFarlane, then US national security adviser, as part of a secret attempt to improve relations and obtain the release of US hostages in Lebanon, through the sale of arms. The hostages remain the main block to any radical improvement in relations between Tehran and Washington as Mr Bush made clear a fortnight ago. He did, however, hope for better ties with Iran. There has nevertheless been a definite thaw in relations. In January, Washington relaxed a three-year ban on Iranian oil imports, though the proceeds of such sales would have to be deposited in an account at the Hague designed to compensate US claimants. On Monday the Middle East Economic Survey, the Cyprus-based oil newsletter reported that Iran had concluded oil deals with two American buyers, for oil deliveries totalling 130,000 b/d to non-US destinations, thereby avoiding the Hague payment restrictions. Last month, the US administration did not attempt to block a Dollars 250m World Bank loan to Iran for earthquake reconstruction, despite Iran being on its list of 'terrorist' nations. The thaw has been prompted by strategic developments in the Gulf region. Now that Iraq's power has diminished and Iran has gone out of its way to improve relations with the Gulf emirates, the US is contemplating the role Iran is likely to play in the future. Iran itself, is anxious to resume the mantle of guardian of the Gulf which it wore under the Shah. Mr Rafsanjani has just completed a visit to Syria and is now in Turkey, to discuss regional issues. He is concerned that Iran should never be as isolated as it was when Iraq invaded the country in 1980, the start of an eight-year war. If tensions were to erupt with Iraq, Iran would want to make sure it did not stand alone. But Iranian hardliners are on the defensive and have attacked Mr Rafsanjani's policy of restoring relations with some of the US's closest regional allies, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan. The daily Kayhan, warned against following a 'policy of appeasement' in order to achieve a 'prestigious place in the so-called Persian Gulf security order'.</p>

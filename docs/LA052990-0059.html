			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL EARNINGS: HOUSE OF FABRICS PROFIT RISES 60% IN 1ST QUARTER  </P> <P> House of Fabrics said its fiscal first-quarter profit jumped 60% from a year  earlier on a 9% increase in sales.  </P> <P> The Sherman Oaks-based company, which operates 619 fabrics and sewing stores,  said net income in the quarter that ended April 30 rose to $2.15 million from  $1.34 million, while its sales climbed to $86.4 million from $79.5 million.  </P> <P> House of Fabrics attributed the gains to an ongoing conversion of its stores  from smaller, shopping-mall units to larger "superstores" that maintain higher  profit margins and to increased demand for home-sewing products.  </P></p>

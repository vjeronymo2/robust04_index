			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / MFN Renewal for China: A big step in long march to respectability It is not the smallest of ironies that on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen massacre China, with President Clinton's help, has taken another and substantial step in its long march back to international respectability. The US decision to extend China's most favoured nation trade status for another year virtually without conditions and to propose that the linkage between trade and human rights be severed could hardly have come as a more welcome development for Beijing. Five years after Chinese tanks blasted demonstrators on the streets of the capital to worldwide disgust, China's international rehabilitation is well on the way to being formalised; although its human rights transgressions are certain to continue to be an irritant to its relations with the West. While Western states maintain military sanctions, even these bans are weakening. Judging by increased military exchanges between China and the West it is only a matter of time before restrictions on arms sales are removed. From China's standpoint, among the more important consequences of the mfn decision is that another obstacle has been removed that might interfere with its manifest ambition of becoming a world trading power to match its political aspirations. In the short term, Mr Clinton's decision should also ensure that China becomes a more active participant in regional forums such as the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum which is emerging as a potential cornerstone of US policy in the Pacific. Indeed, China's foreign ministry yesterday referred to the opportunities for an enhanced regional partnership. 'China and the United States sharebroad interests,' it said. 'The current situation offers an historical opportunity for the enhancement of Sino-American relations.' The US decision will certainly have a positive impact on the Apec summit to be held in Jakarta later this year to be attended by, among others, Mr Clinton and Mr Jiang Zemin, his Chinese counterpart, The mfn decision is also likely to facilitate China's negotiations to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), and its successor World Trade Organisation. An early indication of progress on this front will come in Washington late next week when Mr Long Yongtu, China's chief Gatt negotiator, begins bilateral talks with US officials on the Gatt issue. Gatt negotiations, which have proceeded in fits and start partly because of US diffidence, are likely to accelerate. The chances of China becoming a founder member of the WTO when it comes into being at the beginning of 1995 have been enhanced. Perhaps the most important consequence of the mfn decision is its likely impact on the fractious Sino-US relationship itself. As the 21st century approaches and with it what is widely expected to be the era of the Pacific there is scarcely a more important partnership. Mr Clinton has made possible a less rancorous and more constructive relationship. But he has not waved a magic wand. Differences will persist with the West over human rights and other issues. If the process of the past year has demonstrated anything, it is that China will be tough and combative in defence of what it perceives to be its own interests.</p>

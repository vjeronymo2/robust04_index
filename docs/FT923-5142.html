			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG tries to calm fears over mine deals PAPUA NEW Guinea yesterday moved to ease concern that mining agreements might be renegotiated following the recent election defeat of the former government headed by Mr Rabbie Namaliu. Sir Julius Chan, deputy prime minister and finance minister in the new government headed by Mr Paias Wingti, said that comments made during the election campaign had been 'misinterpreted'. 'We are quite happy. There is no need for a re-negotiation of existing agreements between government and mining companies,' Sir Julius said during a visit to Sydney. However, he said Australian mining groups, which have made substantial investments in PNG, must become 'better corporate citizens' if they wished to share in PNG's rapid development. Disputes over land and royalty payments have disrupted several resource projects, including the Panguna copper mine on Bougainville and an alluvial gold mine at Mount Kare. Both mines were formerly operated by CRA, the Australian mining group. Panguna has been closed ever since it was attacked in 1990 by the secessionist Bougainville Revolutionary Army. However, Mount Kare is expected to reopen soon following an agreement with Placer Pacific, which operates the nearby Porgera gold mine. Sir Julius also said the government was considering increasing its stake in the Kutubu oil project from 22.5 per cent to 30 per cent, in line with its agreement with a group of overseas oil companies. Pasminco, the Australian lead and zinc group, has announced that it has offered voluntary redundancy to 1,370 workers at its Broken Hill mines in an effort to boost productivity by a third. The company, which recently announced a net loss of ADollars 58.6m (Pounds 21m) for the year to the end of June, said there was no ceiling on the number of redundancies that would be accepted. Pasminco said that it wanted to increase production at Broken Hill by about 100,000 tonnes a year to 2.65m tonnes by June 1993. The redundancy offer is part of a programme aimed at increasing productivity to from 1,900 tonnes to 3,000 tonnes a year per employee.</p>

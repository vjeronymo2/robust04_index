			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Arts: Richard's Cork Leg Richard's Cork Leg is Brendan Behan's last play, left unfinished at the time of his death in 1964. It was left to his friend, the Dublin director Alan Simpson, to make sense of the play's missing ending from the numerous wordy and rambling drafts the author left behind, and it is surprising how well this endearing short satire has weathered since it was premiered in the early seventies. At the time it caused a good deal of controversy in Behan's native Ireland, where his work was often banned, being denounced by the Irish clergy as blasphemous. The play is set for the most part in a Dublin cemetery - 'one of the healthiest graveyards in Ireland' - used as a regular gathering place for a company of off-beat castaways: colourful tarts, phoney blind men, zealous Protestants and Irish revolutionaries and fascists. There isn't much of a plot to speak of but rather a college of characters given the opportunity to air their views on love, religion, politics and death. The fast dialogue of witty non sequiturs and whimsical comments on the state of humanity is occasionaly interspersed with bursts of songs of bawdy humour. Merriment and reflection are the hallmarks of the evening, but in the background death beckons in the shape of a large coffin placed centre-stage. Behan's anarchic world springs to life with energy and verve if little polish, but in a way this lack of discipline goes hand in hand with the author's own ungovernable chatter. Julia Hallawell and Paula Hughes are most engaging as the two mini-skirted and bejewelled prostitutes who protest against Mrs Mallarkey's report of 'free love' sweeping the island and threatening their trade. The central character of Cronin, probably the author himself, is played with comic tenderness by Anthony Kernan. The scene in which he competes for the favours of Denise Kean's prim Deirdre is truly touching as she becomes both a reluctant and a willing object of his attentions. Maxine O'Reilly is the spoil-sport Mallarkey who strongly disapproves of her daughter's association with the married Cronin. Directed sympathetically by Iain Charles Hake, who has left out some of Behan's rowdy songs, this is an evening of spontaneous laughter, a a welcome revival of a rarely performed play.

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / SIB consolidates powers with Melton Medes ruling The High Court judgment dismissing an action to sue the Securities and Investments Board for allegedly breaching provisions in the Financial Services Act about passing on 'restricted' information is seen by the regulator as a crucial consolidation of its powers. It also has far-reaching implications for other regulators which have not yet had to test their authority to disclose information in the courts. Moreover, it establishes the right of SIB, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, to enforce the law without fear that individuals adversely affected by its activities can sue it for damages. Yesterday's ruling, dismissing a challenge by Melton Medes, a trading conglomerate accused by SIB of breaching rules governing the investment of pension funds, has clarified the issue. The judge's ruling amounted to a sweeping endorsement of the propriety of the regulator's operations. By removing the possibility that it would be subject to civil claims for damages in the future, the judgment strengthens SIB's enforcement capability. The judge said the only remedy available to Melton Medes was to seek a criminal prosecution of SIB or to seek judicial review. At issue in the case was the decision of SIB to alert beneficiaries of the Melton Medes pension scheme to the fact that the auditors to the scheme were considering altering an unqualified audit opinion given in an earlier year. Melton Medes and Mr Nathu Ram Puri, its chairman, alleged that this amounted to a breach of section 179 of the Financial Services Act which prevents the disclosure of restricted information. The issue arose after Imro began an inquiry into Melton Medes Pension Trustees Ltd in early 1992. This related to a loan of Pounds 5m from the pension funds to the company itself. Although repayment was made, it came in the form of shares of two companies of which one of the pension trustees was a director. At the same time, some beneficiaries of the pension fund began legal action, seeking Pounds 7m compensation for losses allegedly arising from this loan. Melton Medes argued that had the beneficiaries not been alerted to the auditors' concerns by SIB, they would have agreed to settle all their claims without asking the company to add anything to the pension scheme. However, in ruling on whether restricted information had been disclosed, Mr Justice Lightman said it clearly had not. Alerting beneficiaries to information which may exist elsewhere is not the same as disclosing information actually in its possession, he said. 'SIB had no duty to refrain from procuring or inducing others lawfully to disclose information, merely because SIB could not itself lawfully make such disclosure,' he said. Moreover, the judge said, information about the auditors' concerns had actually been available publicly as it had figured in an earlier court case. Under the Financial Services Act, information that has been disclosed publicly elsewhere cannot be deemed to be restricted. Mr Justice Lightman emphasised that there were absolutely no restrictions on disclosure by SIB of non-restricted information. 'I can see no basis for any suggestion that it was beyond the powers of SIB to disclose non-restricted information to assist the beneficiaries in the beneficiaries' action,' Mr Lightman said in his 22-page ruling. 'Indeed the provision of assistance in this form to the beneficiaries would appear to me entirely to accord with the aim of the act and the role of SIB, namely the protection of the interests of investors and the customer (as against the provider) of financial services.' SIB investigators obtained information from Kidsons Impey, the fund's auditors, and disclosed other information to the accountants that SIB had obtained during its investigations. The provision of this information was covered by a gateway permitted in the act. At a meeting in January 1993 between Kidsons and SIB, the auditors said that had they previously been aware of the information passed to them by SIB, they may well have qualified the fund's accounts, instead of signing unqualified reports. The SIB official concerned later asked the solicitor acting for the beneficiaries whether he was happy to rely upon the auditor's earlier certificate. At the root of his concern was that this might lead the beneficiaries to accept worse terms than they might otherwise be able to obtain. The judge was asked to rule on three issues. First, whether anyone has a private right to sue SIB if breaches of section 179 occur. Second, whether SIB had acted in 'bad faith' in talking to the beneficiaries' lawyer. Third, whether the information passed on amounted to a breach of section 179. Mr Justice Lightman ruled in favour of SIB on all three points. The only sanction provided by the act against a section 179 breach was criminal prosecution so private actions could not be brought, he said. He rejected the allegation that SIB had acted in bad faith, saying SIB had specifically refused a request to support the claim of the scheme beneficiaries. Awarding 'indemnity costs' to SIB, Mr Lightman said the case for 'bad faith' had never been made and the case should never have been allowed to proceed. He refused the plaintiff's request for leave to appeal.</p>

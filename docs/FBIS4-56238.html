			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Forum" column] </F>   [Text] Following a careful and thorough analysis of  government plans, the resources and the methodology to carry  them out, each of the presidential candidates, and the parties  that have nominated them, the Pro-Fatherland Civilist Network  [Red Civilista Pro Patria] decided, on Thursday, 28 April, to  support the candidacies of and to recommend that all Civilists  vote for Professor Ruben Dario Carles as president, Guillermo  Quijano as first vice president, and Tomas Herrera as second  vice president.    Without any alliance commitments to the dictatorial regime  and full of patriotic desire to reconstruct our country  following the economic, social, institutional, and ethical  traumas it has endured, the members of the Pro-Fatherland  Civilist Network emerge in the current political picture as a  new, young, encouraging force worthy of credit after traveling a  long road among negative factors that are so contagious. The  members of the group have not demonstrated any tendency to fall  into the traps set by corruption to catch those who do not have  sufficient moral values to avoid any threat of contamination due  to vocation, fear, or bribery.    The recognition that the Pro-Fatherland Civilist Network  gives Professor Carles and his running mates is a valuable  decoration, like those given by the people to those who deserve  it. It is not the result of an intense propaganda campaign, but  a logical result of an entire productive and honest life.    It is not a matter of political alliances, it is a vibrant  invitation for Panamanian people to listen before making the  correct decision at a time when so many people have their  doubts. They will now be able to clearly see the road leading  to a better Panama, alongside the Change '94 candidates, headed  by Prof. Ruben Dario Carles.</p>

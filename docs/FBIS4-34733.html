			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Good Friend"] </F>   [Text] Brazil would have acted properly if, in fact, it  would have canceled the visit of Argentine Economy Minister  Domingo Cavallo to Brazil in retaliation for President Carlos  Menem's objectionable action to launch the candidacy of Mexican  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari for chairman of the World  Trade Organization [WTO] against that of Brazilian Finance  Minister Rubens Ricupero, which already had been announced.    What Menem did in Cartagena, Colombia, was an act of  provocation. He waited for the last moment of the Ibero-American  Summit to create a disagreeable diplomatic situation in keeping  with a political line that has become commonplace at all the  international forums he attends -- and Menem attends all the  forums he can. Menem, who is an exhibitionist, implements  demagogic actions in foreign policy aimed at domestic campaigns  in which he relies on voters' short memories to make them  promises he will hardly be able to comply with later.    Since the Persian Gulf War, when Argentina sent a small  squadron to the theater of operations that did not do anything,  through the controversial approval of NAFTA, Menem attempted to  please the White House at any cost. He will make any deal for an  interview with the U.S. President. On this occasion, Menem has  visibly offered the United States to simultaneously bomb two  candidacies for the WTO presidency: Ricupero, who represents the  developing countries, and Renato Ruggero, the former Italian  economy minister who represents the EC. Within this context,  Salinas seems a docile candidate for the White House, which is  willing to play the role of an interested friend.    Menem's unexpected support for Salinas is a serious matter  because 10 days earlier, Itamaraty had informed the Argentine  and Mexican Governments that Ricupero would be a candidate for  WTO chairman. In diplomatic language, Argentina and Mexico "got  the message" of Brazil's intention.    Within the context of Mercosur [Common Market of the South]  and relations among Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay,  which have been engaged in economic commitments since the  beginning of the year, it was more than obvious that naming  Ricupero should be an essential maneuver.    During the last OAS meeting in Belem, when most of the  countries that attended the meeting, including Brazil, spoke in  favor of Cuba joining the organization, Menem went against the  tide and automatically sided with the United States. He could  not miss that chance. In an extravagant manner, he stands out  from the other leaders of this part of the world. He is an apple  polisher. Not even the United States is as resentful. Evidence  of this is its economic closeness to Vietnam (where in the  sixties it lost 50,000 men), Russia, and the PRC.    To ignore Ricupero's candidacy and jump into the arms of  Salinas is to openly support a policy that is ostensibly failing  in Mexico. The Mexican electoral campaign has demonstrated that  its political system is in crisis after one party's supremacy  over the rest for 70 years. The alliance between Mexico and the  United States through NAFTA is a desperate move to save a  pretend democracy that clashes with the U.S. market economy  system, political freedom, and free elections without fraud or  violence.    To support the Mexican regime at this point is the same as  expressing distrust of the Mercosur partners. Menem has bet on  an uncertain future. His words were like a green light to the  Argentine business people who protest the invasion of Brazilian  products and prefer to seek protection in a protectionist  government instead of improving their competitiveness. This idea  has prompted the formation of economic blocs like those in  Europe and Asia, including the American continent, to overcome  any obstacles to the world economy's growth.    Since 1 January, Mercosur member countries have reduced  their  import tariffs 85 percent. On 30 June, they must reduce them 89  percent, and by the end of the year they must eliminate them  completely. Mercosur is a reality that cannot be ignored. Chile,  which first considered joining NAFTA, now is turning to  Mercosur. Menem, by offering to serve the United States, is  turning his back on his closest friends and undermining  continental solidarity.</p>

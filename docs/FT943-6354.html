			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): High-tech conferences - In a nutshell Fans of high-technology companies, their problems and what they can bring to the world, have an embarrassment of riches this autumn. A high-technology, small-firms conference on September 19-20 hosted by Manchester Business School* aims to promote contacts between policy makers, industrialists and academics. The conference includes a French contribution underlining the lack of advantages small companies enjoy as technology grows more complex, a US look at the role of Federal laboratories as industrial partners, and a 'lesson' in high-technology new-product development from International Business Machines. On October 11, Warwick Business School** is holding a one-day seminar comparing the performance of high-technology companies on and off UK science parks. An HMSO publication on the issue will be published the same day. *Manchester Business School, tel 061 275 6537. **Warwick Business School, tel 0203 523741.</p>

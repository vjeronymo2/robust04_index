			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE INSURANCE DEPT. REJECTS PETITION  </P> <P> The state Department of Insurance has turned down an administrative petition by  the Proposition 103 campaign and a coalition of consumer groups asking the  department to establish regulations under the initiative to limit insurance  company rights to cancel or refuse to renew auto insurance policies.  </P> <P> Department lawyer James W. Holmes wrote the petitioning parties that in light  of the state Supreme Court's review of the constitutionality of Proposition  103, it would be "premature and precipitous" to define terms in the initiative,  even though the high court has ruled that the cancellation and non-renewal  parts of it are in effect.  </P> <P> "Further, while the department intends to enforce vigorously the limitation in  (the measure) on non-renewal and cancellation, we are not persuaded that formal  rule-making is needed to accomplish that objective at this time," Holmes  declared in a letter rejecting the petition filed Jan. 18.  </P> <P> The groups had argued that Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie had "failed  to act decisively" to define what some of the terms of Proposition 103 mean.  Holmes called those assertions "inaccurate and outdated" in light of recent  action the department has taken against companies, such as Travelers, for  failing to renew auto policies.  </P></p>

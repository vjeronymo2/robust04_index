			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Diary of Japan's descent to chaos The sequence of events in which Japan's politics have slipped from stability into chaos, and which culminated in Saturday's resignation of Mr Tsutomu Hata's minority coalition, began in the late 1980s. A series of scandals caused the splintering of the Liberal Democratic party (LDP). Following defeat in a no- confidence motion the LDP lost its overall majority in elections last July, bringing to an end its 38-year rule. Since then, coalition governments have grappled with the problems of political reform, foreign relations, and the longest recession since the second world war in a climate of almost perpetual crisis. 1993 August - Japan New party leader Morihiro Hosokawa, committed to political reform, chosen as prime minister at the head of a seven-party coalition, including the socialists. November 18 - Bills aimed at reforming Japan's corrupt political system passed by Lower House of the Diet and sent to Upper House, where they are bogged down in controversies over budget and foreign calls for the opening of Japan's rice market. 1994 January 20 - Reform measures passed by Upper House committee, and sent to full session. January 21 - Full Upper House votes down reforms, watered-down version later passed with LDP backing February 4 - Hosokawa suddenly announces new 7 per cent consumption tax to finance proposed income tax cuts designed to lift economy out of recession. Forced to withdraw plan five days later. February 11 - Trade summit with US President Bill Clinton ends in failure after Hosokawa rejects US demands to set numerical targets for opening up Japanese markets. March - LDP blocks tax-cutting budget in attempt to force Hosokawa to clear doubts over a shady 1982 loan he is alleged to have used for a political campaign. April 8 - Hosokawa resigns abruptly to take responsibility for parliamentary deadlock and for questionable management of his personal funds in the 1980s. April 25 - Tsutomu Hata of the Japan Renewal party elected prime minister with Socialists' help. Later that day they leave coalition in protest at what they see as efforts to marginalise them. April 28 - Hata forms Japan's first minority government since 1948. June 23 - With tacit backing of LDP and Socialists, budget is passed. LDP immediately submits no-confidence motion. June 25 - Hata announces resignation of cabinet.</p>

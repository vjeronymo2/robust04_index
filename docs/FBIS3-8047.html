			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Mlejnek: "Czech and NATO Interests"] </F>   [Text] The most recent statements by Russian officials,  whether President Yeltsin or Foreign Minister Kozyrev, have  confirmed the Russian veto on the Central Europe countries'  joining NATO and reopened the issue of Czech security. The  word "reopen" is not the correct word because the problem has  been constantly open since November 1989. Certain incorrigible  optimists, lulled by the Partnership for Peace bait, have  realized the urgency of the problem in view of these statements.  Not only they have realized it. The most recent Russian  "offensive" in the Balkans has shown to us that the Russian  position as a world power is beginning to assume a giant  dimension once again.    The countries of Central Europe are afraid, understandably,  and will probably seek a protective wing in Western  institutions. They will use the Partnership for Peace as a  shield (has anyone in Prague tried to find out why Russian  Foreign Minister Kozyrev is so happy about the project?) and  will speak about common values and sovereignty, which no one can  allegedly violate. They still see NATO as the principal  prospective defender of their security and sovereignty.  However, the situation in the Balkans has shown us NATO with  its pants down, weak, and rusty. Greece, a full NATO member,  has not used its right to veto the "warning air strikes," but it  refused to participate in any of the Alliance's actions.  Moreover, it has conducted policy that has supported Russia  rather than Brussels. We cannot have any objections--if  Greece's temporary break with NATO is worth it, Athens must have  a good reason for its behavior. (Or they may believe that they  have such a reason, with is even more important.) This reason  is national, or state interests. The same applies to Turkey,  which threatened to leave the pact if the air strikes were not  launched. What can we infer from that? The state interests of  individual countries are above the interests of the Alliance  itself. Not only in the Balkans' case. On the basis of that  example, we can surmise that other member countries could behave  in a similar way if a potential conflict applied to them as the  Balkans' conflict applies to Greece and Turkey. The old common  enemy has disappeared, and a new one is still to appear inasmuch  as the neoimperialist Russia is definitely not an enemy to the  West.    The interests of the NATO members, mainly of the United  States as NATO's main driving force, are aimed at cooperating  with Moscow. In the West, they are happy that Moscow can secure  peace and order in Uzbekistan and Tadjikistan, and that it will  stop the dangerous disintegration of the immense space of the  former Soviet Union. The state interests of the United States  itself were shifted to Southeast Asia a long time ago. Here, in  that region, Washington is very concerned about becoming a  direct ally of Moscow. It is definitely not in NATO's interest  to confront Russia, much less on behalf of Central Europe.    The Czech Republic wants to get under "NATO's protective  umbrella" as protection against the threat from the East. What  follows from that? It is a simple and, for us, an unpleasant  fact. The Czech Republic's and NATO's interests are outright  disparate. This is one additional reason why it would be naive  to think about joining NATO at this very moment. However, not  all of the Czech and Western interests are so incompatible, but  this is not enough to help us become a member in the Western  security structures. The Czech Republic has common interests  also with its neighbors and quasi-neighbors, who are more  affected by the Russian threat than Paris or Amsterdam, for  instance. We must quickly abandon our illusions, the old  cliches. We must analyze the new situation with a cool head and  respond to it appropriately. We do not have much time, but it  may not be too late, either--let us hope.</p>

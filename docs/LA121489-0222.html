			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> FUNDS ALLOCATED FOR CARE CENTER  </P> <P> The City Council, working to keep a Chapman College day-care center open, voted  to allocate $30,000 to help relocate the center to a site properly zoned for a  child-care facility.  </P> <P> School officials had planned to close the center Friday because it is in a  residential area not zoned for it. Relocation costs made it prohibitive for the  college to move the center, which can serve 30 children.  </P> <P> "With this vote and show of support from the city, I can now rescind my  decision to close the center," Chapman College President Allen E. Koenig said.  "I am most appreciative of the outpouring of support for the center by faculty,  students, neighbors and members of the Orange City Council."  </P> <P> Fred Smoller, associate professor of political science and parent of a child  served by the center, led the fight to keep the center open. After the vote he  said: "I'm happy . . . this is one of those political decisions in which  everyone is going to win. It represents a new spirit of cooperation between the  college and the surrounding community."  </P> <P> Acting as the Redevelopment Agency, the council allocated the $30,000 so that  the Child Study Center could move from its current location at 485 and 489 N.  Center St. to a new campus site at 525 N. Center.  </P> <P> In addition to the city funds, the center received $5,000 from the Orangewood  Children's Foundation and $1,000 from Chapman College Town and Gown, plus  $10,000 worth of carpet, cement, tile and other such gifts from parents and  local businesses.

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Arts: Spring Loaded - Dance Britain's independent dance scene used to be the counter-culture territory of young choreographers and performers who had little interest in finding a place in the established contemporary dance companies. During the past few years, however, this supposedly alternative scene has also become a home for restless dissidents of mainstream organisations. Jeremy James, Mark Baldwin, Gary Lambert and Ben Craft, all former members of Rambert Dance Company, now operate as independent choreographer-dancers. And all, in recent weeks, have presented evenings of their own work in the Spring Loaded season at the Place Theatre, London's busiest venue for independent dance. Ironically, it is these artists - relative newcomers to the scene - who are responsible for some of the most noteworthy and individualistic work in this year's Spring Loaded. Not everything served up by Lambert and Craft (as Small Axe), Baldwin (directing half a dozen ex-Rambert colleagues), and Jeremy James (sharing a bill with versatile freelancer Jo Chandler) could be described as heaven-sent. But the flaws and weaknesses are, to a great extent, diluted by a combination of intelligence and autonomy. Cold Ground Drifting is the latest offering from Small Axe, the ensemble set up in 1992 by Lambert and Craft as a vehicle for their joint choreographic efforts. Like last year's rambling trail From New Malden to Upminster, Cold Ground Drifting invites its audience on a journey, transporting us to various, unspecific, but mostly hostile and deprived areas of the city. It also shows Lambert and Craft beginning to achieve a more organic and potent fusion of means, the overall structure of this new work being not only more visually coherent, but able to harness the same uncertainties of improvisation which blighted the group's debut production. Michael Hulls' design - an arrangement of 20 stripped and hammered car bonnets - and lighting - shadowy and garish by turns - creates an urban scrapyard-cum-playground. The soundscore, by Craft, is one of those blurry collages of filtered everyday noise - footsteps, the sirens of police cars and fire engines, repeated fragments of conversation with street dwellers - broken by interludes for cello and trumpet. The four performers, Cathrine Price, Tristan Borrer, Lambert and Craft (all excellent), are not so much a team as a collection of individuals inhabiting the same space. But a reciprocal ebb and flow of action emerges through shared motifs: limbs swinging into right angle hinge positions, slow push-ups, coiled jumps, the momentary transition of body weight from feet to hands. Like Lambert and Craft, Jeremy James and Jo Chandler seem to be trying to forge a personalised language of dance based on an amalgam of techniques. But while Lambert and Craft have almost ceased looking like Rambert dancers who accidentally wandered into alien choreography and set about reprogramming their physicality on stage, James is still working within the parameters he knows and understands. In his own solo, Scag, he is impish, defiant, casual, but not different enough to stop you having mental flashbacks of his dancing in Rambert pieces such as Siobhan Davies' Sounding. Over the last few months, Mark Baldwin, currently choreographer in residence at Sadler's Wells, has produced two new pieces - Factual Nonsense and More Poulenc - the latter an affectionate companion piece to his Poulenc-accompanied Spirit (created last year for Rambert). Along with Island to Island, (an earlier work for Rambert), and a solo entitled Kate Lines (for Small Axe's Cathrine Price, one of Baldwin's contemporaries at Rambert during the 1980s), this pair of newly completed dances formed his programme for Spring Loaded. More Poulenc, the closing number, is the highlight of the evening. Its prankish manner, throwaway gestures and the rich invention of its choreography become visible almost as soon as the music, Poulenc's Les Soirees de Nazelles, commences. More Poulenc is organised as a series of episodic sketches revolving around the events at a house party. As More Poulenc's mismatched characters, Sarah Warsop, Sara Matthews, Lee Boggess and Baldwin give fine performances, letting the necessary air of restraint waft elegantly across their encounters before succumbing to absurdity and mischief. The sequences for Warsop, Matthews and Boggess are fast-moving studies in elegance and dexterity, threatened by instances of unpredictable behaviour: a limping Baldwin, coursing at dangerously high speed towards the demurely poised trio, pausing then slumping to the ground; Boggess, suddenly and inexplicably, bending over to let Warsop run her fingers up and down his spine; Baldwin lifting Warsop or Matthews as though he's tidying up the stage. Baldwin casts himself as the principal oddball, a role in which he manages to be both mentor and fool and in which he reveals an instinctive sense of comic timing. More Poulenc is one of the best and strangest things he has ever made.</p>

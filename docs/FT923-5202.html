			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (28): A proud name changes hands - Dutch to give up Fokker control FOKKER, the aircraft builder that has put the Netherlands on the world aerospace map, is to be transferred into German hands by the end of 1992, triggering a shakeup of Europe's regional aviation market and substantially redrawing the ownership of the Dutch aerospace industry. Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) is expected to acquire 51 per cent of the Dutch company on or around October 1. Majority control will be achieved by buying out part of the Dutch government's 32 per cent stake and subscribing to a Fl 500m issue of new Fokker shares. Final details of the detail, including the price the Dutch state will receive for its Fokker shares, are still being worked out. Dutch unions and parliament must also approve. Eventually, Dasa will sell a portion of its shares in Fokker to its 'Euroliner' consortium partners, Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy, creating a four-way tie-up in the regional segment of Europe's aerospace industry. The Fokker-Dasa transaction was given the final go-ahead by the Dutch government's decision in late July to sell part of its shareholding to Dasa this year, with the rest to follow in three years. The sale is a logical consequence of the conditions set in 1987, when the Dutch government bailed out Fokker after it ran into difficulties launching its new Fokker 50 and Fokker 100 aircraft, leaving the state with a 32 per cent shareholding in the company in the process. At the time, the government said that Fokker should seek a strong, international partner to help fund any future generations of aircraft. Fokker has now found one in Dasa, part of Germany's Daimler industry group and itself the product of a series of mergers and takeovers among Germany's aerospace companies. Nevertheless, the Dutch government initially baulked at the prospect of Dasa's takeover of Fokker, fearing that high-technology jobs and skills would eventually be transferred to Germany. In his direct negotiations with the chairmen of Fokker and Dasa, the Dutch economic affairs minister, Mr Koos Andriessen, won some guarantees on future employment and production at Fokker's plants in the Netherlands. But the Dutch government, for its part, was required to pledge to give up its remaining Fokker shares at the end of three years. With the main outlines of the Fokker takeover now agreed, the biggest remaining uncertainty is the future of the Fokker 50, the company's 50-seater turbo prop. The agreement with the Germans virtually ensures that Fokker will be able to develop its new Fokker 70, based on the existing Fokker 100. And it indicates that the Fokker aircraft will also form the nucleus of a 130-seater machine which will probably be built together with Aerospatiale and Alenia. But the agreement does not cover the Fokker 50, which has been less successful than the 100-seat Fokker 100. The future of the Fokker 50 is particularly doubtful because Aerospatiale and Alenia have a competing aircraft, the ATR-42, which has managed to crack the North American market, an region where the Dutch machine has yet to achieve a breakthrough. In the past, Fokker has complained that the Franco-Italian jet enjoyed an unfair advantage because of subsidies and grants which Aerospatiale and Alenia receive from the French and German governments. Both companies are now poised to play an influential role in Fokker's future.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE OXFORD BOOK OF BRITISH POLITICAL ANECDOTES EDITED BY  PAUL JOHNSON (OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $8.95)  </P> <P> A rich compendium of stories, bons mots, scandals, etc., from the time of  Richard III to Harold Wilson, guaranteed to delight trivia buffs. Americans  unfamiliar with the intricacies of the British party system and its politics  may miss the point of a few stories, but most of them can be enjoyed by the  general reader. Many of these anecdotes suggest that Parliamentary debates are  far more entertaining and literate than the deliberations of the U.S. Congress.  In 1581, when the House of Commons "had sat long and done in effect nothing,"  the Speaker, Mr. Popham, was asked by Queen Elizabeth I, "Now, Mr. Speaker,  what hath passed in the Lower House?" He replied, "If it pleases Your Majesty,  seven weeks."  </P></p>

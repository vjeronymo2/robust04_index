			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'THE BOSS' MEMORABILIA ON SALE  </P> <P> A closed museum boasting the world's largest collection of Bruce Springsteen  memorabilia wants to sell it intact for at least $50,000.  </P> <P> Among the items for sale: a surfboard, Springsteen's 1970 driver's license, his  draft card and a rare 1966 unreleased single by Springsteen's first band, the  Castiles.  </P> <P> The Asbury Park Rock 'n' Roll Museum shut down last year.  </P> <P> Billy Smith, a co-owner of most of the Springsteen artifacts, said he hopes a  buyer will keep them in Asbury Park, where the singer got his start.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, somebody will buy this stuff and display it," Smith said.  </P> <P> Asbury Park, a down-at-the-heels resort town, is the setting for some of  Springsteen's early songs.  </P> <P> The museum was in the Palace Amusement Arcade, where parts of Springsteen's  "Tunnel of Love" video were shot. When the arcade closed last year, so did the  museum, and its contents went into storage.  </P></p>

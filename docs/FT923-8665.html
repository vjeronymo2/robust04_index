			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Settlers and army back off from clash A CLASH yesterday between militant Jewish settlers and Israeli soldiers over construction of a house ended in a brittle compromise after the army agreed not to demolish the structure for two weeks, while a building permit is sought. It was the first serious incident involving settlers and the military since Israel's new government imposed a settlement curb last month, and came on the eve of a crucial meeting in the US between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and President George Bush. Some 200 activists had confronted soldiers seeking to stop the building of a new house in the militant settler stronghold of Kiryat Arba near the Arab West Bank town of Hebron. Mr Eliakim Haetzni, a fiercely nationalist settlers' leader and former member of parliament, said defiantly: 'We'll build in 500 sites. We are the locals here, not the Arabs. . . There aren't so many units in the army to run after all of us.' Yesterday's clash at Kiryat Arba and the move by Jewish settler activists into a number of houses in the Moslem quarter of Jeusalem's Old City underline domestic pressures on Mr Rabin in his efforts to satisfy international demands for a halt to settlements. The US has welcomed the steps taken by the new Israeli government to curb settlements in territories captured in the 1967 war. US officials had charged repeatedly that such settlements were 'an obstacle' to peace. The Kiryat Arba confrontation may mark the beginning of a right-wing backlash against efforts of the Rabin government to stop the continued spread of settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Since its heavy defeat in the June election, the Israeli right has been uncharacteristically subdued, but in the past few days it appears to have regained its voice and is clearly intent on sounding a discordant note to accompany Mr Rabin's visit to the US.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Hunger not yet sated: The rebound of UK commercial property UK commercial property has staged a remarkable recovery after the worst recession of the post-war period. Since last summer, property prices have risen by nearly a quarter. Yet it is far from being a broad-based recovery. Paradoxically, the rise in property values has occurred despite continued falls in rents. Letting boards still litter most cities, testifying to a near-record oversupply of space and weak demand from tenants. But investors are undeterred. Once institutional investors became convinced that property prices had hit bottom, they spent more than Pounds 1bn in the last three months of 1993. Their appetite for property is far from sated. The Prudential, the UK's largest life assurer, for instance, is prepared to spend Pounds 1bn on property if it can find sufficiently attractive deals. Competition from rival institutions has driven up prices. Scottish Amicable, the life company, beat the Prudential in the race to buy the Camberley shopping centre in Surrey by paying Pounds 90m, well above the Pounds 77.5m asking price. The Equitable Life Assurance company has bought a Reading office building for Pounds 60m from a subsidiary of Germany's Hypo bank, which bought it for just Pounds 45m a year earlier. Property companies, which raised some Pounds 1.5bn in new capital last year, have also been big spenders. Recently, hundreds of millions of pounds have been spent on property portfolios by companies such as Imry Holdings, Hammerson and MEPC. One of the biggest single players has been the British Land Quantum Fund, formed last summer out of collaboration between Mr George Soros, the international financier, and British Land's entrepreneurial chairman John Ritblat. The fund's latest deal - a Pounds 70.5m purchase of a large office building in London's Leadenhall Street - has brought its spending to Pounds 500m. As property prices rise, salaries in the industry are spiralling upwards. Mr Michael Slade, an ebullient 47-year-old who heads Helical Bar, the investment and development company, received a Pounds 1m bonus last year after his company increased net assets per share by 77 per cent. This trend, together with the re-emergence of some of the movers and shakers of the last property cycle, brings back memories of the boom at the end of the 1980s. But there are important differences. First, there is not yet a return to the days when almost anybody - regardless of their resources - could become a property speculator. The banks, which lost billions in the last property downturn, are cautious about making new loans. Equity is king. Second, the surge in property values over the past year was not, primarily, due to high expectations about rising rents, but to a rising bond market. So far this year the bond market has not been helpful to property prices, which last year moved up in tandem with bonds. Bond values have fallen sharply, which has blunted demand, particularly for poor-quality office buildings with little prospect of rental growth. As a result, office values edged downwards in April, according to Richard Ellis, chartered surveyors. Moreover, nervousness about future prospects has hit the share values of property companies, which fell by an average of more than 13 per cent this year. 'The market has run out of steam,' says Mr Nick Leslau of Burford, a quoted property company. 'The recovery so far has been driven entirely by a change of sentiment, which is vulnerable to shocks,' says Mr John Whalley, director of property investments at AMP Asset Management, the fund management group. 'If the long-awaited rental growth disappoints, purchases made at today's prices will look less than astute.' Investors have not seen much evidence of rising rents - which ultimately are needed to underpin rising property values. But they can draw comfort from the fact that rents appear to have stabilised, after falling by a third since their peak in August 1990. In some parts of the market, rents could rise quickly. James Capel, a City stockbroker, believes that rents in the West End of London could rise by as much as 30 per cent over the next 18 months. This is because there is a lack of suitable properties to meet tenant's demands. 'There are surprisingly few options,' says Mr Andrew Sturt, head of property at ICI, who has examined more than 100 buildings in the search for a new headquarters for the company. While it may seem odd that potential tenants have difficulty finding new premises when there are so many empty buildings in London - more than 9m sq ft in the West End alone - many empty buildings are too old and poorly designed to meet tenants' demands. The downturn in development activity since 1990 has exacerbated this problem. 'The development famine over the last few years has deprived markets of the quality and quantity of space that the business recovery will demand,' says Mr Richard Lay of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Already, developers are dusting down plans for schemes shelved at the end of the 1980s. For the most part, developers are cautious; they insist on winning a commitment from tenants before starting construction. Moreover, the banks, still licking their wounds from ill-judged lending to the property sector at the end of the 1980s, are so far unwilling to lend to developers. But gradually, speculative developers are getting back in business, having secured funds from institutions. Mr Slade of Helical Bar, which has a Pounds 100m speculative development programme, argues that the first to get back into the market will reap the rewards. 'We are going to be there with the first wave of development and then let others fight it out,' he says. Land values are starting to respond to the improved prospects for development: Argent's Birmingham site is now worth more than Pounds 26m, compared with its net cost of Pounds 1m last summer. While the return of speculative developers conjures up the spectre of late-1980s excesses, this time round, the caution of the banks is likely to restrain the scale of new building. Although the industry is inherently prone to periods of boom and bust, the signs are that this property upturn will be relatively muted.</p>

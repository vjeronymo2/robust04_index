			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: IBM aims to dominate market in workstations INTERNATIONAL Business Machines aims to become the world leader in the Dollars 9bn computer workstation market by 1994, executives of the US computer company said yesterday. They were introducing aggressively priced new workstation models, among which was a Dollars 4,000 desktop workstation priced to undercut competing colour graphics workstations from Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard. IBM also unveiled powerful parallel-processing systems that achieve supercomputer-level performance using up to 64 of the microprocessor chips used in IBM's workstations. The new products signal an effort by IBM to capitalise on reduced instruction set computing (Risc) technology, which was invented in its research laboratories but which competitors, such as Sun and Hewlett-Packard, have been quicker to exploit. 'There should be no doubt that we intend to be very competitive and very aggressive in this market,' said Mr Bill Filip, IBM vice-president and president of its Advanced Workstations and Systems business. But IBM, which first entered the market for Risc workstations three years ago, is trailing Sun, with an estimated 32 per cent of the world market, and Hewlett-Packard with 20 per cent. According to Dataquest, the US market research group, IBM was in third place in the workstation market with an 18 per cent share in 1992. Mr Filip said that IBM workstation revenues rose by between 30 and 35 per cent last year and that sales growth in the first quarter was outpacing last year's. IBM has entered a crowded field of companies sometimes using hundreds of standard microprocessors to achieve performances equivalent to mainframe and supercomputers.</p>

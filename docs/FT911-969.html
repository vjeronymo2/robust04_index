			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Trusthouse name to be shed in THF revamp - Founder's son, Rocco Forte, denies that egotism lies behind return to family name MR ROCCO Forte, chief executive of Trusthouse Forte, confirmed yesterday that the company planned to drop the Trusthouse part of its name and - once ratified by shareholders - would in future simply be known as Forte. The move is part of a Pounds 15m revamp of THF's 343-strong UK and continental Europe hotel chain aimed at creating several distinct brand identities for its hotels, most of which will carry the Forte name as part of their branding. The decision to drop the Trusthouse part of the corporate name represents a final victory for the Forte family after the acrimonious merger in June 1970 of Trust Houses, a chain of traditional inns, and the Forte hotel chain. For several years after the merger the clash of cultures between the established Trust House management - headed by Lord Crowther and Mr Michael Pickard - and the aggressive style of Lord Forte created tension between the two camps of what had initially been described as a 'friendly' merger. Eventually Lord Forte was successful, ousting both Lord Crowther and Mr Pickard and then building up Britain's biggest hotel chain over the next two decades. Lord Forte, in his autobiography, said of the boardroom battles: 'I do not want to blame any one individual for wrecking what began so promisingly: the truth is that there were deep differences of management philosophy and style, exacerbated by incompatibilities of temperament.' Yesterday Mr Rocco Forte, Lord Forte's son, insisted that the decision to drop the Trusthouse part of the name was taken after considerable research which showed that Forte had the widest marketing appeal both in the UK and overseas. He dismissed suggestions that it was egoistical of the company to carry the Forte family name on all its hotels. 'It was a decision of the board and in the company's best interests,' he maintained. 'In some ways I am sorry that we are 'losing' it as a family, because now it will be the corporate identity rather than a personal one.' Mr Forte also denied that the name change contravened the agreement made with Trust Houses at the time of the merger: this had recently been suggested by Mr Pickard. 'I don't think Mr Pickard's views are valid nearly 20 years after he left the company,' Mr Forte averred. He said that the decision to re-brand the company had been planned for the past two years. In spite of difficult trading conditions in the first few months of 1991 - THF's pre-tax profits for the 12 months to January 31 fell 27 per cent to Pounds 190m - he believed it was the right time to press ahead with the changes. The Pounds 15m cost of the revamp would be spread over two years, he added. The fee for Wolff Olins, the design company involved, was put at less than Pounds 1m of the total cost. Under the re-branding, THF's hotels would be divided into several categories. These covered: Forte Travelodges, a roadside budget chain; Forte Posthouses, bringing together three-star properties, some of which presently trade under the Post House and Crest names; Forte Crest, a four-star business hotel operation; Forte Heritage, which includes traditional country house hotels; and Forte Grand, the five-star international hotels such as the Waldorf in London. THF's luxury hotels, such as the Hyde Park Hotel in London and the Georges V in Paris, would still be known by their existing names and the Forte brand would only be discreetly mentioned. About 32 existing hotels which do not fit into these categories are to be sold. THF hopes to raise Pounds 100m. The City generally welcomed the changes yesterday and marked the shares 1p higher at 275p.</p>

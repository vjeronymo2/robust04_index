			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 1 Apr (PL) -- The National Assembly of the  People's Government [ANPP] (parliament) of Cuba will hold an  extraordinary session on 1 May, according to a summons by the  Council of State divulged today in this capital.    The newspaper GRANMA published the document on its front  page  today which notes that the objective of the meeting will be to  analyze the country's internal financial situation.    The holding of the important Cuban parliament meeting was  suggested by President Fidel Castro, on delivering the closing  speech at the plenum of the national committee of the Cuban  Workers Federation, which began early this week.    The workers plenum -- known here as the workers parliament  --  reviewed a vast analysis process in work centers on the island,  the purpose of which was to have the participants propose  possible solutions to the current primary national economic  problems.    The suggestions of over 3 million workers participating in  the meetings, as the Cuban president has said, will be  considered in the upcoming sessions of deputies, who will adopt  a series of economic measures aimed at improving the country's  internal financial situation and boosting its economic  efficiency.</p>

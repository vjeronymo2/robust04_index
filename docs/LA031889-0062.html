			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRANIAN IMMIGRANTS IN SAN DIEGO COMPLAIN OF INSENSITIVITY, BIAS  </P> <P> When radio talk show host Stacy Taylor suggested to listeners here that they  attach bumper stickers to their cars saying, "Islam Is Lame," it was just  another instance of what many Iranians living in the area say is gross  insensitivity and prejudice toward them.  </P> <P> Taylor, who works for station KSDO, said in an interview that he has no  apologies for broadcasting the remark recently, saying he felt "some smart  entrepreneur" could make a million dollars on the idea.  </P> <P> But Reza Ahmadi, a civil engineer who immigrated from Iran 10 years ago,  complained bitterly that nothing would happen to vehicles carrying such bumper  stickers, while an automobile carrying a bumper sticker extolling the virtues  of Islam would soon be vandalized.  </P> <P> "How come a Mexican-American can have a bumper sticker saying something nice  about his people or his religion, but an Iranian they will vandalize?" Ahmadi  asked.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Celebrate New Year  </P> <P> The engineer was interviewed as hundreds of Iranian immigrants gathered on the  beach at La Jolla one evening this week to celebrate the forthcoming Iranian  New Year with a fire-jumping ceremony that goes back 2,500 years to  pre-Islamic, Zoroastrian times.  </P> <P> This year, there was a somber aspect to the festivities. It is not an easy time  to be an Iranian in the United States, some in the crowd said, and, they added,  with tensions between the United States and Iran threatening to escalate, it  may grow worse.  </P> <P> "We're trying to earn a living, but we don't know what we will be doing  tomorrow," said Mehdi Moen, a teacher's aide in a local school. "I'm not  politically active and I don't intend to be, but I can't ignore the feelings  against us."  </P> <P> Moen said he feels that the Iranian community in San Diego is "lacking strong  leadership, some speaker for our society."  </P> <P> "But I don't know if he would be listened to," he said. "I see lots of  prejudice. Still, we ought to say we're strongly against these radical  movements, and the proof is that we're here because we wanted a free life, and  we're against any fanaticism."  </P> <P> Mohammed Khavarinejad chimed in: "It is bad, at least as far as living here  now. One fact they (Americans) have to realize is that this group is opposed to  (the Ayatollah Ruholla) Khomeini."  </P> <P> The next night, in another part of San Diego, an Iranian businessman, who asked  that his name not be used, said: "The biggest problem we have in America is  that there is always a general conclusion from a simple observation. They're  saying now that Iranians are bad.  </P> <P> "I'm not a nationalist, but I can say we're one of the most peaceful and  educated communities to ever come to America," the businessman said. "Those  general conclusions make me sick."  </P> <P> He said he understands why the American news media would give a great deal of  attention to incidents such as occurred last week when a van belonging to the  wife of the captain of the missile cruiser Vincennes was bombed, possibly by  terrorists.  </P> <P> "But as an Iranian what I cannot understand is that it pays so little attention  to the 12,000 executions that have taken place in Iran since last summer," he  said. "They included three of my cousins."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Perceived Unfairness  </P> <P> Often, the perceived unfairness transcends current developments and is much  more general.  </P> <P> "Islam has 1 billion followers," said Reza Rezai of the Iranian Educational,  Cultural and Social Center here. "Hollywood has portrayed Moses and Jesus  repeatedly, but no one has had the information or the courage to make a movie  about the Prophet (Mohammed)."  </P> <P> Sometimes, it seemed from interviews here this week, ordinary difficulties  facing many Americans can be misinterpreted by Iranians as instances of  prejudice directed at them. One person complained that, simply because he was  seen as Iranian, he had been unable to establish a satisfactory relationship of  confidence with an automobile dealer, or get a special, religious meal on an  airliner.  </P> <P> There was an undercurrent among many of the Iranians interviewed, however, of  real fear that prejudice could turn to violence against them in the future,  although some acknowledged that anti-Iranian feeling had been worse a decade  ago, during the first days of the American hostage crisis of 1979-80.  </P> <P> One member of a small faction of pro-Khomeini Iranians interviewed separately  said, "I see a trend. Something is going to happen. Today, there is no other  religious minority you can so freely savage and brutalize as you can the  Muslims." He asked that his name not be used.  </P> <P> Said Ahmadi, the engineer: "When Iran or Khomeini are by any means related to  any violent events, it immediately gets tremendous (news) coverage, I would say  basically creating negative publicity for Iranians. I wish we could get these  issues looked at individually, and not have everything attributed to all of  us."  </P></p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Three deny insider deal on USM A FORMER stockbroking account manager with the London operation of Svenska, the Swedish-based bank, passed on unpublished price-sensitive information about a public company to clients to enable them to deal in its shares, it was alleged at the Old Bailey yesterday. Mr Alton Byrd, who is also a British international basketball player, breached the insider dealing laws by passing on information about International Media Communications, a video and entertainment company registered on the Unlisted Securities Market, the court heard. Mr Edmund Lawson QC, for the Department of Trade and Industry which is bringing the prosecution, said that by the end of 1989 the company was in serious financial trouble. Under-capitalised and trading at a loss, its share price had fallen to about 5p. In January 1990 Mr Byrd acquired and passed on information that outside buyers were interested in buying the company and bringing in fresh investment. This was information that, if publicly known, would have caused the share price to rise, Mr Lawson said. Mr Byrd passed the information to a number of clients including Mr Roger Wilcocke, the director of a shop-fitting company, and Mr Graham Shear, a London solicitor. Mr Lawson said Mr Wilcocke and Mr Shear then bought 100,000 shares at 5p each and sold when the price rose. Mr Byrd faces four charges of communicating unpublished price sensitive information while being a prohibited person and one charge of procuring another person to deal in shares, all contrary to the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985. Mr Wilcocke and Mr Shear face single charges of insider dealing. All three deny the charges. The trial continues today.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Ukraine in treaty pledge to US THE Ukrainian president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, yesterday assured Mr Les Aspin, the US defence secretary, that the Ukrainian parliament would approve two critical arms treaties by the end of the month, despite opposition from MPs. It will, however, be the parliamentarians and not the president who will determine the fate of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which covers 130 of the 146 inter-continental ballistic missiles on Ukrainian territory, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would entrench Ukraine's status as a non-nuclear nation. Since January, when the US administration began to intensify the pressure on Ukraine to fulfil its non-nuclear pledges, Mr Kravchuk has offered Washington repeated assurances that parliamentary ratification of the two key arms pacts is imminent. However, as Mr Kravchuk's self-appointed deadlines have expired one after the other without any action from the legislature, the gap between the mood of parliament and the official government line has become increasingly apparent. Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, the influential chairman of the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs, told Mr Aspin that the Ukrainian parliament was leaning toward ratification of Start 1 but a postponement of accession to the NPT ' thus leaving Ukraine with 46 ICBMs and a number of nuclear missiles associated with its strategic bombers. 'They (the US group) asked me when Ukraine would be ready to accede,' Mr Pavlychko said. 'I told them we could give up our last nuclear missile when Ukraine's security was no longer in jeopardy,' he added.</p>

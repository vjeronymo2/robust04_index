			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Poland revises its sell-off plans THE Polish government has proposed changes to Poland's mass privatisation plan in an attempt to gain parliamentary support for the long-delayed project defeated in parliament last week. Mr Janusz Lewandowski, privatisation minister, plans to re-submit a revised two-track system which benefits pensioners and civil servants. In the first track are 200 enterprises which will be handed over to funds whose shares would be distributed solely to those entitled to compensation for pension and wage cuts worth 24,000bn zloty made in 1991. These cuts were later declared illegal, and incomes forgone then still have to be repaid by the government. Another 400 enterprises would be placed on the second track and given to other funds. Their shares would be distributed to the population as originally planned. The government has refused to bow to right-wing nationalist pressure over foreign managers, who will retain an important role in the new scheme. In particular the government has made no gesture to win back rebels from the Christian National (ZChN) party who voted against the original proposals. Doubts remain however over the power of the limited concessions to ensure support from the 58 former communist SLD deputies who could ensure the passage of the plan simply by abstaining. The government is conducting private talks to seek their tacit support. In its new proposals however the government has refused to concede the SLD's demand for a delay in the distribution of shares until the operation of the first funds can be tested. Nor will it agree to give companies deemed suitable for the scheme the right to opt out, another SLD demand. 'They (the SLD) think the mass privatisation scheme is a risky experiment, while we think it's safe to go ahead as fast as possible,' a senior Privatisation Ministry official explained yesterday.</p>

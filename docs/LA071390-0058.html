			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICE-A-RONI'S CLASSIC JINGLE WILL RETURN  </P> <P> Rice-A-Roni is bringing back the jingle that was once its meat and potatoes.  </P> <P> Beginning Monday, "Rice-A-Roni, the San Francisco treat," will be sung on a TV  commercial near you.  </P> <P> If you sense it hasn't been long since you last heard it, you're right. It was  only three years ago when Golden Grain Macaroni dumped the 30-year-old jingle  for the side dish that was once promoted as a potato substitute. At the time  the jingle was killed, a company executive said the ad had become so familiar  that "people stopped listening to it."  </P> <P> Well, Golden Grain has changed its tune. Actually, the tune is about the same  -- just a bit more contemporary. And the baby boomers who eat Rice-A-Roni in  the new spot wear things such as suspenders and designer eye glasses.  </P> <P> "We gave it a couple of years' rest," said Steve Odland, director of marketing  at Oakland-based Golden Grain, which is owned by Quaker Oats. "Now, we think  we've given it enough of a hiatus to have it break through again."  </P> <P> Certainly, Rice-A-Roni is not the first to bring back an old theme. Campbell's  Soup recently brought back "Mmm, mmm good." Nestea has revived its "Nestea  Plunge." And while trying to recover from some recent bad publicity, Perrier  returned to its familiar "Earth's first soft drink."  </P> <P> Officials insist Rice-A-Roni sales are up -- not down. An executive at the  agency that revived the new campaign said the timing is right. "There's a lot  more return to the family these days," said Mike Moser, co-creative director at  the San Francisco agency Goldberg Moser O'Neill. "Today, you can turn on  Nickelodeon and watch 'Dobie Gillis' and 'Donna Reed' while eating  Rice-A-Roni."  </P></p>

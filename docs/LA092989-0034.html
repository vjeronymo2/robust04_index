			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> The redoubtably named Luhring Augustine Hetzler gallery -- a partnership of New  York-based Luhring Augustine and Cologne-based Max Hetzler -- has opened in  Santa Monica with recent work by Los Angeles artist Stephen Prina. Suitably  enough, one of his pieces is "Inaugural Mailing List," a boxed set of  invitations to the show stuffed in postmarked envelopes and addressed from  merged mailing lists. The notion of treating a basic component of art gallery  business as a study in ordering and classification is particularly Prina-esque.  </P> <P> A series of 24 identically-sized, computer-created prints gradually spell out a  slogan reeking of corporate paternalism: "It's in your own best interests."  Each piece, made of closely aligned horizontal strokes of blue or black graphic  marker dye, contains either a graphic design (portions of the letters in the  message) or a "blank" field of dye. The diskette that gave birth to the series  is on view too, a mute, inanimate Maker in its own plexiglass display case.  </P> <P> The show also contains seven works from Prina's "Exquisite Corpse: The Complete  Paintings of Manet." Each framed piece of paper swizzled with ink wash is the  same size as a particular Manet. The viewer's devilishly taxing project is to  re-imagine these paintings in their museum setting. (Luhring Augustine Hetzler,  1330 4th St., to Oct. 25.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

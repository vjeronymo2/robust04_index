			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "MP's and Marijuana"] </F>   [Text] No one should wonder about the spreading of the  rumor on the confiscation of property in the United States of  the MP who has been accused of exporting marijuana to that  country. Neither is it correct to think that the whole issue is  a scheme to discredit any political party. The very question  that we should raise now is why the story have been kept under  wraps for at least a year. The U.S. had attempted to get in  touch with the accused MP through the Thai Government since  January last year. Nothing was leaked to the general public.    In practice, the Thai Government, especially the agencies  and  ministers concerned, should expeditiously reciprocate the  request for cooperation in the suppression of narcotics  trafficking from any foreign government. However, this case had  been covered up for sometime probably because it involved  politicians and influential connections.    Official confirmation from the U.S. embassy about the  seizure  of the MP's property in the U.S. has led many to believe that  there could be many Thai MP's engaging in the illicit business.  A research conducted six to seven years ago also revealed that  as many as eight MP's were involved in the marijuana trade. Up  to this point, one will find it rather difficult to turn a blind  eye to the drug scandal.    Moreover, several reports following the outbreak of the  scandal on international drug trafficking connnections reveal  that government officials, politicians, and local businessmen  have been involved in exporting marijuana to the U.S. The  government's suppression operations have so far been aimed only  at small planters and traffickers, while the real chieftains of  the criminal syndicates are left undisturbed to continue with  their lucrative trade until the shameful fact is exposed by a  foreign country.    Therefore, it is imperative to call on the House of  Representatives to make serious endeavors to quickly finalize  the investigations into the marijuana trafficking charge against  the MP. The House of Representatives must defend its reputation.  This is not the personal affair of the accused MP because it  can also have negative effects on the entire legislative  institution. Not only the House of Representatives, the Senate  should also try to do something as a contribution and by so  doing, more people will come to realize its significance.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Arts: Brecht crossed with party-line China - Cinema THE STORY OF QIU JU (12) Zhang Yimou GROUNDHOG DAY (PG) Harold Ramis TRESPASS (18) Walter Hill AN ACTOR'S REVENGE (PG) Kon Ichikawa The shadow of Tiananmen Square spreads across the remote village in Zhang Yimou's The Story Of Qiu Ju. A year or more ago China's greatest film-maker, having won friends abroad and foes at home with his no-mercy masterpieces Red Sorghum and Raise The Red Lantern (both banned in China), found himself backed into a political cul-de-sac. In the wake of the Beijing massacre and the country's return to hard-line Maoism he was given, effectively, a simple choice. Either make a film the authorities like or . . . 'Or' in China can mean many things: 'Goodbye, movie career,' 'Here is your ticket to another canton', 'Please fall under this tank.' So Zhang Yimou made a film that obeyed the rules. Qiu Ju unfolds at times like a Brecht morality drama crossed with a party-line Chinese film from the bad old days: the kind that waved titles like 'Suki Loo Beats the Black Marketeers' or 'Red Women Raise The Flag Over The New Sewage System'. But a great film-maker is incapable of turning out a worthless movie. The Story Of Qiu Ju has a vigour and crackpot humanity even amid its prescriptive Peking populism. The heroine is a pregnant peasant woman (Gong Li) whose husband has been kicked where it hurts during a row with the village headman. She must - she will - have justice. So off she troops to the local policeman, then to the local town, then to the local capital . . . Not for this chilli-growing Mother Courage the partial victory of a pay-off to her spouse or reprimand to the headman. She wants justice plus an apology. Each time that justice falls short, she throws her well-earned money from the pepper market at the next legal mountain to be climbed. When she reaches the provincial capital she is as bruised and dazed by her own fortitude as by the unfamiliar city life around them. Zhang Yimou's hidden camera captures the alien madness. Bicycle-taxis clattering; sea of voices nattering; cartfuls of furniture going surreally by (note the woman sitting on a sofa astride a rickshaw) as if Chinese life en masse were rebelling against its political embalment with a daft, fervent parody of the nomadic. Directed by anyone else, this fable of uplift and upward legal mobility might have been unbearable. Some details, like the heroine's pregnancy, are unbearable. In addition to her other symbolic burdens Qiu Ju must waddle across China carrying the country's future inside her? And the baby's birth sets off the final series of resistible plot detonations: cross-country dash to hospital, husband's crisis of marital faith, the swing into a smiling coda with the headman forgiven, albeit too late for the snapping of justice's Damoclean sword. But before this Zhang Yimou salvages what he can - and it is more than enough - by the simple device of changing his style. No soaring Jacobean grandeur here, no savage poetry of colour and camerawork. Instead Qiu Ju bundles as many faces as it can into the frame - using depth as in a 3D movie - and deploys its multiplicity of human detail like chaff to baffle an Exocet. The deadly Maoist Messages keep swerving off course, confused by the sparkling flakes of comedy, character detail and wittily, winningly observed social flux. Bills sent to the wrong address are the subject of the week's two Hollywood films. The first Bill (funnyman Murray) is a Philadelphia TV weatherman posted to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. For the citified cynic-hero of Groundhog Day the supposed one-day outside-broadcast mission becomes, literally, a small eternity. The second Bill (Paxton in the thriller Trespass) does the town mouse/country mouse routine in reverse. An Arkansas fireman, he is lured to St Louis by one of the few things that could lure anyone to St Louis: a priceless trove of gold. It is stashed, he and flame-fighting friend William Sadler learn from an improbably obtained treasure-map, in a derelict factory. Now: think hard for a moment. What always happens when bills go astray? Exactly. Someone else pays for your mistakes or you for theirs; or else justice is done after long litigation. Groundhog Day is a mixture, but a delicious one, of all three. In this bubbling comedy co-written and directed by Harold Ramis (Ghostbusters, Caddyshack), Bill Murray wakes up on a dozen identical mornings in a town he has only checked into for one night - his italics - to report on the annual ceremony of the groundhog. (Toothy creature emerges from hibernation; sights shadow; heralds spring.) Each dawn the same radio-alarm assaults his ears with country music. The same boarding-house lady supervises breakfast. (Murray: 'Do you have deja vu?' She: 'I'll check with the kitchen'). And the same pretty TV producer Andie McDowell tells him he is late after he has sloshed through melted snow and has almost sloshed, en route, the town's overfriendly insurance salesman. But days in a bucolic time-warp have an advantage. Like reincarnation, they allow a Buddhist self-perfecting process. First our hero becomes nasty: note the crumpled-sheets face, frazzled eyes and cracked-voice wisecracks. (Murray on this form is the most voluptuous misanthropist since WC Fields.) Then he becomes crafty, using each new day as homework for the next. The fancied McDowell once studied 19th century French poetry? 'What a waste of time' croaks Murray on day one; next day he comes in right on cue with complete stanzas of Baudelaire. He can also, of course, survive death, injury and overeating. Finally, though - enter the ghost of Frank Capra - our hero becomes plain nice. In last reel the movie spirals up into an implausible, inevitable Hollywood ether of true love, rescued groundhogs, uplifted townspeople, spring weather. But even here happiness comes too late to spoil the fun. The bills have all been paid or reclaimed: Murray's to society, misanthropy's from its proper targets (insurance-men, C-and-W music), the Hollywood humour department to us the paying customer. And we feel we have earned the right to keep chuckling through the sanctimonious finale. City people being thrown into the sticks, where they learn a homely humanity, is a well-established movie trope. (See a dozen recent movies from Witness to Doc Hollywood.) In Trespass the trope is mirror-written. Two gold-seeking rural firemen are thrown from Nowhere, Arkansas, into a designer urban slumland. Art director Jon Hutman makes the broken-down St Louis factory a merry hell of rusting girders, dangling cables, splintered windows. Ridley Scott's Blade Runner meets Walter Hill's Streets Of Fire; and since Mr Hill is the director of Trespass we are soon into one of those apocalyptic closed-space guerrilla wars he makes his own. The two white heroes, panning for the Greek art treasures rumouredly hidden under a floorboard after a theft 15 years before, are cornered by a band of black thugs led by dandyish Ice T. Since Ice T is conducting his own civil war with would-be leader Ice Cube - put an ice-pack to your brain and bear with the mantric cast list - guns and knives and screams and torchings are soon the order of the day. Or the week, or the year: depending on how long the 100-minute running time seems to you. To me it seemed as long as Bill Murray's awayday in Punxsutawney seemed to him. The far-fetched buried treasure plot - original script by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale of Back To The Future - is a made-in-hell match with Walter Hill's reductive stichomythia of gunfire, explosions, F-words and drug-culture melodrama. (When in doubt, stab someone with a hypodermic or crucify a gibbering heroin victim against a door). And the more artful the images become in this Sensationalist's Guide to America after the LA riots - its original US title was Looters - the more ridiculous seems their harnessing to a plot that would have earned C minus in a beginners' screenwriting class. Make up for time wasted in St Louis by two hours in another, better inferno. Kon Ichikawa's An Actor's Revenge, revived at the ICA, has all Hill's blaze of imagery but a blazingly believable plot - revenge and murder among Kabuki theatre people - to go with it.</p>

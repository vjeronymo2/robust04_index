			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This morning Mircea Rucareanu, our reporter  accredited at Victoria palace [government headquarters],  addressed a number of general interest questions, now, at the  beginning of the year, to Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu.  Among other things, Vacaroiu assessed that over the first half  of the year inflation will grow slightly, by 7 to 9 percent, but  as a result of the package of measures intended to regain the  balance of the macroeconomic structure of the country, during  the second half of the year inflation will decrease to 3 to 5  percent. The average rate of inflation over 1994 will thus  reach 75 to 90, perhaps 100 percent.    The executive has prepared a number of draft bills that  should be debated by parliament, from among which Vacaroiu  mentioned the draft bills on the setting up of a stock exchange  market, the draft bill on public finance, and the draft bill on  the introduction of local taxes.    Asked about a possible government reshuffle, the prime  minister answered that the executive is always considering  reshuffles, depending on the results of the work accomplished by  ministers and state secretaries. Vacaroiu stressed that in the  current transition the government needs the best minds, with  good organizational skills, who could provide a new impetus to  the reform process.</p>

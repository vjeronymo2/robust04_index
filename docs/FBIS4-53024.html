			<p>BFN     [Text] Upholding the party's agriculture-first policy,  soldiers who completed service from the Korea People's Army unit  to which Comrade Kim Chong-yol belongs volunteered to advance to  Pongnae Cooperative Farm in Pyonggang County with a resolve to  uphold our party by increasing the grain production.    The farmers enthusiastically welcomed them upon their  arrival  in the farm.    [Officer Hwang Myong-chin, identified by caption] The 10  comrade party members, who completed service at our unit, have  advanced in a group to Pongnae Cooperative Farm, Pyonggang  County located along the demarcation line bearing the deep trust  and love of the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander  General Kim Chong-il. During their entire military service, the  officers showed examples in carrying out revolutionary duties  better than any others.    After the service, these comrades could have entered  colleges, returned to their beloved hometowns, or deployed to  important revolutionary outposts where they could display feats.  But they ran to the fields of the cooperative farm with the  single will of displaying feats of youth in the construction of  socialist cultural farms, which is our party's first wish at  present.    [Discharged soldier Hwang Won-kun] Blessed by tens of  thousands of people, the hearts of every one of us who ran to  Pongnae Cooperative Farm located along the demarcation line, are  burning with new hope. Fields of socialist cooperative farms.  What a rewarding work site!    [Discharged soldier Hyon Myong-kwan] That's right. From  today, we the 10 discharged soldier-party members will settle  down in this cooperative field forever and unsparingly dedicate  our sweats of loyalty. We are not simply discharged soldiers.  Upholding the far-seeing plan of the respected and beloved  comrade supreme commander, we are the brilliant soldiers of the  entire country, who are running to new front lines and new  outposts .    Therefore, every one of us will become a cell party member  here at a unit of Pongnae Cooperative Farm. As did the  revolutionary party members of Nagwon in the past days of the  fatherland liberation war, we will become 10 party members of  socialist farms, and add luster to our lives as reliable masters  and persons truly in charge of the construction of socialist  cultural farms, which are better places to live in.    [Village party secretary Kim Ho-kyu] How reliable and  presentable are they? We thank the respected and beloved  comrade supreme commander and the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il, who fostered the excellent discharged soldier-party  members. We will help the 10 valuable discharged soldier-party  members so that they become true heroes and reliable persons in  charge of the construction of socialist cultural farms.</p>

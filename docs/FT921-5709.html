			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Fairy godmother for Cinderella projects UK medical research looks set to be the chief beneficiary of yesterday's announcement by the Wellcome Trust that it is to reduce its holding of Wellcome shares and invest in a higher-yielding portfolio. The Wellcome Trust will this year disburse more than Pounds 100m in grants to other bodies for biomedical research. By selling a further tranche of shares in Wellcome, the Trust should be able to double this amount. In the UK, its support for researchers is almost half the level provided by the government-funded Medical Research Council (MRC). Created under the will of Sir Henry Wellcome (1853-1936), the Trust's aim is to advance knowledge in the biomedical sciences and the history of medicine 'which may conduce to the improvement of the physical conditions of mankind'. The Wellcome Trust has had its share of success in headline-catching scientific projects: the first study in the UK into what turned out to be Aids. More recently, Wellcome Trust-funded researchers have been at the forefront of analysing how Aids avoids destruction by the body's immune system. new information on the causes of spongiform encephalopathy ('mad cow disease'). results which explain how genetic make-up leads to asthma and related conditions running in families. techniques to assist the survival of premature babies. The Trust has prided itself on funding 'Cinderella' areas of research which find it hard to attract support from other sources. These have included mental health, skin disease, vision and tropical medicine. Research on treatment for malaria is one example of the latter. As a disease which affects people in poorer countries, such research is often not a commercial proposition for the pharmaceuticals companies. The Trust has also supported epidemiology - the study of the causes and distribution of diseases - normally a sideline for public health workers or hospital clinicians. 'By providing an opportunity to concentrate on epidemiology, the Wellcome Trust has changed the field,' says Professor Michael Marmot of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Health. 'It filled a gap no one else was prepared to fill.' With a squeeze on government funds available through the MRC, charities like the Wellcome Trust, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) and the Cancer Research Campaign have come to play an increasingly important role in biomedical research in the UK. Sir Walter Bodmer, director of the ICRF, says 'the Trust has become a major force and the additional income will provide a tremendous boost to British research'. Some of the new income will be put into developing centres of excellence which can keep top researchers in the UK and attract back those who have gone abroad in search of better-funded facilities. Three are already in place in Glasgow, Cambridge and Imperial College, London. Ms Bridget Ogilvie, the Trust's forthright Australian-born director, is also keen to offer a better career structure to good researchers, to provide a stable environment within which they can pursue creative research. 'We need full-time, or almost full-time, posts if we are to keep able people in UK scientific research.' Above all, increasing funds are needed to keep up with the rising cost of medical research. With new techniques revolutionising medical research and practice, there is plenty for the Trust to spend the extra income on.</p>

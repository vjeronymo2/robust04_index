			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICS OF ABORTION  </P> <P> Recently there has been a rash of abandoned babies in the Southland, who have  been left in trash bins or on doorsteps. Instead of being chastised, women who  do this should be treated with empathy and compassion, as they are often young  girls who are scared, desperate and without any family support. How can we  bring hundreds of thousands of additional children into the world, which is  what anti-abortionists advocate, when we can't even properly care for those we  already have?  </P> <P> KENNETH L.

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Japanese vehicle sales fall 3.3% Japanese vehicle sales, excluding mini vehicles, were estimated at 458,618 in February, down 3.3 per cent from a year earlier, an official for the Japan Automobile Dealers Association (Jada) said, Reuter reports from Tokyo. February marked the 10th straight month of year-on-year declines in domestic vehicle sales. But sales were up 44.8 per cent from 316,775 in January when they fell 0.9 per cent from a year earlier. Vehicle sales in January are usually lower than in other months because there are fewer business days. Sales of imported vehicles in Japan fell 14.6 per cent from a year earlier to 12,720 units in February.</p>

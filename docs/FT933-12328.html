			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Fresh challenge to Yeltsin as ally faces corruption inquiry THE RUSSIAN parliament stepped up its challenge to President Boris Yeltsin yesterday by voting to investigate one of his closest allies for alleged corruption amid charges and countercharges of an impending putsch by supporters of both sides. The parliament voted to permit the procurator general to investigate Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister and Mr Yeltsin's most senior cabinet supporter, on charges that he misappropriated Dollars 14.5m (Pounds 9.6m) of hard currency meant to buy baby food from a Swiss company. Mr Shumeiko, in a television interview, dismissed the charges, saying they were a purely 'political game'. His press secretary likened the move to Stalin's liquidation of his opponents in the late 1930s. The investigation follows another corruption probe into the affairs of Mr Mikhail Poltaranin, a close aide to Mr Yeltsin and a man whose abrasive insults to deputies made him unpopular. During yesterday's session, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, also produced one of his most vitriolic speeches against the presidency. At a press conference later, Mr Lev Ponomareyev, a leader of the Democratic Russia group, urged Mr Yeltsin to cut short his two-week holiday because of the 'pre-putsch situation' in the capital. The fragile recovery in the Russian economy was also in jeopardy after parliament passed a budget on Thursday night with a deficit of some Rbs22,000bn (Pounds 14.6bn) or 25 per cent of gross national product, compared with a government draft budget with a deficit of Rbs12,000bn. Approval of the budget triggered a struggle that could threaten the delivery of western financial assistance for further reforms. Mr Khasbulatov said Russia was on the verge of economic collapse. He commanded the parliament's presidium to remain in permanent session to be ready for a 'sudden turnabout in the development of the political situation'.</p>

However, his movement "is prepared to examine  the possibility of forming a national union government with  members selected on a regional basis," Mr. Moukoueke told AFP,  stressing that this should be "done strictly in accordance with  the Constitution." "If it is established that the formation of a  national union government is the only solution to the current  crisis and that Congolese killed each other in their search for  this government simply because everyone would like to have a  share of the cake, then we accept to examine the issue," he  added.    On the other hand, Mr. Moukoueke said he "is totally opposed  to a government consisting of political parties because people  would seek to defend their party views." Prior to the eventual  establishment of a national union government on a regional basis  "a working document and a consensus program must first be  devised," Mr. Moukoueke stated adding "I wonder why there is so  much talk about this union government; it may not necessarily  bring an end to the crisis."    President Lissouba had announced on 31 December 1993 that he  was prepared to set up a national union government. The  opposition had expressed support for the formation of this  government, provided it was formed after the final verdict of  the arbitration college, which is expected to rule before 5  February on the 58 petitions for the annulment of the 1993 early  legislative elections. The legislative elections constitute one  of the factors leading to the bloody political clashes that have  ravaged the southern districts of Brazzaville for several months  now.</p>

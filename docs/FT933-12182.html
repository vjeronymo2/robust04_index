			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Management: What type of boss are you? Hay uses its own management style definitions - variations are used by other researchers. The styles are characterised as: Coercive: do it the way I tell you. Provides clear direction; does not listen; expects immediate compliance; controls tightly, requiring many detailed reports; gives negative feedback; motivates by threats of discipline or punishment. Effective in a crisis but ineffective over the long term because subordinates are not developed. Ineffective with higher-level technical and professional staff. Authoritative: firm but fair. Gives clear directions tactfully; listens to others' ideas; explains directions and decisions in terms of subordinates' or the organisation's interests; monitors performance; gives positive and negative feedback. Effective in large, complex organisations; when clear directions and standards are needed and when the manager is seen as an expert. Does not work when manager does not develop subordinates. Affiliative: people first, tasks second. Has no clear goals or standards; most concerned with personal popularity; wants to keep people happy; rewards for personal characteristics, rather than job performance. Style works when work is routine and subordinates perform adequately, or when conflicting groups or individuals need to be brought together. Ineffective when people not performing well, or clear direction needed. Democratic: participative. Trusts subordinates, rather than supervising closely; makes decisions by consensus, holding many meetings and listening; rewards adequate performance but rarely punishes. Effective way of managing when subordinates are competent, well-informed, need co-ordinating. Can have drawbacks in a crisis or when subordinates not competent. Pace-setting: 'do it myself'. Leads by example, has high standards but trouble delegating. Coercive when performance is poor and does not develop others. Lone wolves, provide little co-ordination or social support. Style works when subordinates highly motivated and competent. Not as effective when delegation needed, or when subordinates need development and co-ordination. Coaching: developmental. Managers see job as showing subordinates how to improve. Get them to set their own goals and identify solutions to problems. Style is effective when subordinates want to develop. Does not work as well when manager lacks expertise or when subordinates need direction, or in a crisis.</p>

The two governments entered into an agreement on November 6,  1993, to produce three prototypes of the aircraft named  "Saras-duet", by 1996 before taking up serious production in  both the countries. Government of India has sanctioned Rs.  [rupees] 20 crore for the Rs. 95 crore project.    Rs. 25 crore will be pumped in by a Delhi based exporter who  has agreed to take up the production after getting certification  from the DGCA [Director General of Civil Aviation]. However, no  formal agreement has been signed with the private company.    NAL's civil aviation unit head Shivakumar Swamy told INDIAN  EXPRESS at the Avia India '93 where the Saras-duet mock-model  became the star attraction, that the concept to develop a light  transport aircraft was conceived three years ago.    While the NAL was working on a design to produce a 14-seater  aircraft, the Russians too were working on a somewhat similar  class of aircraft. The two teams got together and worked on a  common model based on the two designs. Since then the scientists  of the two countries have been visiting each other at their own  expense to develop the design of the aircraft.    The design configuration has been frozen and NAL and MBD are  now working on the development of the prototype.    Swamy said that the cost would be split between the two  countries to avoid any transfer of funds. While NAL would  produce some parts, the MDB would assemble the first prototype  in Russia by November 1995. Meanwhile, NAL would help the  Delhi-based private company to set up a plant at Mahr (near  Bangalore) on a 200 acre plot of land.</p>

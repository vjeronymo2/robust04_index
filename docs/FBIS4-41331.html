This was stated today at a  briefing by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Department of  Information and Press of the Russian Federation Ministry of  Foreign Affairs.    "The measures envisaged in this edict," he noted, "meet the  objective demands of an extensive part of the population of  Kyrgyzstan half way, are a step in the development of democracy,  boosting the main rights and freedoms of the country's citizens,  they take into account the wishes expressed by the Russian side  with regard to this issue, including on a summit level."    The representative of Russia's foreign policy department has  also expressed the hope that the drafts for the relevant laws  that have been submitted to the Kyrgyz Supreme Council will be  approved and the government will take effective practical  measures to enforce out the president's edict.</p>

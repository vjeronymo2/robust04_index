			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, April 11. RIA - Leader of the People's Rukh of  Ukraine Vyacheslav Chornovil holds the view that the  national-democratic forces have suffered a defeat at the  elections to the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine. In an interview  with RIA he said that by the middle of April 10 it became clear  that the frankly pro-communist forces will have at the minimum  one-third of the seats in the new parliament of Ukraine.    However, it is too early for the communists to celebrate a  full victory, he went on to say. In his opinion, they will not  have one half of the seats in the parliament, and the question  what political force will dominate in the Supreme Soviet will be  resolved somewhat later, when it becomes clear whom the numerous  independent deputies and centrists will side with.    In Chornovil's view, the RUKH movement will be able to form  parliamentary group, but the national-democratic forces will  hardly win more than one third of the seats. The RUKH leader  has stated that he has documents proving the numerous violations  of the electoral legislation. The respective documents will be  turned over to the Supreme Court of the republic.</p>

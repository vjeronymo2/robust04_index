			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cadbury Schweppes' South African arm advances CADBURY SCHWEPPES, the South African subsidiary of the UK confectionery, food and soft drinks group, overcame difficult trading conditions to achieve a 29 per cent increase in profits in the 24 weeks to mid-June. Management warned, however, that trading conditions had deteriorated recently and growth for the full year was unlikely to match that of the first half. Strong sales volume growth in the soft drinks sector helped lift turnover which rose by 24 per cent to R296.5m (Pounds 60m) compared with R239.9m. Apart from growth in drink sales, consumer demand was generally weak, reflected in slightly lower margins. Although selling prices were held below inflation, they were partially offset by improved sales volumes and cost controls. Operating profit was 21 per cent higher at R26.2m (R21.6m). Associated companies performed strongly, with profits rising by 48 per cent from R4.9m to R7.3m. The dividend is lifted to 15 cents per share (12 cents). Earnings per share were 61.2 cents (47.8 cents).</p>

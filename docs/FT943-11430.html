			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Eurotunnel set for passenger licence The go-ahead for passenger train services to run through the Channel tunnel is expected very shortly, Eurotunnel said yesterday. It understood that the Anglo-French Intergovernmental Commission, which must approve passenger services, met on Thursday to make its decision. Eurotunnel said it had completed its presentations earlier this week to the commission's safety authority, which must satisfy itself on the safety aspects of train operations in the tunnel. Letters setting out the commission's decision were expected very shortly. The company, which already runs freight services, wants to operate passenger services between London, Paris and Brussels and a tunnel shuttle service.</p>

Wu Jianmin, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said this at  a routine news conference here this afternoon when asked to  comment on the Sino-French joint communique issued yesterday.    He said that the Chinese Government has always attached  importance to the preservation and development of its relations  with France.    In the past 30 years since the establishment of Sino-French  diplomatic relations, the spokesman said, fruitful cooperation  has been conducted in the political, economic and other fields.    However, Wu noted, in recent years, the authorization by the  previous French Government of the sale of arms to Taiwan  seriously undermined bilateral relations.    "As long as both sides abide by the principles guiding the  establishment of diplomatic relations and relevant principles  underscored in the Sino-French joint communique, Sino-French  relations will be gradually improved and grow steadily," he said.</p>

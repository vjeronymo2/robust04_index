			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD FORFEITS UPHELD  </P> <P> After nearly two hours of discussion Wednesday with officials representing  Buena and Oxnard highs, a Southern Section committee upheld its earlier  recommendation that Oxnard should forfeit two nonleague football victories in  which the Yellowjackets used an ineligible player.  </P> <P> Channel Islands and Camarillo have now been awarded nonleague victories over  Oxnard, which is now 3-5 overall. The Yellowjackets' Channel League record  remains 3-2.  </P> <P> In a meeting at the Southern Section office in Cerritos, Oxnard officials  appealed the Oct. 1 ruling that senior running back Kelly Kendricks was  ineligible because he failed to meet change-of-address requirements when he  transferred to Oxnard from Buena in September.  </P> <P> In their appeal, Oxnard officials accused Buena Coach Rick Scott of undue  influence, citing a conversation between Scott and Kendrick's mother, Pat  Ellison. Both parties acknowledged Wednesday that Scott had told Ellison that  Kendrick, who transferred from Buena to Oxnard the second semester of his  junior year, would have more playing time at Buena.  </P> <P> But Scott and Ellison gave conflicting accounts of when the conversation took  place. Scott said it took place before Kendrick had transferred to Oxnard.  Ellison said it occurred after Kendrick's transfer to Oxnard and prompted her  inquiry of a transfer back to Buena.  </P> <P> Because of the discrepancy, the committee said no conclusion could be drawn  from the information available.  </P> <P> Oxnard also had sought a hardship case for Kendrick based on a claim that  Kendrick was compelled to leave Buena when his inter-district transfer was not  renewed by Buena this fall.  </P> <P> Buena said Kendrick's inter-district transfer, which is reviewed by district  officials before each school year, was not renewed because of Kendrick's  alleged involvement in a gang fight at the school in June.  </P> <P> Oxnard officials said Kendrick was not properly informed of the revocation  until school began in September, a claim disputed by Buena officials.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Ala' al-Mashahrawi] </F>   [Excerpt] Gaza -- Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar has described the  day of the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement as a  black day for the Palestinian people and a day of mourning and  grief to all those who love Jerusalem and Palestine and are  aware of the nature of the conflict on this land.    In his statement to AL-QUDS, Dr. al-Zahhar stressed the  Islamic Movement's rejection of the agreement that is expected  to be signed today in Cairo between 'Arafat and Rabin. He said:  History will not stop on this day or on any such event. Muslim  history has proved that it has surmounted such days and that the  journey of victory might be delayed but it is inevitable and  certain.    Al-Zahhar added: Those signing the agreement will bear its  results, consequences, and repercussions before God, the people,  and history. [passage omitted]</p>

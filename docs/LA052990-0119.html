			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: PARLIN ISN'T STRONGEST, BUT HE'S BEST  </P> <P> In an event often seen as a test of brute strength, shotputter Mark Parlin  isn't the strongest. In fact, Parlin has two teammates on Esperanza High  School's track and field team who are more powerful.  </P> <P> But Parlin is the best shotputter in the Southern Section, and he proved it  again Friday, winning the event at the Southern Section Masters meet with a  throw of 60 feet 3 1/2 inches.  </P> <P> Parlin, The Times' Athlete of the Week, also finished fourth in the discus  (175-4) and qualified in both events for the state championships Friday and  Saturday at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> Such success for Parlin, a junior, is somewhat of a surprise, says Esperanza  assistant coach Bill Pendleton. Parlin won the Empire League's frosh-soph  championship in the shotput last season, breaking the school and league records  by two feet with his final throw. Parlin, 6 feet 1 and 220 pounds, has gained  about 30 pounds and significant strength since football season.  </P> <P> Pendleton said Parlin's athletic ability -- which helped him earn second-team  all-league honors as a running back -- his work in the weight room and a new  spinning technique have combined to improve his throws by more than 10 feet  this season.  </P> <P> "I knew he would be a good thrower, but I'd be lying if I said I thought he'd  go 60 feet," said Pendleton, who is also the strength coach for the Aztec  football team.  </P> <P> "To tell you the truth, he's throwing just about where I thought he would as a  senior."  </P> <P> In the state meet, Parlin will get another chance to compete against Brent Noon  of Fallbrook High, who has thrown 76-2 this season, the second-best all-time  mark on the high school level.  </P> <P> When Parlin and Noon met in an invitational meet earlier this season, Noon won  by 20 feet. Parlin has thrown 61-4, the second-best mark in the state this  year, and though he has thrown a few feet farther in warm-ups, Parlin isn't  expecting any surprises.  </P> <P> "It's cool to see a guy throw that far when he's that young, but I'm not trying  to beat him," Parlin said. "I'm just trying to get second in state, basically."  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Kevin Carlson (6-9 3/4), Katella high jumper, Magnolia triple jumper Phouphet  Singbandith (49-8 1/2) and Dana Hills discus thrower Andy Marrone (184-1) each  won his event at the Masters meet and qualified for the state meet Friday and  Saturday.  </P> <P> Walter Dawkins pitched a no-hitter and hit a home run -- his second of the  playoffs -- to lead La Quinta to a 1-0 victory over El Monte in a Southern  Section 3-A second-round playoff game Tuesday.  </P> <P> Brett Hansen-Dent of Newport Harbor defeated Ari Nathan of Brentwood, 3-6, 6-0,  6-3, to win the Southern Section singles tennis title Saturday. Mater Dei's  Jason Harnett and Adam Jarrett won the Southern Section doubles tournament  Saturday, defeating Sean McKenna and Derek Shinden of Thousand Oaks, 7-5, 7-6  (7-4).  </P> <P> Marc Newfield of Marina hit solo home runs in each of the Vikings' 5-A playoff  victories last week. He homered in the third inning of a 3-1 victory over  Esperanza Tuesday and in the third inning of a 4-0 victory over Mater Dei  Friday.  </P> <P> Mark Parlin  </P> <P> Esperanza High School  </P> <P> * Position: Shotput/discus  </P> <P> * Height, Weight, Class: 6-1, 220, Junior.  </P> <P> * Last Week: Parlin won the shotput at the Southern Section Masters meet Friday  with a mark of 60-3 1/2 and finished fourth in the discus. He will compete  Friday in the state meet in the shot and discus.  </P> <P> * Season: Parlin won the shot and discus events at the Orange County  Championships in March and was also the Empire League champion in both events.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Remarks by Juri Luik, foreign minister of the Republic of </F> Estonia, at the Inaugural Conference for the Pact on Stability  in Europe, in Paris on 26 May --received via Internet E-LIST]    [Text] Mr. Chairman, Dear Colleagues, Ladies and  Gentlemen,    For half of the 20th century, half of our continent was not  able to realize democracy. The political and economic results  of the Second World War effectively put democratic development  in the states of Central and Eastern Europe on hold. Now is the  time to give democracy a renewed push in the right direction by  dealing in a practical way with border and minorities issues.  We share the view of the European Union that it is better to  open these questions for discussion, to talk through the  difficulties and reach practical solutions rather than to ignore  the problems or worse, to suppress their existence. For this  reason, we welcome the Pact on Stability in Europe as a way to  resolve the problems at hand. We believe this Pact is a tool  through which we can implement the principles upon which the  Council of Europe and the CSCE are founded, a process which,  ultimately, will enhance stability on the continent.    Mr. Chairman, when the Pact for Stability was first  introduced, we were eager to use it as a means to reach a final  consensus on our own border question. As you know, the Russian  Federation does not recognize the Tartu Peace Treaty which is so  far actually the only international treaty constituting the  border between our two countries. In the course of negotiations  over the text of the Pact, the formulation used in referring to  border questions has evolved considerably. If in the beginning  we spoke of the consolidation of borders, then today we are  approaching the question on the basis, and I quote from Pact,  "of inviolability of frontiers, territorial integrity and  respect of existing borders, according to the principles of the  Helsinki Final to be seen as a whole" (end of quote). Mr.  Chairman, with your permission, I request the participating  states to note that Estonia regards existing borders to be those  fixed by international treaties concluded between states. I  would further ask you to note that borders fixed by  international treaties can only be changed by other  international treaties which supersede the previous ones. Under  the terms of the Helsinki Final Act, borders are considered  inviolable but they may be changed, and I quote, "in accordance  with international law, by peaceful means and by agreement" (end  of quote). It is exactly this peaceful and law-based approach  to resolving border questions that we have sought to  operationalize within the Pact for Stability. We recognize that  a problem exists, and we want to solve it. But discussion is  necessary in order to create the conditions for resolution.  Unfortunately, some states have taken an unconstructive  approach to this question, thus far refusing to talk about the  matter with us, either within the framework of the Pact or in  other fora. We remain hopeful that in the interest of  stability, the other interested party will eventually come to  the table and agree to talk with the European Union and with us  about the problem.    The second basket of the Pact concerns minorities. I am  happy to report that the question of minorities has found a  liberal solution in Estonia, in keeping with the civic  traditions of our society. Last autumn, our parliament passed a  law on Cultural Autonomy, which was based on our 1925 law  providing national minorities numbering at least three thousand  persons with state support for schooling and churches in their  mother tongue as well as cultural self-governments legally  equivalent to local governments. The CSCE High Commissioner on  National Minorities, Mr. Max van der Stoel, made a point last  summer of praising this law as an example for other states in  protecting minority rights.    But we have not stopped there. A bilateral agreement is  ready to be signed with Belarus extending our Law on Cultural  Autonomy to Belarusians who live in Estonia but are not numerous  enough to qualify as a national minority group. There is one  more issue in this basket worth noting. As we all are aware, a  myriad of other problems stem from the resettlement of peoples  for political reasons by the Soviet central authorities during  the annexation of Estonia. Here, the key issue is to integrate  into society people who may never decide to opt for Estonian  citizenship. For this reason, we have decided to treat  questions of integration separately and parallel to minority  issues within the Pact for Stability. Central elements here  include practical assistance in processing applications,  language training, information exchange and matters of  education. I think all parties should be interested in  resolving these practical problems that are key to enhancing  stability in our corner of the world.    Finally, I would say a few words about the round-tables  which, alongside continuing bilateral negotiations, are intended  to be the actual instruments through which to attain the goals  of the Pact. From the start of talks on this Pact, we have  lobbied to establish a concrete Baltic round-table, to follow  the lines of the Council of Baltic Sea States and to be  supplemented by other interested states. We saw the idea of a  Baltic round-table as an innovative and creative way of fleshing  out the general round-table idea. Through greater regional  specificity, we believed the Baltic round-table would have a  more focused approach that would lead to more effective and  concrete solutions.    I do not wish to reiterate--knowing well that the Pact does  not directly deal with military and security issues--but I would  not be honest if I did not call your attention to the fact that  the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and Estonia by 31  August 1994 would be essential for maintaining stability and  democracy in the region. Mr. Chairman, I wish to conclude my  remarks by thanking French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur for  having initiated the idea of this Pact. I also wish to thank  the European Union for having taken an active interest and a  leading role in resolving the delicate questions of the day.  Estonia remains hopeful that the intervention of the Union,  alongside other European institutions, in particular the Council  of Europe and the CSCE, will, in fact, lead to enhanced  stability on our continent.    Thank you.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOW THEY'RE DOING;  </P> <P> HARRY'S LIFE IS ONE FOR THE BOOKS  </P> <P> Emile Harry's innermost thoughts have stretched far beyond the limits of the  football field, where stardom, or waivers, can be a fingertip catch away.  </P> <P> When he attended Fountain Valley High School, Harry caught touchdown passes and  wrote poetry.  </P> <P> At Stanford, he caught touchdown passes, studied political science and worked  as a computer consultant.  </P> <P> Now a wide receiver with the Kansas City Chiefs, Harry recently completed a  book titled "Flight Above the Moon." He still catches touchdown passes, only  not as often as he used to.  </P> <P> "The book's a story of life and death, and it all takes place on an airplane,"  said Harry, who finished it last year and hopes to have it published.  </P> <P> "It's written from the Judeo-Christian perspective. It's about this  intellectual snob who's in a life-threatening situation on the plane, and he  learns about life along the way. It's a good introspective look."  </P> <P> Harry wrote the book early in his NFL career, when he was struggling to make it  as a receiver.  </P> <P> "It's all about the trials and tribulations that were going on in my life," he  said.  </P> <P> After playing five years in the NFL, Harry can take a step back and take a long  look at where he has been. And where he's going.  </P> <P> Harry, 27, has played most of his pro career as a reserve, wondering day-to-day  if his name would be on a locker the next morning.  </P> <P> His best season was in 1989, when he filled in for injured Stephone Paige and  caught 33 passes for 430 yards and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> Harry has similar numbers, catching 32 passes for 403 yards and two touchdowns  entering Sunday's game at San Diego. The Chiefs (9-5), one game behind the  Raiders, are trying to win their first AFC West title since 1971.  </P> <P> "I still don't know how long the Chiefs want to keep me," he said. "Every year  they say, 'He doesn't have 4.3 (second) speed.' But I've never had 4.3 speed,  and I've played in this league for five years.  </P> <P> "I have my own opinion on why I'm here. I believe my talents haven't changed  much, other than some honing. The bottom line with me is that God is author and  finisher of what I do."  </P> <P> Harry's NFL career started in 1985, when he was drafted in the fourth round by  the Atlanta Falcons.  </P> <P> He was coming off a good career at Stanford, where he started three seasons and  finished with 123 catches for 2,270 yards and 15 touchdowns. He was sidelined  with injuries for most of his senior season.  </P> <P> But he was back in shape by the time he reported to the Falcons' camp, and he  impressed the coaches during the exhibition season as a receiver-kick returner.  Harry was confident he would make the team.  </P> <P> Only four days before the start of the season, the Falcons traded for veteran  receiver Charlie Brown of the Washington Redskins. Harry, now expendable, was  cut.  </P> <P> "I had a $95,000 summer job," Harry said.  </P> <P> Harry became one of the league's wandering nomads, trying out with the 49ers,  Chiefs and Redskins during the 1985 season.  </P> <P> He had a good feeling after his tryout with Kansas City. He signed a free-agent  contract with the Chiefs for 1986.  </P> <P> During the off-season, he returned to Palo Alto, where he was renting an  apartment, and began training with James Lofton, an all-pro receiver with the  Green Bay Packers, and Kermit Washington, a former basketball player with the  Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers.  </P> <P> "Kermit is the most fit man I have ever known," Harry said. "And James had  played my position for many many years. I believe when you work with great  players, you develop a great attitude. I just hung out with them and worked out  with them."  </P> <P> When the Chiefs broke camp in August, John Mackovic, the coach at the time,  announced he would carry five receivers. Harry thought he had made the team.  </P> <P> Then Mackovic revised his plans just before the season, and Harry was the last  player cut.  </P> <P> He kept in shape. He still had hopes of playing.  </P> <P> He got his chance a month into the season, when Chief receiver Anthony Hancock  injured his knee and underwent surgery.  </P> <P> Harry filled Hancock's roster spot and has been with the Chiefs since.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley Coach Mike Milner said the NFL was a "tough adjustment" for  Harry.  </P> <P> "Playing in the NFL has a lot to do with ability, but also being in the right  spot at right time," Milner said. "When you think about the talented players  walking on streets right now, there are a lot of them who could be playing in  the NFL under the right situation. You have to find your niche."  </P> <P> Harry found his with the Chiefs. He finished the 1986 season with nine catches  for 211 yards and a touchdown. After missing 1987 with a shoulder injury, Harry  has averaged 30 catches the last three seasons.  </P> <P> Harry's hopes of NFL stardom started in Fountain Valley, where he played  football with his friends as a kid.  </P> <P> He was the fourth of Alvin and Nilene Harry's seven children. He and his  younger brother, Carl, now a wide receiver with the Redskins' developmental  team, were the athletes in the family.  </P> <P> "Emile's one of the best athletes who ever came through here," said Milner, who  has been at Fountain Valley for 19 years. r"If Emile would have picked up a  tennis racket or a golf club, he could have done anything with it."  </P> <P> Harry split time at quarterback and wide receiver as a junior. He was moved to  wide receiver full-time as a senior when Matt Stevens took over at quarterback.  </P> <P> "I think Emile would have had a great future at quarterback if he had stayed  there," Milner said. "He had a great arm."  </P> <P> And Harry wanted to stay at quarterback, but Milner convinced him his future  was even brighter at wide receiver.  </P> <P> "Milner means so much to me," Harry said. "He was the guy I listened to as a  youth. So many guys on that team had talent but didn't listen to what Milner  told them."  </P> <P> Harry was more effective as a receiver than a passer. As a senior, he had 52  catches for 1,141 yards and 12 touchdowns. He was named the Southern Section  Big Five Conference player of the year.  </P> <P> "As a receiver, he could do anything," Milner said. "He had courage and could  run the crossing routes over the middle. He made the acrobatic catches. He has  tremendous body control."  </P> <P> Harry remembers high school well. He's looking forward to his 10-year class  reunion and hopes it won't conflict with the football season.  </P> <P> "When I played, high school football was pure, unadulterated," he said. "The  guys I played with will always have a place in my heart."  </P> <P> Life isn't as carefree as it was when he was 17.  </P> <P> He and his wife, Sonia, bought a home in Kansas City. Their son, Judah-Michael,  11 months, keeps them busy. There are responsibilities, bills to pay.  </P> <P> And Harry knows that one day, playing football will no longer be a part of  those responsibilities. He's ready.  </P> <P> "When I'm done playing, I want to write," he said. "That's one of my favorite  things to do."  </P> <P> </P> <P> HARRY'S CAREER  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.67IN:4.09IN:1.56IN:1.56IN:1.56IN:1.34IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="6"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Rec.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Yds.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Avg.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Long  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> TD  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 211  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 23.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 53  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Missed with shoulder injury  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 28  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 362  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 13.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 38  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 33  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 430  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 13.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 25  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 32  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 403  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 60  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Total  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 102  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1406  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 13.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 60  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Transport stocks lift Dow in modest volume Wall Street US STOCKS drifted higher yesterday, thanks partly to strength in the transportation sector, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 10.06 higher at 3,369.41 after unexceptional total volume on the NYSE of about 200m shares. Rises outpaced declines by 1,012 to 680. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.05 easier at 416.79, but the Nasdaq composite gained 1.29 to 589.36. On Tuesday, the Dow fell about 19 points. Wall Street largely ignored the Federal Reserve's beige book of economic activity, which showed an increase in activity, although conditions were described as uneven. The market is more concerned with Friday's release of employment data for April, which will provide the first piece of significant economic news for the month and may indicate whether monetary policy is likely to be eased further. Transportation issues outpaced the general market for a second day, with the Dow Jones Transportation Average climbing 13.45 to 1,407.70, after adding 13.46 a day earlier in a declining market. USAir rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 14 3/4 in active trade amid speculation that the company had reached a tentative labour agreement with its pilots' union. Among other airline issues, AMR, parent of American Airlines, was unchanged at Dollars 68 7/8 , Delta Air Lines rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 60 3/4 and UAL, parent of United Airlines, gained Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 126 3/4 . Results continued to trickle in from the insurance sector, with Travelers reporting first-quarter net income of Dollars 63m or 58 cents a share, against Dollars 93m or 88 cents a year earlier. Shares in the company dipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 20. General Re, which fell sharply last week on the back of its quarterly results, recovered Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 80 5/8 . Unocal put on Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 25 7/8 after the Los Angeles-based energy group said it plans to sell or place in joint ventures at least Dollars 350m in non-strategic assets, eliminate at least 400 jobs and take other steps to improve efficiency and profitability. A number of blue chip stocks were active on the NYSE, including Exxon, down Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 59 1/4 , IBM, off Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 93 5/8 , AT&amp;T, up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 44 1/8 , and Ford, Dollars 5/8 firmer at Dollars 45 1/2 . In over-the-counter trading, technology and biotechnology stocks were active. Sun Microsystems rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 28 1/2 and Apple Computer improved Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 61 3/4 . Chiron declined Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 46 5/8 in heavy trading. The company has received US Food and Drug Administration approval to market its IL-2 Proleukin drug for use in cancer treatment. Canada TORONTO stocks closed mixed after the composite index shuffled within a 10-point range during a trendless session, but trading volume was a heavy 30.5m shares, well above Tuesday's 23m. The 300-share index was finally 3.2 off at 3,361.3, but advances narrowly exceeded falls by 278 to 264. Nine of 14 stock groups closed higher, led by transportation, up 2.1 per cent as Laidlaw 'B' gained CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 11 1/2 . The gold group climbed 2.0 per cent, led by American Barrick, CDollars 1 3/4 stronger at CDollars 28 3/4 .</p>

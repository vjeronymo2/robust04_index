In a  statement to AL-AHRAM to be published on Tuesday, Izetbegovic  stressed that the Arab and Islamic countries played a major role  in the Washington negotiations through calls for a fair Bosnian  solution. He expressed his hope that strong political and  economic ties will be established between his country and Egypt.    Croatian President Tudjman made a statement to AL-AHRAM in  which he welcomed the decision by most Arab countries to  establish diplomatic ties with Croatia. He noted that as Egypt  is a major country, Croatia will establish strong political,  economic, and cultural ties with it.    The Bosnian president said the Washington agreement between  the Bosnian Croats and Muslims is positive and fulfills the most  important aspirations concerning maintaining Bosnia's unity.    The Croatian president said the Washington agreement will  end  the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and described it as the path  toward fair peace in the country.    Izetbegovic and Tudjman praised the U.S. efforts and the  efforts of Western countries, primarily Germany, France, and  Austria, and the Arab and Islamic countries to reach the  federation agreement. They said they welcome the Serbs joining  the agreement, providing they accept the unity of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Izetbegovic said the return of the Bosnian  areas occupied by the Serbs is a condition for any cooperation  with them. Tudjman stressed that the return of Croatian  territory occupied by the Serbs for three years is a fair demand.    On Bosnia's new constitution signed in Vienna, Izetbegovic  said that it preserves the national identity of the Muslim  Bosnians and Catholic Croats by establishing cantons based on  distinctive national characteristics. He said the new  constitution that will be ratified by the Bosnian Parliament  will guarantee the presence of a strong central authority and  broad powers for the cantons to address issues relating to  purely national interests.    The Croatian president stressed that the new constitution  guarantees complete equality between the Muslim and Croatian  peoples in Bosnia. Izetbegovic noted that the federation  between the Republics of Bosnia and Croatia will achieve two  practical gains for both parties: Bosnia will obtain the port of  Ploce on the Adriatic in return for Croatia obtaining an  unrestricted transit route through Bosnia.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by State Duma Deputy Irina Khakamada, member of the </F> Committee on Economic Policy: "The 1994 Budget: Revision Is  Dangerous, Correctives Are Needed. The State Duma Acted  Correctly, Accepting the Russian Federation's 1994 Federal  Budget in Principle and Giving the Government Time To Perfect  It"]    [Text] Of course, the budget is not designed to accomplish  any major national priorities (scientific-technical, social, or  whatever) or even to get out of the economic crisis, but only to  maintain a more or less stable position in the context of the  crisis.    But it is exactly what a budget can be that is oriented  toward a moderately stern financial policy, taking account of  present Russian realities. And I think that any major abrupt  changes in the draft could induce social and political  destabilization, even the kind of changes that are objectively  progressive, for example further decentralizing the budget or  reducing the percentage of state spending in the gross domestic  product.    Nevertheless, the draft budget brings up a number of  questions, questions that are so serious that, in my opinion,  the government has to answer them.    The draft budget states, for example, that planned revenues  from privatization in 1994 are estimated in the amount of 148  billion rubles or, at the rate of exchange this year, less than  85 million dollars. Why such a small amount? The first stage of  privatization, during which state property was handed out almost  free of charge, comes to an end starting 1 July, and sales for  money begin. The government will have another half year to  obtain a real monetary return to the budget from privatization.  Why are revenues from that source planned in amounts several  times smaller than last year, taking anticipated inflation into  account? There is money in the country, after all, as is  indicated by the amounts of capital being taken abroad.    What does the government intend to do to attract at least  some of the national capital that is flowing out of Russia in  the privatization process? I wish it would explain why efforts  to activate foreign participation in privatization have been so  ineffective that real revenues from privatization in the draft  budget are being reduced. Only by getting to the bottom of these  questions can we make a decision on this item of the budget.    There are also many questions regarding the budget revenue  source represented by import duties, total collections of which  should come to 500 million dollars in 1994, given taxable  imports in the amount of 21.4 billion dollars. Recent decisions  in this field indicate that the government has no long-term  foreign trade policy and that it is conducting a policy serving  the interests of Russia's industrialists at the expense of the  interests of Russia's consumers. Moreover, this protectionism  embodies neither priorities nor time frames.    Especially puzzling is the introduction of duties on imports  of modern equipment, without which any structural restructuring  and modernization of Russia's industry is unthinkable. At a time  when Western countries have dissolved COCOM and are relaxing  their bans on deliveries of modern machinery and equipment to  Russia, our government is instituting prohibitive duties on  imports thereof. This protection of uncompetitive national  industrialists dooms the country to technological backwardness.    Analyzing the revenue items of the proposed budget, you have  to conclude that it underrates the potential of the source  represented by transactions with state securities. Of course, it  is more difficult to implement such transactions than to take  soft 10-percent loans from the Central Bank--in other words,  from the printing press. However, actively mobilizing the  population's money resources, although it is more complicated,  does have an anti-inflationary effect. Before agreeing to the  proposed structure of budget revenues, I should like our  government to tell us what its approach is to the use of  domestic state loans as a source of budget revenues.    As for budget expenditures, without changing their overall  amounts it is possible and necessary to change the proportion of  expenditures on certain items.    Spending on fundamental research and scientific-technical  progress--4.2 trillion rubles--seems way too low. Yet this is  practically the only competitive potential the country has (not  counting raw materials)! Not only that, the share of budget  expenditures on science and technology is being reduced from 2.5  to 2.3 percent compared with last year. One-quarter of all  expenditures are appropriated for the Russian Academy of  Sciences and all its branches. It is unclear why this percentage  is so low, considering that the Russian Academy of Sciences has  always been the principal base of fundamental research in the  country.    Another source of puzzlement is the sharp increase in the  share of spending to support the "civil" state apparatus. Plans  call for increasing this amount by 1.5 times--from 1.4 to 2.1  percent. Why such a big increase? To some extent we can justify  a reasonable increase in the size of the state administrative  apparatus in subjects of the Federation and on the city, rayon,  and other local levels, and expenditures to support it.  Decentralization is bringing about an increase in the size of  the counterpart apparatus in the localities. But not in the  Federal apparatus! Yet the size of the apparatus of the Federal  ministries and departments increased by 2.4 times in 1991-1993.  Meanwhile, the number of workers on the republic, oblast, kray,  and other levels of authority declined by 1.2 times--that is, to  half the size.    Before approving that part of the budget, we need to study  the causes of the absolute and relative growth of budget  expenditures on state administration in order to reduce them as  much as possible, and also to take measures to reduce the growth  of the Federal bureaucracy, and if possible, reduce its size.  Incidentally, the share of expenditures on the Federal court  system and procuracy bodies is to be reduced from 0.7 to 0.6  percent. Is this compatible with the necessity of strengthening  judicial and juridical institutions in the framework of building  a rule-of-law state?    I think there are reserves for reducing military spending,  which is 20.3 percent of the budget or 5.1 percent of the gross  domestic product (compared to 4.6 percent last year). And this  does not count major appropriations on closed  administrative-territorial formations of the Defense Ministry,  which is a separate item. That high share of military  expenditures is something our country can hardly afford.    The budget's declining social orientation is also cause for  disappointment. In the new budget, the share of expenditures on  social needs, including education, health, culture, and so on,  is being reduced from 7.8 to 6.2 percent. It is unclear, also,  how we are to finance the professional-qualifications retraining  of unemployed persons, whose numbers may rise substantially. In  this regard, a special Federal program needs to be adopted if we  want to avert serious social collisions.</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CBS' '48 HRS.' MAKES TOP 10 FOR FIRST TIME;  </P> <P> RATINGS: NBC WINS WEEKLY NIELSEN RACE. ABC IS EDGED OUT OF NO. 2 SPOT.  </P> <P> The CBS News program "48 Hours" made the top 10 for the first time last week --  one of two CBS News shows in that elite group -- as NBC won the ratings race  but CBS edged out ABC for No. 2, it was reported today.  </P> <P> Missing from the top 10 was ABC's "America's Funniest Home Videos," which was  in a four-way tie for 15th place. The show was competing against regular  programming and did win its time period.  </P> <P> Fox's "The Simpsons" also dropped out of the top 10, after becoming the first  Fox show ever to earn that distinction the previous week. "The Simpsons" has  been said to benefit from an audience switch-over from "Home Videos," but last  week it outranked the earlier show, finishing in 13th place.  </P> <P> The winning "48 Hours," which ranked 10th, joined "60 Minutes," tied for  seventh on the Nielsen list. It was a special outing for the show -- at 10-11  p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday -- and it told the moving story of a missing  child in "The Search for Matthew."  </P> <P> The big difference for "48 Hours" was not having to compete against "The Cosby  Show" and "A Different World" on NBC. The regular "48 Hours" program on  Thursday night finished in a tie for 58th.  </P> <P> The best "48 Hours" has done in the past is rank 12th with its program on  Hurricane Gilbert in September, 1988 -- but it still was second in its time  period against "Cosby."  </P> <P> In the fall, the show will move to a new time period, away from Big Bill, but  the competition won't exactly be chopped liver. "48 Hours" is scheduled to move  to Saturday nights at 10, where it will compete with "Twin Peaks" on ABC and  "Carol &amp; Company" and Robert Urich's new "American Dreamer" on NBC.  </P> <P> It was a pretty good week for ABC News shows, too, with "20/20" in 14th place  and "PrimeTime Live" tied for 28th.  </P> <P> The Sunday movie contest went to CBS, which tied for 15th with "Trouble in  Paradise." NBC's showing of "Gremlins" tied for 33rd, while ABC's "Prizzi's  Honor" tied for 63rd.  </P> <P> NBC won the week ending June 10 with a 10.8 rating and a 20 share. CBS edged  out ABC for second with a 9.8 rating and a 19 share, while ABC had a 9.7 rating  and an 18 share.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP 10 SHOWS  </P> <P> The top 10 programs for the week ending Sunday, June 10, according to the A.C.  Nielsen Co., were:  </P> <P> 1. Roseanne (ABC)  </P> <P> 2. Cheers (NBC)  </P> <P> 3. The Cosby Show (NBC)  </P> <P> (tie) Designing Women (CBS)  </P> <P> 5. Unsolved Mysteries (NBC)  </P> <P> 6. A Different World (NBC)  </P> <P> 7. 60 Minutes (CBS)  </P> <P> (tie) Seinfeld (NBC)  </P> <P> 9. Coach (ABC)  </P> <P> 10. 48 Hours: The Search for Matthew (CBS)  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> CHAMBER MUSIC AT STRAWBERRY CREEK FESTIVAL  </P> <P> When is a facade not a false front but the real thing? When it's William  Walton's "Facade", performed with the professionalism and panache of the  Strawberry Creek Chamber Players.  </P> <P> Narrator Janet Bookspan, eschewing the traditional monotonal interpretation,  displayed one unique characterization after another. In so doing, she revealed  that not all of Dame Edith Sitwell's tongue-twisting poems are the merely  delightful nonsense they are usually purported to be.  </P> <P> Conductor Yehuda Gilad led a crackerjack sextet whose collective versatility in  both the tongue-in-cheek and occasionally serious styles belied the virtuosity  of the 1922 score.  </P> <P> One complaint: Nearly every forte (and louder) passage -- numerous in this  rambunctious work -- found the ensemble nearly burying Bookspan's colorful  recitation, despite amplification.  </P> <P> Friday night, the best had been saved for last, as the first half consisted  mainly of second-rate Mozart. The Quintet in G minor, K. 516, had a little of  everything at times: Wayward intonation, thin tone and miscalculated balances.  </P> <P> Only the adagio movement emerged with the cohesiveness and transparency  Mozart's music demands. Perhaps a last-minute program change and replacement of  an indisposed first violinist were principal culprits.  </P> <P> The evening opened with a seductive reading of Nielsen's "Serenata in Vano."  Led by clarinetist Mitchell Lurie's dulcet tones, the uniquely scored work's  bucolic nuances were faithfully re-created. GREG HETMANSBURGER  </P></p>

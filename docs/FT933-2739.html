			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / New-look Albert Hall to be ready for millennium THE ROYAL Albert Hall in London, home of the Proms, sporting and musical events, is to receive a Pounds 34m facelift, the body which runs the Victorian building said yesterday. The first phase in the refurbishment will cost Pounds 24m. The most expensive element of that is the construction of an underground access route from beneath the steps that lead to Prince Consort Road on the south side of the hall. This will enable trucks to come into the hall and greatly speed up backstage operations and enable the area around the hall to be pedestrianised. Mr Patrick Deuchar, the venue's chief executive, said yesterday that with improved backstage access the hall could remain open for a further 40 days a year. The final stage of the development, costing another Pounds 10m, will be an underpass for Kensington Gore, the main road which passes the hall. This would give London a grand plaza and allow audiences pedestrian access to the Albert Memorial and Kensington Gardens. The scheme is planned for completion before the millennial celebrations on December 31 1999 (and on December 31 2000, the true eve of the millennium). The illustrations, left to right, show: the completed Pounds 34m scheme, with a plaza extending to the Albert Memorial and Kensington Gore traffic confined to an underpass; the renovated balcony area, which will revert to its Victorian use as an art gallery; and the new service areas, with an expanded restaurant, bar, ticket and reception space at the southern entrance in blue, and the underground truck access in red.</p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / China political repression 'increasing' Asia Watch, the international human rights group, has accused China of increasing political repression throughout the country, especially in Tibet where most recent arrests have taken place. A 664-page report documents more than 200 arrests of dissidents in 1993 and is certain to intensify pressure on China at a sensitive moment in its dealings with the West over human rights issues. The report coincides with a heightened campaign by international human rights organisations to block renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status in the US. President Bill Clinton, who has called for 'overall, significant improvement' in China's human rights behaviour, is due to decide by June whether to renew the MFN status. China is also under pressure at the current session in Geneva of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. This is in spite of its recent efforts to counter international criticism by releasing well known dissidents. Mr Sidney Jones, executive director of the US-based Asia Watch, called at the weekend for 'continued pressure' on China on human rights issues. His statement reflected concerns that the US is moving towards MFN renewal without securing substantial concessions. 'There is clear evidence such pressure has been effective in the past,' he said. 'Any move now to abandon that pressure would send a terrible signal to Beijing - open season on peaceful dissent.' Asia Watch said its lengthy report, entitled Detained in China and Tibet, 'shows clearly that political repression is increasing, not decreasing, and that it extends to virtually every province in China and throughout the Tibetan plateau.' Among specific Asia Watch criticisms were: 1993 was the 'worst' year for political arrests since the crackdown that followed the 1989 Tiananmen massacre with 250 cases, compared with last year's release of 37 dissidents. 80 per cent of the new political arrests occurred in Tibet, where the authorities embarked on an 'intensified' campaign of repression against Buddhist monks and nuns involved in pro-independence activities. The number of people detained for 'peaceful political and religious activities' is far higher than that 3,317 figure given by China as the number of sentenced 'counter-revolutionaries'. The authorities say there are 'no political prisoners in China'. Chinese standards of justice remain abysmally low by international standards, with limited prospects of a fair trial for those accused of 'counter-revolutionary crime'. Torture is widely practised both to secure 'confessions' and to maintain control in China's extensive prison and labour-camp system. Asia Watch said 'a most pressing and immediate need' was to secure regular access for organisations like the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to work for better treatment of those in detention. It also called for more determined international efforts to uphold Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 'ensure that no one is arbitrarily detained in the first place'.</p>

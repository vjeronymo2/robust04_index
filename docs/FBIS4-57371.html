			<p>Code   <F P=102>   PA1605204794 </F> <F P=103> PA1605204794 </F> <F P=104></F>    BFN     [Editorial Report] Managua Canal Cuatro Television in  Spanish at 0430 GMT on 14 May broadcasts a 75-minute interview  with Nicaraguan General Humberto Ortega, chief of the Sandinist  People's Army (EPS), by Canal Cuatro News Director Manuel  Espinosa Henriquez at the station's studios in Managua. The  interview is live or recorded.    Espinosa begins the interview by asking Ortega why 21  February 1995 was chosen as the date for his retirement. The  general replies the date is the result of the two-year process  under which the new military code was drawn up. Ortega says:  "The agreement we reached has now become very important for the  nation's stability." He adds: "My retirement, which has been  highly politicized, has been practically resolved within the  framework of the military code and within a framework of a  solution acceptable to the executive, as well as to the EPS."    When asked whether he chose the date of his retirement or  whether President Violeta Chamorro chose it, Ortega replies that  the date was agreed upon by the two sides.    The general says he had agreed with President Chamorro to  confirm his retirement date and to unveil the new draft Military  Organization Law in the afternoon of 18 May. Ortega says: "What  is most important is that this is being done based on an  understanding and a rapprochement that takes important  considerations into account."    Espinosa continues by asking Ortega whether other EPS  officers will also be retiring. Ortega replies that, at this  time, no one else will be retiring, because junior officers  still need to be trained to fill upper-level positions. Ortega  adds that he had never planned to stay in the Army his entire  life.    The discussion turns to the amount of time the next EPS  chief  will remain in the post. Ortega says an agreement has been  reached on the tenure of this post, which will run about the  same length as the presidential term of five years.    In response to a follow-up question, Ortega says the choice  of the new EPS chief will be based on the military career of  various candidates, adding that the chief will be chosen from  the High Military Command.    After Espinosa asks who indeed will be chosen to replace him  as commander of the EPS, Ortega says the Military Council will  review and examine the merits of all candidates, and it will  then present its findings to the president in accordance with  the military code. Ortega adds that he will be leaving the Army  with the satisfaction of knowing he has fulfilled his role.    Espinosa then questions Ortega on his plans following  retirement. The general responds by saying any position he might  hold as a civilian will not prevent him from "contributing to  the freedom and full democracy" that Nicaragua has yet to enjoy.  Ortega says he will devote himself to working with those who  are interested in finding a solution to the critical situation  facing Nicaragua.    He says: "I honestly am not interested in becoming actively  involved in any specific political post. Instead, I feel the  duty and the need, as a Nicaraguan, to contribute to finding the  right road for Nicaragua." Ortega adds: "There is a serious  problem here; it is the problem of trust. If there is no trust,  if the EPS -- now that it has its code -- is not given an  opportunity to demonstrate that it is truly a national army that  does not answer to any partisan interests, then we will always  live in a climate of insecurity and will continue living with  instability."    In response to a question on whether he plans to return to  the Sandinist ranks, Ortega says he will continue on the  revolutionary road from a "very individualistic position."  Ortega notes that since the Chamorro government took office,  members of the EPS have not been members of the Sandinist  political wing. He adds: "All of us who are members of the EPS  are revolutionaries. Some radical Sandinists accuse us of being  traitors." He continues: "These same people are launching a  campaign that says the EPS cannot be trusted, because we do not  answer to a party as in the past regime. I am against the EPS  being under political leadership. This is very dangerous."    When the discussion turns to the relationship between the  Army and the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN), Ortega  warns if Sandinist leaders attempt to influence the Army, the  Army will distance itself from them and a civil war among  Sandinists will follow. Ortega adds: "At this time, the FSLN  can be split into as many factions as it wants. The Army will  not break up over or follow any Sandinist leader."    Asked about the risks posed to the nation by a division  within the FSLN, Ortega says there have been extremists in the  FSLN throughout his tenure as EPS commander. Some of these  extremists have criticized the Army for failing to conform to  their political position. He reiterates that the Army "should  not follow anyone within the FSLN" but, rather, remain committed  to the good of the Nicaraguan people.    Ortega goes on to note that the draft Military Organization  Law is important because, although it is not perfect, it lays  the groundwork for a national Army and the construction of a  democratic system.    Next, Ortega denies having said in December that he had  presidential aspirations, adding that he would consider such a  possibility only at an appropriate time and under the right  conditions. He adds: "My greatest aspiration is for Nicaragua  to attain complete peace and to establish a course of stability  leading to a more rapid reconstruction of the homeland. I think  this is the most important thing. I would like to be part of a  group of Nicaraguans who work to achieve this goal. I do not  necessarily have to be the top leader of this effort and then be  rewarded with a presidential candidacy. I am not looking  forward to becoming a presidential candidate."    Espinosa then asks Ortega about the situation in northern  Nicaragua, where the EPS continues to clash with armed groups  linked to the recontras. Espinosa adds that the EPS is being  accused of committing abuses in the north. Ortega says steps  are being taken "to correct this situation," noting that the  Army has a duty to continue fighting in the area to keep the  armed groups in check.    Ortega continues by explaining he was originally named  defense minister because he could contribute to a rapprochement  between the executive branch and the Army. He adds: "I was then  removed from the ministry because I was a Sandinist, as if being  a Sandinist is tantamount to being evil. This did not help  create the desired stability. As of now, unfortunately, there  is no civilian who is politically qualified to occupy that post."    He says that talks are being held with institutes to train  civilians from various political parties to assist in this task.    The interview continues with Ortega saying the defeat of the  Somoza regime was the Sandinists' greatest success. He decries  the fact that the Chamorro government was incapable of  preserving the unity that prevailed after Somoza's defeat to  rebuild the country. After stressing the fact that the country  is indeed divided, Ortega says: "What is needed here is to  secure a national unity solution in which every sector will be  represented."    Ortega says that joint efforts must be made to reach a  national agreement in order that the next administration's  economic policy will not be so burdensome. He says a national  dialogue must be promoted to find solutions as soon as possible.  He says: "Sandinism, which is such an important sector of  society, should seek an adequate program for the needs of the  country, thinking of the interests of the country, instead of  ideological or sectarian interests. This will encourage other  sectors to do the same."    In discussing national unity further, Ortega says: "We  Nicaraguans must realize it is necessary that we understand one  another. Otherwise, the only path that will be left to us is to  continue to kill one another and destroy one another. Not even  the most fanatical individuals want this. I believe that not  even those labeled the most fanatical extremists in a given  party want war or more violence. They want more order and  security.    "What is happening is that this feeling is growing as the  election period draws near. Therefore, the approaching election  apparently does not encourage the best conditions. In ideal  conditions, as in a laboratory, for example, all of us -- Daniel  Ortega, Arnoldo Aleman, Virgilio Godoy, conservatives, Social  Christians, in short, everyone, including Pablo Antonio Cuadra  and the cardinal -- would work toward rapprochement. This is  the least common denominator needed to prevent the destruction  of this country."    When asked about constitutional reform, Ortega says: "We  must make the adjustments by reforming the Constitution.  Therefore, a constitutional reform obliges us all to have the  laws and instruments, so that, whether or not we like it, the  police and the Army will ensure compliance with the laws. More  important is that we appeal to the conscience of the people to  secure such an agreement. I think this is what is important, to  reach an agreement and to find solutions."    Ortega concludes with a final message: "Despite all of the  complexities, Nicaraguans over the past 20 years have at least  demonstrated that they have more virtues than defects. I think  we Nicaraguans have the duty to tell all Nicaraguans before the  end of this century that we are capable of working together to  reconstruct the nation."</p>

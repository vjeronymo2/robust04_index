			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Belfast Investment Conference: Major unveils training scheme Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday unveiled a jobs training scheme for Northern Ireland, signalling a refocusing of the government's economic strategy for the province to target the areas of highest unemployment. The announcement came as both the US and the European Union reaffirmed their commitment to support the Northern Ireland economy. In an address to the 300 business delegates at the Belfast conference, the prime minister argued that there were five reasons for investing in the province - the educated labour force; its competitive business costs; one of the most attractive incentive packages on offer in Europe; a strategic location as a bridgehead for US and Asian investors; and its technology infrastructure. Outlining plans for new investments totalling about Pounds 75m, Mr Major reiterated the government's commitment to fair employment. In apparent response to reservations voiced by some US executives about sectarian discrimination in the jobs market, the prime minister said the government was determined to 'correct this legacy'. He added: 'Everyone in Northern Ireland must have equal access to jobs and indeed to all the new opportunities of peace.' The prime minister devoted much of his speech to outlining the new community work programme, aimed at providing work for up to three years for people aged between 26 and 60 who have been out of work for more than a year. The objective was to break the 'vicious cycle of declining skills and motivation which long periods of unemployment can so easily create'. He said: 'Northern Ireland has a new beginning. I want people to see, with the minimum delay, the benefits peace is bringing - to commerce, to industry, to everyday life. 'Peace is giving rise to prosperity. Prosperity in turn will consolidate peace.' The need to underpin the ceasefire through economic measures was a theme echoed by Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary. 'At this decisive and hopeful moment, it is essential to create greater economic opportunity in a region whose prospects have been too long dimmed by bloodshed and enmity,' he said. Mr Brown said his presence at the conference was 'only part of a larger ongoing US commitment to Ireland'. The US, he said, was preparing a 'strategic plan' for the economies of both Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Republic. The plan would be presented at President Bill Clinton's investment conference in Philadelphia, scheduled for April, as part of a series of administration initiatives aimed at 'preserving the peace and engendering economic progress'. Mr Carlo Trojan, deputy secretary general at the European Commission, giving further details of the EU's Ecu300m (Pounds 236m) package announced last week, confirmed that the European Investment Bank would extend its interest rate subsidies to help investors in the province. Mr Trojan said the province would require 'significant and sustained investment over the coming years'. Mr Trojan also stressed the need to address structural problems. He said a challenge was 'the redirection of redundant skills especially in the security sector'.</p>

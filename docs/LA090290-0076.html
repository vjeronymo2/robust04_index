			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEES THE BENEFITS IN COLUMBIA PROJECT  </P> <P> Regarding the Culver City council's pending decision about granting Columbia  Studios permission to build several tall office towers on their lot: I think  they should allow it.  </P> <P> Citizen worries about excess traffic and out-of-place development never  bothered them when they approved the Marina Place Mall.  </P> <P> Maybe it's because this time they have to answer to the people who would be  impacted, but they should apply the same logic here -- that the overriding  benefits of the tax revenue and prestige will justify the gridlock. Maybe then  they could forget about Marina Place?  </P> <P> ANDY PEARLMAN  </P> <P> Marina del Rey  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [RUKH PRESS report: "The Case of Missing Mykhaylo </F> Boychyshyn Has Become Internationally Known"]    [Text] Ukraine's People's Rukh [Movement for Perestroyka]  appealed to parliaments of several countries and to the human  rights organization "Amnesty International" with a request to  help in the search for the deputy chairman of Rukh and head of  its secretariat, Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, who disappeared without a  trace. One of the deputies of the Swedish parliament, Peter  Lyuksep, proposed that this affair be considered by the Swedish  Parliament and also turned to parliamentarians of other European  countries. The German Christian Democratic Union, the  Conservative Party of Great Britain, the Conservative Party of  Norway, the Liberal Party of Finland, and also the Human Rights  Democratic Institute in Warsaw have already shown interest in  the Boychyshyn affair. "Perhaps, the fact that Boychyshyn's  case is becoming increasingly known in the international arena  will compel law-enforcement bodies, which show total inactivity,  to do something," a hopeful Vyacheslav Chornovil said.</p>

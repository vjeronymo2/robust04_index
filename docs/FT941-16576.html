			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Paramount contest still open after cool reaction to Viacom The Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) takeover battle for Paramount Communications appeared wide open yesterday as Wall Street reacted unenthusiastically to a new offer from cable company Viacom and rival bidder QVC Network hinted it might cry foul over Viacom's behaviour. Viacom announced on Friday night that it had entered an Dollars 8.4bn merger agreement with video retailer Blockbuster Entertainment and, helped by Dollars 1.25bn of Blockbuster cash, was increasing its cash offer for 50.1 per cent of Paramount's stock. This went up from Dollars 85 a share to Dollars 105 a share, topping a Dollars 92 a share offer on the table from QVC. But at the same time, Viacom sharply reduced the value of the package of securities it is offering for the remaining 49.9 per cent of Paramount's stock. Based on Friday's stock market closing prices, traders reckon the securities are worth some Dollars 51 to Dollars 52 a share, compared with a package of QVC securities worth around Dollars 74 to Dollars 75. The total cash and stock value of the Viacom bid thus stands at around Dollars 78 a share, compared with QVC's Dollars 83 a share, and analysts said the Viacom offer could deteriorate further today if traders marked down its shares in reaction to Friday merger pact with Blockbuster, which came after the stock markets closed. The new Viacom offer, which will be considered by Paramount's board this week, came just hours before the Friday night close of QVC's latest tender for Paramount. The QVC camp indicated yesterday that its tender had failed to secure the 50.1 per cent it needed for victory. Officials blamed Viacom for submitting a last minute offer which, they argued, was not a bona fide bid higher than QVC's, and as such should not lead to a further round of bidding. QVC said on Friday night it believed 'the blended (cash and shares) value of the new Viacom offer will be less than Viacom's estimates and even less than Viacom's previous offer'. QVC officials hinted yesterday that the company would take strong action today - presumably of a legal nature - over the Viacom offer. It could try to depart from the takeover timetable, which calls for rival tender offers to close on the same date, and close its offer before Viacom's January 21 deadline. QVC has until the market opens this morning to say whether it is extending its bid. Viacom said yesterday that its revised offer complied with the agreed bidding procedures, which it claimed meant that QVC would be required to extend its tender offer until midnight, January 21. Viacom also claimed that its offer was superior to QVC's. It said its revised offer increased the cash consideration to Paramount shareholders by more than Dollars 1.1bn over its previous offer, and by more than Dollars 800m over QVC's currrent offer. Analysts said the five-month-old battle seemed to have a considerable way to run, with the potential both for fresh courtroom battles and new offers. Unlikely duo, Page 17</p>

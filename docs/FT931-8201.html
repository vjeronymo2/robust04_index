			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Blair urges 'moral' approach on crime SPEAKING out about moral values and principles is an important element in turning back the rising tide of crime, Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, said yesterday. Mr Blair said the community must rediscover a sense of direction and recognise that individuals had obligations towards others as well as rights. His speech marks a further step in his long-term approach of changing Labour's crime policy, and of moving away from old stereotypes of putting the emphasis on blaming society rather than the individuals. 'If we do not learn and then teach the value of what is right and what is wrong, then the result is simply moral chaos which engulfs us all,' he told Wellingborough Labour party. Mr Blair said that the 'historic problem of old socialism was the tendency to subsume the individual rights, duties and all, within the ideas of the 'public good', that at its worst came simply to mean the state'. The task, he added, was to rescue the idea of community from the narrow view of the state, and establish a new relationship between society and the individual. His approach will be carried a stage further on Monday when he will detail Labour's plans for dealing with juvenile crime. These are expected to include tougher powers for the courts and the provision of more secure accommodation, though not along the lines of the 'approved schools' suggested by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secre tary. Labour believes that the Conservatives' record on crime has become so tarnished that the party no longer commands the public confidence on law and order that it used to do.</p>

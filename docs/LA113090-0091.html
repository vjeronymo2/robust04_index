			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE JOB FREEZE SPARKS CRIME FEAR;  </P> <P> BUDGET: OFFICERS AND COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS WARN THAT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY MAY  INCREASE.  </P> <P> When Hubert Williams was police chief in Newark, N.J., during the early 1980s,  city officials imposed a hiring freeze, announced layoffs and eliminated almost  a third of his uniformed officers.  </P> <P> In retaliation, the police union picketed City Hall. Out-of-work officers  mounted a "Fear City" campaign and distributed bulletins warning visitors not  to shop in Newark lest they be robbed or mugged. Other officers stayed home  with the "blue flu." And the windows of 90 radio cars were shattered in the  police parking lot.  </P> <P> "That was pure unadulterated hell," the chief recalled.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, where a similar budget crisis is looming, Mayor Tom Bradley  this week ordered an emergency, seven-month hiring freeze -- in the midst of  one of the city's most violent years in history. The city may face a  $120-million budget deficit over the next 18 months if cost-cutting steps  aren't taken.  </P> <P> But his announcement drew immediate cries of doom of another kind. Some police  and community leaders Thursday warned that the city's crime rate might worsen  if the police drop their guard.  </P> <P> Some police officials predicted fewer officers on the beat, slower police  response times, less time for crime prevention work and sinking morale among  the LAPD's 8,400 sworn officers. Community activists also worried that the  hiring freeze would signal a field day for crooks, who already outnumber police  in parts of the inner city.  </P> <P> On Thursday, the day after the mayor ordered the halt on police hiring, City  Council member Joy Picus pledged to introduce a resolution to overturn the  freeze.  </P> <P> "I will not stand still and let the number of officers be reduced," she said at  a news conference on the lawn of the LAPD's patrol station in Reseda. "You  can't turn recruitment on and off like a switch and expect it to be  successful."  </P> <P> Police officials said they lose about 400 officers each year through attrition,  with most of those positions being filled by graduates from the Police Academy.  They said that the seven-month freeze would translate into a loss of about 200  officers and that some recruitment and academy personnel might have to be  reassigned.  </P> <P> But they also said that 300 recruits enrolled in the academy will graduate in  the months ahead. The real crunch, they said, won't come until late spring or  early summer.  </P> <P> Cmdr. William Booth, the department's chief spokesman, said there will be no  new classes started after December. He said the department is hoping that the  freeze is only temporary.  </P> <P> "If it goes very long, then we'll get into a hole that is very difficult to get  out of," he said.  </P> <P> A short-term freeze, on the other hand, might "turn out to be nothing more than  an uncomfortable hiccup," he said.  </P> <P> Chief Daryl F. Gates said the city's "roller coaster" style of management is to  blame for the budget crisis. He said that for years he has asked for a  contingency fee in his budget to pay for equipment and other costs but that  "that has gone on deaf ears."  </P> <P> Other police departments have been down this road.  </P> <P> In Houston, a cutback resulted in a 3% reduction in police salaries, he said.  In New York, he added, the mayor is requiring a 1% cut in salaries for all  police managers. He said New Orleans for a while put their police officers on a  reduced, four-day workweek.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, a panel of Washington civic leaders concluded that its Police  Department was poorly organized, with one out of five officers not working in  the field. The group, brushing away contentions that there is a link between  crime and police manpower, called for a 27% reduction in the Police  Department's 6,024 uniformed and civilian positions.  </P> <P> Their premise is not supported by all law enforcement experts. Many believe  that an increased police presence on the street goes a long way to stemming  crime.  </P> <P> "It's common sense that when you're speeding and you pass a cop, you slow  down," said Jerry Needles, director of police organizational services for the  International Assn. of Chiefs of Police in Washington.  </P> <P> "Or, if you're going to pull a burglary or rape somebody and you see a cop on  the block, what would you do? Well, you'd change your mind real fast. It's that  simple."  </P> <P> Police experts and citizen groups also worry about what effect the freeze will  have on crime prevention. They believe that successful programs like the DARE  drug education effort in the schools help reduce future crime rates.  </P> <P> Ralph Sutton, a spokesman for the Brotherhood Crusade in Los Angeles, said that  if police crime prevention suffers, community groups like his will have to step  in.  </P> <P> "It would signal an opportunity for us, at a time of adversity, to take control  of our situation and help the police, who would be undermanned to do their  job," he said. "We'll need more people in the community involved in sending  notices to the criminal element that we will drive them out."  </P></p>

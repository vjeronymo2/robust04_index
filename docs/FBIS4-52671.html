			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 11 (YONHAP) -- The International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will likely conduct additional  inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities at Yongbyon early  next week since Pyongyang has already accepted the UN nuclear  watchdog's request to send inspectors to complete checks at a  radiochemical laboratory in the complex.    North Korea's Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations, Kim  Chong-su, told YONHAP in a telephone interview Wednesday that  his country welcomed nuclear inspectors anytime.    He confirmed publicly for the first time that the North has  not gone ahead with refueling of the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor,  which it had earlier threatened to do without IAEA supervision  when the UN body demanded to take samples of spent fuel rods.    The IAEA director-general sent a telex to North Korean  Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam on Tuesday proposing to send an  inspection team to complete work at the nuclear reprocessiong  plant in Yongbyon that was blocked during its previous visit in  March.    The UN nuclear watchdog, however, made it clear that the  communist country should delay removal of fuel rods from the 5-  megawatt reactor until later this year.    Diplomatic sources in the U.S. capital said North Korea has  already prepared visas for the IAEA inspection team and  predicted that the inspectors would arrive in Pyongyang by this  weekend and begin their task early next week.    Kim, in the telephone interview, offered assurances that the  stalinist regime has not removed any spent fuel.    "We cannot delay removal of the spent fuel rods forever, for  the sake of our safety, and we have to change the fuel rods  because the situation is like a red light that is on in a car  signaling it is running out of oil," he said.    Now that North Korea and the IAEA have settled their row  over  changing the fuel rods, Washington is expected to schedule a  third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang after the  additional nuclear inspections are carried out.</p>

Recent revelations from Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, one of the  historical leaders of the revolutionary process, regarding  failed negotiations for the solution of the dispute, have  brought to the table this affair, which was broadly discussed by  local specialists over recent times.    The accusations that on 25 May 1978 then U.S. President  James  Carter leveled against Cuba for alleged participation in the  attack by Katanguese troops on the Province of Shaba in southern  Zaire, shattered the possible start in New York of the Cuba-U.S.  dialogue.    According to Rodriguez, he was to hold a secret meeting that  day with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to begin the search for  a solution to the crisis between the two governments, which at  that time was already two decades old.    "That battle -- he said -- ended with the clarification of  the truth: Cuba had not participated whatsoever in the  adventure (in that African country), but the opportunity to  start negotiations had passed."    Three lusters after the failed negotiation attempt, Rafael  Hernandez, head of the Inter-American Relations Department at  the nongovernmental American Studies Center (CEA), is one who  believes that the regional situation is very favorable for  normalization of the ties between Cuba and the United States.    The Latin American countries have gradually improved --  since  the beginning of the 70's -- their relations with the island,  the majority recognize Cuba's determination for national  independence and sovereignty and even advise that Washington's  policy hinders international free trade and is counterproductive  and harmful for the Cuban people, he says.    In his article "Learning From the Cold War: The U.S. Policy  Towards Cuba and Vietnam," which recently appeared in the  CUADERNOS DE NUESTRA AMERICA magazine, the analyst remembers  that even today Cuban exiles interfere in the adoption of a  rational policy by Washington toward Havana.    The most dramatic impact of a new U.S. policy toward Cuba  would be precisely on the conduct of the U.S.-Cuban community,  he warns.    In a panel discussion held in mid-December 1993, on the 15th  anniversary of the CEA, the investigator returned to the subject  and spoke about the possible solution of the conflict between  the two countries.    The analysis -- he said back then -- must start from two  basic premises: The impossibility of sidelining the  antagonistic interests and values that separate Cuba and the  United States (beyond the greater or lesser will for a  diplomatic arrangement) and the fact that the accounting of  costs and benefits in a general scenario of negotiation is not  to be reduced to something as simple as balancing a checkbook.    According to his criteria, the main cost Washington will  have  for mending its diplomatic agenda with Havana is dealing with  attitudes and predispositions established over three decades in  the security and foreign relations organizations and in Congress.    Also, [Washington] will have to recognize the Cuban  Government in fact and by law and return to Cuban sovereignty  the Guantanamo Naval Base, a naval and aerial resource in the  Caribbean it has held for almost a century.    However, he adds, that last action will allow an improvement  in the relations and an exploration of forms of constructive  coexistence between the armed forces of the two countries and  will ease -- in fact -- cooperation in topics such as the  struggle against drug trafficking, naval and aerial security,  among others.    Other benefits the White House could obtain at the  negotiating table are the awakening of a political basis of  interest groups -- especially economic -- which up to now do not  work as lobbies [previous word in English] due to the rigidity  of the U.S. policy toward the island.    Also, the total or partial lifting of the blockade will  benefit the U.S. private sector and eliminate a point of discord  with Latin America and several industrialized countries and a  tense topic in the deliberations of international organizations.    The solution of the conflict with the northern neighbor  means  for Cuba immediate benefits: The mere reduction of the  hostility favors its national interests, makes possible access  to new markets and the flow of capital, and broadens the surface  of bilateral contact.    However, rapprochement with the United States also has costs  for Cuba, says Hernandez.    In the first place, the rapprochement between the two  countries, although seen as necessary in purely economic terms,  may divide national consensus on the political and ideological  planes at a time when cohesion is of strategic importance.    Also, the presumed irruption of U.S. capital in the Cuban  economy -- amid a process of reforms -- could be  counterproductive.    That, without ruling out the possibility that Washington may  seek to influence the business community with regard to Cuba by  counseling or tutoring the monetary flow so as to favor  determined political processes.    In any event, the topic of U.S.-Cuban dialogue is currently  moving only in the field of speculation.    Cuba, recently said Foreign Minister Robaina, cannot decide  whether it will make changes in those ties, because its  definitions have already been established and it is Washington  who has to alter its policy.</p>

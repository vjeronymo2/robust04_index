			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Marines move into Mogadishu: UN aid worker wounded as US troops take control of Somali capital US MARINES in desert camouflage and black face paint stormed inland and took the war-ravaged Somali capital Mogadishu yesterday. By nightfall more than 1,300 Marines had been set down in the ruined capital by Hovercraft, amphibious and helicopter landings, and had secured the airport, port and the looted former US embassy compound. The swift operation, which marks the start of the biggest foreign military and humanitarian action ever taken in Africa, went off smoothly with only a few shots fired and no casualties. At the airport, Marines in armoured vehicles secured the control tower, establishing a 24-hour all-weather communications operation for the first time since civil war erupted two years ago. US Galaxy, Starlifter and Hercules military transport aircraft streamed in, closely followed by the first big relief flight for weeks. Shootings and extortion at the airport had led to the cancellation of flights. The day was marred, however, when a United Nations aid worker was shot and wounded on the airport road by gunmen. The UN immediately announced the suspension of relief flights. Mogadishu harbour, where aid workers had been beset by robbing and extorting gunmen, was also secured. Somalis, were stunned by the size and intensity of the US operation and the constant buzz of Cobra helicopter gunships above the devastated capital well into the night. Thousands of the city's residents spent all day perched on sand dunes and rooftops overlooking the port and airport. In the streets, they sang and clapped as they surrounded Marines out on patrol and tried to start conversations in broken English. 'We were the biggest show the folks here have ever seen,' said Col Fred Peck, the US Marine spokesman. 'We must have looked like Barnum and Bailey to them.' In a remarkably honest assessment of the damage inflicted on the country by the rival ambitions of warlords, Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed, the self-styled interim president who controls the north of the city, apologised to his ruined nation in a radio broadcast. 'Each day we should remind ourselves of the destruction we have made to our country to serve as a moral and guilty conscience and to warn ourselves to resolve our differences in negotiations rather than in killing ourselves.' A contingent of 180 French foreign legionnaires also landed in Mogadishu and said they would spend the next 10 days in the capital preparing for the arrival of a total of 2,100 French troops. In Kismayo, the vital southern port which has witnessed some of the worst violence, aid workers were forced to evacuate the city after a night of clan violence and an attack by gunmen on the Red Cross compound. In the next phase of the operation, the Marines will head for the town of Baidoa and secure the 10,000ft runway there to start flying in food. Marines make first easy inroads, Page 6</p>

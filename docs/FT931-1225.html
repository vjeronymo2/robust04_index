			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Avesta Sheffield sees better year after heavy loss AVESTA SHEFFIELD, the newly-formed Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer, should record 'substantially better' results this year after heavy losses in 1992, according to Mr Per Molin, the president and chief executive. The Stockholm-based company, which by some measures is Europe's largest stainless producer, was formed in November from a merger between Avesta of Sweden and British Steel Stainless. Last week, it announced a SKr564m (Dollars 73m) loss after financial items for 1992, and scrapped its dividend. Mr Molin said he could not be more specific about this year's performance because of uncertainties in the European market and the currency markets. But he outlined three points that gave him grounds for optimism; the devaluation of sterling and the Swedish krone had increased the company's earnings capability in several key markets; stainless steel consumption would grow by an average 4 to 6 per cent a year this decade; and the merger itself was turning out better than expected. The new company is hoping to increase its market share through offering a wider range of products, but has also moved quickly to gain production efficiencies. Two hot-rolled plate lines and a precision strip mill in Sheffield have been closed, and the production of cold-rolled plate has been redistributed between the UK and Sweden. But Mr Molin said it would take some time before decisions were taken on the company's four melting shops - two in each of its home countries. 'There is no doubt we will have to change that, but this does not mean that one or two will definitely close,' he said. 'We are analysing the alternative of producing steel for other companies.' Avesta Sheffield's largest melting shop, employing nearly 300, is in Sheffield, and is thought likely to be retained by the company. Its smaller Panteg plant in Wales produces continuously cast billets, and the other two melting shops are in Sweden. The changes are important if Avesta Sheffield is to achieve Mr Molin's forecast for this year. Stainless steel prices are rising, but European consumption of stainless is likely to be about the same as last year before resuming its relatively strong long-term growth later.</p>

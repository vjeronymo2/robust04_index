			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Spending on IT 'may be running out of control' telecommunications, computers and software - rose 9 per cent last year to about Pounds 4.5bn and may be running out of control, Price Waterhouse Management Consultants says today. Its annual IT Review, based on a survey of 1,000 executives in the private and public sectors, found that budgets had over-run for the third year in succession. The increase contrasts with a rise of just 1 per cent forecast by the same executives at the start of last year. It brings the spending increase over the last three years to nearly 50 per cent and underlines the difficulties of controlling costs. Salaries for IT staff rose an average 6 per cent last year - double the rate of inflation - and the average number of systems development staff rose by about 25 per cent, according to the review. Professor Kit Grindley, a Price Waterhouse consultant and professor of systems automation at the London School of Economics, said: 'The problem of how to make the computer work in the best interests of the company is no longer as important as how to make it work more cheaply. Unfortunately, this is a problem that British managers have yet to tackle effectively.' The review found that one of the main responses to past overspending - a move to 'open systems' or non-proprietary standards - had increased costs for most organisations. It also found wide variations in spending by different industries. Heading the list was the relatively recession-proof utilities sector, where spending rose 36 per cent last year as large projects ordered after privatisation reached their expensive final phases. In contrast, the struggling retail sector's spending rose just 0.5 per cent, which represents a cut in real terms. Next lowest was the manufacturing sector, where IT spending increased by 2 per cent. Overall, the review is forecasting an increase of only 0.2 per cent in IT spending this year. But it says this may also prove too conservative.</p>

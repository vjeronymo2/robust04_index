In the Seibersdorf  research center, in Lower Austria, UN personnel of the  Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will  be trained this year; the objective is that they can control  civilian chemical plants. The OPCW inspectors should be able to  find out whether chemical weapons are being or can be produced  in chemical plants. [passage omitted]</p>

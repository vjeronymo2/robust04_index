			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: ICI ousts Hoare Govett as broker in cost cutting move IMPERIAL Chemical Industries has ousted its stockbroker of more than 65 years, Hoare Govett, an established London firm with a reputation for representing blue chip clients. The company, which hived off its drugs arm earlier this year to create Zeneca, said the change of broker was the result of cost cutting following the split. 'We are a smaller company now and we have decided we should only have two brokers. We have worked extremely well with SG Warburg and BZW since the demerger and we have chosen them.' However, Hoare Govett, whose reputation lies largely with its extensive list of blue chip clients, is bitterly upset by the decision, particularly as it has recently been increasing its corporate list and ICI is one of its most established clients. Hoare had been ICI's leading broker for many years, but it was also broker for Hanson, the international conglomerate. When Hanson launched a dawn raid on ICI in 1991, buying 2.82 per cent of its shares, Hoare backed off and refused to represent either side. Subsequently, the firm, owned by Dutch bank ABN Amro, became the number three broker behind SG Warburg and BZW. Last year, Hoare made a forecast that ICI's profits would be well below the expectations of most market analysts and issued a sell recommendation. Mr Martin Evans, Hoare's chemicals analyst said 'It is very disappointing, given our previous loyalty to the company pre- and post-Hanson, and might reflect poor judgment at senior management level, given Hoare's long-established reputation in the City.' And a member of the group's corporate finance arm said: 'There was no doubt that, since the demerger, a rethink on the chemicals side might have been possible, but we have had a relationship with ICI since it was founded in 1926 so the news was obviously a surprise.'</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. DELAYS VAST OIL LEASES OFF ALASKA IN WAKE OF SPILL  </P> <P> In a notable retreat from plans for oil exploration in Alaska, the Department  of the Interior has decided to defer a proposed offshore lease sale there until  scientists can assess the long-term damage caused by this spring's oil spill in  Prince William Sound, Administration officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The postponement of drilling in the Gulf of Alaska and Cook Inlet, which were  tainted by oil from the catastrophic spill, marks the Bush Administration's  first significant decision on offshore drilling since the Exxon Valdez hit a  reef nearly two months ago.  </P> <P> The plan, approved late Tuesday by Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr.,  imposes a one-year delay on the scheduled lease of a vast 138-million-acre  package, postponing final action until August, 1991, to provide time for  scientists to gather more information about the effects of the oil spill on the  pristine marine environment.  </P> <P> A senior aide to Lujan emphasized that the decision on the Cook Inlet site "in  no way diminishes" the Administration's commitment to a separate plan for oil  exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. That proposal has been the  target of criticism from environmentalists since the Alaska spill.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Much to Learn'  </P> <P> But the aide, Steve Goldstein, said Lujan had decided that it "would not be  prudent to go forward with the new lease sale immediately after a major  accident. It is quite clear that we have much to learn from what happened.  </P> <P> "This should not be read as a cancellation," Goldstein said. "This is a  postponement to gather information while new facts are coming to light."  </P> <P> The surprise deferral of the Cook Inlet sale, from which the government had  expected to earn $10 million next year, sends a further signal of the  Administration's willingness to reconsider some long-term drilling plans  established by the Interior Department under former President Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> Among the proposed sales now being re-evaluated are vast areas off the coast of  Southern California and Northern California, which are being reviewed by a  presidential task force headed by Lujan.  </P> <P> "This is a very cautious Administration when it comes to offshore drilling,"  one Republican official said, "and this is just a further indication of that."  </P> <P> However, Administration officials have given no indication that drilling in  those regions would be canceled altogether. And they have expressed a  determination to proceed with other oil exploration in the Alaskan wildlife  refuge and in offshore tracts where drilling rights already have been leased to  oil companies.  </P> <P> Plans for oil exploration in one such already-leased area, Alaska's Bristol  Bay, have been the principal target of drilling opponents since the Valdez  spill. Administration officials said Tuesday that those plans would not be  affected by the decision on Cook Inlet, because Bristol Bay was not affected by  the spill.  </P> <P> Critics of offshore drilling praised the Administration action as a welcome  step. But many argued that the disastrous consequences of the spill already  have made cancellation of the new drilling plans imperative.  </P> <P> "This is the least they can do," said Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), warning  that the Administration and the oil industry might seek to resume "business as  usual once the political heat dies down."  </P> <P> Another drilling critic, Natural Resources Defense Council attorney Lisa Speer,  said that she could not understand why the Interior Department did not act to  postpone other Alaska leases as well until the environmental damage of the  spill can be determined.  </P> <P> "We've already seen the terrible damage that can be wrought by oil in Alaskan  environments," Speer said.  </P> <P> While the Cook Inlet lease sale now has been postponed until at least a year  from its scheduled date of August, 1990, the current Interior Department  schedule calls for at least five other new lease sales to take place next year.  </P> <P> They include two sales off Alaska, two in the Gulf of Mexico and one off North  Carolina and other Mid-Atlantic states. In addition, the lease sales off  Northern and Southern California could proceed if authorized by the  presidential task force.  </P> <P> The postponement of drilling in Alaska, scheduled to be announced by Lujan  today in San Francisco, covers an area known as Lease Sale 114. The majority of  the tract is in the Gulf of Alaska, where it ranges from three to 400 miles  from shore. A smaller portion is in the Cook Inlet, three to 38 miles from  shore.  </P></p>

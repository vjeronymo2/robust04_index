			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic  Liberal Party [DLP] urged the government Wednesday to forge an  independent nuclear policy, including re-examination of the  Joint Declaration on Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.    The appeal was contained in an announcement on the party's  basic position and policy on the North Korean nuclear dispute.  The DLP issued the statement after a meeting of party lawmakers  and local chapter chairmen in the morning.    It was the first time the ruling party has enunciated the  need to form an independent nuclear policy and reconsider the  denuclearization declaration.    Heated debate has occurred among segments in the ruling  party  and the Kim Yong-sam administration over whether South Korea  must take another look at the declaration as North Korea has  been systematically and impudently violating the declaration.    In a statement read by DLP spokesman Pak Pom-chin, the  ruling  party again urged Pyongyang to implement the inter-Korean  accords and the Denuclearization Declaration issued Dec. 31,  1991.    "North Korea should also stop developing nuclear weapons  immediately and in order to prove it, it should retract its  decision to withdraw from the International Atomic Energy  Agency," Pak said.    The DLP is urging North Korea to accept unconditional and  comprehensive IAEA inspections not only to maintain nuclear  transparency in the future but also to assist international  efforts to determine its nuclear activities in the past, the  spokesman said.    The DLP statement asked the international community to  cooperate in U.N. sanctions against North Korea aimed at  resolving the nuclear dispute. Addressing the Kim  administration, the statement said the government should prepare  thoroughly for the effective execution of sanctions within the  framework of international rules and the United Nations.    The party said the country ought to establish law and order  and tight national security by liquidating "left-leaning"  forces, including the radical student organization Hanchongnyon,  which are "openly and publicly supporting the North's  dictatorial regime under an anachronistic illusion and without  realizing the changes taking place worldwide."    In addition, the party expressed concern that if national  policy on the North Korean nuclear dispute is divided in a  crisis, it may induce a misjudgement on the part of the  Pyongyang regime.    All South Koreans should unite against the North's ambition  to conquer by force and communize the South, the statement said.    Earlier in the meeting, DLP leaders received reports from  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae  on the U.S.- drafted sanctions resolution and military  activities in the North.</p>

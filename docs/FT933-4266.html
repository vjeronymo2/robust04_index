			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Greek Coca-Cola bottler advances 18% HELLENIC Bottling Company, the Coca-Cola franchise-holder for Greece, Bulgaria and Northern Ireland, increased operating profits for the first half of 1993 by 18.1 per cent to Dr9.1bn (Dollars 39.6m). Turnover in the first half rose by 29.8 per cent to Dr54.7bn, partly due to the first-time consolidation of HBC's operation in Bulgaria, where it has invested almost Dollars 20m in five joint ventures with local soft drinks bottlers. The Bulgarian Coca-Cola bottling operation, launched at the end of last year, posted first-half profits of Dr260m on sales of Dr3.15bn. HBC's earnings from Bulgaria amounted to Dr120m, the company said. The company forecasts strong second-half growth in turnover in Bulgaria following the launch there of other soft drinks brands over the summer, together with the introduction of plastic bottles for Coca-Cola. HBC's recent acquisition of Pet, a Greek manufacturer of plastic packaging, which controls two local fruit-juice producers, will also help the company position itself for further expansion in Balkan markets. HBC also holds a 15 per cent stake in two joint ventures for bottling Coca-Cola in Romania. They were set up last year as part of an Dollars 18m investment by HBC's parent company, the Cyprus-based Leventis Group. Production started over the summer at two new plants in northern Romania, covering almost 30 per cent of the market. Leventis shares the Romanian Coca-Cola franchise with the Atlanta-based parent company and a Turkish-owned bottling group.</p>

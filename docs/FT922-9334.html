			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Observer: Biter bit A report from the Health Education Council due out on Sunday is likely to suggest that despite the UK government's implementation of an EC directive banning all TV tobacco advertising, the BBC is still providing lots of lovely free space for tobacco producers to splash themselves across. Just why is it that tobacco companies relish the chance to spend millions on sports sponsorship? Is it entirely unrelated to the fact that BBC cameras can hardly avoid spotlighting brand names placarded behind the snooker table, round the formula-one race's chicanes, and above the cricket umpire's elbow? The report will be featured on Sunday's Bite Back programme - in which BBC executives are put on the spot by reporters and members of the public. A golden opportunity, no less, for powers-that-Beeb to put their view across. But Jonathan Martin, BBC TV's head of sport, has declined. It will be entertaining to see who - if anyone - fills the seat; and how many teethmarks are incurred.</p>

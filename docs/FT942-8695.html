			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Observer: Berlusconi's own goal Win or lose, the footballers of Milan, Italy's league champions, have grown accustomed to the personal support of one Silvio Berlusconi, the club's owner and president. But last night even Berlusconi had to concede that there were more important places to be than Athens's Olympic stadium, where Milan and Barcelona were playing what had been billed as a 'dream final' of the European Cup. Instead, Italy's new premier was on the terraces of the upper house of the Italian parliament, egging on his government team to win a crucial vote of confidence. While the media magnate has publicly pledged not to give up the reins of the club, there are already calls for him to distance himself from his favourite toy. But it will be a brave adviser who suggests, say, that he become honorary president. Berlusconi may have lost interest in the running of his Fininvest empire since entering politics, but his devotion to the soccer club is said still to border on the religious.</p>

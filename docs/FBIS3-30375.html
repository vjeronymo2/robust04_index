			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Trebinje, 1 Feb (TANJUG) -- The Russian people have  chosen a new political course in both domestic and foreign  policy, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia, stressed in Trebinje this evening.  Zhirinovskiy was greeted by around 10,000 citizens of Trebinje  and neighboring municipalities in eastern Herzegovina who  gathered around Ducic's monument in Freedom Square.    Zhirinovskiy stressed that the Russian people had suffered a  lot of hardships in the past years, but that the Serb people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina were exposed to greater hardships.    "This is the war which has been waged against the Slavs for  more than a century. I represent a country which has for years  defended the Orthodox world from barbarians," Zhirinovskiy said.    According to him, the enemies of the Slav cause and the  Orthodox world are now looking for a different weapon to use  "against us." That weapon is religion, because the Catholics  from Rome and the Muslims from the south are trying to destroy  the Slav world, Zhirinovskiy believes.    "You are standing at the very border of our Slav world,"  Zhirinovskiy said, recalling that there are no enemies in the  north, east, and west, but, he said, the last enemy remains in  the south [sentence as received].    "You Serbs are in a difficult position, you have been  encircled from all sides, but they forgot that you and we are  one people and that there are 300 million of us," Zhirinovskiy  said to tumultuous applause.    "If they created a community of nations in the west, we have  to create another alliance with you, Serbs -- a Slav alliance in  the east. Then peace and democracy will be everywhere and there  will be no states to impose their will on us. Our East Europe  is spiritually richer than the West, and if we take into account  military issues, the Russian military factor is the strongest in  the world," Zhirinovskiy stressed.    "You received moral support from us. But if it becomes  necessary we will send you thousands of volunteers. If that  proves insufficient, new weapons will come from us. We will  throw our enemy into the sea," Zhirinovskiy said.    "We have to tell our enemies that the time has come to stop  mistreating the Slavs. The time has come for the borders of the  Slav-Christian world to be made secure. I am not threatening  anyone, but let the Vatican know that the borders of the  Catholic Church influence end in Italy," Zhirinovskiy said.</p>

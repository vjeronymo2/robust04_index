			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Japanese 'refuse to sell advanced chips to US': Trade friction may escalate JAPANESE companies are routinely withholding their most advanced semiconductor production equipment from US chip makers as part of a strategy to dominate the world semiconductor market, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, alleged yesterday. Citing evidence gathered in a General Accounting Office investigation, the Texas Democrat said many Japanese suppliers did not make their latest semiconductor manufacturing equipment available to US industry. The allegations could escalate trade friction between the US and Japan at a time when the two countries are in the midst of negotiating a new trade agreement on semiconductors. The agreement is expected to incorporate an undertaking by Japan to increase purchases of foreign-made semiconductor devices. Talks are due to resume week this in Washington. Senator Bentsen's allegations could lead to a new trade complaint against Japan. A spokesman for Mr Bentsen said, however, that he would take no further action on the issue until the GAO had completed its investigations. Ten years ago, US companies dominated the world market for semiconductor production equipment. Today, Japanese companies lead in several critical segments of the market. In microlithography (the process by which miniature circuit patterns are imprinted on silicon chips), for example, the Japanese share of the world market has risen from 39 per cent in 1984 to 74 per cent in 1989, according to a Commerce Department report published this month. In the same period the US market share fell from 60 per cent to 15 per cent. Mr Bentsen was speaking during a visit to Sematech, the government funded US industry consortium in Austin, Texas. He revealed several specific instances in which Japanese companies are alleged to have deliberately withheld their products from US companies. Nikon , the leading supplier of microlithography equipment to the semiconductor industry, had limited sales of its most advanced equipment to Japanese buyers, Senator Bentsen said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another commenter correctly pointed out that the preamble of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim rule was incorrect in stating that current regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that social security numbers must be verified prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifying any applicant household for benefits. Current rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at &sect;273.2(f)(1)(v) state that the State agency shall not delay the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification for or issuance of benefits to an otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible household solely to verify the social security number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (SSN) of a household member.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same commenter correctly identified an inconsistency in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim regulation language at 7 CFR 273.2(f)(8)(i)(A) with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to the requirement for verification where the source of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household's income has changed. The first sentence of that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section correctly states that ``the State agency shall verify a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change in income or actual expenses if the source has changed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the amount has changed by more than $25.'' The final sentence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inadvertently omits the requirement for verification anytime the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source of income changes, even if the amount has changed by $25  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or less. The same inconsistency exists at 7 CFR 273.2(f)(8)(ii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final action amends 7 CFR 273.2(f)(8)(i)(A) and (ii) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correct the inconsistencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter criticized the interim rule's interpretation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 311(D) of Public Law 100&hyph;435. Section 311(D) provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a State agency may not deny any application for participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solely because of the failure of a person outside of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household to cooperate with a request for providing verification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This provision would not apply when the person refusing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperate would otherwise be a household member but for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation of any of the individual disqualification provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsections (b), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of section 6 of the Food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stamp Act. These subsections require disqualification for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person intentionally making a false or misleading statement or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committing any act which violates the Food Stamp Act (section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6(b)); any non-exempt person who is physically and mentally fit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and is between the ages of 16 and 60 who refuses to register to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work (section 6(d)); any person who is a student enrolled at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least half-time in an institution of higher education (section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6(e)); any person who is not a resident of the United States, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not either a citizen or a lawful alien (section 6(f)); and any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual who receives SSI benefits in a ``cash-out'' State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (section 6(g)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When amending 7 CFR 273.2(d)(1) to incorporate the mandate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 311(D) of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the Department added two more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories to the list of persons outside the household who cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the denial of an application for participation if they fail to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperate with a request for providing verification. These two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new categories were: Individuals disqualified for failure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide an SSN, and persons who fail to attest to their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citizenship or alien status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter who criticized this provision felt that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department had exceeded its authority in excluding two new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories of non-household members from the third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verification rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters correctly point out that the Department has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broadened the third party verification rule to include two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional categories of persons who will cause the denial of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application to participate if they failed to cooperate with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request to provide verification. This was done to make this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision consistent with other provisions in the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where ineligible or disqualified persons are, in effect, deemed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by program regulations to be a household member for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining eligibility and benefit levels. FNS believes this is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate as it is consistent with the desire to simplify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program requirements that was expressed by Congress in adopting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Hunger Prevention Act (See, e.g., Senate Report No. 100&hyph;397,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> p.25).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim rule also amended verification standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households subject to monthly reporting and retrospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> budgeting (MRRB) at 7 CFR 273.21(i) (1) and (3). Those provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not being finalized in this final rule, however, because they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been superseded by amendments made in the final rule on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monthly Reporting and Retrospective Budgeting Amendments and Mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changes, published on December 4, 1991, at 56 FR 63597.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individuals with questions about verification standards for MRRB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households should refer to this December 4, 1991 final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

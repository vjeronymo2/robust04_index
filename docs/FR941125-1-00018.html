			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the USEPA notes that, with respect to Jersey County, no additional RACM controls beyond the RACT rules already covered in the SIP are necessary upon redesignation to attainment. The April 16, 1992, General Preamble to the Implementation of Title I (57 FR 13560) explains that section 172(c)(1) requires the plans for all nonattainment areas to provide for the implementation of RACM as expeditiously as practicable. The USEPA interprets this requirement to impose a duty on all nonattainment areas to consider all available control measures and to adopt and implement such measures as are reasonably available for implementation in the area's attainment demonstration. Because attainment has been reached in Jersey County, no additional measures are needed to provide for attainment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Section 172(c)(2) requires the SIP to provide for Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) towards attainment of the NAAQS. This requirement only has relevance during the time it takes the area to attain the NAAQS. Because Jersey County has already attained the NAAQS, the SIP has already achieved the necessary RFP towards attainment of the NAAQS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Section 172(c)(3) requires the SIP to contain a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of the relevant pollutants. The State of Illinois has developed and submitted the required emissions inventory for Jersey County. This emissions inventory has been the subject of separate review and rulemaking by the USEPA. The approval of the emissions inventory is expected to be (and must be) finalized before the USEPA takes action to approve in final the redesignation of Jersey County to attainment for ozone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Section 172(c)(4) requires the SIP to identify and quantify the emissions which will be allowed to result from the construction of major new or modified stationary sources in the ozone nonattainment areas. Although the USEPA has not approved Illinois' NSR regulations, it should be noted that once an area is redesignated to attainment, nonattainment NSR requirements are not generally applicable. The redesignated area becomes subject to PSD requirements instead of the NSR requirements. The USEPA has promulgated acceptable PSD regulations for Illinois and has delegated the implementation of these regulations to the State. It should be noted, however, that until the USEPA officially redesignates Jersey County to attainment for ozone, sources seeking permits for major modifications or major source construction must be addressed through a new source review acceptable to the USEPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Section 172(c)(7) requires the SIP to meet the applicable provisions of section 110(a)(2). As noted above, the USEPA believes that the Illinois SIP meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Section 172(c)(9) requires the SIP to contain contingency measures to be undertaken if an area fails to make RFP or fails to attain the NAAQS. Since Jersey County has attained the NAAQS, the section 172(c)(9) contingency measure requirements are not applicable unless the redesignation request and maintenance plan are not fully approved. It should be noted that section 175A contingency measures apply to areas that are redesignated to attainment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B.2.b. Other Part D Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Below is a summary of Illinois' compliance with the part D requirements for marginal ozone nonattainment areas, such as Jersey County.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Submittal of a Comprehensive Base Year Emissions Inventory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 182(a)(1) of the Act requires the State to submit a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of ozone precursors. As noted above, Illinois has submitted a final, adopted 1990 base year emissions inventory and associated documentation for Jersey County. This emissions inventory is being reviewed in a separate rulemaking action. A Technical Support Document (TSD) recommending approval of this emissions inventory has been prepared to support a direct final rulemaking on this emissions inventory. This emissions inventory must be approved in final rulemaking before the USEPA can approve the redesignation of Jersey County in final rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emission Statement SIP Revision.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 182(a)(3)(B) of the Act requires the State to submit a SIP revision to require stationary sources of VOC or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to annually submit statements of emissions from the sources. Illinois has submitted this SIP revision. A final USEPA rulemaking approving this SIP revision was published on September 9, 1993 (58 FR 47379).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> New Source Review Regulations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 182(a)(2)(C) of the Act requires the State to submit a SIP revision to: (a) require source permits in accordance with sections 172(c)(5) and 173 of the Act for the construction and operation of each new or modified major source (with respect to the emissions of ozone precursors); and (b) correct requirements in the existing SIP concerning permit programs as were required under section 172(b)(6) of the pre-1990 Act to comply with regulations promulgated by the USEPA prior to the 1990 amendment of the Act. Illinois has submitted a SIP revision request to comply with the requirements of section 182(a)(2)(C). The USEPA has reviewed this SIP revision request and has proposed to approve it (September 23, 1994, 59 FR 48839). Although the USEPA has not taken final rulemaking Action on this SIP revision, it should be noted that the USEPA does not consider compliance with these requirements to be a prerequisite to the redesignation or an area to attainment of the ozone NAAQS. The USEPA believes that the applicability of the part C PSD program to maintenance areas makes it unnecessary to require that an area have obtained full approval of NSR regulations required by part D of the Act in order to be redesignated. The USEPA believes that this interpretation of the Act is appropriate notwithstanding the requirement in section 175A(d) that the contingency provisions of a maintenance plan include a commitment on the part of the State to implement all measures to control the relevant air pollutant that were contained in the SIP prior to redesignation. The term ``measure'' is not defined in section 175A(d) and it appears that Congress utilized the terms ``measure'' or ``control measure'' differently in different provisions of the Act that concern the PSD and NSR permitting programs. Compare section 110(a)(2) (A) and (C) with section 161. In light of this ambiguity in the use of the term ``measure,'' USEPA believes that the term ``measure'' as used in section 175A(d) may be interpreted so as not to include NSR permitting programs. That this is an appropriate interpretation is further supported by USEPA's historical practice, dating before the amended Act, of not requiring redesignating areas to demonstrate through modeling or to otherwise justify replacing the nonattainment area NSR program with the PSD program once the areas were redesignated. Rather, the USEPA has historically allowed the NSR programs to be automatically replaced by the PSD programs upon redesignation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> RACT corrections.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 182(a)(2)(A) of the Act requires the State to correct deficiencies in the State's RACT regulations noted by the USEPA prior to the amended Act. The State notes that no deficiencies were noted for the RACT regulations applicable to Jersey County. Therefore, RACT corrections are not an issue for the Jersey County redesignation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

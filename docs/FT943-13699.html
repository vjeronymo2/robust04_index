			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Linotype-Hell cuts deficit to DM57m in first half Correction (published 20th July 1994) appended to this article. Linotype-Hell, the German printing machinery manufacturer, said its net loss in the first six months narrowed to less than a quarter of the DM57m (Dollars 35.6m) loss a year earlier, AFX reports from Eschborn. The group said the result was in line with its aim of breaking even in the full year. Sales in the six months were on target while new orders exceeded expectations. Linotype-Hell said more precise data on the company's first-half performance would be published in August. The next six months should see further improvement, the group said. The planned break-even in 1994 would be achieved on a 'slight sales growth compared with last year', the company added. The restructuring, initiated in 1993, was largely responsible for the narrower net loss in the first six months. In this period, Linotype-Hell's US operations saw the strongest improvement in earnings to post a net profit after a 'significant loss' a year earlier, the company said. The company reported a 1993 net loss of DM153.4m after a net profit of DM32.1m in 1992. CORRECTION Linotype-Hell, the German printing machinery manufacturer, reduced its net loss in the first six months of the year to less than a quarter of the DM57m (Dollars 35.6m) loss in the previous corresponding period. This was incorrectly reported in a headline in yesterday's FT.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Six-month profit at RWE slips as rights issue looms NET PROFITS at RWE, one of Germany's largest industrial groups, slipped fractionally during the six months to December, the first half of the Essen-based group's current financial year. Excluding minority interests, net profits fell to DM395m (Dollars 241m) from DM398m a year earlier, while turnover rose by 2.5 per cent to DM26.7bn from DM26bn. RWE is planning to hold its long-awaited rights issue next month. Last year it won approval for shareholders to increase its share capital by as many as 6.2m new shares. Analysts expect the company to raise between DM1.6bn and DM1.7bn from the issue. The group said that despite the downturn in the German economy, it was confident that in the year to the end of June it would be able at least to hold sales and profits at the same level as in 1991-1992. Energy, construction and related businesses continued to do well, RWE said. Combined with cost-cutting and other rationalisation measures in other sectors such as printing equipment and oil, the group is hopeful that it will be able to maintain its dividend at the same level as last year - DM12 per share. This will be payable on the new shares issued in next month's rights issue. In energy production, turnover in the first half of the year was stable at DM9.2bn, while in oil and chemicals turnover dropped 7 per cent to DM10.3bn. RWE was at the centre of controversy in December when shareholders voted to retain an antiquated voting rights structure giving local authorities in the Ruhr area 60 per cent of the votes although they own only 30 per cent of the shares. Calpers, the large US investor, said at the meeting that it was naive of RWE to retain voting rights restrictions while expecting to enjoy continued access to international markets. Although the vast majority of independent shareholders voted to remove the special voting rights, the local authorities blocked the initiative.</p>

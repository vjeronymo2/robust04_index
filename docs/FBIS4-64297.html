			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime  minister, has declared that both the people in the south and in  the north will suffer if the Cyprus problem is not solved.  Addressing the 35th Congress of the Turkish Cypriot Engineers  and Architects Chambers Union, Ozgur described the Cyprus  problem as a curse for the whole of Cyprus and said that we must  be rid of it.    Pointing out that he regards the UN umbrella as the only  alternative, Ozgur remarked, however, that the United Nations  does have its weak points, which must be criticized. He said:  But, we do not have another alternative. Notwithstanding its  good and bad points, the United Nations is the only organization  that can attempt to protect peace. This is the reality and we  must be aware of it.    Ozgur also noted that it is wrong to continuously display  the  attitude that the world does not understand us and that the  world has been deceived. If the world fails to understand us,  then we must seek the reasons for this, Ozgur stated, adding:  We must be coolheaded, well-intentioned, and constructive if we  are to explain our problems to the world.    Recounting that the talks concerning the confidence-building  measures followed a positive course until the last day and the  Turkish Cypriot side displayed a flexible and constructive  approach, Ozgur announced that the talks broke off when Joe  Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in  Cyprus, insisted on discussing how the Greek Cypriots will  access Maras [Varosha] from the south of Magosa [Famagusta].  Ozgur expressed the belief that the wrong method can be  rectified and the talks could resume. He said that his party  joined the coalition on the basis of the principle that efforts  should be exerted to achieve a federal solution within the  framework of the 1977 and 1979 summit agreements, rather than on  the basis of the argument that a nonsolution is also a solution.  The government is conducting its work within this framework,  Ozgur added. [passage omitted]</p>

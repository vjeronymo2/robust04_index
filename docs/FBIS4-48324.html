			<p>BFN     [Text] A fight broke out this morning between two factions  of Radio Pretoria supporters over the resumption of broadcasts.  The station has been closed after a prohibition on further  transmissions by the Supreme Court. Rev. Mossie van den Berg,  chairman of the Executive Committee, had recommended that the  station should wait on a final decision from the Independent  Broadcasting Authority regarding the issue of a license to the  station.    According to the station's spokesperson, Commandant Piet le  Roux, Rev. van der Berg this morning addressed supporters, and  Mr. Manie Maritz, a prominent right-winger, asked to express his  views. He asked that a new Executive Committee be elected. A  fight broke out. According to Commandant le Roux, the conflict  began when Rev. van der Berg instructed that the station be  closed down. The opposing faction is now threatening to resume  transmissions next week.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Indonesia quake kills over 1,000 AT least 1,200 died at the weekend when an earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale struck the island of Flores in eastern Indonesia. Local government officials have appealed for emergency food and medical supplies amid reports that thousands have been made homeless. The earthquake, which occurred at midday local time on Saturday, had its epicentre 30km north of Flores, creating a tidal wave reportedly 80 feet high. The wave devastated the coastal town of Maumere, killing more than 1,000 people and badly damaging at least a third of its buildings. The town has a population of 70,000, and local government officials say the death toll there is certain to rise as rescue work continues. Two ships carrying emergency supplies have already been sent from the neighbouring island of Timor, but the port and airport at Maumere were reportedly damaged by the earthquake, and this is hampering relief efforts. With the rainy season at its height, officials are concerned that disease may spread rapidly. The full extent of the disaster may take several days to emerge as relief teams struggle to visit the plethora of smaller islands nearby. Flores, with a 1.5m population, lies at the meeting point of two continental shelves, as do many of Indonesia's 13,000 islands, and has a turbulent volcanic past. It has more than a dozen active volcanoes. In recent years, the island has become popular with tourists, largely because of its rugged volcanic landscape and crater lakes. There were no reports of foreigners being killed, although Maumere is a main port of entry for travellers visiting Flores. The earthquake is certain to revive environmentalists' opposition to plans to construct a dozen nuclear power stations on the main island of Java, which lies on the same geographical fault line as Flores.</p>

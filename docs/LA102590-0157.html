			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUNSET FOR HUNTINGTON PIER;  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT: PASSAGE OF THE DECAYING 76-YEAR-OLD LANDMARK AND LOCAL  ATTRACTION BEGINS TODAY WITH A FINAL SALUTE AND THE CEREMONIAL START OF ITS  DEMOLITION.  </P> <P> Old age has been unkind to it.  </P> <P> The once proud monarch of the town -- the Huntington Beach Pier -- now has a  decayed and scabrous look. Bits of concrete fall off from time to time.  Railings have not been repainted since the pier was closed two years ago for  safety reasons.  </P> <P> This morning, the final destruction of the 76-year-old structure begins, but  not before the city offers a "farewell salute to the old pier." A ceremonial  bit of demolition will take place, with the major work to start Monday.  </P> <P> Today's event is somewhat like an Irish wake, a gathering to cheer up the  bereaved at the time of passing. The old pier is going to a resting place deep  in the ocean; a new $11.9-million pier is coming, with construction to start in  January.  </P> <P> But even in its dying days, the old pier still dominates this bustling, rapidly  changing community. Its image is everywhere: on drawings, paintings, T-shirts,  business windows, sides of trucks and city publications. Most of all, though,  the old pier is ingrained in the memories of Huntington Beach residents.  </P> <P> Mayor Thomas J. Mays, 36, recalls surfing at the pier in his teen-age years.  </P> <P> "I also remember fishing on the pier," Mays said. "It's meant a lot to me. It  means a lot to other people who have been around here for a long time. It's  going to be a real emotional experience when they start taking it down."  </P> <P> Councilman John Erskine, who also surfs, said the pier is the essence of  Huntington Beach. "Huntington Beach without its pier is like Paris without its  Eiffel Tower," Erskine says.  </P> <P> Indeed, the history of the pier is intertwined with the history of Huntington  Beach. Barbara Milcovich, archivist for the Huntington Beach Historical  Society, says that the first pier -- a wooden structure about 1,000 feet long  -- was built in 1904, the same year that a land company changed the name of the  village of Pacific City to Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> That land firm, the Huntington Beach Co., had big hopes for selling residential  lots. So the company put up the money for that wooden pier, envisioning it as a  scenic attraction for potential land purchasers, she said.  </P> <P> The wooden pier perished in a 1910 storm, Milcovich said. Undaunted, the  village leaders launched plans for a new, stronger pier, and voters approved a  $70,000 bond issue in 1912 to fund the project.  </P> <P> Milcovich said the concrete structure, completed in 1914, originally spanned  1,320 feet. It was extended 500 feet in 1930, when residents approved another  bond issue for $190,000. The older portion of the existing pier thus dates back  76 years, and the newer section is 60 years old.  </P> <P> The 1914 pier had some intricate concrete work, including pilings and graceful  arches. But time and tides have sapped the strength of those underpinnings, and  in recent months steel mesh has been placed around the piling to shore up the  decaying pier.  </P> <P> Winter storms in January, 1988, sealed the fate of the aging structure. Raging  ocean waters washed away about 250 feet from the end of the pier and carried  off the pier's aptly named End Cafe. The cafe and the end of the pier had been  rebuilt just three years before, after 1983 storms had demolished the original  restaurant.  </P> <P> Milcovich notes that the ocean end of the pier served as a military post during  World War II. Machine gun emplacements installed there at the time were part of  California's defense against a possible Japanese attack.  </P> <P> After the war, the pier and the city blossomed. The post-World War II boom in  Southern California brought thousands of new residents to Huntington Beach.  Surfing became a national phenomenon in the 1960s, and Huntington Beach's pier  drew surfers from near and far.  </P> <P> "People all over the world heard the Beach Boys sing about surfing," Mays said.  "Huntington Beach became known as Surf City. Surfers loved to come to this  pier."  </P> <P> Dawn Huseman, a Huntington Beach resident, is typical of those grieving the  passage of the old pier.  </P> <P> "This pier has many memories for me and my family," she said on a visit to the  structure. "My three sons have all surfed here. I'm here today to say goodby to  this old pier."  </P> <P> In much the same fashion as Huseman, scores of residents are expected for the  11:30 a.m. ceremony at Pacific Coast Highway and Main Street to bid farewell to  the 1914 pier.  </P> <P> "We can take consolation in the fact that a beautiful new pier will soon be  built," Mays said.  </P> <P> But Milcovich added wistfully: "When this old pier is gone, then the old city  of Huntington Beach is gone. We're literally losing our tie to the past."  </P> <P> Pierside DECISION  </P> <P> Voters may decide fate of proposed restaurant complex. B3  </P></p>

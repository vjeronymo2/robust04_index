			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Sentiment subdued as Frankfurt holds A NUMBER of bourses extended Monday's gains, but sentiment was subdued, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT stopped reflecting Russian tensions, and blue chips followed the futures market as the DAX index closed just 1.43 higher at 1,913.61. Turnover rose from DM5.9bn to DM7.2bn. Mannesmann's rights issue left it DM7 lower at DM309.80 but Ms Barbara Altmann, of B Metzler in Frankfurt, said that the funding had been expected for some time. Lower down the size scale, Linotype, the printing equipment manufacturer, hit another new low, a drop of DM9.80 to DM320.20 leaving it down DM44.80, or 12.3 per cent over the past three days, and 38 per cent down on its high for this year after a domestic newspaper report said that it was closing one of its manufacturing facilities. PARIS saw another modest gain in the absence of major corporate news. The CAC-40 index ended up 11.36 at 2,119.97. Generale des Eaux lost FFr31 to FFr2,630 after denying reports in a local newspaper that it might have been planning to raise up to FFr6bn of new capital with a convertible issue. However, the shares closed off the day's low of FFr2,592. Lyonnaise-Dumez added FFr8 to FFr540 following an upgrade by James Capel. Recommending the stock as a long-term buy the broker commented that the measures carried out by the utility during the second half of 1992 would appear to be 'proving sufficient to provide the group with the financial base needed to guarantee a durable recovery in profits'. ZURICH again found 2,500 on the SMI index too great a hurdle and prices turned back, leaving the SMI index 4.1 lower at 2,478.3. Recently firm chemicals were led lower by Roche certificates, down SFr50 to SFr5,315. Swissair shed SFr30 to SFr665 for a two day decline of 7.9 per cent amid reports of earnings downgrades by some analysts after last week's first half figures. Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Swiss Volksbank noted that the resignation of Mr Jan Carlzon from SAS to concentrate on the Alcazar alliance with KLM, Swissair and Austrian Airlines had suggested to investors that the project could be more difficult to implement than expected. AMSTERDAM lost a small early gain to end unchanged, the CBS Tendency index closing at 124.3. ABN-Amro lost 30 cents to Fl 62.40, adding to a fall of 10 cents on Monday. Merrill Lynch has recently upgraded the bank to a buy following recent interim figures. The broker commented that strategic developments over the last 12 months, centred on growth by incremental acquisition, 'illustrate an increasingly clear-headed approach'. MADRID extended its rally in rising volume, the general index putting on another 1.80 to 286.77 as turnover rose from Pta13bn to around Pta18.3bn. Mr Christopher Cooper said that the Opec agreement was good for oil prices and Repsol, up another Pta60 to Pta3,725 for a two-day gain of Pta120. BRUSSELS saw a fall of 3.6 per cent in Arbed, the Luxembourg steel maker, after it forecast a full year loss of some BFr5.5bn. However, volume in the stock was very low as it shed BFr130 to BFr3,450. The Bel-20 index rose 6.04 to 1,288.01. MILAN blue chips reversed early gains as the market grew increasingly nervous about results from Fiat, due late in the day, but the Comit index, reflecting average prices throughout the session, added 9.40 or 1.6 per cent to 602.72. Fiat began confidently, rising to a high of L6,225 before rumours that it planned a two-for-three rights issue at L2,000 a share began to be heard, reviving longstanding fears. The shares finished L98 lower at L5,926. Rinascente was suspended pending an announcement, prompting speculation that Fiat might be planning to sell part or all of the retailer. Ifil, the holding company seen as a possible buyer, fell L154 or 2.4 per cent to L6,242. ISTANBUL soared 2.5 per cent, breaking into record territory for the fourth day in succession. The composite index closed up 391.2 at 15,777.2 in turnover of TL2,169bn, also an all time high. DUBLIN extended its recovery in volume considerably higher than its recently low level, the ISEQ overall index closing 18.30 higher at 1,686.17. Mr Adrian O'Carroll, at Dillon Read, said that the market had been pushed into a correction by the CRH rights issue this month, which led to profit-taking, and that CRH and financials were mainly responsible for yesterday's gains.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- September 28                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 Open       11.30      12.00      13.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1299.51     1297.32    1296.11    1293.90                             1293.28     1291.01    1291.08    1288.96  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                14.00       15.00      16.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1368.33     1366.84    1366.11    1364.97                             1364.73     1363.00    1362.16    1364.11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Sep 27    Sep 24    Sep 23    Sep 22    Sep 21  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1290.59   1274.95   1273.84   1271.99   1279.55 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1361.41   1346.86   1347.03   1346.05   1351.37  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1299.51; 200 - 1368.99 Low/day: 100 - 1288.96 200 - 1361.13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

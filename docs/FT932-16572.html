			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / UK Gilts: Investor enthusiasm helps prolong rally THE gilt rally continued as the market absorbed nearly Pounds 4bn of bonds but still ended slightly higher on the week. Investors responded enthusiastically to the Bank of England's biggest gilt auction, in which Pounds 3bn of 20-year bonds were sold, and also snapped up Pounds 600m of 10-year stock. A further Pounds 650m tranche of gilts is going on sale from today. The market took heart from the lack of evidence that inflationary pressures were increasing. That fits in with the generally bullish environment for government bonds in many other important markets. Another positive indicator was signs of a faint recovery in the UK economy, which may reduce the pressures on the public sector borrowing requirement, widely reckoned to reach Pounds 50bn in the 1993-94 financial year. On the week, gilts at around 20-year maturities gained about half a point for a yield decrease of 10 basis points to about 8.2 per cent. Yields at the 10-year mark barely changed on the week, and were quoted on Friday night at 7.7 per cent. The reason for keen interest in gilts - demand for stock at the auction was roughly twice the amount on offer - is not difficult to explain. Inflationary expectations in the UK, as measured by the yields on index-linked gilts, are that over the next few years inflation will be kept down to relatively low figures of around 4 per cent. With 10-year gilt yields at their current level, the real yield on offer to investors is a reasonably healthy 3 per cent to 4 per cent. The inflation arithmetic appears to be tempting many overseas investors into the gilt market on the grounds that the yields on offer for UK bonds are starting to look enticing compared with those on rival types of government securities. In Germany, for instance, 10-year government bonds currently offer yields of around 6.7 per cent. But with inflation appearing to many observers likely to stay at around 3 to 4 per cent for some time, the anticipated real yield on these bonds does not look particularly attractive. Mr Stephen Lewis, of the London Bond Broking Company, believes that the UK's large current account deficit will be crucial in ensuring that UK inflationary pressures stay muted for the foreseeable future. According to Mr Lewis, any effort by the government to expand the economy - perhaps if it becomes especially worried by further rises in unemployment - would push the deficit still higher than the Pounds 17.5bn expected by the Treasury this year. The difficulties of financing this deficit would cause a run on sterling, which in turn would force the Treasury to tighten interest rates. Over the next few months, however, fragile signs of recovery may become deeper rooted. Anecdotal evidence from various industries increasingly suggests that demand is picking up. A new indication may come today with the expected news that growth in M0, the narrow measure of the money supply which mainly comprises notes and coins in circulation, was around 5 per cent in the year to last month, well above the top level of the Treasury's 'monitoring range' of between zero and 4 per cent. Further signs that increased spending by consumers may also come with today's figures on the amount of new consumer business in February. This is expected to show a slight Pounds 100m increase. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, told a House of Commons select committee of MPs last week that he thought the recession was probably over - a development that many in the gilt market would welcome, on the grounds that the gap between state spending and revenues could be expected to start falling from 1994-95 onwards.</p>

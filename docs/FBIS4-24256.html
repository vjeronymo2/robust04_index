			<p>BFN     [Text] South Africa nuclear scientists are apparently  gaining notoriety amongst the world's intelligence communities.  The National Intelligence Service [NIS] director, Mr. Mike  Louw, says spies are streaming into the country to try and track  these scientists down. They are also checking on South Africa's  capacity to produce dangerous weapons. He was speaking before  the joint standing committee on finance in what has been  described as a symbol of the new openness on the workings of  South Africa's civil intelligence agency. Mr. Louw admitted  openly that the NIS had spied on many of the community's members  in the past. He also said that once the United States had  closed 13 of its CIA missions in Africa, South Africa would  probably conduct the work of these missions.</p>

General Aidid's chief financier Osman Hassan Ali `Ato' arrived  in Nairobi aboard a charter plane from Mogadishu with his former  co-detainees Mohamed Hassan Awale, the warlord's advisor on  international affairs, and Omar Salad Elmi, his former  representative in Addis Ababa.    Aidid, who has been in Nairobi since UN-sponsored peace  talks  collapsed in December, met President Daniel arap Moi in the  western Kenyan town of Nakuru on Tuesday morning, Kenyan  officials said. "We're preparing for further consultations with  other factions since Addis was a failure," Aidid's spokesman in  Kenya, Abdullatif Afdub, told AFP.    A key Aidid ally, warlord Omar Jays, was also expected to  arrive here on Tuesday from Addis Ababa later Tuesday, Somali  sources said. Abdullatif was unable to confirm reports from  Somali sources that Aidid's enemy, self-styled interim President  Ali Mahdi Mohamed, was also coming to Nairobi, possibly for  Kenyan-mediated peace talks.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Esselte back in the black ESSELTE, the Swedish office equipment group, returned to profit in the first eight months, as tighter cost control more than offset the impact of depressed markets. The group reported income after financial items of SKr81m (Dollars 14m), compared with a SKr117m loss a year ago. Sales fell 14 per cent to SKr8.64bn, although in underlying terms the drop was just 6 per cent.</p>

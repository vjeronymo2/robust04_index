			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / US Secretary of State Baker in Southern Republics US Secretary of State James Baker today embarks on an extensive tour of the politically sensitive southern republics of the former Soviet Union. The tour will include Moslem republics which Washington fears could fall under the sway of militant Islamic forces. Mr Baker will visit six newly independent states and the formerly closed Russian city of Chelyabinsk. Armenia, Azerbaijan and Moldova have been added to an itinerary that previously included only Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. In Chelyabinsk, a centre of the secretive Soviet atomic weapons complex, Mr Baker is to meet Russian nuclear scientists, whom Western leaders fear may be seduced to work for anti-Western states.</p>

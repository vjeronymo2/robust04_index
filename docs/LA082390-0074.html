In reality  it offers simple tastes with minimal spicing and easy preparation. The entrees  themselves, which are not necessarily colorful, can be attractive when  embellished with exotic fruits and flowers. Here are two dishes chosen from a  selection of favorite foods sent in by Janet Martin, who was born and raised in  Hilo, Hawaii.  </P> <P> NORI CHICKEN  </P> <P> 2 1/2 pounds chicken thighs  </P> <P> 1/4 cup cornstarch  </P> <P> 3/4 cup sweet rice flour  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 to 2 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 1/4 cup finely chopped green onions  </P> <P> 2 eggs, lightly beaten  </P> <P> 1/3 cup soy sauce  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon hot bean paste  </P> <P> Oil for deep-frying  </P> <P> 1 (.28-ounce) package nori (seasoned roasted seaweed) strips  </P> <P> Dipping Sauce, optional  </P> <P> Bone and skin chicken thighs.

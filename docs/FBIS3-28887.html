On 11  February 1979, the Iranian people, who desired a new life, rose  up in all out resistance against monarchism and overturned the  dictatorial emperor regime. This was a momentous event in the  history of the Iranian people.    Iran is situated between the Persian Gulf and the Caspian  sea  on the Asian continent. The victory of the revolution in Iran  ended the monarchical politics that had imposed feudal  oppression upon the people, thus laying a foundation for  constructing an independent new society.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has declared: Since the  victory of the revolution, the Iranian people have bravely  overcome various difficulties and tribulations, consolidated the  achievements of the Islamic revolution, actively struggled to  defend peace and security in the Persian Gulf area.    The 15 years that the Iranian people have traversed since  the  victory of the revolution have been years of struggle to brave  all difficulties and tribulations, defend the achievements of  the revolution, and promote the independent development of the  country.    During this period, the Iranian people have effected a  success in bravely smashing the moves of intervention and  destruction by the imperialists and reactionaries, removing the  old remnants of the monarchical era, and struggling for social  progress and development.    Today, the Iranian people have put great efforts into  achieving national political stability and economic  self-reliance. They have paid deep attention to developing  industrial development.    A large amount of underground resources, including crude  oil,  natural gas, ores, coal, and chrome, is buried in this country.  Extraction of crude oil has been the base of the Iranian  economy. Natural gas and crude oil account for approximately 80  percent of this country's income and approximately 90 percent of  the acquisition of foreign currency.    In addition, Iran has put efforts to develop light industry,  including the textile and foodstuff industries. Wheat farming  is a major agricultural crop in Iran. Iran grows barley, rice,  millet, and cotton.    The Iranian Government has externally participated in the  nonaligned movement and has maintained the principle for  nonintervention in internal affairs. The Iranian Government has  developed relations with other countries based on the principle  of mutual respect in international relations    Our people have rejoiced over the Iranian people's success  in  the construction of a new society -- like our own success.  Korea and Iran are Asian countries together and members of the  nonaligned movement.    The friendly relations between our people and the Iranian  people have been favorably and have been developing daily.  Visits by each country's delegations have been frequent and  cooperation and exchanges have been developing in various fields.    The Iranian people have highly appraised the success that  our  people, upholding the great leader, have effected in socialist  construction under the wise leadership of the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il. The Iranian people have positively  supported the peace-loving proposals and lines of our party and  the Republic Government for the independent and peaceful  reunification of the country.    Developing friendly relations between our two countries is  beneficial to the interests of the two countries' people, a new  Asian construction, and strengthening and developing the  nonaligned movement.    As in the past, our people will value the friendly and  cooperative relations with the Iranian people for the sake of  independence, peace, and friendship and will actively make  efforts to strengthen and develop cooperative relations.    Our people hope that the Iranian people will achieve greater  success in the work to construct an independent and an advanced  Iran.</p>

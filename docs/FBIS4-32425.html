			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vaclav Lavicka: "Hungarian Businessmen Would </F> Very Much Like To Expand Their Marketing Possibilities, Even in  the Czech Republic"]    [Text] Between 24 and 29 May, more than 30 firms from  the northern Hungarian region of Nograd will introduce  themselves at Prague's U Hybernu Palace. The project is  supported by the Budapest Ministry for Foreign Economic  Contacts.    Recently, Hungary has been attempting to revive commercial  flow among Central European countries and, of course, to find  new markets. The fact that Hungarian manufacturers have  something to offer could be verified by several Czech  journalists in recent days. Their journey led them not to  Budapest but, rather, to northern Hungarian rural areas,  specifically to the region of Nograd, which borders the Slovak  Republic.    The region, with its 230,000 inhabitants, is one of the  smallest in the Hungarian Republic. Its center is at  Salgotarjan, which has a population of approximately 50,000. "We  are greatly interested in having Hungarian and Czech businessmen  get to know each other better and establishing mutually  beneficial contacts. That is why we have decided to introduce  our region, our firms, and their products in Prague," stated  Ferenc Korill, chairman of the General Assembly for the region  of Nograd, during a news conference.    Neither he nor any other officials from the region and  representatives of local firms there, who met with Czech  journalists, made a secret of the fact that the economy of the  region is currently wasting away. The extraction of brown coal  has been halted, and metallurgy and steelmaking (which was, at  one time, the backbone of the regional economy) are in deep  crisis because they were oriented toward a single principal  market. Unemployment in the region affects more than 20 percent  of all jobs (the national average is 12.2 percent).    Agriculture in the region has outstanding natural  conditions,  primarily for the raising of fruit, vegetables, and potatoes.  Other developmental opportunities are provided by the riches of  the forests, and there are even possibilities for tourism. But,  much as is the case elsewhere, there is a lack of investments,  not only for modernizing production, but also for investments in  the weak infrastructure (the highway network, communications,  sources of potable water, the ecology).    "Foreign investors are not exactly rushing into the crisis  regions in Hungary. I would say that their interests end at the  Danube River--in other words, primarily in western Hungary,"  noted F. Korill. In his estimation, the region receives about 1  percent of all foreign investments placed in Hungary (toward the  end of 1992, the region received 4 billion forints).    Prague will be visited from the Nograd region not only by  firms that have already traded with Czech partners, but also by  those who have thus far "cultivated" no foreign contacts. Of  course, the region also has firms (which have been fully or  partially privatized) that already have the worst behind  them--some have even highly successfully penetrated into western  markets. They would very much like to try it in the Czech  Republic.    The presentation by Hungarian firms from the region that is  economically wasting away but that has not resigned itself to  this fate enjoys official support: The Budapest Ministry for  Foreign Economic Contacts has allocated 7.5 million forints for  this purpose.    Let us add that, in the Prague U Hybernu Palace and the  Hungarian Cultural Center in Prague, not only will firms and  their products be introduced, but also folk art from the region,  its rich history, and examples of its contemporary social life.</p>

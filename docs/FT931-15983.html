			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / International Company News: The enfant terrible of Swiss banking - Rainer Gut, the man who has taken Credit Suisse to the top MR Rainer Gut, the 61-year-old chairman of the banking group built around Credit Suisse, has lost none of his taste for a challenge. CS Holding's decision this week to acquire the flagging Swiss Volksbank, a mainly domestic retail bank with too many branches and bad customers, shows that Mr Gut is also still capable of generating a big surprise. Until now, he has been known mainly for his determined and remarkably successful drive to make the Credit Suisse group a major international financial force, with particular emphasis on the hitherto high-flying investment banking business. By contrast, Switzerland, Mr Gut seems to feel, has become a rather lacklustre financial centre. 'Today we could not irritate anybody,' he said recently, recalling the late 1960s when the gnomes of Zurich dominated foreign exchange markets and could even rattle British chancellors. The other two big Swiss banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation, were much slower in recognising the limited potential at home and the need to look abroad for growth, but they have gradually followed Mr Gut's lead. Mr Gut's views on banking were formed mainly in New York, where UBS sent him as a young representative in the late 1950s. He honed his understanding of US investment banking during a four-year stint at Lazard Freres and looks back on its legendary innovative former chairman, Mr Andre Meyer, as an inspiration. He moved to Credit Suisse's US subsidiary in 1971 and two years later joined the executive board in Zurich where he was instrumental in setting up a joint venture to exploit the fledgling Eurobond market in London with the New York investment bankers White Weld. Then, when White Weld was taken over by another US firm, he put together what would become a famous partnership with First Boston. Within a short time, and with Mr Gut's aggressive backing, Credit Suisse First Boston became the top London Eurobond house, a position it has held more or less steadily ever since. Mr Gut likes to say that he would rather be lucky than smart, and he has often been blessed with good fortune. No more so than in 1977 when the bank became engulfed in what became known as the Chiasso scandal. To this day, CS has not revealed exactly how many millions of francs it lost as a result of sums creamed from customer accounts at its Chiasso branch in southern Switzerland and hidden in Liechtenstein. But Mr Gut was one of the few on the executive committee whose hands were indisputably not dirty. Although the bank is traditionally the preserve of the Zurich protestant establishment and the Swiss corporate elite, Mr Gut, a Catholic from Zug, became executive board spokesman in 1977 and chief executive in 1982. He has totally dominated the group ever since. The driving vision of his stewardship has been, and remains, that a bank with aspirations to being globally active must be strong in both investment and commercial banking. But the two banking cultures are so different that they should be kept in strictly separate organisations. The vision was given concrete form in 1989 when Mr Gut created a holding structure under CS Holding for the various activities grouped around Credit Suisse. The move was hugely expensive, both in terms of taxes on the securities transfers involved and as a result of the Swiss Federal Banking Commission's insistence that Credit Suisse itself continue to have sufficient capital to back all the group's subsidiaries. And for once, Mr Gut's timing was off. Just as the deal was being completed, the bottom fell out of the US leveraged buyout and junk bond jamboree, leaving First Boston stuck with a huge pile of dodgy bridging loans. Mr Gut gritted his teeth and bailed out his New York friends, taking full control of First Boston in the process. But ever since, the CS group has appeared to be scrambling for capital. The acquisition of Volksbank at a substantial discount to book value is, some think, aimed partly at boosting the group's capital base, although Mr Gut denies it. Typically, the First Boston setback did not slow him down. He was the first of the big three Swiss banks to see the potential of the swaps and options business and daringly poached a team of specialists from Bankers Trust in London in 1991 to launch Credit Suisse Financial Products, now one of the top players in this trendy sector. All of this activity was, of course, happening outside Switzerland, and it looked for a long time as if Mr Gut was content to leave the bank in Zurich to the Swiss army colonels who had always run it. But in late 1990 CS pounced on Bank Leu, the country's fifth largest bank, then mired in a dispute over a merger plan with another bank, and now Volksbank, a SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.1bn) takeover that will catapult CS over the head of UBS to become the country's largest banking group. While the takeover has been greeted sceptically in many quarters, not least because of the large amount of rationalisation that needs to be done to eliminate duplication between the two banks, Mr Gut is unrepentant. He was right in moving boldly into investment banking in the 1970s, and he believes that retail banking is going to be a good place for an efficient operator in the more austere economic environment of the late 1990s. He points to Citicorp in the US, which has been saved by its strengths in retail banking. Moreover, ever the good investment banker, he is delighted to have bought at what looks like the bottom of the market.</p>

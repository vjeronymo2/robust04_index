			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Exchange may ease rules on Lloyd's The Stock Exchange might soon relax its rules governing the listing of new Lloyd's investment vehicles, according to professionals at the insurance market. The change would make it possible for Lloyd's managing agents to obtain a stock market listing for 'dedicated' funds, which would supply capital exclusively to their own syndicates. Lloyd's raised about Pounds 800m in capital last year from corporate investors for the first time in its 300-year history. But at present all corporate investment funds listed on the exchange are categorised as investment trusts and do not need to show a three-year trading record. Market sources suggest that the exchange is prepared to allow an immediate listing for a dedicated vehicle if its syndicates have a three-year trading record and the last three years' accounts have been signed off. A financier in a corporate capital scheme said: 'There would appear to be light at the end of the tunnel. There would appear to be an accommodation.' Relaxation would be unlikely to trigger a surge of interest from investors. Many Lloyd's investment trusts are trading at a discount to their net asset value. But institutional investors in particular are unenthusiastic about the market's prospects. The market is widely expected to make a profit of about Pounds 800m to Pounds 1bn for the 1993 underwriting year, the results for which will be reported in 1996, bringing it into the black for the first time since 1987. The chief executive of one agency, who has given up plans to raise dedicated funds, said: 'We'd quite like a lot more capital but they are not queueing up.' Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, said last month that the market could raise between Pounds 125m and Pounds 250m in corporate capital for the 1995 underwriting year.</p>

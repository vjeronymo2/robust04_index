Miller, president and chief operating officer, in a statement.  </P> <P> In mid-February, Wang's bank debt totaled $308 million, spokesman Ed Pignone  said. On Feb. 26, the company agreed to sell its international lease financing  operations. This sale will reduce bank debt to $93 million, Pignone said.  </P></p>

To  earnestly implement the guidelines laid down by the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the State  Commission for Restructuring the Economic System has decided to  coordinate with related departments to select about 100 pilot  state-owned enterprises to carry out experiments in establishing  a modern enterprise system.    A modern enterprise system is one which reflects the  socialized mass production and meets the requirements of the  market economy. Its rights and responsibilities are clearly  defined. The enterprise management is separated from government  administration and carried out scientifically. By establishing a  modern enterprise system, state-owned enterprises must  fundamentally change their operation mechanism and genuinely  become independent legal entities and main bodies in market  competition. The establishment of the modern enterprise system  shows that China's enterprise reform has entered a new stage of  focusing on creating a new enterprise system from the stage of  attaching importance to the policy of delegating more  decision-making power to the lower-level units and letting them  have more profits. To establish a modern enterprise system, we  must proceed from the state of affairs in China, sum up our  experience in successfully reforming our enterprises, and  actively learn from the scientific approach of the enterprise  system of the Western developed countries in forming the  enterprise system with Chinese characteristics.    It is reported that the pilot enterprises will be selected  from the large enterprises in various areas under the relevant  departments of the State Council. Headed by unified leading  groups these enterprises should have steadily scored outstanding  achievements in management for three or more years and  demonstrated high awareness in reforming themselves. Some of  them will be industrial enterprises, while others commercial  establishments. Still others will be enterprises in the field of  science and high technology. Therefore, they will be large in  number but they will cover all fields of work.    Their major tasks are to straighten out relationship between  ownership and management of state-owned enterprises, set up a  system of properties for enterprises who are legal entities,  separate administrative and economic management functions of the  enterprise and government, establish a diversified form of  organization for enterprises to keep pace with the development  of the productive forces, foster a scientific internal  management system, implement a new accounting system, and so on.  On the basis of their different characteristics, the pilot  enterprises will formulate their own experimental plans to carry  out all reform projects gradually and in a planned manner.    To carry out experiments in establishing the new modern  enterprise system, we must not only solve problems in going  through the transition period from the stage of the existing  enterprise system to the new enterprise system, but also  exercise the macro-control of the state well so that the reform  projects in controlling state-owned properties and others will  keep pace with other programs for enterprise reform. Thus, in  carrying out experiments in selected enterprises, we must  strengthen our leadership, do a good job in coordinating and  organizing all pilot enterprises, work out our plans carefully,  and give the enterprises the proper guidance. We must not only  carry out reform and create the new, but also boldly carry out  our experiments energetically, steadily, and reliably and in  strict accordance with the standard. The State Commission for  Restructuring the Economic System will convene a national  conference on the work of restructuring the economic system in  early December to work out concrete plans for carrying out the  aforementioned experiments in selected enterprises.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Brussels probes aid to refinery The European Commission yesterday opened an investigation into a DM497.2m (Pounds 189.7m) state aid package granted to Leuna, the east German-based petrochemical manufacturer, by the Treuhand privatisation agency. The inquiry is a further blow to plans to rebuild the Leuna refinery complex, based in Sachsen-Anhalt. Last week, Elf Aquitaine, the oil group and France's largest company, said it wanted to reduce its stake in Leuna from 65 per cent to 35 per cent. The Commission said yesterday it was opening a preliminary inquiry on the grounds that the aid package amounted to subsidies for modernisation and operating costs, and could upset the market. However, it agreed to allow continued financing of Leuna for six months in order to avoid the risk of bankruptcy. Leuna is undergoing an ambitious restructuring plan which has seen its workforce drop from more than 25,000 workers to 7,800 over 12 months. The German authorities argued that the state aid package was vital for the future of an interlinked east German chemical industry, including a feedstock supplier and ethylene cracker for Leuna's down-stream production. But the Commission noted that no such plan had been presented to Brussels. It has invited all interested parties to present more detailed arguments before taking a final decision. Meanwhile it sanctioned a DM30m guarantee for clean-up funds. Elf's plans to reduce its stake have drawn threats of penalties for breach of contract from the Treuhand. The remaining stake is held by Thyssen Handelsunion, which, along with Elf, agreed to invest DM4.8bn to safeguard 1,000 jobs.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RTD UNION TO APPEAL FOOTHILL ZONE RULING  </P> <P> The president of the 5,000-member union representing the Southern California  Rapid Transit District drivers said the union will appeal last week's court  decision allowing the Foothill Transit Zone to compete in the San Gabriel  Valley.  </P> <P> Foothill Transit, a partnership between 20 cities and the county, contracts  with private bus companies to provide service. Unions representing RTD drivers  and mechanics challenged the transit zone's creation, arguing that it  threatened union jobs and was an illegal breakup of the RTD.  </P> <P> Foothill was approved by the county Transportation Commission, which oversees  county transportation policy, in late 1987 as a low-cost alternative to the  RTD. Since December, it has operated express routes from Diamond Bar and  Glendora to downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Last week, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Eli Chernow upheld Foothill  Transit's continued operation, which includes taking over up to 20 of the RTD's  San Gabriel Valley lines by mid-1990.  </P></p>

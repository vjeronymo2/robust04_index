			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Employers of 25 or more employees who lease parking spaces  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for their employees may not offer free parking unless they offer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees the option of retaining the parking or accepting a cash  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowance equal to the market cost of the parking space. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cash allowance will be considered taxable income, but under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current law, up to $60 per month of the cash may be taken in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form of a transit pass, which would be tax-exempt. Those who opt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the parking space will be unaffected by the change. Whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the employee decides to take the free parking or the cash  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowance, the company can still deduct the cost from corporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income tax. Research indicates that such a program may reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single occupant commuting by 20 percent in densely developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas where most employer-provided parking is through leased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spaces. The improvement which is achieved will also assist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employers in complying with the ECO programs in each of the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Special Issues for Mobile Sources. (a) Inspection and Maintenance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While stricter standards act to ensure that new vehicles are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaner than were their predecessors, there has been no guarantee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these vehicles would ``stay clean'' in actual use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically, tampering, lack of proper maintenance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maladjustment, and control equipment failures have meant that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cars on the road would emit on average 3 to 4 times more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollutants than the levels for which their control systems were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified. The evolution of vehicles to fuel injection and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closed-loop computer control along with the reduction in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> availability of leaded fuel have significantly reduced the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that owners tamper with or maladjust their vehicle emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control systems. Simply, the cost advantage of using leaded fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has disappeared, and vehicle performance has become so closely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tied with having all systems operating as designed that it is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer widely perceived to be beneficial to remove or render  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inoperative any of the various vehicle systems. Malfunctions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the engine and emission control systems can still occur, however.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Periodic vehicle emissions inspection and maintenance (I/M)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs are designed to identify and repair these malfunctions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this reason, I/M plays an important role in the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as the FIP areas which are classified as serious or worse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ozone nonattainment to implement enhanced I/M programs. Up to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this time, the State of California has not enacted an enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I/M program which meets the requirements of the national I/M rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which was published in 1992. A recently signed law in California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retains the current Smog Check network of licensed inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> garages in slightly altered form. The national enhanced  <!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline --> I/M  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations require that inspection and repair functions be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted separately to avoid conflict of interest and improper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing unless there are other features which provide sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions to meet the enhanced I/M performance standard. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the State are currently discussing a program design which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would meet the enhanced I/M performance standard, but which would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also preserve as much business as possible for the currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensed inspection stations. This program has not yet achieved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consensus among all parties and is not represented by specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legislation or as a SIP revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FIP I/M design must also deal with the further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constraints that are imposed on EPA, namely that it cannot order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State to implement any of the FIP's required programs, nor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can it add to its own appropriation in order to staff the various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. That means that EPA must design programs which require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the minimum level of oversight and administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing an enhanced I/M program which follows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closely the model program which sets the performance standard for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all I/M programs nationwide. EPA would implement the program in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FIP areas through legal agreements between EPA and a private  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firm or firms which would provide testing services to California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motorists. The firm(s) would be authorized to charge a specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fee for the test; EPA's oversight costs would have to be absorbed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

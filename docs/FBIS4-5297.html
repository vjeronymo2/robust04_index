			<p>BFN     [Text] Electric power companies will increase their  procurement of foreign-made products in fiscal year 1994 in  consideration of criticism from the U.S. Trade Representative  (USTR). Because most companies are cutting their investment in  equipment, the ratio of foreign-made products will drastically  increase this fiscal year.    The Tokyo Electric Power Company is planning to spend 59  billion yen to purchase foreign-made goods, and this amount is  almost 200 percent higher than that spent on this sector in  1993. Also, the Chubu Electric Power Company, which spent 20.9  billion yen in purchasing foreign-made equipment in 1993,  intends to spend an additional 5-10 billion yen on equipment in  1994. These decisions are partly because of the companies'  intention to cooperate in easing trade frictions, but their  primary objective is to lower investment costs through  purchasing cost-effective foreign products.    Last February, the Tokyo Electric Power Company invited  foreign companies to place bids to supply a generating turbine  for the Yukawa hydraulic power plant (in Nagano Prefecture).  The company intends to increase its purchases of larger  general-purpose equipment from foreign companies. Moreover, the  core parts of nuclear reactors and gas turbine generators -- for  constructing the No. 6 and 7 reactors of the Kashiwazaki-Kariba  nuclear power plant (in Niigata Prefecture) and the No. 7 and 8  generators of the Yokohama thermal power plant--will be  imported. The parts will be purchased from the United States  because General Electric (GE) possesses advanced technology in  these fields.    The Chubu Electric Power Company will also purchase GE-made  gas turbine generators for the No. 3 generator of the Kawagoe  thermal power plant. Other electric power companies intend to  increase their imports of general-purpose goods such as optical  fiber cables, transformers, and power-transmission wires because  these products are expensive in Japan.</p>

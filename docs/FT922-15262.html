			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Petrocon appeal to Panel over James Wilkes bid PETROCON and its advisers, Robert Fleming, are to appeal to the full Takeover Panel to try to reverse what is increasingly looking like a thwarted bid for fellow engineering company, James Wilkes. The Panel's executive earlier yesterday rejected Fleming's contention that NM Rothschild, Wilkes advisers, had given a few crucial shareholders material additional information that was not made available to the market as a whole. The panel executive ruled that the offer, which closed on Monday, should not be extended and that it would have lapsed but for Petrocon's appeal to the full Panel which will be heard on Friday. Petrocon is understood to be angry that a few shareholders, including Baring Brothers and Edinburgh Fund Managers, were given assurances that two Wilkes directors, who helped support Mr Stephen Hinchliffe, the discredited former chairman, would play reduced roles in Wilkes in the future. In an all-paper bid battle that has revolved around the question of which management team is best equipped to turn Wilkes around, Petrocon is thought to believe such assurances were material to the bid. As one observer said 'to lose one director during a bid is unfortunate; to lose two would have been viewed as careless.' The departure of Mr Hinchliffe, who resigned as chairman after the Pounds 35m bid was launched, appears to have assuaged a number of institutional shareholders' concerns about Wilkes's future. Last Friday, Edinburgh Fund Managers decided not to back Petrocon with its 8 per cent stake in Wilkes even though it had given written assurances that it earlier been among institutions that wrote to say they would support the bid.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Economists warn on skills training The British government should take steps in the Budget to encourage skills training if the UK manufacturing revival is to be sustained. Economists from Lloyds Bank argue, in their latest monthly bulletin, that low skills levels are 'probably the single greatest threat to the improved condition of UK manufacturing.' UK manufacturing output has been rising for over two years, and is now growing at close to 4 per cent per year. The bulletin says this reflects the changing nature of the economic recovery, with investments and exports providing more impetus for growth. It predicts that manufacturing output as a whole should accelerate into 1995. The Lloyds Bank economists, Mr Sheldon Warton-Woods and Mr Patrick Moon, cite these growth rates as evidence that the long-term decline in UK manufacturing has bottomed out. The past 25 years have seen manufacturing's share of UK GDP decline from around one-third to close to one-fifth.</p>

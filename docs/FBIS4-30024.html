			<p>BFN     [Text] Support from all resources in the country including  public cooperation is required to cope with possible acts of  international terrorism, National Security Council [NSC] chief  Charan Kunlawanit said yesterday.    The NSC chief made the statement at a seminar on "Policy and  Guidelines on International Terrorism" which was jointly  organised by the NSC and the Interior Ministry.    The seminar at Government House was attended by about 450  senior government offices, provincial governors and high-level  authorities concerned with international terrorism.    Gen Charan said that since 1972 there have been eight  incidents regarded as acts of international terrorism, the last  being the huge water-tank bomb containing C-4 plastic explosives  found in a truck in front of Lumphini police station in March  this year.    Most of the events involved the hijacking of aircraft. In  these events, Thailand had never been a party in the conflict,  he said.    For example, the water-tank bomb was aimed at an embassy by  terrorists from another country who chose to use Thailand as the  venue for their activities, he added.    Gen Charan said that Thailand, as a member of the  International Terrorism Suppression Organisation, has exchanged  information and intelligence on activities and identities of  blacklisted international terrorists.    The NSC itself has coordinated with the National  Intelligence  Agency and Police Department on this matter but people in  general are usually unaware of such activities, he said.    Gen Charan said Thailand has a policy of not wanting to see  any terrorist activities in the country. If an event of this  nature takes place, Thailand would solve the problem in a way it  can to maintain the country's interests.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Simferopol, 20 January -- The Crimean Supreme  Council Presidium has appealed to the peninsula's population in  connection with the Day of the Republic of the Crimea. It is  said in the appeal, in particular, that in the time that has  passed (since gaining autonomy) the course taken toward the  Crimea gradually attaining statehood has proved to be right.  "With the interests of all the peoples populating the Crimea  taken into consideration, a possibility for the Crimea to become  a bridge uniting Russia and Ukraine, with and peace and civic  accord on the peninsula preserved and not undermined, the will  of the Crimeans, has been realized. Recreating the republic,  adopting its own constitution, delimiting powers between itself  and Ukraine, and signing economic agreements are all difficult  but necessary means of creating preconditions for the Crimea to  be economically independent. The elections of the president and  Supreme Council of the Crimea will complete this rather short  but important stage in the history of the Crimea. The future  destiny of the republic is in the hands of the Crimeans  themselves," the statement notes.</p>

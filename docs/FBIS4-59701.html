			<p>BFN     [Text] The security forces are investigating the incident  in which 19 Arab residents and three border policemen were  injured in Hebron this afternoon. The incident started when  Jewish residents were walking through Policeman's Square in town  and came under a hail of rocks. They shot at the stone  throwers, wounding nine Arabs. IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  patrols that arrived at the site were also pelted with rocks.  They were forced to shoot in an attempt to disperse the stone  throwers, and apparently wounded 10 residents. The IDF detained  two yeshiva students from the region for questioning about the  shooting. The city of Hebron was declared closed military zone.</p>

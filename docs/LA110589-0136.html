			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER RESIGNS  </P> <P> After more than 10 years with the city, the assistant city manager and  community resources director of Hermosa Beach has announced she is looking for  a new job and will resign in January to "look for bigger and better things."  </P> <P> Alana Mastrian-Handman, 44, who had complained in May that doing both jobs was  too stressful, cited personal reasons for the resignation. She added that news  reports linking her decision to a recently discovered fee-collection error were  inaccurate. The resignation, she said, had absolutely nothing to do with the  error, which she made in 1987 while she was filling in as city manager.  </P> <P> The mistake was a failure to have the city collect a $200 increase in fees  assessed to movie companies filming in the city. The error cost the city about  $10,000 and wasn't caught until last month. Although City Manager Kevin  Northcraft called it "unfortunate, but not earth shattering," it was seized  upon as an issue in the current City Council election campaign.  </P> <P> "I've been thinking about this for the last six months. I've been here 10  years, and I was getting tired of the routine," she said. "I was putting in 12  to 14 hours a day on average, and then I got married a year and a half ago, and  I decided I had to start balancing things out."  </P></p>

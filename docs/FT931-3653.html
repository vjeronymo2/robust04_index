			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Leaked report embarrasses Heseltine MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, trade and industry secretary, yesterday found himself trying to contain the political fall-out from a leaked report written by his department that shows a depressing outlook for manufacturing industry. The confidential report, prepared as a background paper for Mr Heseltine by the DTI's industrial competitiveness unit, was leaked to The Sunday Times newspaper. The report underlines the structural problems faced by industry and the uphill struggle needed to bring about an export-led recovery. The paper concludes that UK industry is beset by weak management and products and underinvestment in new technology. Mr Heseltine, speaking on BBC radio yesterday, appeared to play down the accuracy of the report while at the same time confirming its authenticity and partially agreeing with some of its conclusions. 'Of course it is a leak and it gives a very superficial impression,' he said. Mr Heseltine defended the government's record over the past 10 years in the creation of small businesses, privatisation and industrial relations. But asked whether he agreed with the report's main findings that Britain's product base was weak and deteriorating and that any adjustment would take many years, Mr Heseltine said: 'I do accept that.' He added: 'This is a long-term process and this is what makes it so difficult in PR terms.' Earlier Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, called on the government to publish the leaked report in full. He told the party's Scottish conference: 'There are now only 4.5m people working in manufacturing industry in Britain. If present trends continue this government will achieve a new economic first . . . we will have fewer people at work making things than we will have really out of work making nothing.' During his interview Mr Heseltine would not be drawn on whether the government would publish the full report. He said: 'If we feel there is a case for making aspects of it available we will. But we are not simply prepared to provide a propaganda exercise for our international competitors to pick up bits and pieces and say 'look, the British themselves feel this is not their strongest point'.'</p>

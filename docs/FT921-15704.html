			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Baring Securities buys seat on Paris bourse BARING Securities, the UK securities firm, has paid an undisclosed sum for the Paris stock exchange seat of DG Bourse, a subsidiary of the German bank, DG Bank. The British firm has taken over DG Bourse's shares in the Societe des Bourses Francaises, the market executive. From January 1, having such shares has been the main requirement for being allowed to trade on the French stock market. Previously, new entrants had to buy an existing seat and the stockbroking firm that went with it. Baring Securities is the first firm to take advantage of the latest stage in French stock exchange reform. It has not bought the firm DG Bourse, which will continue to run its fund management business. Since its arrival in Paris in July 1990, the Baring Securities office has specialised in advice on Japanese and other Asian shares, passing orders to its fellow subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Tokyo. Mr Andre Marini, director general of Baring Securities, Paris expects to increase staff from 15 to about 20 in the next month or two and to begin trading in French equities in two to three months. The board of the London International Financial Futures Exchange met yesterday to discuss the future of equity options trading after the exchange's merger with the London Traded Options market next March, writes Tracy Corrigan. Liffe appears to have succeeded in persuading more firms to act as market-makers in equity options, needed to boost liquidity in the languishing market. After the meeting, a Liffe official said that 'subject to confirmation from market-makers, there will be adequate market-making capacity to proceed with the provisional allocation of 'D' shares'.</p>

Following a preparatory artillery bombardment, the enemy  attacked Akhmadagaly in Agdamskiy Rayon. Armored vehicles  supported the onslaught. Violent clashes are taking place  around that town at the present time.    Uninterrupted positional fighting has continued in  Gorenboyskiy, Terterskiy, and Fizulinskiy Rayons during the past  two days. The Armenians suffered many casualties in their  unsuccessful attacks against Gorenboy. The enemy units lost  more than 50 men. They abandoned 12 machine guns and grenade  launchers and fled from the battlefield.    The border observation posts in Kedabekskiy Rayon were fired  on from Armenia last night.

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN SHOW THE WAY  </P> <P> South County's severe water shortage can hardly be solved by children. But it's  still encouraging to see that third- and fourth-graders at six schools in San  Clemente study ways to save water.  </P> <P> Partly because of rapid growth and water-delivery problems, San Clemente has  been hard hit by a water shortage. The City Council on Wednesday will consider  an ordinance that would encourage -- and if the situation worsens, require --  residents and businesses to conserve water. Elsewhere in Orange County, the  state's drought conditions are lowering reservoirs.  </P> <P> To emphasize the value of conservation, the San Clemente schools are staging  art and essay contests. The prizes: $50 savings bonds. It's a small step, but  an important one. Conservation is a lesson that must be learned by young people  if water is to continue to flow freely for the next generation.  </P></p>

He  quoted military experts as saying that "the peace keeping units  would immediately become hostages of such action."    Zlenko thinks that Serbians could then use the air strikes  as  a pretext to retaliate against the peacekeeping forces.    The Ukrainian minister thinks that a decision on air strikes  should be made by the UN Security Council. He does not doubt  that Russia would veto air strikes.    He did not rule out the possibility that NATO could make a  unilateral decision and emphasized that the security of  peacekeeping units had to be guaranteed, in particular the  Ukrainian battalion.    Zlenko would not, however, welcome unilateral withdrawal of  the Ukrainian unit, even if a decision to stage air strikes was  made. He told the journalists that his country had earlier  proposed adopting a convention on UN peacekeeping forces.</p>

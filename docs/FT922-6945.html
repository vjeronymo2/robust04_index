			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Mitel reduces annual loss to CDollars 5.7m MITEL, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker controlled by British Telecom, has enjoyed its best quarter in several years, but posted a loss for fiscal 1992 as a whole. The company, based in Ottawa, also warned that, despite a return to profit in its fourth quarter, strong competitive pressures remain. It indicated it was unlikely to repeat the past three months' results for at least the next half-year. The net loss for the fiscal year ended March 27 was CDollars 5.7m (USDollars 4.78m), or 12 cents a share, compared with a CDollars 107m loss, or CDollars 1.41 a share, in fiscal 1991. Revenues slipped to CDollars 406.1m from CDollars 431.3m. Operating losses, excluding extraordinary charges, were cut from CDollars 31.8m to CDollars 8.1m. The fourth quarter, however, produced a CDollars 5m profit on record sales of CDollars 121.7m. Much of the recent improvement is due to intense efforts to contain costs. Sales of the GX5000 office switchboard more than doubled to CDollars 7.1m last year. BT has been seeking a buyer for the past two years for the 51 per cent stake in Mitel it bought in 1985.</p>

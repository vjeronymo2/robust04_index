			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHICAGO MAY GET STADIUM WITH DOME  </P> <P> Gov. James R. Thompson and Mayor Richard M. Daley reportedly are backing plans  for a new domed stadium to house the Chicago Bears and serve as a magnet for  major political and sporting events, such as the Super Bowl.  </P> <P> The Chicago Tribune reported in today's editions that the Metropolitan Pier and  Exposition Authority, which would build the dome, has hired lawyers and  appraisers to examine a site a few blocks south of Soldier Field, current home  of the Bears.  </P> <P> While Bears President Michael McCaskey has resisted the idea of a domed  stadium, he recently has modified his position, a move that has put plans for  the new stadium in high gear, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> "We're going to explore the dome and see what can be done to make it an  exciting place to watch football," McCaskey said Thursday.  </P> <P> "We're not wildly enthusiastic about it," he said. "But the politicians feel  strongly that only a structure with a lid can be justified from a public  standpoint."  </P> <P> Thompson and Daley apparently have convinced McCaskey that a dome, located  close to Chicago's McCormick Place convention center, is the team's only chance  for a taxpayer-subsidized stadium.  </P> <P> The Tribune said that Thompson and Daley will downplay the Bears when they  present the plans for a domed stadium to lawmakers in Springfield this spring.  </P> <P> Instead, they will emphasize its attraction as a home for events like political  conventions, the Super Bowl, or the NCAA's "Final Four" basketball playoffs.  </P></p>

We progressed from de Quincey to Aldous Huxley in last week's survey of artists and drugs in Without Walls. Today (9.00 C4) we move on to the 1960s and such characters as Ken Kesey, Timothy Leary and JG Ballard. 40 Minutes finds nine young men from north-east England packed into a Benidorm flat intended for four. 'Loud, aggressive, abusive, they drink too much and leer at the topless girls', we are told. 'It looks like an orgy of loutish behaviour but, for them, the excesses are an escape from the drabness of life in everyday Britain'.

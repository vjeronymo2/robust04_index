			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): A new regime is planned - Taxation of income from property A series of preparatory measures towards a new self assessment regime will take effect from April 6 1995 and deal with income tax rules applying to the taxation of income from property. This will make it easier for those liable to income tax to compute their income from property and to assess it under the new regime. Income from property in the UK is taxed under Schedule A. Income from furnished lettings is presently taxed under Case VI of Schedule D. The changes proposed apply only to income tax. The present rules for companies with Schedule A and Case VI property income will remain as they are. For the purposes of income tax it is proposed to bring all income from property situated in the UK including furnished lettings within the new rules for Schedule A. Under these rules tax will be charged on the profits of a business of letting property including isolated or casual lettings. The current prescriptive approach of defining what receipts are taxable and what deductions are allowable will largely disappear and in calculating profits most of the rules currently in force for trading profits under Schedule D will apply, including the use of ordinary accounting principles. But although income from property will follow the trading computational rules, this does not mean it will be taxed as if it is trading income. Income from property will continue to be treated as investment income, and the income received as a return on capital which has been invested in the property. Under the new approach all income from property situated in the UK will be pooled together regardless of the type of lease or whether the property is furnished or unfurnished, including income not derived from a lease. Expenditure incurred in earning that income will be allowed against the pooled income. Capital allowances will be given as a Schedule A expense, as part of the property income calculation. As capital allowances are not available for plant or machinery let in a dwelling house, the renewals basis or the wear and tear allowances for furnished lettings will be maintained. All losses brought forward to date will be set against the new pooled income, and any excess can be carried forward against future income from the business. The treatment of income from property situated outside the UK will be aligned with that of income from UK property by importing some of the new rules into Case V of Schedule D. This will mean that, for example, interest payable on a loan to purchase the property will in future be allowable as a deduction. There will be no change to the rules computing income from property for corporation tax purposes.</p>

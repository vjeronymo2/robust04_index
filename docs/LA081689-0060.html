			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JASON LEA'S DEATH RULED A HOMICIDE;  </P> <P> BOY, 9, DIED FROM 'SEVERE BLOWS TO CHEST,' AUTOPSY REVEALS  </P> <P> Jason Lea, the 9-year-old Upland boy whose body was found at the base of a  cliff in the San Gabriel Mountains earlier this month, was killed by "severe  blows to the chest," authorities said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "The blunt force trauma to the chest was the result of an assault. It is being  listed as a homicide," said Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Bob  Dambacher.  </P> <P> Coroner's investigators did not determine what type of object might have caused  the injuries, but said the trauma was not caused by a fall off the cliff. An  undetermined amount of alcohol was also found in the boy's body, but no sign of  drugs was found, Dambacher said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives, in whose jurisdiction the boy's body  was found, said the autopsy report also indicates that the victim received  injuries both before and after death.  </P> <P> Homicide investigators will submit evidence to the Los Angeles County district  attorney's office for possible filing of murder charges once they receive the  written coroner's report, possibly today, said Deputy Chris Wahla.  </P> <P> Two juveniles, 16 and 17, were initially arrested in connection with the  disappearance. Lea's nude body then was found Aug. 4 at the bottom of a  200-foot ravine off Glendora Ridge Road in the Mt. Baldy area.  </P> <P> Later, two other suspects, age 18 and 19, surrendered, and sheriff's homicide  detectives sought murder complaints against them.  </P> <P> However, prosecutors decided against filing charges against any of the four for  lack of evidence. They noted that the coroner at the time had not yet ruled on  the cause of death.  </P> <P> Two of the original four suspects remain in custody of San Bernardino County  authorities. The 18 year-old is being held on a probation violation, and one of  the juveniles remains in custody on an unrelated charge.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, memorial services were held for Lea on Tuesday at the 11th Street  Baptist Church in Upland.  </P> <P> The boy, who lived with his grandfather, disappeared the night of July 29 after  going for a bicycle ride. His bicycle was found outside an arcade in Upland.  </P></p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Swedish krona recovers A combination of fundamental and technical factors yesterday helped the Swedish krona stage a sharp recovery on the foreign exchanges, writes Philip Gawith. The currency improved on the back of a better tone in the bond markets, helped by investors who were short of the currency at the end of last week, needing to square their positions. The krona finished in London at SKr4.933 against the D-Mark from SKr5.008 at Friday's close. Elsewhere, the dollar and sterling continued to suffer at the hands of the firmer D-Mark. The dollar closed at DM1.5309, from DM1.5396, and at Y97.96 from Y98.47. Sterling finished over a pfennig lower at DM2.3729 from DM2.3836. Against the dollar, however, it was firmer, closing at Dollars 1.5501 from Dollars 1.5483. Analysts said that both the dollar and the pound were the victims of poor sentiment, rather than concerted selling pressure. In Europe the D-Mark was little changed. It closed at FFr3.430 against the French franc, from FFr3.431. Against the Italian lira it closed at L1,020 from L1,021. The catalyst for the recovery in the krona was last Friday's fiscal proposals from the opposition Social Democratic Party, predicted to win next month's general election. The market, concerned by Sweden's large budget deficit, was impressed by the SDP's plans to reduce the budget by SKr61bn over the coming four years. Sentiment was also helped by comments from Skandia, the large insurer, on the basis of the SDP proposals, that it would be prepared to buy Swedish state bonds again. Markets' were recently shocked by Skandia's decision to boycott purchases of state bonds owing to the country's weak fiscal position. Mr Keld Holm, international economist at Lehman Brothers in London, said the krona had quite significant momentum in the longer term, with the potential to appreciate to SKr4.60 over the next year. In the short term, however, he cautioned that uncertainty, particularly over the November referendum concerning Sweden's accession to the EU, could well see the krona retreat back towards the SKr5.00 level. The market's view about the weakness of sterling is that it is currently a cause for vigilance, rather than anxiety. The UK currency has not yet become the target of speculative pressure, its level still being almost exclusively a residual of movements in the larger currencies, particularly D-Mark and dollar. The trade weighted index finished at 78.2, from a close of 78.5 on Friday. Although the pound is now 25 pfennigs below the DM2.62 it reached before the February rate cut, it is nine cents higher against the dollar, up to Dollars 1.55 from Dollars 1.46. The government does not have an explicit exchange rate target, and there is little support for the view, notwithstanding fears in the gilt market, that the Bank of England might be tempted to raise interest rates to support sterling. Mr Peter Fellner, gilt strategist at Natwest Markets, commented: 'It is always the pace (of the decline) as well as the level that matters as far as the Bank is concerned.' He said the Bank would probably become concerned if the trade weighted index was, on a sustained basis, to lose a few points a day. The prospect of higher rates, because of currency weakness, would probably only arise when the Bank deemed the level of sterling sufficient to constitute an inflationary threat. At the moment it is possible to argue that the Bank is enjoying the best of both worlds. Mr Neil MacKinnon notes that UK exporters, who send roughly two-thirds of their products to the EU, will be welcoming the pound's weakness against the D-Mark. The Bank, however, will not be too concerned about sterling's strength against the dollar. The US is more important than the EU in terms of the cost of imported goods, and sterling strength will thus help curb inflationary pressures. The Mexican peso firmed against the dollar after partial results showed the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party keeping power in general elections. It closed in London at 3.315 pesos from 3.3815 pesos on Friday. Analysts said sentiment towards the US dollar remained negative. Mr MacKinnon said the position of the market was broadly neutral, with interbank traders driving it lower. He said there was no evidence of selling pressure from fund managers. In the UK money markets the Bank of England provided Pounds 574m liquidity at established rates, after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 550m. Overnight money traded between 3 and 4 3/4 per cent. In the cash markets, three month LIBOR was unchanged at 5 7/16 per cent. Activity in the futures markets was very quite, with the December short sterling contract trading 13,494 lots to close at 93.37 from 93.38. In Germany the December Euromark contract closed unchanged at 94.84. Call money rates were little changed at 4.85/4.95 per cent.</p>

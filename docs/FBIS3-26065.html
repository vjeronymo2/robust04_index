			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ZHONGGUO JIAOYU BAO (CHINESE EDUCATION JOURNAL) reporter </F> Liang Jie (2733 2638) and XINHUA reporter Zhang Yinshu (1728  6892 2562)]    [Text] Beijing, 25 Jan (XINHUA) -- Four special groups  charged with inspecting the enforcement of the "Teachers' Law"  will leave for Anhui, Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei respectively on  27 and 29 January. Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State  Council, told all members of the inspection groups at the Great  Hall of the People today that paying back what is owed to the  teachers is not an expedient measure and that there must be no  further default in teachers pay after paying back what is owed  them.    Li Lanqing said: The "Teachers law" adopted at the fourth  session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] Standing  Committee is an important law in promoting China's education  cause. The law must not be ignored; it must be strictly  enforced. All localities and departments across the country  must resolutely implement the law and use it as a weapon to  resolve practical problems encountered by teachers and to  further develop a fine social ethics of respecting teachers and  education.    Li Lanqing said: Elementary education is the most important  layer in China's macroeducation structure. It is something of  vital importance to the people's standards and the nation's  future. Therefore, we must do everything possible to make our  elementary education a success. It is the important  responsibility of governments at all levels to make elementary  education, including the nine-year compulsory education,  successful. Thanks to the efforts of governments at all levels,  the question of default in teachers' pay, which had existed in  some areas since the second half of 1992, has been mostly  resolved. To our knowledge, the problem, however, still existed  in a few areas. Resolving the question of default in teachers'  pay is a concrete expression of respect for teachers and  education. Governments at all levels and people of all walks of  life should all take it seriously. Paying back what is owed to  teachers is not an expedient measure; there must be no further  default in teachers' pay after paying back what is owed them.  An appropriate safeguard mechanism must be established.    Zhao Dongwan, chairman of the NPC Education, Science,  Culture, and Public Health Committee, and Zhu Kaixuan, minister  in charge of State Education Commission, were present at the  meeting. Zhao Dongwan said that the emphasis of the current  inspection is to find out about: 1) measures adopted by various  localities in implementing the teachers' law; 2) progress made  in various localities in paying back teachers' wages; 3)  progress made in various localities in implementing the newly  announced wage system; and 4) ways to improve the mechanism for  ensuring payment of teachers' wages. The four provinces which  the inspection groups will visit are places where the question  of default in teachers' pay is more serious.    The NPC Education, Science, Culture, and Public Health  Committee took the lead in organizing the current inspection.  Responsible persons of departments concerned of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee  and the State Education Commission were also present.</p>

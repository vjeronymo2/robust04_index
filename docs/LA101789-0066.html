			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAVY SUSPENDS DEFENSE FIRM  </P> <P> The Navy said Monday it has suspended a Baldwin Park defense contractor from  doing business with it, saying the company supplied untested circuit boards for  tactical missiles.  </P> <P> The boards, made by Asher Engineering Corp., went into such weapons as the  Navy's Phoenix long-range air-to-air missile, the Harpoon anti-ship missile,  the Tomahawk cruise missile, the Sidewinder heat-seeking missile and an  advanced medium-range air-to-air missile, the statement said.  </P> <P> The firm made printed wiring boards that were put into arming switches made by  another defense contractor, Micronics International of Brea.  </P> <P> The arming device, roughly comparable to the safety on a gun, is built into the  missile's fuse to prevent premature firing.  </P></p>

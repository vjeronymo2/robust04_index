			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 17 May (DPA) -- Dominican soldiers  and policemen intensified today their surveillance around the  poor neighborhoods that surround the capital and began searching  vehicles for weapons. Soldiers and policemen, including special  riot police forces, were posted at key points of the capital,  especially in the neighborhoods where protests and violent  demonstrations generally start. It was reported that the  military occupation of the capital was ordered to prevent  disorder and possible acts of violence.    The tension continues to increase in the Dominican capital,  while reports on the election results are slowly being disclosed  and charges of fraud by the opposition Dominican Revolutionary  Party (PRD) increase.    Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, presidential candidate for the  PRD, announced today he will ask for the annulment of the  election results in the provinces where fraud is proven and  reiterated his charges that the voter lists were altered to  prevent members of his party and other opposition organizations  from voting.    This afternoon another PRD leader accused the Central  Electoral Board (JCE) of providing the country with incorrect  information on election results. Manuel Esquea Guerrero, PRD  delegate before the JCE, said the figures provided in official  bulletins do not correspond to the figures provided to the  parties on "diskettes," which should be the same figures  provided to the public.    The country was partially paralyzed today. Government  offices were not open, and many businesses remained closed. The  schools that were used as voting centers yesterday did not open  today either, and the flow of vehicles, both private and mass  transit, was minimal.    The latest results provided by the JCE show an increase in  Joaquin Balaguer's lead. With 61 percent of the voting tables  counted, Balaguer has 786,559 votes or 43.53 percent.  Opposition candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez has 730,775  votes or 40.44 percent of the votes.</p>

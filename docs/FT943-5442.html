			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: You can bet on it] - Fancy a flutter on exam results? No problem When the GCSE school examination results came out last month, one Manchester mother and daughter had much to celebrate. The daughter got 10 A-grades and her mother won Pounds 150 from a bet on the outcome. Putting money on a child's academic success might not appeal to everyone - it could put unwelcome additional pressure on a nervous candidate - but, every year, a few parents choose to have a flutter. Bookmaker William Hill started offering odds on exam grades a few years ago when a 15-year-old boy studying for GCSEs asked to lay a bet on his own chances. He was refused - betting is illegal for under-18s - but his father then staked Pounds 50 at 20-1 that his son would get all A-grades. Then the boy's headmaster also placed a bet - and with such confidence from those with inside knowledge of his form, it was not surprising that the boy turned out a winner. Since then, the typical odds have narrowed. Graham Sharpe, at William Hill, gave the bright Manchester girl odds of 3-1 after seeing her latest school report and mock GCSE results. But, given that about 80 per cent of bets on exam results are successful, Sharpe's odds may still be on the generous side. Another winner this year was a father whose son arrived in the UK from the former Yugoslavia only in May 1992 but still managed three grade As at A-level this summer. Winnings usually end up in the hands of the successful youngsters, perhaps as a cash bonus or in the form of a new bike or holiday. If you had planned to wave a Pounds 50 note or two in front of your child as an incentive for diligent revision, then placing a bet could be one way of doubling or even tripling the potential reward. If, however, your child slipped one grade but then demanded a reward for all the effort, anyway, you might regret having staked the money. As with all wagers, there is a tax of 10 per cent. You can decide whether to pay it when you lay the bet or run the risk of paying 10 per cent of your winnings. If your children's talents lie in other directions, you can find bookies willing to lay odds on sporting prowess or almost any other achievement. Sharpe was contacted recently by parents wanting to bet that their son would play rugby for England. Any win would be a long time coming, though - the lad was only 17 days old. At that age, the odds offered can be spectacular: perhaps 10,000-1 or more. But when the child is older, and has had the chance to show if it has some footballing talent, they drop quite sharply. Even so, most parents betting on their children's sporting success get only entertainment value from the bet. But, six or seven years ago, Sharpe accepted Pounds 200 from a proud father who wagered - at 500-1 - that his son would win the 1,500 metres race at the 1996 Olympics. That boy is Curtis Robb who was, at the time, just another good teenage runner. Since then, though, he has become a leading athlete who ran in the 800 metres at the Barcelona Olympics two years ago. Sharpe is now confronting the real possibility of having to pay out Pounds 100,000. So, if you cherish dreams of your son or daughter winning an Olympic gold or getting into parliament, there is nothing to stop you backing the dream with a little cash. It might be a very long shot - but how many other investments could pay out Pounds 100,000 after 20 years for a one-off Pounds 200 premium? Just be sure you don't lose the betting slip.</p>

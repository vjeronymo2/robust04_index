			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan rises on prospects for budget passage The continent's bourses found it difficult to sustain momentum in the face of a variety of domestic factors. MILAN adopted a brighter tone at the end of a difficult week amid growing optimism over the progress of the 1995 budget through parliament and hopes of a calmer political outlook through a broadening of the coalition. The Comit index rose 5.31 to 643.59, also supported by comments from the treasury minister, Mr Lamberto Dini, which held out hopes for lower interest rates, if the budget was agreed in its present form. The index was little changed over a week that, said NatWest Securities, had seen the largest ever demonstration against the government and continued with a series of confidence votes, which gave an idea of the difficulties that the prime minister and his cabinet were experiencing. 'Although the political climate remains heated, we believe we are nearing an end to this long and uncertain period,' said NatWest. 'With this in mind, we would be quite happy to start turning more positive as most of the bad news is now in the price.' Gains were seen across the board with Olivetti rising L71 or 3.4 per cent to L1,995 and Cir up L60 to L1,938. Ferruzzi, L32 ahead at L1,369, continued to show gains in spite of the official denial of rumours that it would be merged with Montedison, its agro-industrial subsidiary. FRANKFURT was pressured by the expiry of options, the Dax index off a marginal 0.41 at 2,102.28 in official hours, and up 1 per cent on the week. Mannesmann continued to benefit from Thursday's results, rising DM5.30 to DM411.80. Elsewhere, VW put on DM6.60 to DM460.00 marks on options expiry. Financials eased slightly, with the results season due to start next week: Deutsche Bank lost 80 pfennigs to DM757, Dresdner70 pfennigs to DM412.70, Commerzbank DM3.70 to DM329.30 and Allianz DM16 to DM2,424. Chemical stocks were also lower ahead of next week's results with BASF down DM2.40 at DM312.60, Bayer down DM1.50 at DM343.60 and Hoechst down DM1 at DM324. ZURICH edged higher in quiet conditions, with the firmer dollar providing further support. The SMI index rose 5.6 to 2,606.5, little changed on the week. UBS commented that the week was again dominated by a marked improvement on the currency front as the Swiss franc weakened further against the dollar and the D-mark. The bank said it expected a further positive impetus on the currency side although the stimulus from interest rates was likely to be modest. In the coming week, dollar sensitive stocks would continue to outperform interest rate sensitive shares. Brown Boveri gave up Thursday's advance, losing SFr7 to SFr1,107, with the nine month results from ABB proving in line with expectations. Swiss Re registered shares, however, picked up SFr22 to SFr797 as demand picked up after the recent profit-taking. AMSTERDAM weakened as expiry of November options made itself felt. The AEX index dipped 1.44 to 409.85, a week's rise of 0.5 per cent. Philips headed the list of most active stocks, with some 2.7m shares traded largely as a result of options expiry. The shares lost 80 cents to Fl 53.20. KNP BT, the paper and packaging group, went against the trend, adding 20 cents to Fl 50.10 on better than expected third quarter earnings. Begemann, the industrial group, which fell sharply on Thursday, put on Fl 1.10 to Fl 29.70 in strong local trade. MADRID finished higher as some late buying overcame mid-session weakness, with the expiry of the future contract boosting otherwise thin volumes. The final quote of the general index was not available, due to technical problems, but the Ibex-35 index rose 14.24 to 3,286.71. Dragados climbed Pta45 or 2.4 per cent to Pta1,955 in response to Thursday's results. STOCKHOLM was led higher by Ericsson in a partial correction of Thursday's losses, although prices came off midsession highs as the domestic bond market lost earlier gains. The Affarsvarlden index rose 6.10 to 1,506.50, for a 2.9 per cent rise on the week. Ericsson B rose SKr4.50 to SKr443, in turnover of SKr803m following Thursday's SKr23 fall in response to its nine months figures. The share hit a session high of SKr449 and a low of 432. SCA B rose SKr1 to SKr115, following its nine months profit figures and higher full year forecast. Asea A fell SKr9 to SKr533, following the ABB nine months figures.

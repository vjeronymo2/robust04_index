			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Working week still shrinking EMPLOYERS and manual workers are continuing to negotiate reductions in the working week in spite of the recession, according to a report from Incomes Data Services, the independent pay analysts. Almost one in 10 organisations have cut, or agreed to cut, basic working hours during the past year. By autumn 1992, manual workers in 60 per cent of engineering and related industries had a 37 1/2 -hour week or less and a quarter of all organisations used a week of 37 or 37 1/2 hours for blue-collar workers. The most common holiday entitlement was 25 days plus public holidays. The past two years have shown a rise in the number of companies giving maternity pay and leave above the statutory entitlement and a sharp increase in those willing to change work arrangements for pregnant workers, says a study by Alan Jones and Associates, management consultants. Hours and Holidays 1992. IDS, 193 St John Street, London EC1V 4LS. By subscription. Maternity and Childcare, Alan Jones &amp; Associates, Apex House, Wonastow Road, Monmouth, Gwent NP54YE. Pounds 130 plus VAT.</p>

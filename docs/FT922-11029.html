			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Walesa looks to France for his presidential model PRESIDENT Lech Walesa yesterday announced his intention of becoming a Gaullist-style executive president and further undermined his prime minister, Mr Jan Olszewski, by naming two other candidates as better suited to haul Poland out of its deepening political crisis. 'Our present system isn't functioning,' he told a news conference, 'so I am suggesting a French-style presidential system to improve the efficiency of government.' He named Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, leader of Poland's largest party and prime minister of the first post-Communist government as the best man to get Poland's fractured political parties working together. But he also singled out Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the finance minister, as 'the best qualified person if we want quick and resolute reform'. Despite his public endorsement for the two men, however, he stopped short of asking Mr Olszewski to resign his premiership, adding: 'I don't exclude this possibility even though there is no such necessity today.' Mr Olechowski, a former senior trade and central bank official, is already a key member of Mr Olszewski's government. He recently secured cabinet support for cuts in public spending needed to keep the budget deficit below 5 per cent of GDP. But the cuts, which were needed to gain International Monetary Fund support for Poland's economic reforms, still have to be approved by parliament. On Friday parliament delayed for two weeks a vote to nullify a court ruling which called on the government to reinstate welfare and pension cuts made last year. Failure to achieve the required 75 per cent support to overturn the court ruling would double the proposed budget deficit and risk rekindling hyperinflation. Mr Olechowski has made clear he would resign if this happened, which in turn would almost certainly cause the collapse of the government. The difficulty of forming a solidly based government capable of supporting tough economic policies from a fractured elected parliament of 29 political parties and the ambiguous role played by Mr Walesa have underlined the need for constitutional reform. Mr Walesa spoke yesterday of the need to follow democratic procedures. But in a clear reference to the possibility that he might put himself at the head of a populist movement to back his demands, the former leader of the anti-communist Solidarity movement warned that he did not 'exclude being forced to be a strong president backed by a large party if these calculations with the presidential system don't work'.</p>

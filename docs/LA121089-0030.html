			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILD'S PLAY: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> SAFE POOLS  </P> <P> THE DROWNING OF a child is the swimming pool owner's greatest fear. Active  toddlers and preschoolers, who mistakenly believe they can swim, are  particularly at risk. The fencing around most pools is intended to keep out  trespassers. Removable perimeter pool fences and pool covers, though not a  substitute for adult supervision, are a wise safety measure.  </P> <P> Fencing is made of poly-coated nylon mesh (it comes in black, which is most  transparent, white or beige), which is too fine for a child to climb on. Fences  come in 3 1/2- or 4-foot heights, with supporting aluminum poles and gates or  points of entry spaced regularly around the perimeter of the fences. Poles are  anchored in the decking about two feet from the edge of the pool. A section or  two can be opened up or removed to permit access for swimming or maintenance.  For parties or special events, the entire fence can be taken down in 15 minutes  or less, depending on the size of the pool, and set back up again in about the  same amount of time. Typical cost for installation ranges from $1,500 to  $2,000.  </P> <P> Manual or motorized safety pool covers provide a horizontal, rather than  vertical, barrier to entry. (Consumers should look for covers that meet federal  safety standards; other covers can be simply intended to catch debris.) The  reinforced vinyl cover slides on a track attached to the decking. Care must be  taken, however, to prevent accumulation of water on top of the cover from  rainfall. Typical cost ranges from $1,000 to $6,000, depending on the size and  shape of the pool and whether the cover is motorized.  </P> <P>  Manufacturers and distributors of removable pool fencing and pool covers sell  and install their products throughout Southern California.

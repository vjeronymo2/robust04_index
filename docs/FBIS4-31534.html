			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bernadeta Waszkielewicz and Pawel Reszka: "The </F> Council for the Press; Is There a Threat of Return of  Censorship?"]    [Text] The opinions on the idea of setting up a council  for the press are quite varied:    --It is an attempt to reestablish censorship.    --Someone should watch, within reasonable limits, over the  values or opinions promoted by the press, say politicians of  various political stripes about the proposal submitted by  Democratic Left Alliance Deputy Adam Halber. The basic  controversies are: Is it necessary to watch over the press?  Should the press market be protected from foreign capital?  Eventually, if the council were to exist, who would set it  up--the authorities or the journalists themselves?    Someone should watch, "within reasonable limits," over the  values or opinions promoted by the press, believes Janusz  Dobrosz, deputy chairman of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], who  accepts the idea of establishing a council for the press.  "There is a difference between respecting general values and  imposing, offending, and slandering. We have pluralism, and the  press is shaping public opinion."    Asked about whether the council will not be a form of  censorship, Dobrosz replies that it will not, but "the  informative proportions are so distorted that not the political  opposition but the opposition to our views has a greater share  in the media." Dobrosz did not firmly deny the suggestion that  the role of the council would be to ensure influence of the  governing coalition over the press. He explained that he  believes that "the government must have its own press, which is  exemplified by the governmental page in RZECZPOSPOLITA, because  someone must present" the activities, intentions, and opinions  of the government, not only this government "because this one  will eventually leave, but every government." "This is a lack  of balance, it is absurd and inadmissible."    According to M.A. Jerzy Adamowski of the Journalism  Institute, it is possible for a press council to function in the  Polish reality. It should not deal with disputes between  journalists and politicians. This should be handled by courts  of law.    Krzysztof Krol of the Confederation for an Independent  Poland  opposes the idea of setting up the council. He fears that the  idea of establishing the press council is "an attempt to  recreate the former censorship." "Such a council would soon get  the idea of creating types of press `space slots'--that is,  calculating who appeared in the press and how many times. It  would be a kiss of death for journalism. There is a great  difference between a civil servant and a journalist; these two  should not be confused."    A negative attitude toward the council has also been adopted  by Zdobyslaw Milewski of the Freedom Union. He considers the  idea of establishing a press council to be misconceived because  it aims at regulating the free media from the position of the  state authorities.    Comparison with the National Council of Radio and Television  [KRRiT] is also not a very good one because it deals with the  regulation of the affairs concerning radio stations, where there  is not enough space for everyone.    Presidential Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski also is not an  advocate of the idea of establishing the council. "I do not  think it could be a panacea for the problems that journalists  themselves cannot resolve today."  <H5>  The Protection of the Press Market </H5>   According to the author of the idea, among the fields of  activity of the press council should also be the protection of  the press market from the influx of foreign capital. There is  no agreement over this issue as well. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, of  the Center Accord, claims that a lack of inflow of foreign  capital would conserve the advantage of the postcommunist forces  on the press market. Kaczynski would back the idea of admitting  a greater amount of foreign capital to the Polish market, which,  he believes, might result in greater pluralism. This, among  other reasons, is why he objects to the establishment of the  council. He does support the idea of setting up a nonparty body  that would be entitled to impose prohibitive taxes, for  instance, as a result of which obscene magazines would not be a  good source of income.    Ignacy Rutkiewicz, president of the Polish Association of  Journalists [SDP], says that it is absurd to limit the inflow of  foreign capital in a free market economy.    The PSL's Janusz Dobrosz is of a different opinion: "The  penetration of the Polish press by foreign capital is too great;  proportions have been distorted," and some organ should control  this issue. Jerzy Adamowski believes that the press council  might deal with the protection of the Polish capital on the  press market (during a transition period, it would protect  periodicals from the dumping prices of competitors). It might  also prevent the concentration of capital, and deal with the  journalists' ethics and disputes between publishers and  journalists.  <H5>  Authorities' Attempts To Gain Influence Over the Press </H5>   Jerzy Adamowski says that the council should be independent  of politicians. It should consist of "persons of public  confidence," representatives of publishers, and of journalists,  and, if this cannot be avoided, of politicians. However, the  latter should not have the greatest say. It would be a threat  to the council if politicians wanted to gain influence over the  media through it. SDP head Ignacy Rutkiewicz concedes that  there are various opinions among journalists on the  establishment of the press council. Some of them firmly oppose  this idea; others say that the council should be established.  However, it cannot be established by the government's decision;  nor can it be formed in line with the special party-political  system (as it was in the case of KRRiT). It should rather be an  expression of the will of the journalist's milieu.    It would have to be situated within the press law. It should  not be established in a separate law--one drafted in the fast  mode, at that--provided that journalists themselves decided that  such a council should be established.</p>

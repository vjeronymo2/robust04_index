			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / 'Rubber stamp' advisers win power to make their mark: How a shadowy organisation will play a central role in the drive for more open government FIGHTING yesterday's battles can be as demanding as tackling today's difficulties, as Mr William Waldegrave, the public-service minister, has found in his efforts to bring greater openness to government. His insistence that 'release' rather than 'retain' should be the watchword in dealing with government files more than 30 years old has been as alien to the culture of secrecy in Whitehall as the greater availability of current information held by departments. In theory, at least, Mr Waldegrave appears to have won some victories over the mandarins' belief that there should be no need to know. The white paper on open government, published last month, sets out changes to the criteria for keeping files secret which are intended to ensure that more documents should be made available. It also sets out the basic principle that all records should be released after 30 years unless actual damage would be caused by their publication. But perhaps the greatest changes are to the role of the Advisory Council on Public Records, called a 'rubber stamp' even by some of its members. The 16-strong council is made up largely of politicians and academics and chaired by Sir Thomas Bingham, the Master of the Rolls. Its task is to advise the Lord Chancellor about which files should remain closed for more than 30 years. Its powers are to be extended. First, its remit will be expanded so that officials seeking to keep files closed within departments must seek the approval of the council. Previously a department could bypass the council by deciding to retain a file rather than transfer it to the Public Records Office. There are strict rules about what categories of documents can be retained by departments, but some council members are not convinced that they are always kept. One noted how, when some files from the 1940s finally found their way on to the agenda, the department said merely that they had been 'overlooked'. The detail of the second change has yet to be finalised, but goes to the heart of members' complaints about how they carry out their work: it will give them access to the documents. Mr David Sumberg, the Tory MP for Bury South who sits on the council, is clear that it would have been untenable to continue with previous practice. Council members were presented at their quarterly meetings with long lists of files which, they were told, were to remain closed, and were given only the most general explanations for their closure. 'At the end of the day, either people can be trusted to see documents and take decisions, or they can't,' he said. Mr Waldegrave has made clear that some way of giving the council access to the files will be found in future, but the recent letter to council members from the official who organises did not say how this would be done. The most likely outcome appears to be that the council will be able to look at files as a last resort, and that knowing this power exists will deter officials tempted to interpret the rules in a restrictive way. If these changes work as Mr Waldegrave intends, they will represent a serious assault on departments' ability to keep aged information out of the public domain. Mr Waldegrave's officials are clear that the assault could not have been mounted without the 'broad philosophical support' of Mr John Major, the prime minister, and the active backing of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. They say that the 'open-mindedness' of Mr Hurd was crucial in putting pressure on the Ministry of Defence, which had been seen as the department least enthusiastic about unwrapping its past files. And will Whitehall be defeated in any rearguard action it may try to mount against the opening up of its past? Mr Terry Davis, MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill and Labour's representative on the council, said: 'Ask me again in a year's time.'</p>

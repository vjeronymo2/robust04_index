			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Egypt to end foreign banks' currency curb EGYPT is to remove curbs barring foreign banks from operating in local currency, in a move the government hopes will attract substantial new investment. The measures, approved at a meeting earlier this week attended by President Hosni Mubarak and the country's top economic policymakers, will allow the 22 foreign bank branches in Egypt to take deposits and make loans in Egyptian pounds without requiring changes in the branches' shareholding structure or legal status. In practice, the decision would considerably open Egypt's banking market. 'Foreign banks will be able to enter Egypt without any restriction whatsoever,' one senior local banker said. Mr Atef Obeid, cabinet affairs minister, said the move aimed to encourage foreign banks to 'make bold decisions to invest and extend credits'. A proposed amendment to Egypt's banking law will be put to parliament for ratification next week. Approval is considered a formality. Foreign bankers in Cairo welcomed the move, suggesting it could herald considerable expansion into the domestic retail market by such banks as Citibank, American Express Bank, Chemical Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Credit Suisse and Arab Bank. 'Basically, the move opens up a totally new market,' one US banker said. The measure has been resisted strongly by some of Egypt's larger and more conservative banks. The banking law had previously held that foreign banks with branches in Egypt should have local partners to be allowed to operate in local currency. However, some local bankers welcomed the move, saying it would jolt Egypt's banks into greater efficiency. 'I welcome foreign competition, provided the central bank has the capacity to control and monitor the expanded activities,' Mr Hazem Beblawi, chairman of the Export Development Bank of Egypt, said. The decision to liberalise the banking market comes amid steps to boost growth and impress the IMF and World Bank with Egypt's resolve to expand the private sector. Last week the bank signed a memorandum of understanding unfreezing a Dollars 150m structural adjustment loan, after approving Cairo's plans to speed privatisation of its public sector.</p>

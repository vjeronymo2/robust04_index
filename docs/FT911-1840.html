			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: Travelers' returns hold steady TRAVELERS, the multi-line insurer which startled Wall Street last autumn when it made large provisions for potential losses on its property investment interests, yesterday reported static first-quarter profits, at Dollars 93.1m. The figure for the first three months of 1990 was Dollars 91.6m. The company said the property market 'in most parts of the country continued to deteriorate' and it did not expect any stabilisation until the economy picked up generally. It also warned that pricing levels in the commercial property-casualty market - its biggest area of business  - remained soft. But, notwithstanding these problems, Travelers added that the first-quarter results had met the group's expectations. On the stock market, Travelers shares gained Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 24 1/4 . The latest profits figure compared with net income of Dollars 92m a year earlier. Earnings per share amounted to 88 cents, against 87 cents. The figures include net realised investment losses of Dollars 2.4m, against a profit of Dollars 5.2m in 1990. But this was largely offset by a Dollars 7.3m (nil) extraordinary credit. Excluding these two factors, profits totalled Dollars 88.2m against Dollars 86.4m. On the commercial property-casualty side, net profits were Dollars 42.5m, against Dollars 42.2m, after realised investment losses of Dollars 8.6m compared with a Dollars 200,000 deficit last time. It said premiums fell from Dollars 833m to Dollars 731m.</p>

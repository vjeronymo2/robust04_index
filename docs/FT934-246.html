			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Winds of change whistle down Tokyo's corridors of power: An 'island of stability' is under attack Power in Japan is concentrated in Kasumigaseki, where a few broad streets are lined with buildings that are home to Tokyo's bureaucrats. In cramped conditions, with desks carefully arranged to reflect the occupier's place in the hierarchy, the graduates of the great universities, Tokyo and Kyoto, preside over the drafting of policy, confident they have guided Japan to its post-war prosperity. Senior bureaucrats are fond of portraying Kasumigaseki as an island of stability and enlightenment, remote in attitude from the adjoining parliamentary district of Nagatacho where the often grubby business of politics is conducted. Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, minister for international trade and industry, defiantly crossed the line between the two districts last week by forcing the resignation of Mr Masahisa Naito, director-general of Miti's industrial policy bureau, and one of the country's most powerful bureaucrats. The case stirred fears among the bureaucracy that the new coalition government intends to increase the power of ministers at the expense of their ministries. Bureaucrats had been made uneasy by a deregulation drive intended to reduce their influence, but the campaign by Mr Kumagai was seen as a direct attack on the bureaucracy. Urged by colleagues to resist the unwanted political intrusion, Mr Naito admitted he had erred by promoting a ministry official who was leaving to become a candidate for the Liberal Democratic party. The official also happened to be the son of another senior Miti bureaucrat who had pushed for the promotion. Mr Naito had earlier said the resignation demand was unfair, and a dozen other Miti officials offered to resign in sympathy. These resignations are yet to be submitted, and public sentiment has swung against a bureaucracy perceived to be more conscious of the privileges than the responsibilities of office. The case highlighted the political affiliations of the bureaucracy. Mr Kumagai, a former Miti official, was taking aim at bureaucrats seen to be close to the LDP, which ruled for four decades until losing its majority at a July election. Links with the LDP were handy for bureaucrats, particularly for those with an eye on a second career in politics. But the bureaucrats' desire to have Kasumigaseki recognised as Tokyo's high moral ground was undermined by this partisanship and by the acquiescence of ministries in recent construction, trucking and financial industry scandals. One senior Miti official said yesterday many bureaucrats are conscious their best protection against politicians is to be seen to be clean and competent. In using deregulation to wrest influence from the bureaucracy, the coalition government is aware that the ministries' power resides in the vagueness of Japanese laws and in the maze of administrative regulations and conflicting interpretations built around these laws. The Japanese parliament, for example, introduced legislation to bring financial reform in April, but the extent and timing of reforms are still controlled by officials in the finance ministry. Banks' entry into the securities business has been slowed, and ministry regulations demand staff at a securities subsidiary wear a uniform completely different to that of the parent bank. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa came to office promising he would take a hatchet to such regulations and make the conduct of government more transparent. He complained that as a prefectural governor he was unable to move a bus stop without the approval of bureaucrats in Tokyo. 'If bureaucrats continue struggling to protect or expand their vested interests, they will end up increasing the inconvenience to the people they are meant to serve,' Mr Hosokawa said in a thin volume of his thoughts entitled The Time to Act is Now. The bureaucracy takes comfort from instability within the coalition, a hotchpotch of seven parties likely to face another election next year. More than Mr Hosokawa, officials are wary of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, who pulled together the coalition and runs the Japan Renewal party. Mr Ozawa is close to Mr Kumagai, and the two are agreed elected politicians should tackle the unelected bureaucrats. Part of the Ozawa agenda is that politicians should serve longer as ministers to build expertise in their area and reduce their dependence on bureaucrats, who write speeches and answer questions in parliament on behalf of their masters. But ministers are unlikely to secure long terms in a shaky political environment, while an LDP government would want business as usual and would hardly pursue an official of Mr Naito's political leanings. The next direct confrontation between coalition and bureaucracy is expected to be a bout between the Social Democratic party, formerly the Japan Socialist party, and the finance ministry, which is pushing for an overhaul of the taxation system that the SDP dislikes. The ministry wants an increase in the country's 3 per cent value-added tax, and the SDP would like companies and the wealthy to pay more tax to compensate for a decrease in revenues. But the SDP's largest obstacle in charging the barricades at the ministry is one of its partners in government: Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, who was an official at the ministry before entering politics. From his speech on appointment as minister, to most of his recent public statements, Mr Fujii has relied on his old friends the bureaucrats; they are unlikely to allow a rewrite of their script.</p>

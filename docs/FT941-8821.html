			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Miners lead strike wave in Russia A series of strikes and strike threats are now rippling across Russia, evidence of a growing militancy in face of non-payment of wages, reductions in workforces and plunging morale as workers in different industries face increasingly uncertain futures. The coalminers, traditionally the most militant group in Russia as elsewhere, have staged stoppages in the Arctic region of Vorkuta and in the larger Kuzbass coal basin. However, a wider strike expected to be called on Tuesday has been delayed, as divisions emerged on the council of the Independent Miners' Union about how far political demands should be advanced. Mr Yuri Shafranik, the Russian energy minister, promised the Kuzbass men on Tuesday to pay Rbs1,500bn in back wages in order to avert action in the basin. More seriously for the government, oil workers in the city of Nizhnevartovsk, the centre of the Tyumen oil-producing region, have voted for a strike which will be called by a strike committee 'if the situation requires'. The oil workers claim they have not been paid their salaries, of around Rbs500,000 a month, for three months. Thousands of teachers at institutes of higher education struck yesterday, also protesting against non-payment of wages and citing rapidly worsening conditions in the colleges. They demanded payment in full of all wages and that the government fulfil its promises to index the low pay rates to inflation. In Moscow, the city's ambulance service workers, who include doctors in their ranks, have decided to strike from March 1 - but in a 'special form' which will include not carrying corpses (except those of children) and not filling in forms, but will not include refusing to take emergencies and the aged to hospital. An earlier call for a full strike, made by the work force council of the ambulance agency, was overturned by a meeting of the service's workers yesterday. Mr Anatoly Solovyov,head of the service, said that many, especially the elderly, 'would experience a moral, if not physical, trauma if they hear of an all-out strike'. Strikes have been rare in spite of - or because of - the steadily worsening living standards and the now habitual inability of enterprises to pay their workers. However, the example of the miners, who have usually won promises (if not always the actuality) of extra payments whenever they have threatened strike, the practise seems to be spreading.</p>

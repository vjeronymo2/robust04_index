Toto Schillaci scored five of their eight goals in 1990. Altobelli scored four of Italy's five in Mexico in 1986. In 1982, Paolo Rossi, silent as Italy trudged through the group matches, hit six goals in the last three games to carry Italy to victory. Signori is quick, brave, bright and skilful, but his greatest asset is his ferocious shot. He has no backlift, so goalkeepers and defenders have little time to react; yet he shoots with power and accuracy. He blasts penalties while standing still. He can score against any defence. If he does so Italy will go far. Key Game: Italy v Ireland (June 20 - San Francisco) This is the hottest ticket in the World Cup. This match has captured the imagination of New York, and not just its strident Irish and Italian communities. The atmosphere should be raucous even if many spectators do not really understand the game which will provide an intriguing contrast of styles. It will also be fiercely contested. Neither team dares lose and both will want the three points and the likely place in the last 16 a win brings. Last time the two countries met Ireland had completed their fairy-tale run to the quarter-finals in 1990 and were happy to die valiantly, exhausted at the host's feet. Now, World Cup veterans and fresh from friendly wins against the Netherlands and Germany, they, and their opponents, will have a higher opinion of what the green shirts can achieve.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 28 Jan (TANJUG)--It is with pleasure that  Hungary will uphold the lifting of the sanctions adversely  affecting not only the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia but  Hungary as well, Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky told  FRY Prime Minister Radoje Kontic today. Federal Prime Minister  Kontic received the Hungarian foreign minister at the Palace of  the Federation today. The meeting was also attended by Federal  Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic.    Views were exchanged on bilateral relations between the FRY  and Hungary, stability in the Balkans, and the consequences of  the unjustly imposed sanctions. The two sides expressed mutual  interest in the development of good-neighborly relations and the  desire to resolve all disputes through dialogue.    "Yugoslavia is firmly determined to settle all disputed  issues in a peaceful way", the Yugoslav prime minister pointed  out. The prime minister also stressed that relations with  neighbors were a priority in Yugoslavia's foreign policy,  emphasizing that national minorities should be bridges of  cooperation, not causes for confrontation. Consequently, all  national minorities in the FRY -- including members of the  Hungarian minority -- are enjoying and will continue to enjoy  all rights in conformity with the highest international  standards, Kontic stressed. He informed Minister Jeszenszky  about the effects of the unjustly imposed sanctions and said  there were no longer any reasons for maintaining them.    Hungarian Foreign Minister Jeszenszky conveyed his  government's interest in maintaining good-neighborly relations  with the FRY and expressed his conviction that they will be even  more beneficial in the future. Jeszenszky believes that peace  in former Bosnia-Herzegovina was now closer at hand than ever  before and assessed that the FRY was making a significant  contribution to this effect.    The two sides also discussed economic cooperation,  especially  after the sanctions.    Prime Minister Kontic extended an invitation to the  Hungarian  prime minister to visit Yugoslavia.</p>

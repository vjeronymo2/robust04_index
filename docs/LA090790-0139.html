			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CENTURY MARKS ITS FIRST VARSITY CONTEST AGAINST REBUILDING EL DORADO  </P> <P> If the first varsity game for a high school football player is traumatic,  imagine the effect on an entire team.  </P> <P> Tonight, 1-year-old Century High School will play its first football game, at  7:30 against El Dorado at Valencia High School's Bradford Stadium. Century  Coach Bill Brown has no illusions about how his players -- all sophomores and  juniors with no varsity game experience -- will react.  </P> <P> "We know darn well that when we take our kids up to Bradford Stadium, their  hearts are going to be a-pounding and their diapers are going to need  changing," Brown said. "That's natural. We've all been there. Everybody that's  ever played the sport has felt butterflies. We expect that, but again, that's  just part of the maturation process."  </P> <P> In a quirk of scheduling, the Centurions' first varsity opponent is El Dorado,  a team that didn't win a game last season. The Hawks are also a young team,  with four sophomores starting, but at least they have seniors on the team.  Century has no seniors among its 1,700 students.  </P> <P> Still, as is the custom among coaches, second-year El Dorado Coach Rick Jones  is downplaying the potential for a mismatch.  </P> <P> "At this level you've got to get ready each week as if you are preparing for  the Rams," Jones said. "It doesn't matter if you are playing Bishop Amat or  Orange County's Pop Warner team, you've got to get ready."  </P> <P> In the case of Century, El Dorado is facing a team somewhere between those  extremes. The players come mainly from Century's freshman and sophomore teams,  which went 9-0 and 4-6, respectively, last season.  </P> <P> Brown is preaching patience and preparation for the future, while trying to  limit the importance of any single game in the Centurions' first season. One  advantage of having such an inexperienced team is that no one will graduate  from it. Barring transfers or grade problems, everyone will return next season.  </P> <P> And it's next season and beyond that most concerns Brown, who coached at  Brea-Olinda from 1979 until 1987. He believes he is building a firm foundation  at Century, which next year will have between 2,100 and 2,500 students.  </P> <P> Ever since three players showed up to the first informal practice in the summer  of 1989, the program has grown steadily. Today it has 62 varsity players and 40  freshman team members. Brown said the cornerstones of success are in place: the  administration is supportive, money is available and three of his five  assistants have teaching contracts.  </P> <P> But Brown hasn't begun saying, "Wait till next year." Playing its first varsity  season in the Pacific Coast League with two-time Division VIII champion Trabuco  Hills and last year's Sea View League champion Estancia will prove quite  challenging, but Century's nonleague schedule isn't as daunting. Of the  Centurions' five nonleague opponents, only Bloomington (7-3) won more than two  games last season. One, Jurupa Valley, is also playing its first year of  varsity competition.  </P> <P> Brown has the Centurions running a triple-option wishbone offense.  </P> <P> "If we can keep the plays down to a minimum and control the ball and play good  field position, maybe at the end of the game we're going to be close," Brown  said. "Then it just takes one break or two to win a ballgame.  </P> <P> "Our big concern is conditioning right now -- how long our kids can go. We have  a few kids that could probably play for most people, but we have an awful lot  who are going to be on the field that would be on other people's JV teams."  </P></p>

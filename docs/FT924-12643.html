			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Landlords 'abusing duties' WIDESPREAD abuse by landlords of their legal responsibilities towards owners of leasehold flats has been uncovered by a survey of such owners. The study, commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research body, is the first to look in detail at problems faced by owners in small converted blocks of flats. It found that two out of three leaseholders in its sample of 246 had suffered problems with landlords failing to meet obligations. Almost half of the leaseholders complained of serious problems such as excessive service charges and delays over important repairs. The most common complaints were about repairs and difficulties in contacting the landlord followed by suspected misuse of funds collected by landlords. Twenty-five per cent of leaseholders said they had considered taking landlords to court and 5 per cent had done so. Six per cent claimed they were the victims of harassment. Ten per cent of flat-owners did not know who held the freehold of their building, with more than 50 per cent dealing with an agent. A further 28 per cent reported difficulties with making contact with landlords or agents. Only 6 per cent had a resident landlord. The survey was carried out in anticipation of the leasehold reforms in the Housing and Urban Development Bill which will come before parliament this autumn. The legislation will give most holders of long leases a right to buy the freehold of their flats. Plans to introduce a system of 'commonhold' - which would enable flats to be bought and sold as freehold properties, but with special legal obligations towards other owners in the same building - have been postponed. The survey showed that dwindling leases produced few problems buying or selling leaseholds, and that very few tenants had sought lease extensions. However, of those surveyed, only 3 per cent of leases had less than 60 years remaining. One in seven leaseholders already owned a share of the freehold and most said the arrangement worked well, giving them greater control over the upkeep of buildings. Leasehold Flats: Time for Reform.

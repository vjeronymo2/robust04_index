			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Book Review: Economic eggheads unscrambled LOST PROPHETS By Alfred L Malabre Jr Harvard Business School Press 272 pages Dollars 27.95 He's sick of the lot of them. Alfred Malabre would refrain from using such coarse language. But, after 35 years of business and economic re-porting for the Wall Street Journal, his opinion of professional economists seems pretty low. His advice to the public and policymakers: stop listening to these charlatans and follow your gut instincts. Malabre's long service in the economic trenches gives him a valuable sense of perspective. He points out that the omnipresent economic 'guru' is a relatively recent phenomenon. Politicians and industrialists did not always hang on economists' every equation. When he joined the Journal staff in 1958, the paper did not employ any economists. It rarely ran an article about economics on its feature pages. If reporters used terms such as 'balance of trade', they had to define them because readers were assumed to be 'economic ignoramuses'. This was not an oversight on the Journal's part but a reflection of the low demand for the insights of economists. In those days, few of Wall Street's top firms bothered to employ professional economists: Salomon Brothers, for example, did not set up an economics department until 1961. Economists were just as rare at leading US corporations. The National Association of Business Economists had not been created. The economy, however, was doing just fine. Malabre fears economists have sold the public a false bill of goods. Through the use of computers and high-powered mathematics the profession has created a largely fraudulent aura of scientific competence. At the same time practitioners have made large sums by pretending to be able to predict the economic future. Yet their forecasts have proved anything but accurate. Moreover, economists have made grandiose claims for a succession of mutually inconsistent theories - Keynesian economics, monetarism and supply-side economics. In the author's view, none lived up to expectations and each created as many problems as it solved. Malabre's first swipe is at John Maynard Keynes. His theories, he argues, had absolutely nothing to do with the US's superior economic performance after the second world war - for the simple reason that Keynesian professors did not begin to exert much influence in Washington until the election of John F Kennedy in 1960. In the 1940s and 1950s policymakers still followed the old rules - balanced budgets, sound money and so on. The author marvels at the extraordinary hubris of the Keynesian gurus (mostly from Cambridge, Massachusetts) of the 1960s: the Paul Samuelsons and Walter Hellers. Many Keynesians seemed convinced that scientific 'demand management' could abolish the business cycle. Yet as soon as Kennedy and Johnson tried to put their ideas into practice everything came unstuck. Their legacy was not endless economic expansion but the inflationary crack-up of the 1970s and the budget deficits that still haunt the US. The next craze - monetarism - was no better. Indeed, Malabre recalls with shame how 'super salespeople' such as Milton Friedman duped him. Friedman assured Malabre in long discussions that there was a reliable short-term link between monetary growth and inflation, but somehow forgot to mention that the velocity of circulation (the rate money changes hands) could vary. Malabre recalls with shame how Friedman 'virtually dictated' articles to him which ran at length on the Journal's front page. Yet the relationship between money and inflation proved more complex than Friedman claimed; by the late 1980s central banks were not sure they could define money, let alone control its growth. Malabre reserves his strongest invective for 'supply-side' economics - the theory that tax cuts would generate so much growth they would pay for themselves. He always regarded this as 'nonsense of the worst sort' but had to watch helplessly as the Journal's influential editorial page became prime sponsor of the new gospel. He argues the theory was so daft it could never have won political support without the tireless advocacy of Journal writers such as Jude Wanniski and Robert Bartley. It led, he claims, to record budget deficits, a collapse of US savings and investment and a reduction in the economy's potential growth rate. The lesson from these debacles, says Malabre, is that economists must learn to be humble. They are not scientists. They cannot predict the future. They have at best a limited understanding of the economy. Their policies are hard to implement and often backfire in unexpected ways. Policymakers, meanwhile, should be less gullible and recognise that the economy has a natural rhythm  -the business cycle - which they can do little to tame. They should concentrate on the simple things, like keeping their budgets in balance. Malabre hints that the economics profession, at least in the US, may now be losing ground. He reports that many companies have reduced their economic staff since the mid-1980s: Citibank, for example, once employed more than 50 economists but now makes do with only a handful. At Harvard, government has overtaken economics as the most popular undergraduate major. President Clinton's economics team consists mainly of lawyers rather than economists. All this suggests economists may now be paying a price for their exaggerated claims to omniscience. It was time somebody took a shot at economists. Malabre has got his revenge on the eggheads who lectured him for so many years. But his critique, though highly entertaining, is probably too damning. Most economists subscribe to a core of theory - mostly micro-economic - that is useful and that should be heeded by politicians. It is the egotistical forecasters and 'super salespeople' that give the profession a bad name.</p>

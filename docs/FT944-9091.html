			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Deregulation boost for Japan by year 2000: Keidanren sees short-term rise in unemployment Full-scale deregulation of the Japanese economy would cause a temporary rise in unemployment and a drag on growth, leading to a net rise in prosperity in six years. That is the main conclusion of a report* by the Keidanren, Japan's leading business lobby, in support of its campaign to encourage the government to fulfil promises to curb the administrative controls which constrain an estimated 40 per cent of industrial activity. The Keidanren predicts that the collapse of inefficient businesses as a result of increased competition would wipe Y10,000bn (Pounds 64bn) off gross domestic product and put 2.84m people out of work in the next few years. A rise in imports - already evident in trade figures - would come at the cost of a fall in domestic production, says the study. By the year 2000 however, consumer prices would have fallen enough to produce a rise in real incomes and demand, which would feed through to an eventual rise in output. It cites forecasts of a 20 per cent fall in consumer prices by 2000, from the present level, around 50 per cent above average prices in New York, London, Paris and Berlin. This would lead to a net increase in 740,000 jobs and a Y177,000bn rise in national wealth over the six years, equivalent to 5 per cent of GDP a year, according to a Keidanren economic model. Its forecasts are hypothetical, given the government's reluctance to deregulate faster than the vested interests which help keep it in power will allow, and companies' traditional aversion to making redundancies. Yet the study is one of the clearest analyses yet of the practical problems ahead for Japan's latest deregulation drive, started just over a year ago by the former government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. To ease the shock of transition to a freer economy, the Keidanren calls for joint government-private action to improve 'social capital'. By that it means improving urban infrastructure, telecommunications and improving Japan's current slim social services. The study also urges the government to promote venture capital companies, to encourage small business to flourish in new markets opened up by deregulation. It calls for tax breaks for start-up companies, financial aid for their long-term investments and easier listing requirements for the over-the-counter (OTC) market. OTC listing rules are far higher than in the US, birthplace of modern venture capitalism, the Keidanren says. The industries most likely to grow as a result of deregulation include service sectors, where Japanese productivity lags well behind the US and Europe, the study suggests. These include, sport, travel, telecommunications, multi-media and environmental businesses, says the Keidanren. Irrespective of deregulation, the study forecasts a growth in services for the elderly, where Japan has the world's fastest ageing population profile.

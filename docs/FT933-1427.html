			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Tracking profits to the south - Canadian railways branching into new markets MENTION Canadian Pacific, and Canadians and foreigners alike are apt to conjure up an image of a coast-to-coast railway snaking through the Rocky Mountains and striking out across the prairies. That image is rapidly being overtaken by a less romantic reality. Canada's two railway companies, Canadian Pacific and the government-owned Canadian National, are paying less attention to the thinly populated Rockies and prairies, in favour of more profitable business to the south in the US and Mexico. 'With globalisation and free trade, we're seeing the business opportunities being much more north-south traffic flows within the continent, as opposed to east-west,' says Mr John Guppy, CN's senior vice-president for marketing. CN recognised the trend last year by combining its Canadian and US operations under a single corporate umbrella, known as CN North America. The Canadian railways' growing north-south focus is a response to the emergence of an integrated North American market as customs duties are eliminated and other trade barriers fall under the 1989 US-Canada free trade pact. Rail traffic between Canada and Mexico, though still small, is also growing rapidly as business seeks to capitalise on the North American free trade agreement, due to take effect on January 1. The southbound expansion by the Canadian railways is also explained by rising competition from US railways and road transport. US west coast ports and transport companies have already garnered more than two-thirds of the container traffic from the Far East to Toronto and Montreal. Mr Gil Mackie, CP's executive vice-president, says the Canadians suffer from a lack of traffic density, which is where US railways have an important advantage through their cost structures. He adds: 'If we're going to get the level of efficiency we need, we need to expand our businesses.' The top priority for both CP and CN has been to secure their access from eastern and western Canada to Chicago, the hub of surface transport in North America. CN cemented a western link last year by allying with Burlington Northern, the aggressive US railway company which runs a line from CN's railhead at Duluth, on the western tip of Lake Superior, to Chicago. Under the agreement, CN can run its own trains on BN's track, with only a crew change at Duluth. In the east, CN's trump card is a proposed CDollars 200m (Pounds 99m) cross-border tunnel between the US and Canada, under the St Clair River north of Detroit. The tunnel, due to be opened late next year, is to accommodate the double-stack container trains which have become one of the railways' most potent weapons in their drive to bring down costs. The tunnel is expected to lop 12 hours off the train-and-barge journey from Toronto to Chicago. CP has taken a slightly different approach. Besides numerous alliances with US carriers, it has bought two US railways: the Soo Line in the mid-west and the Delaware and Hudson in the north-east. These acquisitions have helped to propel CP into the domestic US market. Mr Mackie says that aspect was an afterthought, but 'the more experience we get, the more we understand it and recognise the potential. I think we'll see more and more of our operations within the US.' The opportunities in a wider North American market are matched, however, by the threat from powerful, low-cost US railroads and road transporters within Canada. Under the 1987 National Transportation Act, Canadian shippers can ask a government agency to impose a freight rate for a carrier competing with CP or CN. The Canadian railway is left to haul the goods to the nearest connecting point with the US carrier - just the type of short-haul business which CP and CN are trying to leave. The Canadian carriers are working on three fronts to overcome their handicaps. First, they are lobbying governments in Canada and the US to drop rules which put them at a disadvantage against their cross-border rivals. Canada's high taxes on locomotive fuel and property are one sore point. CN and CP estimate that their tax bill is the equivalent of about Dollars 200m a year higher than it would be if they were based in the US. Furthermore, US railways can write off their investments almost twice as quickly. Second, the Canadian companies are pulling out the stops to bring down costs. Their efforts range from the closure of loss-making lines in Canada to greater emphasis on double-stack container trains. One short line has already been bought by a US company, Railtex, which specialises in restoring this type of operation to profitability. Third, CN and CP are building their North American business on the old adage that, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Beside their alliances with US railways - such as Burlington Northern, Conrail and CSX - the Canadian companies are forging links with road rivals on both sides of the border. These alliances reflect the explosive growth in the past three years of 'inter-modal' shipments, involving the use of both road and rail. The goal is for railways to focus on profitable, long-distance routes while trucks act as short-haul feeders. CN and CP are banking heavily on their 'piggy-back' trains, which carry trailers equipped with both truck tyres and train wheels. According to Mr Mackie, CP's piggy-back traffic has reached a new record every month this year.</p>

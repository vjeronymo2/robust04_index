			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Observer: Opening up Good to see Derek Bonham, the new chief executive of Hanson, stamping his authority on the conglomerate by holding Hanson's first-ever analysts' meeting after this week's full-year results. It is hard to imagine any other Footsie company not having a regular analysts' meeting. Could it have anything to do with the increased influence of the new Mrs Bonham, who in a previous incarnation was Hanson's US investor relations contact? Whatever the reason it is the sort of public relations gesture which doesn't cost much, apart from the hire of a posh hotel like The Lanesborough. It proves that Lords Hanson and White can delegate, but whether they will listen to the feedback from the meeting is another matter.</p>

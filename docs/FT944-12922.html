			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Outdoors: One ski in the grave - but no parrots / FT Ski Expedition Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a round-the-world trip. They are in New Zealand. I have joined New Zealand's One Ski In The Grave Club. Although one is supposed to be 55, when I applied for membership for Nigel, my skiing chum in Hampstead, London, they made on exception for me. At 50, I am old enough to qualify as a veteran. However after an exhilarating day's helicopter skiing in the Harris Mountains (Lucy's first full day of heli-skiing) I feel it may be some time before both skis are entombed. We thrived in excellent corn snow on Roller Coaster and Gold Mine Ridge and found good powder on Twin Falls. We also landed on the spectacular Tasman Glacier in a Pilatus ski-plane. While the skiing was undemanding, the scenery - not dissimilar to the Vallee Blanche in Chamonix was superb. Bob Monro, our guide, even led us through tunnels in the huge ice-falls, and on one occasion we took off our skis and climbed into a series of tomb-like ice-caves in a huge crevasse. Meanwhile we have become the latest victims of New Zealand's unique Alpine Parrot, the Kea. This comical bird - which waddles and hops its way around every ski area in South Island - cannot resist sinking its sharp beak into anything malleable. Ski gloves, cardboard cups, picnic leftovers, or - in our case, rubber clips on our ski-rack - the Kea will go for it. Sometimes there is no escape. The official archives of Mount Robert recall that even in the primitive alpine lavatories, 'with a large gap above the door, the occupant would invariably be subjected to 'Charlie' Kea's beady eyes as it hung upside down from the roof. Should the door be accidentally left open, it would be seen flying off trailing a huge streamer of toilet paper.' At Porter Heights, one of these clownish birds got inside a lift operator's rucksack and ate his sandwiches while he was standing, oblivious, a few feet away. More seriously, Keas frequently gnaw their way through rubber seals on car windscreens and rip off the insulation around electrical components on ski lifts. Many ski resort staff would cheerfully shoot them, but this would result in a hefty fine. Recently a European tourist was heavily fined for trying to smuggle Keas out of the country in tubes stuffed into his trousers. They are said to be worth Pounds 50,000 to collectors.</p>

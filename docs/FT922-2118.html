			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Report prompts rethink of law THE GOVERNMENT has agreed to consider changes to the Financial Services Act in the light of the confidential report by Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, on supervision of the Maxwell companies. But ministers have indicated that they will wait until they have seen not only the report but the detailed assessment of it by the Securities and Investments Board (SIB). Mr Anthony Nelson, the economic secretary, also signalled yesterday that the government was unlikely to try to arrange publication of the report as a parliamentary paper, in order to deal with the legal difficulties that are said to exist with publishing a full report. In response to a question from Mr David Shaw, one of the Tory MPs leading the parliamentary campaign on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners, Mr Nelson said that Treasury officials were discussing with SIB 'the scope of SIB's ability to publish reports within the powers transferred to them under the act'. The MPs believe criticism of some of the professional advisers to the Maxwell companies will increase the prospect of help for the pensioners. The Treasury is said to be considering arranging for publication of the report's conclusions and findings. It is also conscious of the need to maintain some broad consistency between the extent of what is published about the supervision of Maxwell companies and the report of the Bingham inquiry into BCCI. MPs are pressing Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, to make a formal approach to the Liechtenstein authorities to release information about the Maxwell affair. A delegation of MPs saw officials at the Swiss embassy, which acts in Liechtenstein's interests, and were told that co-operation could only follow a formal request.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sydney, June 16 (AFP) -- The Australian government  has summoned Chinese Ambassador Shi Chunlai to protest his  country's June 10 nuclear test blast, officials said Thursday.    "Senior department officials protested to him about the test  yesterday (Wednesday) and reiterated our view that it was deeply  disappointing," said a spokesman for the Department of Foreign  Affairs and Trade in Canberra.    China carried out the underground blast, which had a  strength  of 10 to 40 kilotonnes of TNT according Australian scientists,  at its Lobnor test site on Friday.</p>

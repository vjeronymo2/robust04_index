			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages in italics as published] </F>   [Text] Henry W. Anderson, Belizean ambassador to Guatemala,  yesterday said his government is prepared to begin negotiations  on the territorial dispute with Guatemala; adding that a  commission has been created for this purpose and only the final  details must be settled.    The Guatemalan Government has recognized Belize's  independence; therefore, we have accepted the fact that a border  dispute prevails between the two countries, a situation we hope  will be handled cordially, he said. Regarding the  organization of a Belizean Council, the ambassador said this is  considered positive because it is a sign the Guatemalan  Government is prepared to begin negotiations to settle the  dispute.    Belize is interested in establishing trade, cultural,  and sports relations, not only with Guatemala but with all of  Central America; and that is one of the reasons that prompt us  to be prepared to negotiate what is negotiable, Anderson  said. The ambassador also said he cannot release the names of  the persons who make up the Belizean commission that will  participate in the negotiations, because he does not have them.    He also referred to the role played by the media in the  case,  which is important, to establish the objective atmosphere  necessary to settle relations between the States of Guatemala  and Belize. The diplomat added that Belize's recognition as an  independent state by the media, and the illustration of this on  the region's maps, will represent a great step forward.</p>

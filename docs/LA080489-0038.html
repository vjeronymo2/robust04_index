			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> DELICATE CULTURAL FLAVOR IN 'BOWL OF TEA'  </P> <P> Wayne Wang gets shadows and a honey-soft glow into the images of his fine new  film "Eat a Bowl of Tea" (Music Hall). Pinned down in darkness, the flesh tones  gleam like peach-skin pearls. Like his last movie, the vacuous but gaudily shot  thriller "Slamdance," "Tea" resembles a sort of film noir under glass. But it's  a delicate, rummy little film noir that doesn't heave murder and cliches at us.  The melodramatic plot points are buried within a naturalistic, nostalgic story,  set in an era and place -- the late '40s in New York's Chinatown -- that begins  to seem stylized as a Czech puppet film.  </P> <P> Based on Louis Chu's 1961 novel, "Tea" is about a young Chinatown couple  pressured so outrageously to produce children that, finally, they can't even  make love. This is no smutty joke. The Exclusion Laws, in effect for 60 years  until they were repealed in the mid-'40s, had banned women and new immigrants  from entering the country. Chinatown, in the late '40s, was a community of  aging virtual bachelors.  </P> <P> So, swarming around the movie's young couple -- Army vet Wang Ben Loy (Russell  Wong) and his immigrant bride Mei Oi (Cora Miao, the wife of director Wang) --  are an enclave of grinning old voyeurs who can barely contain their lascivious  curiosity. Deprived of marital sex and family, they turn the wedding pair into  both heroes and butts. Worst of all is Ben Loy's father, Wang Wah Gay (Victor  Wong), who's seen his prestige rise as a result of the marriage and fears it  will topple if they can't produce. The joker in this randy deck is a wily,  chubby Lothario named Ah Song, played with beaming panache by Hong Kong comedy  star Eric Tsang Chi Wai.  </P> <P> The couple, in turn, are drowned in romantic fantasy: the plush, moonstruck  images they've flushed out of movies and pop songs. Wang stages the action  against creamy '40s pop ballads -- a Chinese chanteuse, languorously crooning  "Slow Boat to China" -- scat songs and standards. And he surrounds his lovers  with great lustrous images out of movies. When Ben Loy woos Mei Oi in her  village, they're before a huge screen showing Capra's "Lost Horizon." Later on,  the couple get hot with Orson and Rita in Welles' "Lady From Shanghai," and,  still later, the romanticism has shriveled to pint-size: a scene from Cukor's  "Holiday" on a tiny TV, which they all but ignore.  </P> <P> Wang's major subject is the fusion of Chinese and American cultures. In "Eat a  Bowl of Tea" -- a vernacular phrase that roughly means "Take your medicine" --  he's again examining it with irony and affection. One of his funniest insights  is in the way he replaces cliched images of smiling, remote, somewhat sinister  Sino-Americans with earthy and pragmatic urban wise guys, more realistic  cousins of the slangy, extroverted hipsters Keye Luke played in the '40s.  Indeed, one flaw in the film may be that Mei Oi is too Americanized, acclimated  too rapidly. This Chinese girl, fresh from the countryside, in the end, cops  attitudes that seem more compatible with post-'70s liberation.  </P> <P> The youngsters are good but sometimes facile. The oldsters around them shine.  As Wah Gay, Wong gives another eccentric and endearing comic performance. He is  a great oddball camera subject: His face looks like a withered fruit split down  the middle and pasted back together slightly askew, with a crooked, slithery  grin and the eyes popping frenziedly in either direction. His character here  isn't like the warmhearted "uncle" he played in Wang's "Dim Sum." This is a  warm-hearted, patriarchal nut-case and Wong acts him with the unabashed comic  fervor of Charley Grapewin's Grampaw Joad in "The Grapes of Wrath."  </P> <P> Judith Rascoe's screenplay is so briskly compressed, the movie feels almost  distilled. Shot in Hong Kong, in sets that are like a dollhouse vision, the  characters are seen flailing around in their little rituals of love, cultural  adjustment, betrayal, shame and violence, just as trapped in the plot as they  are in conventions and culture. But there's nothing stifling or ragged about  the imagery in "Eat a Bowl of Tea" (MPAA-rated PG-13, despite sexual content).  It's like a photo album with the pages being precisely turned, one after the  other. That's the key to the movie: a mixture of love and sarcasm. Like those  medicinal herb teas, it's steeped in bitterness and warmth, soaked in tradition  and life. MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

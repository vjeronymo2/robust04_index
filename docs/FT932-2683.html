			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mr Tovarevic's pigs go wild for acorns - Serbian farmer's answer to soaring feed costs WHEN THE price of animal feed soared by 500 per cent because of UN sanctions against Yugoslavia, Mr Toma Tovarevic moved his 1,300 pigs to a wood near Belgrade to rear them on acorns. Mr Tovarevic, who claims to be Serbia's largest pig producer, says that veterinarians were afraid his pure-bred Yorkshires would never survive the rigours of life in the wild. 'I was willing to take the risk. Otherwise, I'd be selling at well below cost,' he says. 'In fact, it's worked out well.' The pigs that hurtle out of the undergrowth in response to the sound of Mr Tovarevic's jeep look the picture of health. They have the run of 28,000 hectares (70,000 acres) of state-owned oak and poplar woods beside the Sava river, which provides them with a supply of extra protein in the form of newts and frogs. 'They'll eat anything they find in this wood. I give them a little corn at night and in the morning, but my feeding costs are down by more than 80 per cent,' he says. Mr Tovarevic pays nothing for using the Kupinovo wood. He took advantage of a new law that opened up state forests to pasturage by local residents. His main expense was building pig shelters, which are roofed with metal plates from a bankrupt newspaper printing plant. Mr Danilo Viskovic, a Belgrade University veterinarian, says: 'It takes an extra month to get pigs raised in the open to market weight. But the quality of the meat is better and you don't have as much illness as with pigs kept in sties.' Mr Tovarevic has also moved 150 beef cattle to the wood. He plans to add 500 sheep. 'The numbers would triple if it were still possible to export,' he says. Meat production in Serbia is down by an estimated 30 per cent this year. Sanctions have eliminated a flourishing export trade in beef and lamb, mainly to the Middle East. In addition, pork and baby beef was exported to Greece and Italy. Serbia earned about Dollars 87m in 1990 from exports of meat and meat products, mostly ham, salami and bacon supplied to the former Soviet Union. 'We had well developed export arrangements for the Middle East. To avoid having to export live animals, we slaughtered here according to Islamic practice and sent butchered meat as air freight,' says Mr Milorad Gilic of Srbcoop, a leading meat producer. Srbcoop earned Dollars 7m from meat exports to Middle East countries in 1990, much of it produced on its own farms. Another Dollars 4m worth went to western Europe. Domestic sales are also shrinking as Serbia's economic position worsens. With hyper-inflation taking hold, meat prices are rising by at least 100 per cent each week. Few Serbian families in towns can afford to eat meat more than once or twice a month. In villages around Belgrade, pigs are being slaughtered at home to provide stores of bacon and ham rather than being sent to market. 'It's not just that fewer people can afford to buy fresh meat. Our products plant may have to close because salami and sausages are getting too expensive,' Mr Gilic says.</p>

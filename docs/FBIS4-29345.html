			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  will likely hold subcabinet-level talks on telecommunications  trade around June 22 and 23, a Foreign Ministry official said  Thursday [16 June].    The official was briefing reporters after the end of the  first-day session of two-day working-level telecom trade talks  in Tokyo. Both sides avoided discussing the quantitative aspect  of "objective criteria" in gauging the openness of Japan's  telecom market, the official said. Friday's session will also  refrain from addressing quantitative criteria, the thorniest  issue under the bilateral trade "framework" negotiations, he  said.    Talks on improving U.S. access to the Japanese telecom  market  resumed in early June after a hiatus of three and half months  following the Feb. 11 disruption of the summit talks between  then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S.  President Bill Clinton.</p>

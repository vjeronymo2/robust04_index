			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / People: Coutts quits APV over personality clash APV, the big producer of food and drink manufacturing equipment, is looking for a new executive director following the surprise resignation of Neill Coutts with immediate effect. Coutts joined APV in 1991, and had responsibility for APV Crepaco, the US process engineering company for the dairy and beverage industries, and for the components business. His departure is put down to a personality clash with Clive Strowger, APV's chief executive. 'There is nothing sinister about this,' said Neil French, APV's finance director, yesterday. 'It was just a question of two people finding it difficult to get on.' There were no disagreements over policy. Strowger will take on Coutts' responsibilities temporarily, which will give him an opportunity to evaluate whether Coutts' successor should be an internal or external appointment, said French. In March, APV announced that 1993 pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 13.4m, from Pounds 20.2m a year earlier, but struck a positive note on orders and future prospects.</p>

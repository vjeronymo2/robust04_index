The truce will be effective only in the northern region of  the country where the recontras operate, Mendieta said minutes  after opening a meeting attended by ranking chiefs of the Army,  the Government Ministry, and the Catholic Church, as well as  representatives of the OAS International Support and  Vertification Commission (CIAV). The meeting will study a  disarmament proposal submitted last Thursday by the Catholic  Church and writer Pablo Antonio Cuadra, director of LA PRENSA,  which is owned by President Violeta de Chamorro.    Last evening the so-called recontras announced a unilateral  cease-fire and requested assistance in evacuating their wounded,  one week after the Church announced its peace plan.</p>

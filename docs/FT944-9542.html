			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Elektrowatt net income falls just short of record Elektrowatt, the Swiss power generation and engineering group, said net income in the year to September 1994 was slightly below the previous year's record SFr212m (Dollars 165m). No figure was given. Mr Oskar Ronner, chief executive, said the group was hit hard by the strength of the Swiss franc. Consolidated sales rose only 3 per cent to SFr4.9bn and new orders were up 8 per cent. He added that the group would at least maintain its dividend and held out the possibility of a special bonus payment in recognition of its jubilee. Elektrowatt, in which the CS Holding financial services group has a 46.3 per cent stake, said sales of electric power were 4 per cent higher at SFr1.7bn. The engineering and contracting division lifted sales 6 per cent to SFr900m, but incurred a loss because of provisions on two projects. Holderbank Financiere Glarus, the world's largest cement producer, expects consolidated net income to jump 48.1 per cent to SFr425m in 1994, due to improved results of subsidiaries in Europe and North America. Net sales would rise 3.2 per cent to SFr8.7bn, with shipments of cement and clinker rising 6.5 per cent to 49.2m tonnes, it said. Mr Thomas Schmidheiny, chairman, said Holderbank planned to launch a programme of American depositary receipts in the US next year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 25 (CNA) -- Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang  of the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)  warned Sunday that Taiwan's worsening investment environment has  prompted multinational enterprises to withold investment here.    Britain's ICI, U.S.-based Glaxo and DHL, and even Taiwan's  Acer will cut the size of their business in Taiwan, according to  an investment willingness survey comissioned by the CEPD.    Hsiao said the survey showed that some 30 percent of all  foreign business groups lacked confidence in Taiwan's investment  climate and are making plans to gradually withdraw capital from  Taiwan in the next few years and shift their Asian business  centers to Singapore or Mainland China.    Most manufacturers surveyed said Taiwan's investment climate  had become worse over the past five years, creating problems in  their investment and production plans, Hsiao noted.    Hsiao explained that the survey listed Taiwan's labor  shortage, rising labor costs, skyrocketing land prices, low  administrative efficiency and deteriorating quality of life as  most affecting manufacturers' investment willingness.    If there is no significant improvement in the domestic  investment climate, some international enterprises will consider  narrowing their business scale here and may even leave the  island, Hsiao warned.    Hsiao added that the survey results have stunned the  government, which planned for increased investment after the  completion of the six-year national development plan in 1996.  The results also run counter to the government's plans to  develop Taiwan into an Asia- Pacific business operations center,  Hsiao said.    Some of the multinational enterprises already have concrete  plans to cancel new investment in Taiwan, which may have a  negative impact on the island's economy, Hsiao said.    Improving the domestic investment climate and keeping  foreign  manufacturers are the government two most urgent tasks, Hsiao  said.    The survey polled 103 manufacturers in the service, finance,  and manufacturing fields, including President Foods, Jardine  Fleming, Nestle, Bayer, 3M, American Express, Texas Instruments,  Westinghouse, IBM, AT&amp;T, Citibank, United Airlines, Lockheed,  BBC, Canon, Philips, NEC, Ford Motor Co., General Electric,  General Motors, Microsoft Corp., and Acer.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Enzo Roggi: "We Run the Risk of </F> Ungovernability"]    [Text] The Second Republic has been born under the sign of  ungovernability. As we write, a right-wing majority is emerging  that has immediately shown deep divisions toward forming a  prospective government. The transition to the new configuration  of the Italian system thus appears incomplete, riddled with  difficulties, marked, it is true, by the success scored by the  various forces that rallied around Berlusconi, but also by a  strong presence of the Left. In addition to electoral  consensus, this is the result of a unity that represents an  unprecedented and valuable heritage that should be put  immediately to the test. The outcome expresses the climate of  confused hostility that marked the last stage in particular of  the election campaign: the total disregard for the rules, the  body blows, the prevarication in the propaganda, the cunning  rumors spread to further behind-the-scenes speculations.    In the midst of so many difficulties, it is by no means  rhetorical to mention the performance by the progressive  alliance, which, while failing to attract all the votes that it  required, has nevertheless introduced an element of rationality,  reason, national responsibility, and good sense. Within this  alliance, the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] emerges once  again as the largest and best structured force, capable of  mobilizing valuable grass-roots energy that has enabled it to  honor its role as the major force uniting, leading, and  gallantly supporting its allies. It remains to be seen how all  this will translate into seats, but meanwhile, this acquired  capital must be preserved and invested in the harsh reality that  the poll opens up.    The undeniable success of the so-called Freedom Pole is the  fruit of a combination of factors that cannot be reduced to  sticking together. The single factor that all the components of  the cartel clearly had in common was fear of success by the  progressive alliance: a negative feeling, a sort of psychosis  brought to the point of paroxysm by the unprecedented force of  its propaganda, which succeeded, to a certain extent, in  resurrecting old fears, ghosts that wormed their way into the  psychological and political void left by the old regime. As to  the rest, in other words its platform, political consistency,  and ideological identity, the right-wing camp presented no  credentials as a cohesive, credible governing alliance. The  conflict, the reciprocal, irremovable repulsion between the MSI  [Italian Social Movement] and the League, is the most obvious  aspect of this lack of internal cohesion, which seems likely to  have enormous political and parliamentary repercussions and to  create a situation detrimental to the Right's ambitions.  Although the mediating role performed by Berlusconi (who has  promised a semi-alliance with the League in the north and a  semi-alliance with the MSI in the south) has made it possible to  pull in the whole moderate and conservative vote, it has not  solved the political issue of the unity of a right-wing  government. The statements in which Bossi has ruled out a full  governing deal with the "reactionary right" of National Alliance  in the name of a democratic undertaking on which the League does  not intend to renege, may well mean that the Right's success  will by no means translate automatically into the formation of a  governing majority. The Berlusconi front's strong point, so to  speak, lay in bringing together the votes of the opposing  tendencies, the old seeking continuation by other means and the  new protest movement that reduces everything to driving out the  previous political personnel. The outcome is that this Right  emerges as something very similar to what dominated the last  decade of the first republic, with the addition of explicit  regressive intentions in the social welfare field. All in all,  it is a large but divided Right lacking unity in its goals and  in its methods for pursuing them.    The centrist PPI [Italian People's Party] and Mario  Segni-led  forces may be assessed as follows: They refused to believe in  the logic of bipolar democracy. Indeed they rejected it with  incomprehensible determination, and now they have to come to  terms with the de facto bipolarism imposed by the electorate,  albeit via a messy voting system. They rejected the path of a  joint commitment to rebuild and reform Italian democracy,  keeping the Right out, and they made the mistake of thinking  that the country's vast moderate sector would rally to the  forces proclaiming substantial continuity with the party that  had dominated the first republic. But the issue that the poll  now raises, and in no uncertain terms, is that of the quality of  the transition and of the forces that can succeed in coalescing  to lead it, including the forces of democratic Catholicism.    This election, the most difficult in our history, has buried  the old Italy but has not given us a predefined future. This  creates enormous problems on the domestic political front and  raises major uncertainties for our international partners.  Although it will be difficult, reconstruction cannot be  avoided. From today onward, we all bear greater responsibility  for our destiny.</p>

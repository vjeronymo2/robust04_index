			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT-MESA RACE COMES TO A BOIL AT FORUM  </P> <P> One of the most contentious board races in the history of the Newport-Mesa  Unified School District continued Friday with a volley of heated charges  exchanged over breakfast in the main ballroom of the exclusive Balboa Bay Club.  </P> <P> Board member Sherry Loofbourrow, documents in hand as her proof, charged that  her challenger, Jo Ellen Allen, belongs to an extremist group that tried to  have the novel "Of Mice and Men" and the movie "Romeo and Juliet" banned at  school districts across the nation.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, she knows nothing," Allen shot back.  </P> <P> Wendy Leece debated incumbent Rod MacMillian as to whether his 24 years on the  board was long enough.  </P> <P> Further, the challengers accused the incumbents of being a cozy club that has  kept the public at arm's length on important issues; not so, responded the  incumbents.  </P> <P> In a wide-ranging question-and-answer session, the six candidates discussed a  variety of issues, including sex education, censorship, reassignment of  principals and how much say parents have had in running the district's 26  schools.  </P> <P> About 100 to 150 people were at the forum, whose host was the Newport Harbor  Area Chamber of Commerce. Lawyer Jim Parker moderated the event, one of the  last before the at-large election Tuesday in the district. About 16,000  students from Costa Mesa, Newport Beach and Corona del Mar attend district  schools.  </P> <P> At the forum were incumbent MacMillan, 62, of Corona del Mar and challenger  Leece, 41, of Costa Mesa; incumbent Judith A. Franco, 52, and challenger Karen  Evarts, 48, both of Newport Beach; incumbent Loofbourrow, 48, and challenger  Allen, 43, both of Corona del Mar.  </P> <P> In a related action Friday, the 700-member Newport Mesa Federation of Teachers  cast its support to incumbents Franco, Loofbourrow and MacMillian. It was the  first endorsement in the teachers union's 21-year history.  </P> <P> "It was felt that because of the affiliations of some of the opposing  candidates with organizations which advocate censorship of textbooks, class  content and libraries, that the interests of students, teachers and the  community will best be served by the incumbents," the association announced in  a prepared statement.  </P> <P> During the Balboa Bay Club forum, Loofbourrow said Allen is a member of Eagle  Forum, a national political organization that the California Congress of  Parents, Teachers and Students Inc. (now the proper name for the state  organization still known as the PTA) has labeled extremist. Allen is state  president of the conservative women's organization founded by Phyllis Schlafly,  a proponent of traditional roles for women.  </P> <P> According to the PTA, Eagle Forum has tried to persuade school districts to ban  districts John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men," director Franco Zeffirelli's film  version of Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" and Shel Silverstein's poetry book,  "A Light in the Attic." The PTA also contends that Eagle Forum has worked  closely with Citizens for Excellence in Education, a group based in Costa Mesa  that argues that public schools are dominated by an atheist ideology.  </P> <P> Allen said that neither she nor the state branch of Eagle Forum participated in  any attempt to censor books or films.  </P> <P> "I am not an extremist, no matter what the PTA says," said Allen, who  emphasized her 15-year teaching career and who is now a lecturer at USC.  "Censorship is not my job. I have no hidden agenda, and sex education is not  the reason I am running. Academic excellence is."  </P> <P> Allen and also Leece have said, however, that they want abstinence to be the  chief focus of the district's sex education programs, and they contend that  some films and books are not appropriate for some schoolchildren.  </P> <P> Both are backed by the Committee to Restore Ethical and Traditional Education,  a group that supports "traditional values" and that wants to ban such films as  "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "The Breakfast Club" from classrooms.  </P> <P> Board and the Public  </P> <P> Turning to the matter of parents' relationship with the district, Franco denied  charges by Evarts, Leece and Allen that the board always votes unanimously and  that it neither considers nor respects public opinion on major policy  questions.  </P> <P> "We get a tremendous amount of input from teachers, parents and students,"  Franco said. "Our decisions are reached after lengthy deliberation. It takes  time to be conversant with the issues before we vote."  </P> <P> According to a high-ranking district official, the district has stressed  parental involvement for years, and parents have been heavily involved in  advisory councils for developing a sex education curriculum. Parents can also  review class materials and keep their children out of certain courses, she  said.  </P> <P> "We are doing everything we are accused of not doing," Loofbourrow said.  </P> <P> Said Leece: "I would like to go back to the Founding Fathers of this country,  when parents were the primary teachers of their children. We have gotten away  from this, and it has caused teen-age pregnancy, promiscuity and drugs. We need  to work with parents."  </P> <P> Leece, who describes herself as a fundamentalist Christian, teaches two  offspring at home and sends a third to Calvary Chapel High School in Santa Ana.  She says she represents thousands of parents who are dissatisfied with public  schools.  </P> <P> "You must take part in the system if you want to run," MacMillian said. Leece  "has never taken part."  </P> <P> Franco faces a strong challenger in Evarts, a Newport Beach library board  member who has raised the most campaign contributions -- $12,000 -- so far.  </P> <P> At the forum, Evarts said she would like to replace Superintendent John Nicoll  and put fresh blood in the administration. She said Nicoll and the board were  especially rude in their dealings with parents and students when they decided  to swap principals at two high schools in 1988.  </P> <P> The incumbents said some mistakes were made but that the principals, who were  looking for jobs outside the district before the swap, are now satisfied.  </P> <P> Asked how district expansion could be accomplished in light of the public's  aversion to taxes, Allen said she would have to meet with parents to see what  they would like.  </P> <P> Loofbourrow said the board is now researching ways to accommodate rising  enrollment, that it is looking at land management methods, refurbishing schools  and working with the Irvine Co. to develop new campuses.  </P> <P> Turning to the subject of MacMillian's 24 years on the board, Parker asked him  whether he has served long enough, as Leece contends he has. MacMillian  responded that he has been involved with youth organizations, schools and  sports since 1947 and that he has no intention of losing the race.  </P> <P> "I'm not tired," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Anna Samelova, editor of Slovak radio's Radiozurnal,  has strongly protested against the statement made by Peter  Kuchar, spokesman of the Interior Ministry of the Slovak  Republic, to the effect that some journalists used the events at  the Primatial Square on Monday, 14 March, to compromise the  police.    On that day at the Primatial Square, an unknown man hit  Samelova in the face with his fist. She asked a policeman  standing next to her for help. To her request, he replied: I  am not here.    The Radiozurnal editor denies that, at the beginning of the  Monday evening edition of Radiozurnal, she used the information  to politically compromise the police. She merely described what  happened at the square during a public radio broadcast.  However, she does not see the fact that she decided not to  press charges as a reason not to investigate the events and draw  appropriate conclusions on the part of competent bodies.</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Stock Exchange completes regional network THE London Stock Exchange has completed a regional network of five offices which it hopes will improve relations with quoted companies in the Midlands, the north, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The process has been completed by the opening of a Leeds office, joining those in Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and Belfast. Leeds and Belfast are representative offices, while share transfer settlements can be made at the other three. The network's completion marks the final transition from the era in which Britain's largest provincial cities each had its own stock exchange. The electronic marketplace finally made obsolete the last vestiges of the local exchanges. The advent of the new Taurus paperless trading system next year will also end local settlement. Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, Stock Exchange chairman, said: 'We hope to use our regional offices to improve relations with listed companies outside London. In the past we have been a purely regulatory body. We no longer see ourselves as merely a trade association for stockbrokers.' Sir Andrew said the new offices would offer commercial services to listed companies. They would also build contacts with locally based investors and investment institutions. The regional offices also run advisory groups of local stockbrokers, who meet quarterly to hear the opinions of local company chairmen and commentators. The outcome is then reported to Sir Andrew. For example, at last week's meeting of the north-west advisory group Mr Robert Hough, chairman of Manchester Ship Canal, asked for the exchange's 'yellow book' - the rules for quoted companies when reporting potentially price-sensitive activities - to be made more user-friendly. The cost of maintaining a Stock Exchange listing was also discussed, as were the difficulties created for the exchange's marketmakers by the large numbers of medium-sized or small regional companies whose shares are rarely traded.</p>

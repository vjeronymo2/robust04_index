			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: First Leisure Not many companies have come through the recession with gearing of just 12 per cent and pre-tax margins of 29 per cent. That First Leisure has managed to do so testifies to the quality of a management that refused to be seduced by the deceptively easy opportunities of the late 1980s. But it also suggests First Leisure may be an innately cautious company which will be slow to exploit the recovery. The question matters because First Leisure is approaching the time when it will have to rely on more than just organic growth to justify a historic multiple of 21. Investors might be willing to forgive the poor outlook for earnings this year. Not only will the pace of site openings slow; the company will also face an increase in its tax rate that was held down to an abnormally low 20 per cent in 1991-92 as a result of unclaimed capital allowances. A spate of site openings around the end of the current year and, presumably, some economic recovery should see a return to a more robust growth rate in 1993-94. First Leisure is also now well placed to take advantage of cheap property prices in the southeast to expand in a region which has hitherto seemed too expensive. That will still leave only limited growth prospects. First Leisure needs something more. Bingo seems the most likely possibility, but it will not be easy. Bass and Rank dominate the business. Neither is likely to prove a willing seller, which seems to block the acquisition route. Both would surely move to counter any competitive threat even if this were confined to under-exploited 'out-of-town' sites. First Leisure cannot prevaricate indefinitely, though, if it wants to outperform.</p>

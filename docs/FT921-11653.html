			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Political Notebook: The rail cost of privatisation There is only one manifesto commitment the Conservatives could make that might be as damaging as their 1987 poll tax pledge. That would be a promise to inject voters with bubonic plague. That view, offered only half-jokingly by one of the leading players in Mr John Major's cabinet, is understandable enough. Ideology was the driving force behind the poll tax. The party now is led by a careful man who puts common sense before abstract credo. His manifesto will preach caring Conservatism, not permanent revolution. The logic seems impeccable. The conclusion could prove misplaced. The debate over how the Conservatives should privatise the railways - assuming of course they win the election - has obscured a more basic political reality. As a handful of Whitehall insiders are beginning to realise, the break-up of British Rail has the volcanic potential to make the poll tax look like a small tremor. The government will fight the election committed to privatisation. Mr Malcolm Rifkind plans to publish a white paper sometime before then. The transport secretary had hoped to produce it in December. He presented the prime minister with what seemed then to be a plausible blueprint. Briefly, the network would be opened to competition; InterCity and the freight operations would be sold; the loss-making Network SouthEast and the other regional services would remain in state ownership but their operations would be franchised out to private companies. That model did not win instant approval in Downing Street. On one level, Mr Major's policy unit thought not enough detailed work had been done. How would the new system be regulated to ensure that operators ran essential services, how would subsidies be fixed, who would own the stations? On another level, Mr Major preferred the more romantic notion that the pre-1948 regional companies could be re-created. To complicate things, Mr Peter Lilley wanted much greater competition, throwing the Department of Trade and Industry's weight behind the idea of a separate rail-track authority on which operators would compete for business. The latest talk is of a hybrid solution: InterCity might be sold off intact, with regional companies revived and given permission to use its tracks. But some ministers have begun to stand back from the argument over detail to take a broader view of the political risks. They do not like what they see. Westminster gossip has it that Mr Chris Patten is among those arguing that the white paper should confine itself to general principles. British Rail is unlike any previous privatisation. It is a monopoly in which the customer travels on the production line. It loses vast amounts of money. It has no real prospect of making any. Even those parts - such as InterCity  -which are notionally profitable on paper would not survive real accounting criteria. Theoretically the network could be made profitable if fares for commuters in the south-east were raised by 50 per cent or so, the regional networks slashed, and the loss-making 'ends' chopped from the InterCity network. Those are hardly options, unless Mr Major wants to be certain of losing the election after next. Fares will go up. That is the most obvious lesson of all privatisations. But unless still more passengers are to be driven on to clogged roads or the government is ready to raise sharply the cost of motoring, the network will not survive without large state subsidies. The private-sector ethos and semblance of competition provided by franchising will not be a sufficient substitute for the taxpayers' money needed to make up for decades of under-investment. Nor is franchising as simple as it sounds. A glance at the mess made of the auctioning of commercial television licences provides ample evidence of the capacity for mistakes. It hardly matters if there is nothing new on TV-am for 12 months or so. Commuters from Tunbridge Wells would feel rather more aggrieved if a rail franchise operator decided to take a few trains from its schedule if its contract were not renewed. Such problems could be solved with enough money. But enthusiasts for privatisation have not paid enough attention to the Treasury agenda. Whitehall's most powerful department has a simple objective - to stop spending money on the railways. It usually gets its way. The Treasury's refusal to spend more money ensured the poll tax was destroyed before it started. Mr Major might reflect that voters felt the impact of that mistake once a year. If rail privatisation went wrong, millions would be reminded of his error twice a day.</p>

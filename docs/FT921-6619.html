			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / EC puts paid to sex discrimination in night work SIX European Community countries and Switzerland are intending this week to denounce the International Labour Organisation convention banning night work by women in industry. The move has been hailed by supporters as ending unjustified sex discrimination but decried by critics as increasing women's vulnerability to exploitation. After this week no Community country will be bound by the 1948 ILO Convention, whose 48 remaining adherents will be almost exclusively drawn from the Third World. Germany, Britain and Denmark never ratified the convention, and Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands pulled out 10 years ago. Now Belgium, France, Spain, Greece, Italy and Portugal are taking advantage of the latest year-long 'window' for revoking ratification of the convention which expires this month. Their decision reflects a ruling last year by the European Court that a French law forbidding nightwork by women was discriminatory, and so illegal under Community law. Governments and employers have also complained that the 1948 convention, which applies only to industry, is too rigid. In Switzerland, where the government's denunciation decision was preceded by a long public debate, trade unions argued that the nightwork ban (with exceptions) should be extended to men and expressed fears that scrapping it could make women especially vulnerable to pressure to work at night by employers because they tend to be cheaper to employ. Some estimates suggest that in the Swiss economy as a whole more women already work at night than men since they predominate in services such as nursing, hotels, cleaning and so on where nightwork is routine. The European Commission in Brussels has recommended that member countries ratify ILO Convention No. 171 of 1990 - a 'new generation', more flexible convention which aims to improve conditions for all nightworkers, men as well as women, in services as well as industry. The convention includes provisions on pay for unsocial hours, health monitoring, the right to transfer to day work for medical reasons and maternity protection. Switzerland has already said it plans to change its law on working conditions with ratification of the 1990 convention in mind.</p>

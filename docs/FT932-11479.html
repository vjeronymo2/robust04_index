			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / From Sinatra to Sinatra-plus: The G7 has established a new credibility but much has yet to be done Four months ago it was a joke. It now looks as though we are going to have to take the Group of Seven seriously again. After last week's spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund in Washington, economic policy co-ordination is looking in better fettle than for many years. The G7 finance ministers and central bank governors from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada not only managed to meet without squabbling; they put their names to mutually reinforcing measures designed to return the world economy to faster growth and less unemployment. They also broadened their present efforts to co-ordinate economic policy to include long-term issues such as labour market reform and curbing health care costs. The day after Thursday's G7 meeting, they gathered with representatives of the developing and former communist countries in the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee and turned their commitment to growth into a global effort. The Interim Committee appointed a referee - the IMF - to blow the whistle and cry foul if any country's economic and exchange rate policies threaten to create currency turmoil and upset the international community's efforts to achieve greater growth. That was the good news. But past experience tells that there is many a slip twixt cup and lip in international economic policy co-ordination. The goal of sustained non-inflationary growth is not new. It was trumpeted by the G7 and others in the 1980s only to be followed by the near stagnation of global economic output in 1991 and recession in many industrial countries including the US, Britain and Canada. Recession has now spread to Germany and the European continent while Japan is suffering its most worrying economic slow-down since the second world war. It does not require a cynic to see how the G7 countries can unite in their concern to foster growth and job creation. The one step that could give a boost to global growth prospects - completion of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks - remains uncertain. The G7 ministers last week repeated that a further opening of the international trading system was indispensable for maximising world growth, while President Bill Clinton pledged 'exceptional efforts' to bring the round to a close by the end of this year. But finance ministers can only exhort on trade issues while trade and agriculture ministers have in the past shown themselves impervious to their pleas. The US itself displays a curiously split personality to the outside world. Hours after Mr Clinton made his pledge on the trade round, his administration launched a volley of trade sanctions against Japan, Brazil, India and several other trading partners. This is a peculiar way of demonstrating liberal intentions. In the international monetary arena, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, has not been averse to treading on his partners' toes. The courtly Texan let drop his customary mask of benevolence when he talked up the yen in the weeks ahead of the G7 meeting, much to the annoyance of the Japanese government. However, he skilfully defused the issue by the time of the Washington gathering by permitting the US Federal Reserve to intervene shortly before the meeting to curb the yen's rise. The G7 is therefore still operating according to the Sinatra Doctrine, by which its members clearly put their own economic policy priorities first and 'do it my way' in terms of policy making. But Mr Horst Kohler, the state secretary at the German finance ministry and one of the chief G7 fixers, insisted last week that there has been a qualitative change in policy co-ordination. 'It is now Sinatra-plus,' he said. Certainly the contacts among the G7 countries have intensified since the Clinton administration took office. Last week's meeting was the third in as many months at ministerial level. The senior finance ministry officials who do so much of the work preparing the meetings now have a telephone conference line arranged to improve communications. Among the ministers, there seems to be a genuine spirit of goodwill. Mr Bentsen can claim much of the credit for this since first calling for a strengthening of the G7 co-ordination process in January. Under the Bush administration, America's partners learned to construe Washington's occasional urge to co-ordinate policies as an attempt to secure US policy goals with other peoples' money and effort. Mr Bentsen has avoided giving this impression, stressing the benefits of joint action. He has been careful to avoid megaphone diplomacy. Looking back over the past three months, there is much that the group can be pleased about. Economic policies in the big industrial countries are in better balance since the US took steps to reduce its budget deficit; Japan announced a fiscal package to boost its economy and the Bundesbank embarked on a programme of cautious but relatively frequent interest rate reductions. The G7 also has completed arrangements to set up a nuclear safety fund to deal with the dangers caused by Chernobyl-style nuclear reactors in the former Soviet Union. In mid-April the group agreed a package of aid measures for Russia which may have strengthened the hand of President Boris Yeltsin ahead of his referendum victory. Inevitably, more needs to be done. Because of their powerful position in the world, the G7 countries carry the overwhelming responsibility for bringing the Uruguay Round trade negotiations to a successful conclusion. Further efforts will be required in the years and months ahead to cut the US budget deficit, stimulate growth in Japan and reduce interest rates in Europe. But it is difficult not to agree with Mr Bentsen's verdict on events since he set out to revitalise the G7. 'Not bad for the first 100 days,' he said.</p>

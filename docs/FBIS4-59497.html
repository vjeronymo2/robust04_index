			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  arrived in Damascus this evening on a new shuttle tour aimed at  advancing the peace process, which is being obstructed because  of Israel's intransigent positions. On his previous visit, the  U.S. secretary left Damascus with queries about the Israeli  proposals that he had conveyed to Syria. The proposals, which  called for gradual Israeli withdrawal at long intervals, were  rejected by Syria, which stressed the need for a full and  comprehensive withdrawal to achieve a just and lasting peace.    The chief of U.S. diplomacy knows that his current tour will  not be any better than his previous ones if he fails to bring  new Israeli ideas or acceptance of full withdrawal from the  Golan and south Lebanon. U.S. State Department Spokesman  Michael McCurry stressed prior to his chief's tour that  Washington expects the peace process to be tough, suggesting  that Christopher will find it difficult to push ahead the  Syrian-Israeli track as long as negotiations continue to move in  a vicious circle.    It is clear that if Israel wants to apply the Gaza-Jericho  model to the other tracks, then it will not be able to  infiltrate the Syrian track, which is totally different from the  others, especially the Palestinian one. Informed sources point  out that Christopher's tour of the region is surrounded by risks  and difficulties and will not achieve its objectives as long as  the U.S. Administration does not pressure Israel into accepting  full withdrawal in exchange for full peace.    If Christopher ends his visit to Damascus stressing that his  country will play an effective role in advancing the peaceful  settlement--and this is exactly what Damascus is expecting from  him--then Syrian officials will not say more than they did the  last time: that they are awaiting his answers. If  Christopher's tour fails this time, and doubts about its results  came through the U.S. State Department spokesman who said that  Christopher does not expect a major achievement from any of his  upcoming tours, then this will shake the bases on which the  Madrid peace conference was launched and that the Geneva summit  between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill  Clinton emphasized, namely, adopting international resolutions  to implement the Israeli withdrawal. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, a Syrian media source stressed today that any  peace not based on comprehensive peace will be doomed to  failure. The source said Syria is not the PLO and is not  interested in peace outside the framework of international  resolutions and the U.S. initiative, which is based on the  principle of exchanging land for peace. The Syrian source said  Syria is expecting the American partner to play a responsible  role, put things on the right track, and help Tel Aviv rulers  decide to withdraw, dismantle settlements, and implement UN  Security Council resolutions.

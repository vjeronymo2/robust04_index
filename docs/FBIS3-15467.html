Nazeykin said the draft resolution submitted for  consideration by First Vice Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets  envisions allocating funds to TV and radio broadcasting  companies for them to prepare programs and communications  enterprises for their distribution services.    According to the document, TV and broadcasting companies  will  have to remove commercials from the state air time. They will  be broadcast at other time at commercial prices. Re-selling air  time is expected to be prohibited.    Nazeykin said it still remained unknown whether the document  will be approved by the government.    As for the state's debt to communications sector workers  worth 65.9 Bn [Billion] rubles which made them cut down air time  in many regions of Russia on February 10, the money has been  paid out, according to Nazeykin.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Many UK companies fail to reveal R&amp;D costs MANY British companies are not showing the amount they spend on research and development in their annual accounts in spite of an accounting standard normally requiring its disclosure. An analysis for the Financial Times by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monitoring service of accounts, shows that 10 per cent of quoted companies with evidence of R&amp;D expenditure do not publish the amount they spend. But SSAP 13, a UK accounting standard, says R&amp;D expenditure on the profit and loss account should be disclosed and analysed between spending in the current year and that capitalised over future years. There are notes on the treatment of R&amp;D in the accounting policies section of the latest accounts for companies including Rothmans International and Tate &amp; Lyle but no disclosure of amounts. Mr Jan Du Plessis, group finance director at Rothmans International, said his company did not provide a figure for R&amp;D because the amount was insignificant. It disclosed its accounting policy on R&amp;D because that was 'prudent'. Similarly, references to R&amp;D are made in the directors' reports of companies including Asda, RMC, BET and Forte, but none shows how much is spent. J Sainsbury's directors report says only that R&amp;D expenditure 'exceeds Pounds 4m'. From 597 companies which reported in the past year, 236 or 40 per cent refer to R&amp;D spending, usually in the directors' report or the accounting policies. However, 58 companies, or 25 per cent of those which show some evidence of R&amp;D, do not disclose the sums they spend.</p>

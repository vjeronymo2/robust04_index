			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (5): Contracts lead to corruption - Italian industry's image has been tarnished by political scandals THESE ARE testing times for Italy's construction industry. Already hard pressed by difficult economic conditions, the industry has recently come under fire after disclosures of corruption in public contracts. Earlier this year Milan magistrates, investigating irregularities in major projects, dented the construction industry's reputation when they ordered the arrest of senior executives of several construction companies, along with local politicians. To counteract the damage to the industry's image, the board of ANCE, the national building contractors' association, met last month to discuss the Milan kickback scandal. Pointing an accusing finger at increasing delinquency in Italian society generally, ANCE put much of the blame for corruption on the progressive spread of political influence. Recognising the high potential for corruption in the construction industry, the association called for clearer separation between politics and public administration and for greater transparency in awarding contracts. 'The construction industry hopes that not only will there be legal outcomes to the present cases, but that there will also be a reversal of the pollution in relations between the public authorities and firms.' Figures from ANCE show that the biggest public spenders are the ANAS highways authority (13.9 per cent of total public sector business of L31,461bn last year), the state itself (13.4 per cent), the southern development agency Agensud (11.8 per cent), the FS state railways (9 per cent) and the ENEL state electricity corporation (7.4 per cent). The authorities in Italy's many provinces and communes collectively accounted for 35.3 per cent of public sector construction business in 1991. Though public sector works accounted for only 21.7 per cent of total investment in construction last year - down from 1990's figure of 22.5 per cent - the absolute value nevertheless represented an appetising market for Italy's work-hungry contractors. If ANCE's forecasts are correct, however, they will be sharing a smaller cake in 1992. The association published figures earlier this year that point to an expected 3.9 per cent fall in the real value of public sector construction. Added to the 3.5 per cent real decline between 1990 and 1991, this will completely erode the growth that occurred between 1986 and 1990. But the outturn may be worse, ANCE officials now admit. As the recent government decision to freeze all non-essential work until October highlights, part of the solution to the problem of Italy's deficit-wracked public sector finances is likely to be a sharp brake on investment. Moreover, the policy of tightening the purse-strings may continue until the mid-1990s as the government attempts to put the accounts in order. Fortunately for Italy's contractors, there are some areas of light. While local authorities may expect a sharp reining back, ENEL's power station projects should not be affected. And ANCE is optimistic that work on Italy's TAV high-speed railway project will be under way before the end of the year. The contractors' association notes that the TAV's mixed public-private sector financing and management formula offers an innovative solution. With the past two years recording significant falls in the real value of investment in public sector construction, and a short to medium term that is full of imponderables, companies cannot rely on work from this segment of the market. Indeed, as ANCE officials note, the health of its membership depends on private sector business. And, though registering a significant slowdown, the volume of private sector construction nevertheless continued to grow last year. ANCE's figures record L73,762bn of total housing investment last year (new and improvements to existing stock), compared with L67,489bn in 1990. This represented a volume increase of 1.2 per cent, a modest performance when set against real growth figures of 2.4 and 1.7 per cent for 1988-89 and 1989-1990 respectively. Non-residential private sector construction provided business worth L39,730bn last year. Notwithstanding the downturn in the Italian economy, this was 1 per cent higher in real terms than in 1990. It represented, however, the end of strong upward trend. Real growth of less than 4 per cent had been recorded only twice since 1985: 1.6 per cent in 1986-87 and 3.8 per cent in 1987-88. ANCE's 20,000 member firms, whose payrolls account for about half of the 1m workers employed in the Italian construction industry, are facing a difficult period. Growth in private sector work is not expected to compensate for this year's sharp decline in public sector business. 'The economy is stagnant, and private sector construction activity reflects this. The recessionary climate is deterring industrial and commercial concerns from investment. Housebuilding has also slowed,' says an ANCE official. Indeed, the association's forecasts point to zero growth in the construction of new residential property this year. With ANCE expecting a 0.4 per cent downturn in the real volume of total public and private sector construction work this year, the first negative outturn since 1987, what prospects do foreign markets offer? Performance over the past decade, during which Italian contractors have registered a 75 per cent drop in business abroad, suggests that markets beyond Italian borders, reachable only by the largest firms, will not ameliorate the pain being felt at home.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ITALIAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY: TURNOVER IN LBN  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          1988      1989      1990      1991      1992*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Residential: new       33,507    36,445    40,736    44,435    47,101 Residential: improvements           22,184    23,599    26,753    29,327    31,398 Non-residential: private sector         28,075    31,708    36,423    39,730    42,535 Non-residential: public works           24,423    27,020    30,187    31,461    32,047 Total construction    108,189   118,772   134,099   144,953   153,081  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Real change (%)          2.3      3.9       2.5       0.1      -0.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *ANCE estimate Source: ANCE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

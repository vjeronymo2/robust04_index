The conflict  can be solved only by negotiations, she stressed.    Stiborova pointed to the possible escalation of the conflict  which would endanger civilians and UNPROFOR forces, including  the Czech units operating in the area. She said she believed  that the security of the Czech Republic would be jeopardized as  well, due to its "being involved in the War conflict." The SLB  was opposed to the strengthening of the Czech military unit in  the region in 1993, and now it urges its withdrawal, she stated.    The conflict could be solved by immediately convoking a  peace  conference attended by representatives of the former Yugoslav  lands, representatives of international institutions and top  European politicians, Stiborova said.    The SLB thinks that world politicians who should have  efficiently intervened in the talks between the antagonists in  Bosnia have so far taken part in them only as observers, she  added.</p>

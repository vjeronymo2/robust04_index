			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW SAFE IS LAX?  </P> <P> I am disgusted by the Republican Administration's lackadaisical manana  attitude: We cannot expect state-of-the-art equipment until 1998.  </P> <P> By that time, the equipment will be that many years behind the current state of  the art. With our American prowess in technology, it is criminal that the  safety of millions is being treated in such a cavalier fashion.  </P> <P> THE REV. ARTHUR A. KENT  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

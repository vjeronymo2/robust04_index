The political reform bills which are based  on reform of the election system had only just begun to be  deliberated in the upper house, but the coalition government  camp had begun work on making a list of prospective candidates  in the single-seat election districts, and anticipating the  election results. Among the candidates backed by the coalition  of the ruling parties are listed even the names of incumbent LDP  Diet members, and Diet members who will be urged to "switch  sides" are also revealed. Within this is concealed a  level-headed, shrewd calculation which foresees a  re-restructuring of political circles.    Single-Seat Election District Diet Seats Predicted by Coalition Camp   (full number: 274)   Party            Predicted Diet   @          0          #          *                   seats   Candidates backed by coalition of ruling parties (by party)   SDPJ             30               3          19         15         21   Shinseito        41               16         25         11         6   Komeito          29               5          24         8          9   Japan New        18               3          13         8          6  Party   DSP              10               3          4          7          3   USDP             1                1          0          0          1   Sakigake         7                2          4          1          4   Other            17               3          6          15         6   Subtotal         153              36         95         65         56   Opposition party candidates   LDP              115              25         44         65         97   Japan            3                0          0          1          9  Communist  Party   Other            3                1          1          1          2   Notes: The predicted number of Diet seats for each party was computed  centered on those who were certain to win (@), those who had a good chance  of winning (0), and also considering candidates whose chance of winning  depends on the situation in the election district (#--slight chance,  *--almost no chance). The "Other" of the candidates backed by the coalition  governing parties includes such persons as those who are not at present  members of the coalition government parties, but who will become candidates  backed by the coalition government parties at the time of the election. The  "Other" of the opposition parties are such persons as independents linked  to the LDP.    <H5>  Even Formation at One Stroke of a New Unified Party </H5>   Even if the political reform bills on which deliberation has  begun in the upper house were to be passed in the current Diet  session, the work of dividing into single-seat election  districts would not be settled until about next summer. But  predicting the division of the new districts is not difficult  for an election professional. And the "fitting (into election  districts)" of candidates based on the division of districts is  already progressing steadily behind the scenes.    One cannot do the "fitting" unless one grasps the trend of  opposing candidates, not to mention the votes received in the  past by candidates on the government-party side based on the  division of districts and the analysis of vote-gathering  organizations. It is no exaggeration to say that this ability to  collect information before the fact makes the difference between  victory and defeat. This table of predictions was made by  executives of the coalition governing parties, based on  information from every party, as material for the purpose of  advancing as quickly as possible the coordination of candidates  within the coalition governing parties.    The system of single-seat election districts is advantageous  to large political parties. If the current coalition governing  parties were to each field their own candidates without  cooperating in the election, there would be no doubt of a strong  victory by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in virtually every  election district. If the coalition camp also desires to survive  after reform of the election system, it has no choice but to  merge and form a new party, or to narrow down to a single  candidate by coordinating candidates among a number of parties.  Even if it does not go so far as to form a new unified party at  one stroke, the building, as soon as possible, of a system of  election cooperation which has a re-restructuring of political  circles in view is a question of life or death for the coalition  government parties.    That is, the election situation summarized in the prediction  table not only constitutes reference material for devising the  governing parties' election strategy and reconstruction  strategy, it also constitutes material for persuasion when  urging candidates of other parties to switch sides.    Prediction for Diet Seats in Proportional Representation Districts   (Total: 226)   Coalition government  parties (total of 140  seats)   Social        32  Democratic  Party of  Japan                 Shinseito     25                 Komeito       28                 Japan New     36                Party                 Democratic    7                Socialist                Party                 United        3                Social                Democratic                Party                 Sakigake      9   Opposition parties (total  of 86 seats)                 LDP           73                 JCP           13    <H3>  "It Is Painful for the Social Democratic Party of Japan, But  It Is an Accurate Reading" </H3>   Incidentally, what one notices as soon as one looks at the  table is that even though the parties in the same coalition  government, members of Sakigake [Harbinger] and the left  faction of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] have not  been made coalition-backed candidates. Sakigake is forming a  unified group with the Japan New Party, and both Chief Cabinet  Secretary Takemura and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hatoyama,  who guard Prime Minister Hosokawa's flanks, are from Sakigake.  But it has been rumored more than once that they are not on good  terms with the Komeito-Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] bloc,  which forms the root and trunk of the party side. Outwardly, the  people involved deny that they are not on good terms, but to the  extent that one looks at this chart, one can see that there  seems no likelihood that the split between the two will be  healed.    To the executives who made the table, the nucleus of the  governing party is strictly Shinseito, Komeito, and the  Democratic Socialist Party, plus the Japan New Party;  furthermore, the ideal appears to be to form a new group, if  possible, by drawing in the right faction of the SDPJ. In  election districts in which it is judged that members of  Sakigake and incumbent members of the SDPJ's left faction will  run, they are throwing coalition-backed candidates against them  without mercy. In that sense, one can say that the prediction  table's selection of coalition-backed candidates is rather  arbitrary. But if one bases it on the present situation of the  Shinseito-Komeito bloc holding leadership power, there is no  doubt that this prediction is a simulation with a high degree of  probability.    "I feel it is a bit painful for the SDPJ, but it is an  accurate judgment. It is certainly the work of a pro."    Political commentator Minoru Morita said that in a positive  manner after just glancing over the table.    "About the time of the Kaifu government people were saying  things like young politicians will fight in election districts  and elders need only move to the proportional representation  section, but after all, ultimately there is no choice but to  field candidates who can fight. The most important thing to  politicians and political parties is being elected, so water  flows downward, and politicians try to survive. That is very  clear when one looks at the table."    A considerable portion of the single-seat election districts  were formed by dividing existing midsized districts into two. In  such cases, it appears that if the governing parties' strongest  candidate chooses one of the two districts, there will be a  tendency for the opposition party's strongest candidate to  choose the other district. If that happens, it means that both  sides will be able to survive. But at the same time, the  agricultural sector of LDP Diet members and the urban sector of  governing party Diet members will not "get in," no matter how  they adjust. In the end, candidates who are relatively weak in  elections will have to switch to other parties, or transfer to  proportional representation districts.  <H3>  Young Japan New Party Candidates Will Be Pursued in Urban  Sectors </H3>   The table on the preceding page brings together those among  incumbent Diet members who will very possibly lose their  election districts. In the agricultural sector the names of LDP  party elders are conspicuous, and in urban sectors it is the  names of young Diet members of the Japan New Party, who were  elected in the previous new party boom, and of SDPJ Diet members  who have an air of decline.    Needless to say, to political parties it is more welcome for  former Prime Minister Nakasone and Diet member Yuriko Koike of  the Japan New Party to collect votes from throughout Japan as a  person on the proportional representation list, than to have  them fight a close race in a single-seat district where winning  the election is not necessarily guaranteed. But it also remains  to be seen whether this kind of fastidious person will move to  proportional representation with little fuss.    Well, if we take it that things work out as predicted by the  executives, the total Diet seats for the coalition parties in  the single-seat election districts will be 153, exceeding the  LDP's 115 Diet seats by nearly 40 seats. In particular,  Shinseito will win 41 seats and be the top party of the  coalition governing parties. Why is Shinseito strong? Morita  analyzes it as follows.    "At present the only ones that have grassroots  vote-gathering  ability are the Komeito-Shinseito bloc and the LDP, which still  has power. It is inevitable that in the single-seat election  districts the basic pattern of the election will be a battle  between these two."    Komeito, which possesses the firm support base of the Soka  Gakkai, and Shinseito, which has been skillful in elections  since the time of the LDP's Takeshita faction, are currently at  the core of the government, so it is natural that they will gain  strength. On the other hand, the hollowing out of the LDP will  progress increasingly with the passage of time. That is the  centripetal force of power. Even so, the provincial  organizations that were built up over the course of 40 years  will not crumble that easily. It seems likely that the LDP will  continue to maintain a force that will account for a third of  all Diet seats.  <H3>  The Key to Understanding the Route of Reorganization of the  Government Is... </H3>   The downward trend will be spurred still more for the SDPJ,  which, along with the LDP, shouldered one wing of the 1955  system. In single-seat election districts it will be overtaken  by Shinseito and fall to second place among the governing  parties. According also to the prediction for proportional  representation districts (see the table) concerning which SANDE  MAINICHI made an estimate based on analysis of such things as  recent public opinion polls and the past voting behavior and  rate of votes gained for each party, the result will be that the  SDPJ will be overtaken by the Japan New Party, and barely be  able to garner more than 30 Diet seats. It appears that because  of the breakup of the prefectural, regional and district  councils, the local labor union organizations, which occurred  along with the start of Rengo, the SDPJ will not be able to put  a brake on the loss of support.    Morita dismisses it, saying, "The trend of the times is to  seek persons with individuality. The SDPJ and Sakigake, which  have vague policy lines, will be weeded out in the end."    When we look at the increases and decreases for all Diet  seats which adds together the Diet seats which the  governing-party executives predict for single-seat election  districts and the Diet seats which SANDE MAINICHI predicts for  proportional representation districts, the LDP will decline by  nearly 40 seats from the number it has now, and, conversely, the  governing parties will add the large number of 17 independent  Diet members, so it will increase by about 30 Diet seats. If the  combination of parties remains as it is now, it would probably  mean that the Hosokawa coalition government will continue to  shoulder the responsibility for government, and will also become  more stable. But it is to be expected that that is not the only  aim of the single-seat election district predictions.    What deserves attention here is that, even if one excludes  the group that will switch from the LDP and which is counted as  independents, the core governing parties bloc, consisting of  Shinseito, Komeito, and the DSP, will total 140 Diet seats,  which means that whether this number joins with the 62-seat  SDPJ, or with the 54-seat Japan New Party, it will surpass the  188 seats of the LDP. In other words, the three parties of the  core bloc would now for the first time gain a free hand in  re-reorganization of political circles. It seems likely that the  aim hidden in the prediction chart will be the key to  understanding the route to a new reorganization.

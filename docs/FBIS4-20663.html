At this venue, Director General Eda said in his greeting  that  nuclear power played an important role within the country's  energy policy, indicated the government's intention to maintain  its policy on this matter, and sought the cooperation of the  power company executives. Furthermore, regarding fuel recycling,  along with emphasizing that he would like to maintain the  policies passed down to him, he said that, with regard to making  information public, while there are many difficult problems,  including the protection of nuclear substances and proprietary  rights, "we would like to release as much information to the  public as possible, from the standpoint that the information  possessed by the administration is the public's information."    In response to this, Kohei Abe, chairman of the Federation  of  Electric Power Companies, stated that he felt strongly that the  current administration was promoting a policy consistent with  previous policy on nuclear power, and declared again the  Federation's position to actively work for the promotion of the  utilization of plutonium for electric power. Particularly,  regarding plutonium which had returned from abroad, he said, "We  plan to process MOX fuel abroad and transport it from overseas.  We would like to make use of the transport experience that we  obtained through the Akatsuki-maru'." Furthermore, the chairman  indicated that, for progress in the development of nuclear  power, it was extremely important to secure a new site [for a  reactor]. He emphasized that, regarding the site problem, "We  would like to grapple with this problem in the future with all  of our might, while at the same time obtaining the understanding  and cooperation of the people."</p>

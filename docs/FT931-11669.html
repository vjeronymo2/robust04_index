			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Italian Socialists promise not to leave coalition ITALY'S Socialist Party last night pledged its full support for Prime Minister Giuliano Amato's shaky four-party coalition. Party leader Bettino Craxi quashed rumours that the Socialists were considering withdrawing from the government after a police raid on their offices last week. 'We have always supported the government,' Mr Craxi said after a crisis meeting of party leaders. 'We have always opposed and we will continue to oppose a government crisis which would only hurl us into an abyss.' If the Socialists pulled out, the government would fall. Behind the scenes, however, Mr Craxi was earlier reported to have threatened to leave the coalition. This threat, coupled with the tension in the party over the fate of Mr Craxi, has obliged Mr Amato to place the plight of his government above that of his party. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has played an important part in encouraging the prime minister to take this position. On Sunday he pointedly summoned Mr Amato to the presidential palace. The extent of Mr Scalfaro's influence in keeping the coalition alive was also underlined by former president Francesco Cossiga, who observed yesterday that there was a return to a strong presidency. Mr Amato's position towards Mr Craxi has been followed by Mr Claudio Martelli, justice minister, and Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, environment minister. Mr Amato, who refused to attend yesterday's meeting, needs all the support he can muster on Thursday when his government, with only a slim majority, faces a series of no-confidence motions from opposition parties. This comes as the coalition risks being undermined by a bitter battle between Mr Craxi - the prime minister's notional party superior and former close colleague - and the Italian judiciary. Mr Craxi has received three separate advisory notes from Milan magistrates that he is under investigation for alleged corruption and illegal party financing. Parliament must consider whether to waive his parliamentary immunity. He has rejected any suggestion of wrong-doing and has gone on the offensive, claiming the magistrates are out to undermine Italian democracy. He claims they have over-stepped their authority in the 11-month-old Milan corruption scandal and are conducting a campaign of denigration of himself and the Socialist party. The mere prospect of a political chaos rattled financial markets on Monday. Bonds opened sharply lower and failed to recoup, and the lira had slipped on opening to 934 against the D-Mark from 928 on Friday.</p>

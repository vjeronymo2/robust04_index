			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Kukanov, St Petersburg: "`Fifth Column' on </F> Channel Five"]    [Text] The hullabaloo raised in connection with corruption  allegations against the administration of the government  television and radio company, Peterburg-5y Kanal [Channel 5],  smacks of a rehearsed performance. At a precisely designated  hour on 4 March deputies of the state duma -- communist  Krasnitskiy and liberal democrat Yegorov, who had completed the  ceremonious act of submitting sensational documents to legal  protection organs, appeared before television cameras at the  entrance to the city office of the public prosecutor. The  essence of the compromising materials was as follows: the  chairman of the Peterburg-5y Kanal GTRK [State Television and  Radio Company], Bella Kurkova, gave a large discount to the  closed joint-stock company, "Kommercheskiy Tsentr TV i Radio  Sankt-Peterburga" [Commercial Center for St Petersburg TV and  Radio] in exchange for financial aid rendered by the  aforementioned firm to Kurkova's husband, Vadim Tareyev,  publisher of the newspaper NEVSKIY GLASHATAY. He was allegedly  given 12 million rubles in cash. The general director of the  firm, V. Mikhaylov, informed the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia] deputy to the state duma, V. Marychev, of this two  days prior to the aforementioned ceremony.    Events occurred in the following manner. Some time ago,  Mikhail Syroyezhin, deputy chairman for commercial questions of  Peterburg-5y Kanal GTRK, did make a proposal regarding  sponsorship to the newspaper NEVSKIY GLASHATAY. The  corresponding contract was signed on 16 February by Mikhaylov  and Tareyev. Incidentally, the document cites 15 February 1994  as its expiration date. The document was obviously prepared in  such haste that not a single signatory found time to read the  typed text with the typographical error.    The one-year agreement concerning joint advertising  operations with Mikhaylov's firm was signed on 23 February by  Siroyezhin. While having the right to decide such questions  unilaterally, he nevertheless brought the document to Kurkova,  who also signed it the following day. The contract concerned 120  minutes per month of advertising on St Petersburg television and  a 35-percent discount on the total cost of materials placed.    On 22 February Mikhaylov gave Tareyev 12 million rubles --  the first sponsor contribution. He explained that he borrowed  this money from his friend Nikita Arkhipov, who not long before  the events being described was invited by Syroyezhin to be  director of the joint commercial center of St Petersburg TV.  Thus, he said, accept the cash. This is how Mikhaylov portrays  events in his report of Mr. Marychev. Actually things went a  little differently. Syroyezhin gave the money to Tareyev, and  not on 22 February but on 25 February, Friday. Few people paid  attention to this discrepancy in dates, and as we will see  further, that was a mistake.    One must be a very naive person and not understand anything  about commerce to take 12 million rubles in a plastic bag  without witnesses, without even looking at the bills (what if  they were counterfeit), carry them through town to the editorial  offices and lock them in a safe because the work day was over  and all banks were already closed. The editor of NEVSKIY  GLASHATAY is precisely this kind of person. This was confirmed  unanimously by people who have known him for a while.    Bella Kurkova insists that she learned about the sponsorship  contract with NEVSKIY GLASHATAY only when the scandal broke. But  these are words which, as we know, do not correspond to the  facts. The financial and commercial affairs of Peterburg-5y  Kanal GTRK are being examined by a management control commission  of the president's administration, sent from Moscow today.  Incidentally, this type of examination had been planned, but the  fuss surrounding St Petersburg's TV accelerated the  disembarkation on the banks of the Neva of a landing party of  inspectors from the capital. They should have at the same time  questioned some participants in this story in order to receive  first-hand information. But here some curious circumstances  arise.    Mikhaylov has disappeared. Moreover, his firm is nowhere to  be found. The Petrograd District administration cannot confirm  that his commercial structure was registered -- there is no data  about it in the computer. It is unknown where, by whom and when  Mr. Mikhaylov's enterprise was registered.    There is more. Three days before the transfer of the 12  million to the NEVSKIY GLASHATAY, Arkhipov, the director of the  OKTs [Joint Commercial Center] of St Petersburg TV was fired  unexpectedly. Telephone calls to his home reveal that he is  somewhere abroad and it is not clear when he will return.    Finally, Kurkova's deputy, Syroyezhin, who handed her  husband  the money on Friday, 25 February, went to Moscow on business on  28 February and has also disappeared. Several days prior to his  departure he attempted to obtain a visa to the U.S. through the  international division of the Peterburg-5y Kanal GTRK for his  wife, who worked for him at the television station. He was  unsuccessful in obtaining the visa, but Siroyezhin's wife  disappeared from the city, and from that time no one in St  Petersburg has seen him either. It is true that two people at  least heard from him.    Bella Kurkova, who categorically refuses to comment to SMI  [mass media], nevertheless submitted a number of documents to  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. A business note by V. Nechayev, director of  the joint information service of Peterburg-5y Kanal, states:    "On 2 March at about 8 p.m. I received a call from M.  Syroyezhin, who told me that he was calling from Moscow, that he  had been involved in an incident, that he had been attacked,  that it had been said he was in `shock' and was in the hospital  to recover. `If anyone organized this, it was someone from Most  Bank,' said M. Syroyezhin. It's too bad B. Kurkova is quarreling  with Most Bank (let me remind you that in one of the broadcasts,  entitled `On the Political Olympus,' which aired on RTV [Russian  TV] following the well-known October events, eyewitnesses told  Kurkova that the thugs bypassed the floors occupied by this  commercial structure). Nevzorov was also discussed, and M.  Syroyezhin said that Nevzorov also has his sights on St  Petersburg television."    From the work notes of S. Karatayev, director of the  international service of Peterburg-5y Kanal GTRK:    "On the evening of 10 March M. I. Syroyezhin called me and  said that he was in Austria and in the hospital because of liver  damage. In Moscow a gang of people unknown to him had attacked  and beaten him, taking the documents that he carried. After  this, being in shock from his injuries, he travelled to Austria,  where he learned that an abnormal situation had developed  surrounding his name. He told me that he would like to return to  work at the TV station but that first he would have to know  exactly what he was being blamed for. He asked me to talk to B.  Kurkova so that she would explain everything about the guilt of  M. Syroyezhin. He reported that very high authorities about whom  we do not know are interested in firing Kurkova, and that he is  a `small' person who wants a normal and quiet life."    Mr. Syroyezhin has not yet appeared on the banks of the  Neva.  The company's management has turned to the Federal  Counterintelligence Service and the St Petersburg and oblast  GUVD [Main Administration for Internal Affairs] with a request  to take measures to find him. All of this is like a bad dream.  We have the feeling we have already seen it before. Yes, of  course, the "white house," the vice president with compromising  briefcases, the secret disappearance of Yakubovskiy...It looks  like an old scenario was suitable for this time too. It is true  that it is a play on a different scale and on a different stage.  This point of view is shared by Aleksandr Semikolennyy, the  director of the group of inspectors from the president's  administration. In a conversation with me, without anticipating  the results of the investigation, which in all likelihood will  not conclude earlier than next week, he called the Channel 5  scandal a preplanned political provocation. In his opinion, no  criminality regarding advertising discounts will be upheld,  because this is practiced on domestic TV right and left. The  television company should just have been more selective in  choosing partners for cooperation in the commercial arena.    B. Kurkova says that Mikhail Syroyezhin's appearance on  television did not arouse the slightest bit of suspicion in the  company's administration, since he had a fair reputation in  business circles. In additio,n he is the son of the deceased  Ivan Syroyezhin, well-known in our country and abroad as a  scientist-economist who participated actively in Leningrad TV  programs.    These are the main participants and perpetrators of the  scandal, which naturally has an underlying political basis.  There was no point to Mr. Marychev's assurances at a recent  Moscow press conference on the Channel 5 situation that the  actions of the duma deputies have the completely beneficial  purpose of fighting corruption. To a person who knows the habits  of the representative of St Petersburg's liberal democrats in  the state duma it is very difficult to believe in the sincerity  of such pronouncements. Recently, for example, he wished to  appear on television in order to campaign for the LDPR before  elections to the city assembly. Having received a negative reply  for the reason that not a single one of the 16 election blocks  will have this opportunity during the pre-election campaign,  Marychev declared that Kurkova should not forget about the empty  rooms in Lefortovo prison.    Simultaneously with the heated scandal, Nevzorov restated  his  demand to put "600 Seconds" back on the air. On the initiative  of the city office of the public prosecutor, his work was  subject to expert analysis in the Russian Academy of Sciences,  where Nevzorov himself is an honorary member. The academicians  found no evidence in his program of calls toward violent action,  of fascist propaganda or of other illegalities. On this basis  Nevzorov demanded to be put on the air and people carrying red  flags and portraits of Stalin moved toward the television  station.    However, all of this is just surface scandal. There are  other  facts that are hardly known to most people. On 25 February (the  day of the transfer of money to Kurkova's husband and the eve of  the mysterious disappearance of Syroyezhin) a fax arrived at  Chapygina 6 from the director of the Arkhangelsk Joint Radio and  Television Transmission Center with a request to give  communications workers the right to broadcast in exchange for  canceling all debts of Peterburg-5y Kanal GTRK. After this,  similar dispatches arrived from Kaluga, Ulyanovsk,  Yekaterinburg, Yaroslavl, Zlatoust, Belgorod, Rybinsk and Tula.  All of them stated the same thing, as if they were xeroxed  copies of each other. B. Kurkova feels that the scandalously  blank television screens in Russia this winter were not the  result of a strike by communications workers, but a  demonstration of the power of big money, of the intentions of  powerful commercial structures to buy government television.    If Ostankino and RTV are not accessible to some today, they  can try to get the third largest state television company, that  of St Petersburg, the programs of which are transmitted by 300  transmitters to 80 million people. Considering the fact that  presidential elections are not far off, someone is already  examining the situation and pulling the strings.    Who? I do not have the answer to this question. B. Kurkova  says that she knows the names of people who will attest that  Mikhail Syroyezhin has certain ties with many representatives of  the party's "armed detachment," which is very displeased with  the changes in the country.    Mikhail Molostvov, deputy of the state duma from Saint  Petersburg, and writers Daniil Granin, Aleksandr Volodin, Yakov  Gordin, Nina Katerli and Boris Strugatrskiy have sent an open  letter to the RF president, in which they ask him to turn his  attention to the Channel 5 situation and to have the Russian  General Office of the Public Prosecutor take this matter under  strictest control. I feel there is an urgent need to do this.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Technology: Checkmate by silicon chip - As a computer prepares to play the world's top chess players, Charles Arthur assesses its chances On May 20, a rather unusual chess player will line up in a hall in Munich alongside professionals such as Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short. Beside five more of the world's top chess players and eight human qualifiers will be a computer. 'It won't win, but it won't come last either,' says Fred Friedel about the Fritz3 chess program developed by his Munich-based company, Chessbase. As the third generation of an already successful program, it is now being adapted to run on a personal computer using an Intel Pentium chip running at 100MHz - a contender for the most powerful available PC. Its presence is partly explained by the fact that Intel, as a sponsor of the Professional Chess Association - the breakaway group formed last year to which Kasparov, Short and a number of other professionals now belong - is keen to show off its processor running the software. But Fritz3 is also there on merit: in 'blitz' chess, where each player has 25 minutes to play all his moves, its ranking puts it easily among the world's top 20 players. The increasing power of computers means it might not be long before the world champion in some of the west's best-known games, such as chess and draughts, is made of silicon rather than flesh and blood. 'All the programs are better than 99.99 per cent of chess players,' says Malcolm Pein, publisher of Chess magazine and a grandmaster. 'They're just having trouble with the last 0.01 per cent. There's about 1,000 of us out there who are better than them.' Computers are already central to chess professionals' lives: they are used to study openings, to record games, to confirm analysis of complex positions and to provide a huge, cross-referenced database of past games as a clue to opponents' strategies. And the sponsorship of Intel of the US, the world's leading computer chip maker, is recognition that after a couple of thousand years chess has become big business. This fact was driven home by last year's live TV coverage in the UK of the PCA's world championship. 'According to the research, 60 per cent of all adults watched at least one of the programmes,' says Andrew Finan of the sponsorship company Sports Bureau International. 'That blew away all the thinking that it was a niche market.' The more detailed profile found that most watchers were ABC1 males (demographics for 'well-off middle-class') and aged between 16 and 44. 'It is an advertiser's dream market,' says Finan. 'And it's also Intel's core market.' As the biggest chip maker in the world, Intel is now spending more than Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) over each of the next five years to have its name associated with the game. Sales of chess programs are worth millions each year; every games software house knows that having one in the catalogue is a necessity. The market splits quite equally between players aged from 40 upwards, and those aged about 20. Chess programs have actually been around longer than computers. The first was written in the 1940s by the mathematical genius Alan Turing, who helped crack the German Enigma code. He realised that deciding between moves could be reduced to a formal process: by trying each move, and each combination of moves following that, and then evaluating the position after those moves (by allotting some numerical value to each - say, +1 point for capturing a pawn, +5 for capturing a rook, +1,000 for checkmate), you could choose between them. Assign the correct values, and you would have an unbeatable program. Turing's first efforts were laboriously manual, using pencil and paper. But when the first computers were developed, some of the first non-serious applications were chess programs. In the 1970s, a master player, David Levy, set a series of challenge bets that he could beat the best machine versions. He won, before retiring in 1983. The programs' weakness remains their strictly mathematical approach, say those who beat them. 'People have intuition, and the knowledge and plans for hundreds or thousands of positions,' says Pein. 'They have a much keener knowledge of when to give up material for a positional advantage. And when the position is closed, with little chance for tactics, humans are better at manoeuvring so that when it does open up, they will be at an advantage.' Not many humans will be, though. By the official Elo chess rating - awarded to players on their record, such as the quality of the players they beat - today's programs, such as Fritz, Chess Genius or Kasparov's Gambit are better than almost everyone in the world, even in standard tournament play where players get two or more hours for the first 40 moves. The 6m or so club players worldwide have Elo ratings between 1,200 and 1,900; masters, from 1,700 to 2,000; the 1,340 international masters, from 2,200 to 2,450. The 465 grandmasters rank from 2,400 upwards; Kasparov, at just above 2,800, is officially the best player ever. Fritz2 is ranked at about Elo 2,300, and Pein expects to see a program ranked Elo 2,500 soon. For would-be writers of chess programs, there are four attractive factors, says Friedel: 'It's competitive - you can evaluate claims of whose program is better simply by playing them against each other, which you can't with, say, word processing programs. And there's a lot of literature to guide you; chess openings and endgames have been studied for centuries. It's commercially viable: you can sell what you make. And it's a hard problem to solve - but not too hard. I wouldn't touch go, for example.' Go, an eastern game invented 4,000 years ago, making it about twice as old as chess, is played on a 19 by 19 grid, on which the players alternately place black and white counters (called stones) to try to surround empty territory. It has only nine rules, fewer than chess, but that very simplicity, coupled with the size of the board, means that at every stage there can be a couple of hundred different moves to choose from. In draughts the problem is simpler, since only half as many squares are used. In 1992, a program called Chinook - officially the world's second-best player - challenged Marion Tinsley, the world champion since 1954. After 39 games, Tinsley won 4-2. But Chinook's developer is now working on an even better version. 'It's analysing from the endgame backwards, and from the opening forwards,' says Friedel, who keeps in touch with such developments. 'It's about six moves away from linking up the two ends. And then that will be that. It will be like playing God. You may draw, but you will never win.' The program will simply never let itself be drawn into a losing thread of play; it will, in effect, have a map of the entire game. When Tinsley makes the tiniest error he will lose his title. Could the same ever happen to chess? Kasparov is as dismissive of computers as he is of many of his human rivals. In October 1989, he played and twice defeated Deep Thought, a customised IBM workstation running a chess program; it was the first computer to achieve grandmaster status. Asked what improvements they should make, its programmers were told: 'Teach it to resign earlier.' Undaunted, the team is developing the successor, Deep Blue, which will contain Deep Thought shrunk on to a single chip. So is Kasparov's crown really at risk from a machine? 'Probably not,' says Friedel. This is the fascination for me.'</p>

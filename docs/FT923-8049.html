			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Boots receives licence in UK for Manoplax MANOPLAX, the cardiovascular drug whose success is vital for the credibility of Boots' pharmaceuticals drug research, received its first licence yesterday. UK regulators said the medicine, developed by the British retail and healthcare group, could be used to treat congestive heart failure. The UK pharmaceutical market is only the fourth largest in Europe but the announcement is significant because it demonstrates that Boots has overcome regulators' fears about the drug's safety and effectiveness. Early clinical studies suggested Manoplax was ineffective. Boots shares rose 7p to 429p. 'There is little else more important for the Boots' pharmaceuticals business than Manoplax. This is its first new drug for a long time and the division will depend on Manoplax to drive growth in the 1990s,' said Mr Paul Krickler, pharmaceuticals analyst at Goldman Sachs. Manoplax could generate revenues of between Dollars 100m (Pounds 52m) and Dollars 150m by 1995, assuming swift US approval, said Mr Krickler. The pharmaceuticals division's turnover last year was Pounds 699m, generating operating profits of Pounds 120m, nearly a third of Boots' Pounds 374m pre-tax earnings. Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said: 'We confidently look forward to receiving further registration approvals in most major markets in the coming months.' The company said it expected to have US approval by the end of its financial year in March. Boots takes heart, Page 16; Lex, Page 14; Market, Page 32</p>

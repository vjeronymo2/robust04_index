			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Retailing looks healthier - Boots' decision to sell drugs side When John Boot started selling herbal remedies in Nottingham in 1849, he could not have imagined how awkward it would be for his successors to mind the shop and to discover new medicines. Yesterday, the management of The Boots Company, one of the largest employers in the east Midlands, opted to concentrate on retailing. The decision was no surprise. Boots has been criticised for being too small to compete in the drugs industry. Barely in the world's top 40 drug makers by sales, it needed a breakthrough to stay on terms. It was not to be. In the summer of 1993 it was forced to abandon its most promising drug, Manoplax, a heart treatment, because of side effects. The company quickly announced a strategic review of its pharmaceuticals operations. An outright sale was only one of the possibilities. The exercise followed a decade of acquisitions in the 1980s, culminating in the unhappy purchase of retailer Ward White in 1989 for Pounds 900m - only just above the Pounds 850m the company is likely to receive for its drugs businesses. The delay in finalising the drugs business sale was partly because of the price Boots was asking - which put off such suitors as the UK drugs companies Zeneca and Medeva - but also because of the company's historic commitment to the city of Nottingham where it is one of the biggest employers. But earlier this month, Boots management said that job losses were inevitable. This cleared a path for a buyer keen to cut costs, and provided an opportunity for a management buy-out. In the end, BASF was able to offer more. The sale includes all of Boots overseas prescription drugs operations. These range from insulin sales in India to its biggest product, Synthroid, a thyroid hormone, which is only sold in the US. Other products include Brufen and Froben for rheumatism and to combat inflammation. Boots has not left the health business entirely. It still owns an over-the-counter businesses that includes throat pastilles and sticking plasters. Ironically, the sale of the drugs division will dilute earnings. But Sir James Blyth, chief executive, earlier this month sweetened the pill for shareholders by suggesting that some of the sale proceeds might be returned to them. He did not say whether this would take the form of a share buy-back or a special dividend.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Pashto </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] By means of demonstrations, the residents of Kabul  today strongly condemned the continued fighting and the closing  of communication lines with Kabul, and asked that the United  Nations, using its influence, bring pressure to bear on the  enemies of the people of Afghanistan as soon as possible in  order to open supply routes to Kabul. The demonstrators asked  the United Nations to send more aid to the people of Afghanistan  so that residents of Kabul can be rid of the famine caused by  the putschist road blockers. Expressing repulsion and hatred at  the acts of putschists, the demonstrators asked the United  Nations to secure world aid to rid the people of Afghanistan of  famine and hunger, which has been caused by the closing of the  Torkham border post and communication lines.</p>

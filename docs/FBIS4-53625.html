			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second installment of four-part article by Shinobu Takeda </F> of NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN's Industrial News Department:  "Centennial Change in Construction Industry"]    [Text] "If the budget is approved by the Diet, there are  approximately 150 government-related public works projects  alone, worth more than 700 million yen, to be contracted under  the open competitive bidding system," Motoyuki Kidokoro, chief  of Ministry of Construction's Technical Research Office, says.  However, there are doubts in the construction industry about  "how many of the public works could actually be carried out even  if the Diet passes the budget." Under the current situation,  the execution of public works cannot be carried out without the  cooperation of general contractors. The construction industry  fears that the open competitive bidding system, which distances  itself from general contractors, could be an obstacle to the  execution of public works.  <H5>  Getting Contracts Not Guaranteed </H5>   On 25 February, 1,200 people assembled at the main hall of  the first floor of Pacifico Yokohama, an international  conference hall at Minato Mirai in Yokohama. They were  construction contractors who had come to learn about the reform  of the bidding system for Yokohama City's public works projects.  Regarding that the designated bidding system, in which  contractors selected by a government office based on their past  business records and confidence compete to win a contract,  became the hotbed of bid rigging, the Construction Ministry  [MOC] and local autonomous bodies decided to introduce the open  competitive bidding system. Separation from the familiar system  raised uneasiness among the construction contractors, and made  them come to the Pacifico Yokohama.    General contractors were able to increase the possibility of  being designated by the government offices, and hold an  advantageous position at a bid rigging meeting by cooperating  with government and municipal offices from the public works  project's designing stage, which imposes a heavy burden.  However, under the open competitive bidding system, winning a  contract for a project that one supported by spending time and  effort is not guaranteed. Such an uneasiness was not eased even  after participation in the explanatory meeting at the Pacifico  Yokohama.    Until 40 years ago or so, government and municipal offices'  own technicians had mainly designed and carried out Japan's  public works projects. But, since the government offices were  not able to cope with the sharp increase in the work load of  public works during the days of high economic growth, they  entrusted private construction firms with the job of executing  public works projects, while leaving the job of designing to  themselves.    However, everybody in the industry knows that general  contractors now "help" the government offices even in the  designing stage of large-scale public works constructions.  Acknowledging the situation, the MOC says, "Mapping out a plan  is becoming no longer the work of clients as the significance of  environmental assessment and measures to obtain understanding of  a project from the people in the district prior to execution of  the project increases."  <H5>  Possibility of Unsuccessful Bidding </H5>   The MOC has its own technical research institute, and 60  percent of its 24,000 workers are engineers. While the MOC is  still all right in terms of technical experts, the local  autonomous bodies are much weaker. For example, Ibaraki  Prefecture's Sanwa-cho, whose mayor was arrested in the general  contractors' bribery scandal, "does not particularly have an  expert for designing," according to the town's General Affairs  Division, and this is not an isolated case.    General contractors have sent their valuable architects to  the government offices to help in a project because the  construction companies could expect to get a contract for the  construction of the project later. Besides, earnings for  designing are much smaller than those for building. If general  contractors are not guaranteed to receive a contract after their  cooperation due to the introduction of open competitive bidding  system, they will become reluctant.    The system of placing an order with outside architects and  paying for it is stipulated in the present reform of bidding  system. While this is a chance for architecture companies and  consultants, only Nippon Koei Co., Ltd., the largest company in  the designing business, can make a plan for a dam. The structure  in which a designing for a public works project is dependent on  general contractors is still the same. If general contractors  withdraw from drawing designs, public works cannot be carried  out.    Also, there is the possibility of unsuccessful case of  bidding under the open competitive bidding system. In a public  works project, expenses for machinery and materials and  personnel are estimated and called the estimated price. Partly  due to the decline in clients' technology, however, there is a  case in which a project is estimated at 80 while it actually  costs 100. Although contractors avoid to take such a contract  because they make no profit, "usually a company is selected at a  bid rigging meeting to take the non-profit-making contract  because reestimating the costs of project by redesigning it will  loose government's face," an executive of a semi-major general  contractor reveals. Such a trick [to avoid a situation in which  no one places a bid for a contract in which no profit is made]  will not be able to be used from now on.    Scale of Public Works Becomes Smaller    In addition, the fact that general contractors were excluded  from public works projects by being suspended from bidding after  they were investigated in connection with the bribery scandal  has beclouded the situation. According to the MOC's Statistics  on Public Works Construction Starts, the appraised value for the  constructions started from April 1993 to February 1994 is the  record high of 17.449 trillion yen, which is a 2.9 percent  increase from the year-ago level. The details, however, show  exactly two opposite trends: the amount for the national  government's projects declined 0.7 percent while the figure for  local governments increased 4.0 percent. Large-scale projects  by the national government have declined, and small projects  have increased, such as local municipalities' road constructions  and sewage maintenance which can be carried out by small and  medium contractors.    "The scale of construction to become small prevents the  procurement of materials and machinery, such as steel, cement,  and construction machines, to increase, and as a result, the  demand usually created by public works becomes small," Hiroshi  Fujimura, deputy manager of Research Office, Management and  Planning Department of Taisei Cooperation, says. This is one of  the reasons why the economy is not recovering while Japan's  public works have been increased by the government's economic  stimulus package.    While "steady execution of public works," "fulfillment of  social capital," and "expanding domestic demand" are the  government's international commitments, other promises such as  "introduction of open competitive bidding system," and "strict  employment of Antimonopoly Law" obstruct the realization of the  former objectives, creating a paradox.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Forward by Toru Yamashita, chairman, Defense Technology </F> Foundation]    [Text] I hope you noticed the new format of the August  issue of the ``Boei Gijutsu Journal'' that has just come out. I  would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to the  journal for publishing my inaugural remarks upon becoming  chairman of the foundation in the May issue of the journal last  year. I plan to work even harder than before on making the Boei  Gijutsu Journal a magazine that is for and by the members of the  foundation, so I request the support, cooperation, and  understanding of all members.    It has been a little more than a year since I became  chairman, and in that time the editorial staff working under the  leadership of executive director Yasuo Imai has held numerous  discussions about the magazine. We have also had help from  people with previous editorial experience in the private sector  who were kind enough to share their knowledge with us. The  director of the foundation, Izumi Tomita, who took on his new  job last year, also offered help in consolidating the new  editorial policies and helping with the new layout. Once that  was done, we started collecting manuscripts, and finally in  August sent copies of the magazine to foundation members.    We would like to see the magazine used not only as a  resource  for members to obtain a clear picture of defense technologies in  Japan today, but also used as a forum for exchanging technical  information between the public and private sector for the  benefit of its members. We also would like to see it play a role  in improving the technical potential for achieving qualitative  superiority in defense hardware and equipment.    From the mid-18th century until today, there has not been a  single year in which there has not been an armed conflict of one  kind or another in the world, and since the end of World War II  there have been more than 100 such armed conflicts in one place  or another around the world. The words spoken at the time of the  Roman Empire that ``if you want peace, prepare for war'' are  just as relevant today as they were back then. There have been  signs recently of a full-scale debate taking place in Japan  pertaining to Japan's security arrangement. I believe that this  debate should also include a discussion of technology as well.    From the view of security arrangements for the 21st century,  I think we should welcome a clarification of the policies that  go with maintaining and developing an industrial base and  technology base for producing and developing defense arms and  equipment. If this is done, a widespread consensus can be  expected to emerge among the people of Japan.    It is my hope that the members of the foundation will not  only be actively involved in contributing articles to the newly  formatted magazine but will also take time to express their  opinions as well.</p>

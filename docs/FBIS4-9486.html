			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 25 (CTK) -- "A series of  ill-conceived and wrongly timed decisions" of the previous  government (of Vladimir Meciar) have brought the health sector  to the brink of collapse, Slovak Health Minister Tibor Sagat  told CTK today.    He also mentioned unqualified changes in hospital management  and the halt of health insurance transformation as causes  leading to the present state.    He said the different development of the Czech and Slovak  health sectors after the 1993 split of Czechoslovakia were the  result of the "better running of the Czech Health Ministry which  could project its needs and support them with hard evidence."    "Unfortunately, we failed to do likewise in this country,"  he  added.    The health sector's budget was not a priority under the  previous government, resulting in health services being as much  as 50 billion crowns ($1.5 billion) in debt, Sagat said. He  added that this year the 15.7 billion-crown health sector budget  was 5 billion crowns short of the requirement.    He said extra money would have to come from national  reserves, causing a deepening of the budget deficit, or from  foreign loans. It is hoped that a foreign loan decision would  come by the end of June since his ministry plans changes in the  financial management of the health services to take effect as of  July 1, Sagat said.    A foreign loan is to be managed by health insurances as  their  "starting capital," since the hitherto "irregular and variable"  insurance revenue has left them unable to cope with service  costs, Sagat said, adding that the government would have to back  the health sector more effectively.    Health and social insurance funds would have to be separated  as the past six months' performance of the mixed National  Insurance showed it to be falling behind expectations. The  separation of the two funds looks likely to happen, Sagat said.</p>

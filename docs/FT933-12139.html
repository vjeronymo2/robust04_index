			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / A degenerative research programme According to Professor Mark Blaug of the London School of Economics, monetarism has become a 'degenerative research programme'. What exactly does that mean? It all goes back to that great philosopher, Sir Karl Popper, who has consistently maintained that the test of a genuinely scientific theory is that it has withstood repeated attempts to falsify its implications. His pupil, Imre Lakatos, was impressed by how difficult it was to falsify any hypothesis convincingly. A defender could say that the initial conditions were wrongly stated or that disturbing influences had been at work. Lakatos, therefore, switched his emphasis to bodies of related theories called 'research programmes'. These could not themselves be tested empirically. But if a research programme was progressive, it provided lots of subsidiary theories and hypotheses, which could both explain well-known facts and yield interesting and unexpected implications. A degenerative research programme, on the other hand, relied more and more on special factors and ad hoc explanations, and failed to throw up interesting and surprising predictions. A research programme could easily start out as a progressive one, and degenerate over time, as with monetarism. The core of monetarism in its heyday was that monetary forces determined the rate of inflation in the long run. In the short run monetary forces could affect real output as well as inflation, but it was difficult to generalise about the mixture between the two effects. Professor Milton Friedman originally put the typical lag before economic activity was affected at nine months and the typical lag before inflation changed at 18 months - although the final effects could be drawn out over many years. Friedman also suggested that monetary policy was best assessed by the growth of some measure of money and not by interest rates. This, however, surely needed further investigation. Monetary policy has operated via interest rates throughout nearly all its recorded history. The high and variable inflation rate of the 1970s made nominal interest rates a very bad guide to the real cost of borrowing money. But this is no longer so obvious in the less inflationary 1990s. At any rate, since the beginning of this decade the Fed has reduced short-term interest rates from over 8 1/2 per cent to 3 per cent. European monetarists were celebrating these reductions as an example of what could be achieved in tackling recession by an independent central bank untainted by an exchange rate regime or target. Unfortunately for them, some hardline US monetarists have always maintained that the Fed, too, has got it wrong - because the growth of broad measures of money in the US has slowed down to a crawl. A new paper* suggests that US monetary growth has been low as an indirect effect of the bailout operation for the Savings &amp; Loan institutions. The thesis that the Fed has followed a tight money policy in disguise is difficult to sustain. The reluctance of bond rates to fall below 6 1/2 per cent suggests that there are limits to how far the Fed can go without stirring up inflationary fears. US headline inflation has been around 3 per cent for more than a year and shows no sign of collapsing into deflation. Above all, the monetary base - cash, plus deposits at the Fed - has been accelerating to an 8 per cent per annum growth rate, compared with a Friedman recommendation that it should be frozen altogether. Indeed, should inflationary symptoms reappear monetarists will quickly flip over from broad money to the monetary base. One can sympathise with Fed members who say that, whatever they do, they will be accused by monetarists of not practising the doctrine correctly. The problem is that monetarists have succumbed to the market demand to explain output, employment and every twist and turn of the cycle. They should have stuck to the early statements which made it clear that theirs was a long-run doctrine about inflation, which might have a bearing on deflation and depression, but which did not explain the normal real forces at work in an economy, forces which were, in any case, not easily susceptible to influence by policy. The monetarist research programme has cast its net too far and snapped as a result - which is hard for those of us who believe that monetary policy can have a moderating influence on boom and slump if its claims are not overstretched. *Monetary Malpractice, by James Buchanan and David Fand.

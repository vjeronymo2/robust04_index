			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: ICI to build pipeline in Australia ICI AUSTRALIA, part of Imperial Chemical Industries, is to go ahead with construction of a ADollars 300m (USDollars 200m) pipeline linking the Moomba gas fields in South Australia with its Botany Bay petrochemical plant. This follows a decision by the South Australian government to sell ethane to the ICI plant. ICI's expenditure will be spread over a couple of years. About ADollars 170m will be spent on the pipeline; ADollars 100m on the Botany Bay facility; and the remainder in South Australia's Cooper Basin. The pipeline will be about 1,380km long, and follow a similar route to the existing Moomba-Sydney pipeline. The aim is to switch the Botany Bay plant over to South Australian ethane by May 1996. ICI has been anxious to secure long-term feedstock supplies locally. The decision to sell ethane to ICI followed a deal between the South Australian authorities and the Queensland government for the latter to supply natural gas to South Australia after existing contracts between the states expire in 2003.</p>

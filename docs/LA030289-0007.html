			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TACOMA TO TAKE BACK CINDY, AN ALBATROSS OF AN ELEPHANT FOR PARK  </P> <P> Zoo officials in Tacoma, Wash., are making plans for the return of Cindy, a  4-ton Asian elephant once characterized as America's most dangerous, who did  little to diminish that reputation during seven years at the San Diego Wild  Animal Park.  </P> <P> Cindy will return to the Point Defiance Zoo by fall after leaving the Wild  Animal Park, where last month she broke the collarbone of one of her keepers  with a slap from her trunk.  </P> <P> The contract between Port Defiance and the Wild Animal Park expired in  December, but Tacoma officials said that, before the construction of a new  $1.5-million elephant center, they lacked the expertise and the facilities to  handle Cindy.  </P> <P> The center apparently can't open soon enough for Wild Animal Park officials,  who have had their fill of 24-year-old Cindy.  </P> <P> Though Cindy has a history of attacking keepers at the park, officials say she  is no more of a problem than some of the other Asian elephants, which tend to  be aggressive toward each other rather than their keepers. Park officials have  told the Tacoma zoo that they would like to get rid of Cindy as soon as  possible because she has failed to be mounted by a bull and is using space that  could be occupied by a willing female.  </P> <P> "We had expressed a desire to move her months before" the Jan. 31 attack, park  spokesman Tom Hanscom said Wednesday. "We want to make sure she gets a proper  home that can handle her. She has already become a headline subject."  </P> <P> Two days after the incident, U. S. Department of Agriculture officials  investigated and concluded that Cindy had attacked the keeper without  provocation. She has since been kept with the park's lone Asian bull to isolate  her from the remaining eight Asian cows and the keepers. Hanscom said Cindy is  known to like only one of the park's six keepers in the Asian elephant yard.  </P> <P> Cindy, whose species is endangered, has never mated. In explaining her  anti-social behavior and fear of bulls, zoo and park officials cite her early  years in isolation in Tacoma. Officials there said they considered using  artificial insemination to produce offspring during her time there.  </P> <P> The new elephant complex at the Point Defiance Zoo will include a "squeeze  cage," a hydraulically operated device in which Cindy can be immobilized while  keepers handle her, officials said.  </P></p>

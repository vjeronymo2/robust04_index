			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Smith lays basis for closer Labour ties with industry: Party's commitment to manufacturing given warm reception by CBI MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday laid the foundations of a closer relationship with the Confederation of British Industry by stressing the opposition's commitment to manufacturing industry. Mr Smith largely avoided controversial issues in a warmly received speech at the organisation's conference in Harrogate designed to convince business leaders they have nothing to fear from a Labour government. Aides said his intention, as the first Labour leader to address the CBI, was to prepare the ground for the launch of the party's industrial policy document next year, which will set out detailed proposals for partnerships between government departments and business. Labour officials say business leaders have welcomed many of the party's emerging proposals, although there is concern about plans for worker directors being drawn up by Mr Robin Cook, the party's industry spokesman. CBI members gave Mr Smith a sustained ovation, which observers contrasted with the more restrained applause accorded cabinet ministers on Monday. 'The message that came across was that he is passionately committed to manufacturing industry,' one delegate said. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, sought to undermine the impact of Mr Smith's appearance by drawing attention to the omission from his speech of any reference to the party's commitment to a 35-hour, four-day working week. Mr Hunt said Mr Smith had failed to request an opt-out from the election manifesto of the European socialist group, which contains the commitment. However, delegates also responded warmly to Mr Smith's stress on Labour's commitment to improvements in training, education and the potential for partnerships between government departments and business. Mr Smith sought to exploit divisions between some business leaders and the government by endorsing criticism of the Conservative party's 'negative approach' expressed by Mr Howard Davies, the CBI director-general. 'Such a posture can seriously damage our interests. It is ironic that those who promised to put Britain at the heart of Europe have caused us to be marginalised in crucial areas of decision making,' he said. Mr Smith warned delegates that British business would have to live with the social chapter of the European Union's Maastricht treaty, in spite of the government's decision to opt out. He said the opt-out meant British ministers would 'leave the room' when employment issues were discussed, leaving the other 11 countries to determine policies 'which almost inexorably will come to be applied, not just to British companies operating in Europe, but to all companies operating in Britain'. Mr Smith called for an early cut in interest rates to boost recovery, and urged the government to avoid threatening the recovery by imposing tax increases in the budget. He also called on ministers to drop plans to increase the proportion of sick pay met by employers. However, his main aim was to draw a sharp contrast between Labour's support for manufacturing and the low level of investment in industry since the Conservatives came to power in 1979. 'I have always believed passionately that Britain's prosperity depends upon the creation of a dynamic and competitive economy, built on the bedrock of a strong manufacturing sector,' he said. Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, said there was 'a lot in the speech which we would agree with, and with which our members would agree', but wide differences remained on public spending and the social chapter of the EU's Maastricht treaty.

Inherent Causes of,  Legal Countermeasures Against Antidumping Actions    Apart from some irrational provisions of antidumping laws in  foreign countries and in the rules of the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade [GATT] and in their application, there are  also in China's own present political and economic system many  deficiencies and problems which have given cause for  investigations of China's conditions by various European and  American countries.    A. China's foreign trade system is basically one of strict  controls, but in actual fact, exports are not effectively  administered, and imports too are not strictly controlled. On  the other hand, all export-import companies and foreign  trade-oriented enterprises are themselves responsible for  earning their own foreign exchange and for their own profits,  and they are also ignorant of the law. For these reasons they  will not hesitate to fight among themselves, pushing down each  other's export prices, causing a continuous decline in the  prices of China's export products. This then of course easily  incurs accusations of dumping.    B. Target areas of China's exports are limited and export  distribution is irrational. Because China's reform and opening  up has only been going on for a short time, China's markets  abroad are still very limited. The countries and territories to  which China presently exports on a regular basis are Hong Kong,  the European Community, and the United States. Chinese products  have not yet penetrated other markets, such as Latin America,  for example. Under these circumstances, export products are  being distributed to an extremely narrow field, and there is  also no unified coordination between China's enterprises, so  that the allocation of markets has very obviously become  somewhat irrational. Even more serious is the widespread  practice of the "three ins and one compensation" trade  (importing materials for processing, importing samples and  ordering corresponding goods, importing parts for assembly, and  compensation trade). Although these types of trade have, to a  certain extent, been profitable for China, the various countries  will compute quantities and prices according to the origin of  the merchandise. China's profits will then be extremely small,  while Hong Kong, the main entrepot for such trade, will reap the  largest share of the profits, while China will also have to bear  the risk of antidumping measures by foreign countries.    In view of the two points mentioned above, China must adopt,  in legal respects and as soon as possible, the following  measures:    1. In legal respects, there has to be a further  clarification  of the legal position of the various state agencies in charge of  import-export affairs and of all import-export companies and  enterprises, and a clarification of their respective rights and  obligations. This would require that China promulgate as soon  as possible a "Foreign Trade Law," which would have to fix in  legal terms the whole series of mutual relations involved, and  should lead to a state of affairs in which economic activities  would have laws to rely on and rules to follow. The state's  import-export administration must combine the strict with the  moderate, and must take firm control of the main issues. At  present, China's agencies in charge are assuming administrative  charge of everything, but in actual fact administer everything  badly. In my opinion, an agency, placed in administrative charge  by the government, must not take on and concern itself with all  matters, big and small. Moreover, China's present system of  strict administrative controls is unsuited to China's further  efforts at reform and opening up, and incompatible with the  policy of moving the foreign trade companies and enterprises  toward the international market and having them participate  directly in the competition. The state organs in charge should  as soon as possible readjust the direction and mechanism of  their own administrative controls. They should adhere for  themselves to the larger orientation of serving the enterprises,  they should strengthen contacts with foreign governments, help  enterprises actively open up overseas markets, transmit  information, exert efforts in dispelling concerns and resolving  difficulties on the part of the enterprises, and should do a  good job of well-coordinated controls and effective guidance.  In their capacity of agents of foreign trade, the import-export  companies and enterprises must then, with regard to their  organizational setup and with regard to the macro-controls they  are subjected to, actively and of their own accord respect and  comply with administrative measures of control by superior  departments in charge. There must be no passive resistance and  going one's own way. At the same time, the foreign trade  enterprises and companies in all regions and of all systems must  strengthen their lateral economic associations, mutually  exchange information, and mutually coordinate action. There  must be no "civil war" among ourselves, we must take a unified  stand against the outside world, and there must be, as far as  possible, identity of prices for the same king of commodities.  At the same time as we shall actively open up and expand  international markets, we must better coordinate the allocation  of present international markets. It has already been proven  that engaging highhandedly in internal competition among  ourselves, to gain profits merely for one's own unit, may result  in a temporary and one-time profit, but that it will ultimately  not only harm the interests of others and of the state, but also  not necessarily be of profit for oneself.    2. Strengthening investigation and study of the legal  antidumping code of GATT and relevant legislation in other  countries, and compiling a Chinese antidumping law, antisubsidy  law, and other relevant laws.    As Chinese products are imported by other countries, they  will be subject to the limitations of the antidumping laws of  those countries, while when foreign products enter China, China  has no corresponding limitations or restrictions by way of  antidumping legislation. This is not fair, and is also not a  normal situation. Even though China is presently achieving a  certain positive result in protecting the Chinese internal  market by means of quantitative restrictions and raising import  duty, this is not a good long-range device. If it is the  intention to actively develop national industries, achieve a  smooth entry into GATT and as quickly as possible adjust to the  situation after joining GATT, the most positive and active  alternative is to set up, as quickly as possible, a Chinese  antidumping system. This would prevent the large-scale dumping  of foreign products in China, would prevent irrational harm  being thereby done to China's national industries by foreign  imports, and would promote China's industrial readjustment and  the healthy development of China's market economy. Enactment of  a Chinese antidumping law would necessitate a more intensive  investigation and study of the antidumping rules of GATT and the  antidumping laws of other countries. We should take GATT's  antidumping rules as basis, give in addition consideration to  the specific conditions in China, in formulating an antidumping  law and antisubsidy law that has Chinese characteristics and is  consonant with the international developmental trend.    Simultaneously, China also needs to perfect its present  legislation concerning foreign economic relations, to suit the  ongoing reform and opening up, especially with a view to the new  situation after joining GATT. Everything that is outdated and  backward in Chinas' legislation must be changed, and made to  conform with the demands of world standards in economics and  trade and with the fundamental principles of GATT.    3. Adopting effective countermeasures in actual practice, no  passive attitude and suffering a beating.    First of all, we must thoroughly study and utilize the  exceptional clauses in GATT rules to protect China's national  industries. GATT, being an international economic treaty, is at  the same time the product of antagonisms and compromises between  the signatory states. In order to coordinate the interests of  the various signatory states, GATT included certain exceptional  clauses. Through sustained struggle and effort, the developing  countries gained inclusion of some additional preferential  measures favoring the developing countries. Among these, the  ones that China can use to its advantage are:    1) The clause concerning the balance of international  receipts and payments. According to Article 12, China may, for  the reason of protecting its foreign financial status and  international balance of payments, place a limit on the quantity  and value of imported commodities. 2) The protective clause.  According to Article 18, China may, for the reason of raising  the general living standards of its people and of accelerating  the buildup of its infant industry, adopt appropriate customs-  and non-customs-related measures. According to the provisions  of Article 19, China, having undertaken the obligations that  include a reduction of customs duties, may, if that would allow  a large influx of certain products and thereby seriously harm or  seriously threaten domestic production of the same kind of  products, completely or partly abrogate, for a time, the said  obligation. 3) Exceptional clause. If certain particular  commodities pose a problem as to a country's protection of  natural resources, environmental protection, its public health  or national security, GATT rules allow the importing country in  question to impose restrictions on the importation or prohibit  the importation of this kind of articles.    Apart from making full use of the legal provisions, China's  import-export companies and enterprises should also give serious  attention to the utilization of legal techniques. Many Chinese  import-export companies and enterprises are little knowledgeable  as to international treaties and foreign laws, and pay little  attention even to domestic laws. If they are one day brought  before a court of law as defendants, they will therefore, not  know what law to adduce to protect their own interests. Their  methods will then be merely negative and passive; they will in  such a case try to shift responsibility to others and argue back  and forth, and not actively meet the accusation. At the same  time, they do not know how to utilize the special advantages of  joint interests with export merchants, distributors, or  commission agents, and will make no effort to gain their  cooperation and support. Enterprises and companies engaged in  foreign trade should employ legal advisors on permanent  contract, and have the lawyers check contracts before signing,  to ensure accuracy, so as to avoid as much as possible any  future economic disputes. If one day a dispute should occur, an  experienced lawyer should promptly be asked to assist in the  lawsuit, utilizing his expertise in legal matters and any of his  relevant social relations, so as to have him help come out  victorious.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Neven Kopandanova commentary: "BSP Has Monopoly"] </F>   [Text] On 21 February Zhan Videnov said that in addition  to meeting the visiting Russian parliamentarians as Bulgarian  Socialist parliamentarians, the two delegations also had  unofficial contacts at the party level. Apparently next week  there will be a meeting of Russia's leftist parties in which the  Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] will take part. On the Russian  side, the meeting will be attended by the Socialist Labor Party,  Rybkin's Agrarian Party of Russia [APR], and the "Free Russia"  People's Party [as published]. Our Socialists hope that other  CIS countries will also participate in the meeting.    The Socialists' active contacts with congenial parties in  Serbia, Greece, and Russia, where those parties rule, could  hardly be reduced to attempts on the part of the Bulgarian  Socialists to overcome the difficulties along the road to  Europe. There is a present danger that the BSP could monopolize  a part of our foreign policy. This evokes an even greater  concern against the background of the different views of the  political parties in our country in anything related to foreign  policy elements.    It is true that National Assembly Chairman and the Movement  for Rights and Freedoms [DPS] also received official invitations  to visit Russia. On 21 February deputies of the Union of  Democratic Forces [SDS] said that they also have been invited,  but for the time being they consider their invitation as  unofficial. In principle, the SDS was interested in  strengthening relations with Russia, but for the time being  there was no adequate program, [SDS deputy] Asparukh Panov said  on 21 February. The main foreign policy expert of the blue  coalition [SDS] did not hide his concern with the independent  foreign policy tunnels the BSP is tracing. He noted that the  BSP's foreign policy activity is becoming ever more intensive  and that this hardly contributes to a uniform Bulgarian foreign  policy.    Bulgarian tax payers noted a long time ago that there is no  uniform Bulgarian foreign policy. If the president is closer to  the SDS doctrine, the premier undoubtedly professes the BSP's  doctrine. However, since according to the Constitution, there  are two foreign policy centers in Bulgaria, it is reasonable to  expect their chiefs to clarify the direction in which the wind  blows. One could hardly doubt the fact that we need good  economic and political relations with Russia. The question is  to what extend we will be able to defend our independence and  equality in our relations with Russia, something that the two  centers, or at least one of them, apparently cannot guarantee.  It cannot be natural that the political force with the greatest  influence in our country -- the SDS -- does not have direct  contacts with a great power such as Russia. Such relations  would certainly introduce a new tone in international relations,  which will break out of the narrow party track in which the  Socialists pushed them through their monopoly.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Labour leaders challenged in vote on defence THE LABOUR conference defied the party leadership for the fourth successive year yesterday by voting for deep cuts in defence expenditure. The grassroots were more determined than ever, with 4.35m votes insisting that a Labour government should cut UK defence expenditure to the average of other western European countries. Only 831,000 voted for the national executive's recommendation to throw out the motion, confirming the strength of feeling against the Pounds 24bn defence budget. The rebellion will have little influence on the leadership, which has consistently ignored similar resolutions in each year since 1989. Mr Tony Clarke for the national executive committee argued that the leadership was not hostile to the sentiments of the motion, but its vague wording failed to identify how the average figure should be calculated. Speakers including Ms Debra Gold, from Hampstead and Highgate, protested that the leadership had 'hidden away and disowned' its peace and disarmament policy. More important, on Thursday the result of a card vote showed the extent of resistance to any significant alteration to the union's block vote at party conferences. Delegates voted by a margin of four to one for a motion endorsing the present relationship in spite of appeals from the leadership to leave the ultimate decision to a working party which is due to report by Christmas.</p>

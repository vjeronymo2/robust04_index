			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / BMA told to stop issuing private health fees guide The government yesterday accepted a Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommendation that the British Medical Association should stop publishing fee guidelines for consultants' private practice. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said an MMC investigation had established that, by following the guidelines, consultants could 'charge higher fees than would otherwise be possible'. The BMA immediately agreed to cease publication and distribution of its guidelines, but attacked the decision as perverse. It said the MMC's own research showed that 70 per cent of the private healthcare market was influenced by the fees schedules of Bupa, the biggest medical insurer, and other provident associations. The MMC decided that publication of the Bupa fee scales could continue. It found in its report, published yesterday, that a complex monopoly under the 1973 Fair Trading Act existed because of the way some National Health Service consultants fixed their charges for private work by reference to the BMA or Bupa guidelines. In 1992, says the report, about 6,600 consultants followed the Bupa benefit maxima and 3,400 the BMA guidelines. Both were treated by the consultants as tariffs, with the doctors setting at least half their charges within 2 per cent of the BMA or Bupa figures. The report recommends prohibiting publication of the BMA guidelines and introducing greater clarity into the setting of consultants' charges. It concludes that Bupa's published scales were not sufficiently connected with the consultants who acted on them to be included in the complex monopoly. A distinction should be drawn between insurers' benefits, 'the publication of which we accept is a proper step for the carrying out of their function as insurers', and the BMA guidelines 'which are designed to help organise the market'. Given the relatively weak position of patients in the private healthcare market, says the report, Bupa and the other insurers were the principal counterweight to the consultants. The Bupa benefits maxima, which were generally lower than the BMA guidelines, 'have had a restraining effect on consultants' charges'. The issue of private consultants' fees was referred to the MMC in September 1992, after concerns over the introduction of the BMA guidelines in 1989. Most treatment in private hospitals is carried out by NHS consultants. About two-thirds of their charges are financed by medical insurance, which covers about 12 per cent of the population. Many consultants, says the report, find price competition distasteful or even unethical. Private Medical Services, Monopolies and Mergers Commission. HMSO. Pounds 23.</p>

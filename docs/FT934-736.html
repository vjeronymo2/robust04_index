			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Duty calls drinkers to France Just a few cross-Channel shopping days to Christmas - and a sense of urgency grips the crowded Dover to Calais ferries. Swarms of foot passengers clamber aboard and station themselves strategically at the entrance to the duty-free shop. Many of them clutch folding trolleys to wheel away the bargains on offer. The scrum starts as soon as the ship sails and lasts throughout the trip. Shoppers emerge with a few cases of beer, a bottle of spirits and a pack of cigarettes - and fortify themselves for the struggle to collect more spirits and cigarettes on the return journey. At Calais the ships disgorge the bigger spenders. The vehicles that roll off towards the town include scores of rented Transit vans, a pick-up truck and a black cab. There are cars towing trailers, old Post Office and British Rail vans, and a horsebox. Mr Bill Simpson, of Whitbread, who has been monitoring the beer run, says there are a dozen warehouses and supermarkets catering for British shoppers. Calais Chamber of Commerce estimated that British visitors would buy 80m litres of beer in the pre-Christmas period. 'This trade,' said Mr Simpson, 'now represents a quarter of the total beer market in northern France.' EastEnders, one of the biggest warehouses, run by Mr Dave West, a Londoner, was sealed off this week by police who said he had not complied with planning rules. At Pidou cash-and-carry the drivers of four articulated lorries joined a stream of buyers of Stella Artois and Kronenbourg beer at FFr45 to FFr49 (Pounds 5.20 to Pounds 5.66) for six litres. Among mountainous stacks of cases at Beers R Us, 12 litres of super-strength Skol lager was on offer at Pounds 14 - 'about the cost of duty in the UK', said Mr Simpson. At another warehouse one customer claimed to have bought Pounds 1,500-worth of champagne as seasonal presents and to have saved Pounds 2,500 on his usual bill. Another shopper was less fortunate. In a hurry, he loaded his van with cases of bottles labelled Panache and learned back at the docks that he was taking home a load of shandy.</p>

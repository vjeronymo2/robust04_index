			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russians leave US without grain debt deal MR ALEKSANDR Shokhin, Russian first deputy prime minister, left Washington yesterday without an agreement on ending his country's grain credit problems, leaving US-Russian grain trade stalled. After Mr Shokhin and Mr Mike Espy, the US agriculture secretary, ended their talks on Tuesday Mr Espy said he remained dedicated to finding a solution to the impasse, but he had no specific timetable. Grain traders remain convinced that the US will offer Russia a grain export programme of some kind - most likely food aid - when Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin meet for a summit April 4. However, Mr Espy said he did not view that date as a deadline and added that there were some outstanding problems. Disappointed traders pushed Chicago grain and soyabean futures prices lower in early trading. Mr Warren King, grain analyst with Cargill Investors Services, said he was preparing to reduce his forecast of wheat exports to Russia. 'The (wheat) marketing year is over in June,' he said. 'We're running out of time.' Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union owe more than Dollars 416m in overdue loans for US grain purchases. Russia made what was viewed as a token interest payment of Dollars 15m, the first since late November, before Mr Shokhin and Mr Espy held their final meeting. Under the US guaranteed loan programme, Russia must repay all of its arrears before fresh grain loans can be granted. To lower the bill, Mr Shokhin has requested that Russia's grain indebtedness to the US be separated from other former Soviet republics. In a speech in Chicago on Tuesday evening, Mr Yegor Gaidar, chief economic adviser to President Yeltsin, explained that Russia was balancing its obligations to the US against its indebtedness to other Paris Club nations. 'We fulfilled our payments to the US until November, neglecting other members of the Paris Club, which affected our relations with Europe and Japan,' he said. 'We're looking for a way out without hurting our relationship with other countries of the world.' Russia has made strategic payments to at least one other wheat supplier to keep world grain shipments moving. The Australian Wheat Board said it had received payments on grain shipped to Russia two years ago and had contracted to supply an undisclosed further amount of Australian grain. 'A small cash payment has been received from the Russians and shipments of Australian wheat will commence against that payment,' said Wheat Board chairman Mr Clinton Condon.</p>

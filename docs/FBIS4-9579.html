			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ylli Rakipi: "We Should Tell Greece </F> Everything We Think"]    [Text] "When you shake hands with a Greek," as the English  saying goes, "you need to count your fingers afterwards." Given  that such words come from a distant island, one can imagine what  the Albanians have to say about their ancient neighbor -- a  neighbor who historically has only thought about how to tear his  neighbor to pieces! Lately, particularly now, the Hellenic  nature has become more cruel and is being manifested to its full  extent. It has been proclaimed on the pages of newspapers and  at mass rallies, from congress rostrums and in diplomatic  corridors, at paramilitary commando camps and at holy altars.  In all these places the Hellenic nature shrieks.    The term "Greek chauvinist circles" is by now outdated. The  term "certain circles" is also lackluster. The madness of the  senile Sebastiano [ethnic Greek head of the Albanian Orthodox  church] can no longer be called simply madness. The  anti-Albanian activities of the criminal Omonia organization,  the killing of Albanians while they sleep in the night or by a  stab in the back; the maltreatment of the Albanian refugees --  all these and other reported or unreported things show that the  efforts to Hellenize Albania have become Greek state policy.  Hundreds of anti-Albanian bulletins, books, maps, and calendars  are being published. Dozens of mass protest rallies are being  staged to call for the liberation of Vorio-Epirus. All these  things are taking place in Greece, but the Greek Government  claims to know nothing about them. The holy Greek state denies  any responsibility for the paramilitary groups who cross the  border to kill Albanians at night (as if they were not soldiers,  but a cloud of rain passing from Greece into Albania). The Greek  state knows nothing and disclaims any responsibility for what is  going on and what is being engineered in Greece against Albania  and the Albanians.    However, does the Greek state know what the 50,000 pampered  Albanian Greeks are doing in Albania? Or what the Omonia people  and the men of God, the priests, are doing? Even these things  are not known to the Greek state. It happens perhaps because  governing the European Community has given great problems and  concerns to the Greek state!    Let us then remind the very busy Greek state that a good  part  of the Greek minority in Albania, who are coddled by the  Albanian state and people, illegally distribute their books,  bulletins, appeals, and calendars, all calling for Vorio-Epirus  to be liberated. Let the Greek statesmen know that Omonia is a  criminal organization that pursues anticonstitutional and  anti-Albanian activities! Let them learn that the angels of the  Orthodox church in Albania want it to be a solely Greek Church!  All these things must be taught to the Greek statesmen. They  must be taught, although they are already aware of such things.  First and foremost they must be taught that the 40-50,000 Greek  immigrants who came to Albania to earn a crust of bread can  never Hellenize this country.    "When you shake hands with a Greek, count your fingers  afterward," as the English say.</p>

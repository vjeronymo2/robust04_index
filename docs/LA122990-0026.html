			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.N. VOTE AGAINST ISRAEL ON PALESTINIANS  </P> <P> High fives to U.N. Security Council for its endorsement of an international  peace conference to resolve the Palestinian issue.  </P> <P> Israel claims to want a peace treaty with its Arab neighbors, but won't  participate in an international conference to resolve the crises.  </P> <P> Israel also asserts that it wants to reach a negotiated settlement with duly  elected representatives of the Palestinians, but refuses to meet with their  overwhelming choice, the PLO.  </P> <P> Such doublespeak is probably a smoke screen to mask the policies of Israel's  right wing, as exemplified by Israeli Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, who was  recently quoted by The Times, "There will never be a second Palestinian state.  Jordan is the Palestinian state." Sharon went on to say that Palestinians could  have "a life almost without interference." What Sharon and his Likud buddies  are really offering the Palestinians is continuing subjugation; there is no  incentive for them to negotiate.  </P> <P> The litany of PLO atrocities against innocents is deserving of worldwide  condemnation and suspicion. However, the same can be said of Israeli  involvement in atrocities dating back to 1948, such as the King David Hotel,  Dier Yassin, Lod, etc.  </P> <P> What is so tragic about all of this is that Israel has struggled too long and  shed too much blood not to understand the aspirations of another people who are  currently struggling and bleeding for identical reasons. Any Palestinian  solution must embody the principle that survival and independence be equally  weighted for both sides, rather than the present concept that the survival of  one people depends upon the subjugation of another.  </P> <P> MICHAEL A. SCOTT  </P> <P> Glendora  </P></p>

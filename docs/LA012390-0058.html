			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DREXEL BUYOUT OFFICIAL VANISHES AFTER REPORT;  </P> <P> TAKEOVERS: JEFFREY BECK, WHO PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE BEATRICE AND RJR/NABISCO  DEALS, DISAPPEARED AFTER A NEWS STORY SAID HE USED FALSE TALES OF MILITARY  HEROICS AND A POTENTIAL INHERITANCE IN HIS PITCHES TO CUSTOMERS.  </P> <P> A top Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. investment banker who played a significant  role in some of the largest corporate takeover fights of the 1980s apparently  has gone into hiding after a newspaper account on Monday that claimed he had  lied repeatedly to customers and co-workers about his own background.  </P> <P> The Wall Street Journal reported that Jeffrey Beck, 43, nicknamed "Mad Dog,"  had made up elaborate stories about military service in Vietnam, including  tales of heroism, war wounds and decorations. But the newspaper claimed that  Beck had never been on active military service. The report also said Beck  falsely claimed that he was heir to a fortune in the billions of dollars.  </P> <P> The well-connected investment banker reportedly used the tales of his war  heroism as part of his pitch to customers -- individuals involved in leveraged  buyouts or corporate takeover battles whom he persuaded to turn to Drexel for  investment banking services. Beck was regarded as one of the top "rain makers"  in investment banking, able to drum up hugely profitable merger and acquisition  business for Drexel.  </P> <P> Beck played a key role in two of the largest leveraged buyouts ever, those of  Beatrice Cos. and RJR/Nabisco. He enjoyed a close professional relationship  with Henry Kravis, a principal of the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis  Roberts &amp; Co. He also was credited with getting Drexel hired in the  takeover fights for Federated Department Stores and Pillsbury.  </P> <P> The disclosures, if true, mark a significant new embarrassment for Drexel,  which has been reeling from the criminal prosecution of its former junk bond  chief, Michael Milken, the fallout from the firm's own guilty plea to  securities fraud charges and from the depressed state of the junk bond market.  </P> <P> A Drexel spokesman, Steven Anreder, refused to discuss the specifics of the  Wall Street Journal article. But he said Beck had "preliminarily tendered a  resignation a couple of weeks ago." He said Beck didn't give a reason for  wanting to resign, and the matter was left unresolved after a couple of initial  talks with senior Drexel executives. Anreder said Drexel since then has been  unable to find or talk with Beck.  </P> <P> "We have been unable to be in contact with him since then," Anreder said. He  refused to say if Drexel is now inclined to accept the resignation.  </P> <P> Beck couldn't be found by The Times for comment. A secretary in his office said  she had heard from him by telephone shortly before a reporter called. But she  said she did not know where he was and confirmed that Drexel officials had been  unable to get in touch with him.  </P></p>

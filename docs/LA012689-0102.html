			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOPEZ TRANSFERS TO GLENDALE FOR SPRING SEMESTER  </P> <P> Ronnie Lopez, who started at quarterback for Pierce College last season,  enrolled for the spring semester at Glendale on Tuesday and said he expects to  play football next season for the Vaqueros.  </P> <P> His body may say otherwise.  </P> <P> Lopez underwent surgery Dec. 28 to repair torn ligaments in his right shoulder  sustained in a game against Santa Monica. Lopez is in rehabilitation therapy  and said he will not be able to throw a football until June.  </P> <P> In 1987, Lopez led Franklin High to the City Section 3-A Division title and was  named 3-A player of the year. He did not receive a scholarship offer from a  4-year school because, in part, of low Scholastic Aptitude Test scores.  </P> <P> Lopez said his decision to transfer was based on the long daily commute from  Eagle Rock to Woodland Hills and that former Franklin teammates Anthony Navarro  and Juan Cardona play for Glendale.  </P> <P> At Pierce, Lopez completed 66 of 163 passes for 921 yards and 6 touchdowns and  threw 9 interceptions.  </P> <P> Lopez will face an uphill battle to start at Glendale. "Darren Fitzgerald is  definitely our No. 1 guy right now," said Sid Stark, the Glendale quarterbacks  coach.  </P></p>

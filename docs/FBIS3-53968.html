			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio report by economic correspondent Gil Tamari followed </F> by Moti 'Eden video report]    [Excerpts] [Tamari] Golan Heights settlers have enjoyed  massive government investments over the last few years. It  appears that no harm was done to investments on the Golan  Heights this year as well. Treasury officials this evening  confirmed, albeit off the record, that investments will continue  at the same level as before, although they will not include new  projects. Our correspondent in the north, Moti 'Eden, reports  on this issue:    [Begin 'Eden recording] The amount of funds to be invested  on the Golan Heights this year will not fall from that invested  last year. This includes tourism infrastructure, new factories,  and the expansion of existing factories. Last year the state  invested 100 million shekels for development purposes on the  Golan. This included expanding the Qatzrin industrial zone and  kibbutzim factories. The industrial output on the Golan in the  same period was six times higher than the investment, namely  $200 million. [passage omitted]    The government plans to invest the same sum of money which  was invested last year on the Golan Heights, mainly in industry  and tourism projects. [passage omitted]    Another special budgetary allocation which was not included  in the 100 million shekels allocated to the Golan last year is  40 million shekels used by the Construction and Housing Ministry  for renovating Golan Heights roads.

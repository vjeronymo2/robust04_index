			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / French assurance over relations with Nato FRANCE signalled yesterday it would not allow any disagreement with the US over the right tactics in Bosnia to check its slow move towards a closer relationship with Nato. 'Without returning to Nato's integrated military command, we want to demonstrate that there are more relaxed relations between France and the Atlantic alliance,' the Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 'We are very attached to the Atlantic alliance and particularly to the presence of American troops in Europe.' A day earlier Mr Francois Leotard, defence minister, had said France might adopt Spain's compromise towards Nato later this year. Like the French, Spanish troops do not come under peacetime Nato command; but unlike France, Madrid sends its defence minister to Nato meetings. Mr Leotard also said in a Le Monde interview that it would be 'useful for more French officers to participate' in Nato meetings. Reuter also reported that France had reclaimed limited voting rights in Nato's supreme military committee. A French official said France had voted on peacekeeping operations discussed by the committee but reverted to non-voting observer status on other issues.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Isakov, chairman of Russian </F> Federation State Duma Committee for Legislation and Judicial and  Legal Reform, by Yuriy Zvyagin; place and date not given:  "Vladimir Isakov: Respect for the Law Will Triumph"]    [Text] Vladimir Isakov has a reputation as an experienced  parliamentarian. This is evidently why the State Duma deputies  elected him to one of the key posts in their chamber -- that of  chairman of the Committee for Legislation and Judicial and Legal  Reform.    [Isakov] Our small committee has been set extraordinarily  great tasks. It has to prepare and make a preliminary  examination of drafts of federal constitutional laws, federal  laws in the spheres of human rights, the judicial system, civil,  civil-procedural, criminal, criminal-procedural, and corrective  labor law, and legislation on administrative offenses, and  amnesty decrees.    We are obliged to make a preliminary examination of  proposals  for a revision of the Russian Federation Constitution and for  amendments to it and to organize parliamentary hearings on  questions of implementing the Constitution and federal  constitutional laws. We are required to prepare rulings on  draft laws and also to monitor the execution of legislation.    [Zvyagin] Are the committee's members sufficiently ready for  responsible work, and does the difference in their political  views and the fact that sometimes they are even opposed not  embarrass you?    [Isakov] Indeed, we all have very different political  partialities. But then there is also something which unites  literally all of us. We are jurists. Many have academic  degrees and have had plenty of practice. I myself am a doctor  of juridical sciences and a professor, and I was chairman of the  former Supreme Soviet's Committee for Constitutional  Legislation. I have devoted considerable effort to lawmaking.    The same can be said of Boris Zolotukhin, my deputy. He used  to tackle problems of judicial and legal reform on the former  analogous committee. Zolotukhin represents "Russia's Choice."  Another deputy of mine is Dr. of Juridical Sciences Viktor  Vishnyakov (Liberal Democratic Party of Russia), leading  associate at the Institute of Legislation and Comparative  Jurisprudence. A third is Sergey Zenkin (Party of Russian Unity  and Accord), a lecturer at Ivanovo State University.    I believe that we will also be able to make successful use  of  the rich experience of Anatoliy Lukyanov and Professors Vladimir  Tumanov and Viktor Sheynis. Incidentally, before being elected  to the State Duma, the latter was, along with Boris Zolotukhin,  a member of the Legislative Proposals Commission under the  Russian Federation president. They have all done considerable  work over almost the whole range of problems. As regards the  diversity of political views, this diversity must be overcome by  respect for the law.    [Zvyagin] Has the committee already gotten involved in  lawmaking activity?    [Isakov] Of course. We have already prepared a Russian  Federation draft law on the procedure for publishing and  bringing into force federal constitutional laws, federal laws,  and acts of the chambers of the Federal Assembly. This is one  of the fundamental, top-priority documents.    Our committee has also prepared another important document.  It is the declaration on the legal succession of the Federal  Assembly with regard to the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of  Russian Federation People's Deputies. In particular, we hope  for the return to parliament of the Institute of Legislation and  Comparative Jurisprudence.    [Zvyagin] What is your contribution to the entire State  Duma's plan of law-drafting work?    [Isakov] Since the members of our committee have more  experience of lawmaking work than others, people heed our voice.  We are now seeking to draw the paramount attention of all  committees to the creation of federal constitutional and federal  laws which stem from the Russian Federation Constitution and  which ensure its operation. Among the drafts of normative acts,  to draw attention to those aimed at more fully defending  citizens' rights and freedoms, developing the social sphere, and  strengthening state-legal foundations. Members of our committee  will also take a very direct part in drawing up the majority of  future legal normative documents. Above all, this means these  laws: on the state flag; the state anthem; the referendum; on  the Russian Federation Constitutional Assembly; on the  government; on the judicial system; on the commissioner for  human rights.    More than other members of parliamentary formations, we will  have to tackle the preparation of draft codes of legislation:  civil, criminal, criminal-procedural, criminal-executive, air,  land, tax, housing, and labor legislation, legislation on  marriage and the family, on administrative offenses, and others.    [Zvyagin] What other draft laws which need to be examined  and adopted without delay could you name?    [Isakov] On the procedure for ensuring the opportunity for  citizens to familiarize themselves with documents and materials  which directly affect their rights and freedoms; on public  associations; on the procedure for holding rallies,  demonstrations, processions, and pickets; on elections to the  State Duma, on the procedure for forming the Federation Council  of the Federal Assembly, on the main provisions for elections to  organs of local self-management; on federal state service; on  the application of citizens to state organs and organs of local  self-management. I also deem it obligatory for us to  participate in the work on them, for the Committee for  Legislation and Judicial and Legal Reform is responsible for the  quality of our entire new parliament's lawmaking.</p>

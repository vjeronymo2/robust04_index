			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz predicts break-even for year Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz, the German diesel engine and industrial plant manufacturer, expects to break even in 1993 despite poor results in the first half of the year. The company said that for the full year, turnover would fall by 10 per cent to DM3.3bn (Dollars 1.95bn). In 1992 its turnover was DM3.7bn and it then broke even on a pre-tax basis. Mr Werner Kirchgasser, the chief executive, said the company would again break even this year because of its cost-savings programme and a pick-up in business at its industrial plants divisions. KHD said it had saved 'hundreds of millions of D-Marks' by reducing its workforce and raising productivity. The company said it would continue to slim down by laying off 800 employees by the end of 1993 from its current workforce of 11,000. In 1992, the company reduced its payroll by over 2,000 employees. KDH also said it had significantly reduced material costs. It added that while the motors and agricultural machine-tools divisions were suffering from the general slowdown in domestic and international markets, business was picking up in the industrial plants side. Turnover in that division is expected to reach over DM1.8bn for the year, over a third of KHD's total sales. It said this would greatly improve the overall turnover, which dropped by 21 per cent in the first six months of the year.</p>

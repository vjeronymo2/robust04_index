			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Enrique Ortez Colindres, adviser </F> to Honduran President Reina and Liberal Party spokesman, with  Alfredo Villaclara -- live]    [Text] [Villaclara] We are in touch Lawyer Enrique Ortez  Colindres, adviser to the president. Is this sort of warning,  made even at the United nations -- as revealed by Deputy Luis  Lagos [regarding a possible coup d'etat in Honduras] -- possible  at this stage of the process to consolidate Honduran democracy?  Good morning, Dr. Ortez.    [Ortez] Good morning, HRN.. I thank you for being so kind  to call me, because I would like to comment in two capacities,  as the official Liberal Party spokesman and as an adviser to the  Presidency of the Republic. It is also worthwhile to say -- I  hope without seeming pedantic, because I am trying to shed light  on this case -- that I also speak as former Honduran ambassador  to the United Nations.    I want to tell you that about 160 countries are represented  at the United Nations, and its members can talk about anything  from A to Z. In the assemblies and committees, anyone can talk  about robberies, human rights violations, marijuana, cocaine,  and gunrunning. Anything goes.    Nevertheless, I do not see how any credence can be given to  a  coup d'etat in a country as serious as ours; a country that  installed a new government, which is supported by the people,  not even 100 days ago. I see no possibility of that, and I will  tell you why.    First, the Honduran Army took an oath and promised to obey  the people's mandate. You could say they offered to do just  that under several governments that were dealt coups d'etat.  But I want to ask you whether there could be a coup d'etat --  you who know Honduras -- 90 days after a party as strong as the  Liberal Party assumed power. I want to ask you if there could be  a coup when 1 million Liberals are ready to defend this  government. What de facto government could achieve stability  given the current circumstances if even strong governments led  by tyrants, as was the case in Panama, could not achieve it?  You also saw what happened in Nicaragua. You see what is  happening in some South American countries and in Haiti, where  they have been unable to consolidate themselves.    At present, with the resolutions issued by the United  Nations, which brings the international community together, it  is difficult for any John Doe to break constitutional order and  stay in power. I think that the time for coups is over. Why?  Because if support is what is needed at this time, we are  capable of showing support. We will make the call within the  party and we will urge the 1 million people who supported Dr.  Carlos Roberto Reina to make a show of force. You will see what  kind of party the Liberal Party is.    It would not be the first time we faced a coup. What has  happened when someone dared do carry one out? Corrupt  governments that brought virtual destitution to our country were  installed. Thus, I do not think it would be possible -- in light  of the international situation -- because there would be no  support for it. I do not think it will happen because the Army  is obedient. I do not think it could happen because the Army  lacks a leadership capable of ousting a democratic government  supported by 1 million Liberals and people who believe in  democracy. It would be the suicide not of the Liberal  government but of the Armed Forces. There are intelligent people  in the Armed Forces.    Believe me Rene, I have noticed that selfish interests --  the interests of corruption, of sinecures, of all those who have  been on the payroll, all those who today are not enjoying  privileges from the government because we are implementing a new  system -- are trying to promote unrest. I can assure you that  this will not happen. As a member of the Liberal Party and as  official spokesman, I urge the Honduran people, especially the  members of the Liberal Party, to express their support for the  government, whose only crime is trying to end corruption and  establish a new system of government. It is obvious that the  wounded have joined forces because they know that a moral  revolution is on and that dishonest people will be put in jail  because the Honduran people have elected a completely different  person. We can see in the media -- spoken and written -- that  they are trying to exploit the discontent that exists in the  country.    Carlos Roberto Reina is not God and he cannot perform  miracles. Our country was completely sacked. In December alone,  1 million pesos were distributed in transfers using the people's  funds. The previous administration supposedly subsidized  kerosene, while three big fish stole the people's money. The  previous government sacked Injupen [Retirement and Pensions  Institute], so now the 50,000 houses that were to be built for  young people will not be built as quickly as planned. The  project will not be canceled. According to the director of that  institute, only 500,000 lempiras were left. When I was  government minister, the contributions and savings of public  employees totaled $1 billion, but those funds were misused in  risky projects. Land that had been purchased for 1.14 [currency  not specified] per square meter was sold the following day for  200 or 300 lempiras per square meter, stealing 40 to 42 million  in each of those operations. All this will be uncovered,  because this government will make decisions.    Therefore, I ask the Honduran people and Liberal Party  members to remain calm but to be alert, because those who  lost....[pauses] I am not even blaming the National Party, which  suffered the defeat, but people and groups that held sinecure  jobs in the past and lived like parasites on the national  budget. They are defending their interests and attacking the  government to negotiate those shameful salaries that previous  administrations paid at the expense of the Honduran people.</p>

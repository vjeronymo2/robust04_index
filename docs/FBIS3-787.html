			<p>Language: <F P=105> Zulu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Comment and Opinion" page: "There is nothing </F> sacrosanct about 27 April" -- article published in English]    [Text] Isn't it amazing how the Government and the ANC  [African National Congress] are so adamant on April 27 as the  ONLY possible date for the first ever democratic  elections for South Africa?    Most South Africans are surely puzzled as to why this should  be the case.    We certainly are, given that the matter is by no means as  cut  and dried as it is made out to be. In the first instance, we  should cast our minds back to how it was that this date was  agreed to in the first place.    What happened was that all the parties at the World Trade  Centre, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] included, agreed to a  resolution which stated that the election date should be set  ONCE there had been sufficient progress in  negotiations.    However, the ink was barely dry on this when Messrs  Ramaphosa  and Meyer started agitating to have the date set --  DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE AGREED-TO PRECONDITIONS HAD NOT  BEEN SATISFIED.    In other words, there had not been sufficient progress in  negotiations. Indeed, the joint stonewalling by the Government  and ANC -- in refusing to even consider the IFP's proposals on  the form of state, on the negotiations process and on violence  -- resulted in an impasse which was "resolved" by way of the  mechanism of "sufficient consensus."    The date was set, and on 2 July the IFP walked out of  Kempton  Park in protest.    In other words, 27 Apri? was not a democratically determined  (ie, all-inclusive) election date. Not only were the  preconditions agreed to beforehand totally ignored, but those  parties which objected to this procedural abuse were simply  overruled.    To these parties, 27 April never therefore assumed the false  status to which it was subsequently elevated. 27 April was  merely another symptom of the characteristic World Trade Centre  craziness which urged that dates be set BEFORE  substantive agreements were properly reached, instead of  AFTERWARDS.    The fact is that those parties which created the 27 April  problem and who now believe the date cannot be changed, are  living in cloud-cuckoo land.    Reality #1 is that the prime objective before all parties  should be to create an all-inclusive constitutional settlement  without which the elections and subsequent "democracy" may well  be severely threatened.    Surely it is self-evident that the prime issue is reaching  an  agreement, and that the implementation of this must come next?  To put the cart before the horse is both stupid and dangerous.    Reality #2 is that certain parties have already been  conducting their election campaign for many months. They have  had road shows, have conducted massive advertising campaigns,  and have done all that parties do by way of presenting  themselves to the electorate in order to win votes.    Other parties, however, have not even started yet. This may  suit the Government and ANC which now have a huge head start,  but since everyone agreed early on in the negotiations process  to a levelling of the playing field in order to allow parties to  participate in fair and free elections, it stands to reason that  this agreement be adhered to.    The big question, of course, is whether this is possible.  Not in terms of political will, but constitutionally.    Reality #3 is the simple fact that there is absolutely no  valid reason why the date cannot be changed. The term of office  of the present government expires in September this year, at  which stage an election must be called.    In other words, there is no legal or constitutional  impediment to elections being held in May, June, July, August or  September. It changes absolutely nothing other than the date  itself.    We all know the ANC and Government are reluctant to change  the date, but equally, we all know it can be changed should  there be a need to do so. The question is -- are the  Government and ANC more concerned with behaving as they have  done to date, in forcing through their deal regardless of the  consequences, or are they prepared to be reasonable?    Nothing stops the date being changed other than obstinacy, a  stubborn refusal to be fair and a desperate attempt to gain  power at all costs. It is surely time for a rethink -- if  they're the democrats they profess to be, there should be no  problem in being reasonable.    After all, we've waited more than three hundred years for  this momentous occasion -- does a month or two really make that  much of a difference?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Doubts have been raised over the civil construction  technology of nuclear reactors following the mishap in the  Reactor Building (RB) 1 at the Kaiga nuclear power project  recently. Considering that the National Power Corporation (NPC)  has not experienced such problems, critics feel that the setback  calls for a review.    The Project Director, Mr. Paramahams Tiwari, said an enquiry  into the design and execution was underway. The Enquiry  Committee includes Mr. C. M. Surendra. NPC Director  (Engineering), Dr. Prem Krishna, Professsor, (Civil Engineering,  Roorkee Universlty, Mr. D. Rajappa, Chairman and Managing  Director, Ministry of Water Resources, and Mr. Kushawaha, Head,  Reactor Structure Section.    Following the mishap on May 13, when about 130 tonnes of  concrete from the under-surface of the inner dome fell from 40  feet, some debris had to be cleared to prevent it from damaging  the dust-sensitive equipment housed in RB 1. To document  evidence for further enquiry, videographs and photographs were  taken. he added.    While the civil construction work was curtailed, othcr  electrical and mechanical jobs were being done in the building.    The total dome would now have to be recast, which could be  done in three months. It would not delay the project scheduled  for completion in June 1996, Mr. Tiwari explained.    The structure design, submitted by Stup Consultants, Bombay,  was approved by the NPC and cleared by AERB. Subsequently,  I&amp;T  was awarded the civil construction contract which includes the  RB 1. The 42-metre inner dome was designed to withstand a  pressure of 25 pounds per square inch.    Designing a dome like the RB 1, which has to bear the weight  of 600 cubic metres of concrete, involves pre-stressing.  However, the degree to which pre-stressing can be done is  circumscribed by parameters governing the elasticity of the  material in use. It is pointed out that in this case, the  localised failure might have occurred because of transcending  the elastic limit. The structural engineers have speculated  that the binding factor which causes the dome to hold like an  integral whole may have also been contributory.    Interestingly, had not the print media chanced upon the  event, the localised structural setback might not have become  public. The roof of the fire-station on the project site also  suffered minor deformations from suspected structural problems.</p>

In an  earlier exclusive interview with INTERFAX, Meshkov made it clear  that the Crimean naval forces are strong enough to defend this  peninsula on the Black Sea.    As the press-service noted, "Since responsibilities for  national defense rest with the country's president and defense  minister and since the Crimea is, although autonomous, also an  integral part of the Ukraine, it is exclusively within the  competence of Ukraine's president to discuss Ukrainian troop  withdrawal from the Crimea."    "Meshkov is not a military man, and therefore cannot assess  the defense sufficiency of southern Ukraine," the press service  noted.</p>

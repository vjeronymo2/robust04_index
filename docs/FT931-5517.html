			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Williams Holdings The rerating of Williams Holdings' shares since the summer gets it out of something of a box. Funding yesterday's acquisition of the Thorn fire extinguisher business with equity makes sense now the shares stand at a small price earnings premium to the market average. Its respectable full-year profit goes some way to justifying the market's faith. Yet Williams' ability to finance expansion with debt or out of cash flow still looks limited. A small asset base has always explained its aversion to debt. Yesterday's provision for deferred tax on the pension fund surplus - and the looming provision for post-retirement healthcare costs in the US - will shave net assets further. A gearing ratio of 43 per cent is not excessive. But it will rise smartly if Williams funds acquisitions - particularly of branded products which require goodwill write-offs - with borrowings. Although the company argues for interest cover as a better measure, the City's preference for balance sheet gearing remains a fact of life. Cash flow was broadly neutral last year after the proceeds of disposals. That should improve in line with trading conditions. The Pounds 84m dividend payment, though, remains a barrier to building a war-chest. Williams could always conserve cash by growing the dividend slower than profits. But that might undermine the rating of the shares. Judging by the small increase in the pay-out yesterday, it is loath to take the risk.</p>

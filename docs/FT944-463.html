			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / International Company News: Cadillac Fairview gets court protection Cadillac Fairview, the big Canadian property developer, has obtained court protection from its creditors while it tries to stitch together a financial restructuring. The Toronto-based company, whose securities are held mainly by North American institutional investors and 'vulture' funds, has debts of CDollars 5.3bn (USDollars 3.8bn), including CDollars 2.3bn of mortgages tied to specific properties. Its developments include the landmark Eaton Centre and Toronto-Dominion Centre in Toronto, Pacific Place in Vancouver, and commercial buildings in several US cities. Cadillac sought the court order in an effort to prevent nervous creditors triggering a liquidation of assets. The action was directed mainly at Goldman Sachs, the New York investment bank which holds 28 per cent of Cadillac's senior bank debt, totalling CDollars 1.1bn. A real-estate investment fund managed by Goldman is also one of four parties which have submitted proposals to acquire a controlling equity stake in Cadillac as part of the proposed restructuring. Despite its balance-sheet problems, Cadillac is widely regarded as having a blue-chip property portfolio. The other three bidders are New York's Blackstone Group in partnership with JP Morgan; a real-estate management firm controlled by US financier Mr Gerald O'Connor, in partnership with the Ontario teachers' pension fund; and a group comprising Canada's Cambridge Shopping Centres and the Caisse de Depot, the Quebec public pension fund. Mr Justice James Farley gave Cadillac until January 31 to present a draft restructuring plan. During this period, management will be allowed to negotiate with potential investors, without sharing details with the creditors. However, Goldman Sachs's 28 per cent holding of one class of debt is sufficient to block any proposal which it finds unacceptable.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Capital adequacy Creating a level regulatory playing field for banks and investment groups throughout the European Union is a laudable ambition. But the capital adequacy directive, due to take effect in just 14 months, is flawed. One problem is that the directive fails to achieve its main objective of ensuring fair competition between non-bank investment groups and banks' securities subsidiaries. The banks' securities businesses will still be subsidised by cheap capital from deposit bases  - less costly because, in the last resort, they are guaranteed by governments. Worse, the new regulations distort the market. The capital requirements for securities will, on occasions, be 32 times less than for loans with similar risk, so banks will be encouraged to develop securitised lending over traditional loans. This was gradually happening anyway, but it remains un-satisfactory that a significant acceleration should be the unintended result of regulation rather than market forces. The directive's eventual impact will depend on the authorities' interpretation and implemention. The UK looks set to reinforce its record of adopting a legalistic, hair-shirt approach to European legislation through 'super-compliance' - insisting on capital adequacy and documentation even greater than that required by the directive. This would increase costs and disadvantage London as a financial centre. Within the directive, there is scope for discretion. The industry's regulatory bodies should use it.</p>

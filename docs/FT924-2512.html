			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / S&amp;P downgrades Nationwide rating NATIONWIDE is the first building society to have its short-term debt rating lowered. Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, yesterday downgraded Nationwide's commercial paper and certificates of deposit from A1 to A2. S&amp;P said the downgrade reflected the 'impact of the continued weakness of the UK housing market on Nationwide's asset quality'. Mr Richard Lassen, Nationwide treasurer, said the society would 'probably stay away from the commercial paper market for the next few months' to avoid higher costs. He added: 'We can continue funding in the UK, principally by winding down our very high level of liquidity.' Nationwide has a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.28bn) commercial paper programme.</p>

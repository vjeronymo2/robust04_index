			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Polish central bank in row over rates The Polish government has called on the country's central bank to lower interest rates and attacked the bank's recent decision to lower the adjustable monthly devaluation rate - which devalues the zloty in order to keep exports competitive - from 1.6 per cent to 1.5 per cent. A government statement issued on Tuesday night deepens a row over how best to deal with growing foreign currency inflows which are inflating the money supply and increasing inflationary pressures. It came as senior western commercial bankers gathered in Warsaw to sign formally a deal reducing Poland's Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9bn) commercial debt by 49.5 per cent which could produce capital inflows worth more than Dollars 1bn a year. Poland's net foreign debt stood at Dollars 44bn at the end of last April. At the same time, Poland's foreign reserves have grown to around Dollars 11bn, largely because of a rise in exports to Germany. Capital inflows from cross-border trading, including hard currency from citizens of the former Soviet Union who come to Poland to purchase consumer goods, have also swelled reserves. The resulting growth in money supply has led the central bank to refuse to make the 1 per cent interest rate cut which the government is now openly demanding. 'High real interest rates are putting a brake on the country's economic development,' the government said after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. The bank says, however, that inflationary pressures leave it no room to cut rates. It also maintains that the lower rate of zloty devaluation is necessary to encourage domestic currency savings by slowing the rate of dollar appreciation. The rate of inflation for this year is expected to reach 27 per cent, or 4 percentage points more than forecast by the government in its budget for 1994. The government is also accusing the central bank of having infringed the law by not discussing the change in devaluation policy with the finance or the foreign trade ministries. The bank has denied the charge. The row is accompanied by government proposals that the central bank's supervisory functions be transferred to an advisory council appointed by politicians. This suggestion has led Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz Waltz, the central bank chief, to warn that the bank's independence is under threat. See Editorial Comment</p>

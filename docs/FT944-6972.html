			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / How to Spend It: Direct deals for phone addicts - Judith Gubbay calling . . . what service do you require? As the telephone breaks loose from the home and the office, the services you can call on it are expanding. It is 9pm on Sunday. You have just returned home after two weeks of sun-baked idleness. What is the first thing you do? If you are anything like Jane, my friend, the first thing is to open your mail. The second is to ring your bank. Jane is a worrier, and one of the envelopes she opened suggested that her finances were not as well-ordered as she thought. 'I knew I woudn't be able to sleep until I'd sorted it out, so I picked up the phone.' Jane's call was to First Direct, the pioneer among telephone banking services. Had she been feeling frivolous - or more anxious about the contents of her wardrobe - she might have rung Next Directory or Racing Green for a copy of their new catalogues. She could have called Rail-Direct, to order train tickets for her trip to Leeds at the end of the month, or checked on how her shares were doing, or booked a seat for the Tuesday night showing of The Browning Version. Ordering goods by phone is hardly new: UK consumers have been summoning pizzas and Chinese meals to their homes for years. What is new - and growing fast - is the number and range of services available that bypass the shopfront and the middleman, using special free or cheap phone numbers so that it does not matter (to you) where you are calling from. Many are open most, if not all, hours. These, coupled with increasingly sophisticated information and entertainment lines, for which you pay a premium, may transform UK shopping habits. The Henley Centre's Teleculture 2000 report shows that more than 50 per cent of people in the UK are using the phone to organise their financial affairs. Some 39 per cent use it to buy from catalogues. BT's own research suggests that travelling, parking and queuing are turning consumers from conventional shopping. First Direct customers' experiences bear out the other main attraction. 'I enjoy being able to pay my bills at odd times of the day or night - whenever it suits me,' says civil servant Steven Jones. First Direct confirms that Sunday evenings are a peak business time. Drawbacks to telephone shopping seem few; best advice, however, is always to keep a note of your transactions and orders. No directory of these services exists - so here, for the benefit of the unconverted is a selection of telephone services: FREE-TO-YOU PHONE CALLS Many companies charge nothing if you want to order a catalogue. They quote a special FreeFone number, starting with 0800 (the Mercury Freecall prefix is 0500).

PAYING A PREMIUM There are premium-rate phone information and entertainment services to suit pretty well every taste - up-to-the-minute cricket scores and racing form guides to weather information and the FT's own Cityline. Now that the 0898 numbers (and their Mercury and Vodata equivalents) have been cordoned off from all but those who want 'adult' services (you cannot get through without a personal identification number), almost all the 20,000 odd premium-rate services are confined to BT's 0891 (and its experimental 35p-a-call 0894), Mercury's 0839 (and its lower-tariff 0881), and Vodata's 0336. If you do not want your phone used to call premium-rate services, ring 150 (free), and ask for the call-barring service. Travellers' Healthline: 0839 337733. Pre-recorded information from the Hospital for Tropical Diseases; interactive service, allows you to select which parts of the message to listen to.</p>

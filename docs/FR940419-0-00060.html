			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Definition of Conflicts of Interest <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of comments concerned the definition of types of conflicts of interest. The term ``conflict of interest'' in this rule has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same definition as contained in FAR Subpart 9.5. EPA has not adopted any unique or agency specific definitions for types of conflicts of interest. EPA also has included the term ``personal conflicts of interest'' which is not defined in the FAR. For clarity, we have provided a definition of personal conflict of interest in EPAAR Clause 1552.209&hyph;73, Notification of Conflicts of Interest Regarding Personnel. A personal conflict of interest is ``a relationship of an employee, subcontractor employee, or consultant with an entity that may impair the objectivity of the employee, subcontractor employee, or consultant in performing the contract work.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Apparent Conflict of Interest <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters objected to the expansion of conflict of interest to include the term ``apparent'' and indicated that the term was too vague and was not defined in the rule. To be consistent with FAR Subpart 9.5, this term has been removed from the rule. Nevertheless, EPA strongly supports the OFPP approach on this issue and will fully comply with section 6(d) of OFPP Policy Letter 89&hyph;1, which mandates, ``Federal procurement officials shall encourage contractors to consider carefully the potential for conflicts of interest in all of their activities associated with federal procurement, and shall be sensitive to the appearance of conflicts of interest in any contracting actions.'' A comment was also received which stressed that contractors that work for both private and public parties should avoid and mitigate both actual conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts in order to protect the public interest. Accordingly, our contractors should be sensitive to the appearance of conflicts of interest in all contract actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Potential and Actual Conflicts of Interest <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters took exception to EPA's inclusion of the term ``potential'' to describe a particular type of conflict as being too vague and overly restrictive, and one commenter stated that the term ``actual conflict'' was undefined and contrary to the FAR. We disagree and are retaining the terms in the rule. The concept of potential conflicts is well established in acquisition regulations. FAR Subpart 9.5 provides examples of situations involving potential conflicts of interest and also includes the term ``actual'' conflict of interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Significant Conflict of Interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters recommended that EPA only be concerned with the reporting of significant conflicts of interest. We disagree. It is unacceptable for contractors to report only conflicts which they consider significant. All actual and potential conflicts of interest that are identified must be reported to the appropriate EPA Contracting Officer. In accordance with the process set out in FAR Section 9.504, the EPA Contracting Officer identifies and evaluates conflicts, makes a determination of whether a conflict is significant and determines if the conflict can be avoided, mitigated, or neutralized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Restriction of Contracting Officer's Decision Making Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two comments received expressed concern that the rule will infringe upon or eliminate the Contracting Officer's decision making authority on conflicts of interest. In particular, the comments stressed that it is important that Contracting Officers make decisions on a case-by-case basis and that EPA is abrogating its responsibilities by placing the full burden on contractors to disclose conflicts of interest no matter how insignificant or immaterial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this rule restricts the Contracting Officer from making decisions on conflicts of interest on a case-by-case basis. In fact, Contracting Officers are required to make decisions on a case-by-case basis in accordance with FAR subpart 9.5. The existing EPAAR requires contractor disclosure of conflicts and the rule does not change this responsibility. This disclosure requirement does not mean that the Contracting Officer will find that every reported conflict is significant or that it cannot be avoided, neutralized, or effectively mitigated, but rather allows the Contracting Officer the opportunity to carefully evaluate the facts of each case and make an informed determination that protects our programs and the public interest. Clearly, both EPA and its contractors have a continuing responsibility to identify and prevent conflicts of interest in federal procurement. However, it is not feasible or practicable for EPA to routinely search and review contractors' business records to unearth conflicts. Such action would be inappropriate and intrusive. Therefore, as a practical matter, we must require contractors to report conflicts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Once renowned  for sloppy work practices, an over-unionised workforce,  lacklustre merchandise and low productivity, Britain is today  leading a field of overweight European economies towards  recovery.    And bringing up the rear is Germany, the one-time home of  the  economic miracle. Nothing, it seems, lasts forever.    These changes are borne out by a survey of 100,000 companies  in eight European countries undertaken by the European Chambers  of Commerce. The report finds that Britain's economic recovery  paints the most optimistic picture for the future while  Germany's is one of the gloomiest.    The findings mirror THE EUROPEAN's own 1994 forecasts,  published earlier this month. Described as the largest economic  survey in the world, this new report says 1994 will be a turning  point. However, the degree of improvement will not be  sufficient to reverse the key problem of rising unemployment or  to encourage entrepreneurs to raise investment. West German  entrepreneurs are highly sceptical about future propspects with  one-third predicting that developments for their company will be  unfavourable. Recovery -- not expected until late this year  will be "a long and difficult process." As a consequence  recovery in eastern Germany is being hampered, although 35  percent of entrepreneurs count on favourable development for  their company, albeit from a low baseline.    British entrepreneurs are at the other end of the spectrum.  "The UK has experienced a steady climb out of recession since  the beginning of 1991," says the report. "The withdrawal of  sterling from the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in September  1992 improved their competitive position further."    Nearly 60 percent of UK companies expect beneficial  developments in 1994. Despite a slowing of exports, the UK  picture is now one of a gradual return to growth.    Although European recovery is largely unsynchronised,  improvements in the UK economy may augur well for other member  states. However, this premise should be treated with caution  because structural, monetary and social circumstances differ  between countries. In Ireland, changeable interest and currency  levels created serious difficulties for firms.    In Italy, devaluation of the lira in September 1992  engendered cautious optimism among exporters.    In the Netherlands, last year was perceived as a  disappointing year with prospects for this year gloomy. "In  1993, turnover fell, investment decreased and the number of jobs  fell for the first time since 1982," says the survey.    Although Greece's economic climate was poor in 1993,  companies reported an increase in turnover and investment.  Spain was also hard hit but the outlook for this year is  brighter as exports increase and business experiences a modest  recovery.    Completion of the single European market in January last  year  has not proved a landmark for companies because steps towards  greater integration had already been introduced.    The study says a strengthening market will boost the economy  in the medium term. Despite progress, many companies complain  about barriers which still exist in the areas of customs  procedure, statistical declaration and standards.</p>

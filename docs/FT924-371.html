			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Minding your own Business: Past imperfect, future tense - The plight of small companies IT HAS been a difficult year for small businesses. Although they can respond more flexibly to change than their larger counterparts, the relentless pressure on finances, management time and morale exerted by the recession has been hard to cope with. More than 46,000 businesses - most of them small - failed in the first nine months of the year, an increase of nearly 40 per cent on 1991, suggesting the total for the year will be more than 60,000. Increased failures are to be expected during a recession. Usually they are matched by a healthy number of new start-ups. But there are signs that the ability of the sector to regenerate itself has been weakened. Figures for 1992 will not be available for some time, but in 1991 the net number of companies registering for VAT (new registrations minus de-registrations) was just 3,000 compared with 55,000 the year before. This slow-down need not be a serious cause for concern provided the numbers recover in line with the economy. Britain's record in creating new businesses over the past decade has been a good one - better than that of most other developed countries. Where it has fallen down is in creating the medium-sized companies which are the strength of the German economy. Government policy-makers have accepted this argument and are adapting programmes accordingly. The nation-wide network of business advice centres known as one-stop shops - launched in July by Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary - is intended to target the established small and medium-sized business, not start-ups. The main problems facing the business owners themselves have been a lack of customer demand, the cost of borrowing, sometimes prickly relations with their bank managers, and the tardiness with which their customers settle their bills. Bank base rates have fallen during the year from 10.5 to 7 per cent but, with inflation still going down, real interest rates remain at a high level and businesses are pressing for further cuts. Small firms can expect to pay several points above bank base, anyway. Complaints about interest rates led to renewed accusations in the autumn that the banks were not passing on base rate reductions in full. These were denied, but they highlighted once again the fragility of the banks' relationship with many of their small business customers. The chief concern of small businesses has been the more restrictive attitude the banks have taken to lending. Many firms have found overdraft and loan facilities frozen or reduced. There are serious concerns that the banks will be unwilling to finance small firms' increased demands for loan finance when the upturn comes. Business organisations are equally worried about a looming shortage of equity capital. With the exception of an ambitious venture capital programme launched by Midland Bank, and the launch of a handful of local venture funds, there has been a further contraction of the venture capital industry. This was compounded by the chancellor's announcement in his March Budget of the abolition of the business expansion scheme at the end of 1993. The late payment of debts has become an even more pressing problem over the past year. There is very little pressure that small businesses can bring to bear on large customers when they delay paying their bills. The government announced in March that large companies would have to disclose in their annual reports how quickly they paid their suppliers. It also said it would insist that main contractors on government contracts paid sub-contractors within 30 days. But there is considerable scepticism about the value of these measures, although slightly more is expected from a proposed simplification of court procedures for collecting debts, announced at the same time. The government remains opposed to the introduction of an automatic right to interest on unpaid invoices. Small business complaints about 'red tape' produced a response earlier this month when the governement announced a beefed-up campaign to root out bureaucracy. An inventory of the challenges facing business revealed no fewer than 6,000 pieces of legislation and 2,500 forms affecting business. The past 12 months have been difficult enough but recovery, when it comes, could exact an even heavier toll than the downturn. If previous upturns are any guide, failure rates increase when businesses attempt to expand and their finances become overstretched. Amid the general gloom, however, there are companies which are doing well. A combination of careful management, tight financial controls and luck has allowed many businesses to swim against the economic tide. It might be little consolation to those thathave not survived, but the fact that people are now concerned about the plight of small businesses shows the extent to which their contribution to the economy has, belatedly, been recognised.</p>

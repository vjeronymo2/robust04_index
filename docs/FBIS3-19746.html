The payment of wages and salaries before the  religious festival and the repayment of part of Turkey's  internal debts yesterday have left the Treasury without funds.    The Treasury has drawn and used 122.5 trillion Turkish lira  in the form of an advance from the Central Bank. That amount  was the maximum it could draw from the Central Bank. It is now  eagerly awaiting tax revenues to pay the workers and civil  servants.    The Central Bank and the public sector banks have moved to  attract funds following the religious festival. Ziraat Bankasi  [the Agricultural Bank] has taken measures to attract funds  through high interest rates so as to meet its hard currency  needs. Emlak Bankasi [the Property Bank], Halkbank [the Popular  Bank], and Vakifbank [the Endowment Bank] have taken similar  measures.    The Treasury paid 16.5 trillion Turkish lira in wages and  salaries on 11 March by using funds from the Central Bank. It  repaid part of its debts yesterday by using the foreign currency  it has in its accounts with the Central Bank.    In a statement to SABAH, a high-ranking Treasury official  said the Treasury's accounts will be in the "red" if the  expected increase in tax revenues does not occur. Stressing  that a very large part of the foreign currency acquired from  Japan cannot be allocated for the payment of internal debts, the  official asserted: "Some $725 million has been acquired from  Japan. Of that, $225 million has been used to repay foreign  debts. The remaining amount has not been touched. It has been  added to Turkey's official reserves. But it is in the  Treasury's accounts. The Treasury must transfer that resource  to the Central Bank if the Central Bank moves to intervene in  the money markets. We have not done so. That resource belongs  to the Treasury. We have transferred a very limited amount from  it for the payments that were effected yesterday. The amount  allocated for the purpose was the maximum that could be  transferred. The remaining amount is earmarked for Turkey's  external obligations."</p>

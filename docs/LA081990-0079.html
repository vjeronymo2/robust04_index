			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECURITY COUNCIL DEMANDS IRAQ LET FOREIGNERS LEAVE  </P> <P> In an urgent late-night session held at the urging of the United States, the  United Nations Security Council on Saturday unanimously approved a resolution  demanding that Iraq permit the immediate departure of the thousands of  foreigners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.  </P> <P> The resolution, the fourth aimed at Iraq by the 15-nation body since Iraqi  troops invaded Kuwait earlier this month, also demanded that Iraq do nothing to  jeopardize the safety or health of the foreigners and that consular officials  be allowed to see them.  </P> <P> The Security Council acted on the measure after announcements by the Iraqi  government that it was detaining Westerners until the threat of war was over  and that those detained, including infants and elderly people, would be denied  food and medical supplies unless the United States and its allies lifted its  blockade and permitted such items through.  </P> <P> Iraq said that detained Westerners would be kept at key military and civilian  installations until the danger of war was over.  </P> <P> "We are dismayed and revolted by these actions," Thomas R. Pickering, the  American ambassador to the United Nations, said in remarks to the Security  Council after the 15-to-0 vote was taken. Iraq had "crossed the Rubicon" by  daring to take such steps, he added.  </P> <P> Earlier, Pickering accused Iraq of holding thousands of foreigners "hostage,"  using a term U.S. officials previously had avoided in referring to those being  detained.  </P> <P> About 2,500 Americans and 4,000 Britons are in Kuwait and more than 500  Americans and 700 Britons are in Iraq. In addition, thousands of other foreign  nationals have been barred from leaving those two countries since the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.  </P> <P> The latest resolution also reaffirmed a previous resolution declaring Iraq's  annexation of Kuwait as null and void, and it demanded that Iraq rescind its  order for the closing of embassies and consulates in Kuwait and for the  withdrawal of immunity for diplomatic personnel.  </P> <P> Also, under the resolution, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar was  asked to pursue "urgent consultations" with the Iraqi government to ensure  "full and immediate compliance" with the measure.  </P> <P> Perez de Cuellar was on a trip to Latin America but planned to send  representatives to Baghdad. They are Undersecretary General Virendra Dayal, an  Indian who heads the secretary general's executive office, and Undersecretary  General Kofi Annan, a Ghanaian who is controller in the U.N. program planning,  budget and finance office.  </P> <P> Yemen, the only Arab nation sitting on the Security Council, voted for the  resolution but urged the lifting of the embargo of foodstuffs to Iraq,  contending that this would be not only a humanitarian step but also would lead  to a reduction of tensions in the gulf region.  </P> <P> Action on the resolution came after more than four hours of closed-door  consultations involving member nations of the Security Council along with  representatives of Iraq and Kuwait.  </P></p>

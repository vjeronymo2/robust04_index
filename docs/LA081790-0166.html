			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ZIA'S SON BLAMES BHUTTO IN HIS FATHER'S DEATH;  </P> <P> PAKISTAN: IJAZ UL-HAQ CALLS FOR NEW INVESTIGATION INTO AIR CRASH TWO YEARS AGO  THAT ALSO COST U.S. ENVOY HIS LIFE.  </P> <P> Gen. Zia ul-Haq's oldest son today blamed former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto  and her government for his father's death in a mysterious plane crash two years  ago.  </P> <P> At a memorial ceremony marking the anniversary, Ijaz ul-Haq called for a new  investigation into the Aug. 17, 1988, crash that killed Zia, many of Pakistan's  top military generals and U.S. Ambassador Arnold L. Raphel.  </P> <P> An inquiry ruled the crash was sabotage, but a criminal investigation was never  conducted.  </P> <P> Ijaz spoke at a news conference as tens of thousands of Pakistanis, reeling  from 20 turbulent months of democracy, streamed to the grave of the fallen  dictator to pay tribute.  </P> <P> Mourners traveled by foot, cart and bus to the giant Faisal Mosque to offer  prayers.  </P> <P> "The previous government through criminal negligence covered up any evidence,"  charged Ijaz, who is launching his own political career. "The former prime  minister and her ministers actually ridiculed the tragedy, provided cover to  the criminals and shut the door on any investigation."  </P> <P> He said Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party was responsibile for the crash and  demanded that President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, head of the military-backed  caretaker government that replaced Bhutto on Aug. 6, and the army chief of  staff open a new investigation.  </P> <P> Bhutto, who in turn blames Zia for her father's execution in 1979, could not be  immediately reached for comment.  </P> <P> Bhutto's government was dismissed after being accused of corruption, nepotism  and ineptitude. Bhutto, whose father was overthrown by Zia in 1977, claims a  similar coup was staged against her but camouflaged by the constitution.  </P> <P> Her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was hanged in 1979 on charges of conspiring to  murder a political enemy who was never killed.  </P> <P> While in power Bhutto proclaimed her father a martyr for democracy. Ijaz says  his father was a martyr for Islam.  </P> <P> Earlier, Ijaz vowed to carry on his father's pan-Islamic dream.  </P> <P> "The dream is being fulfilled -- Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey," Ijaz  told an estimated 100,000 people who crowded onto the sprawling grounds of the  Faisal Mosque and climbed its sloping roof and towering spires for the brief,  low-key ceremony.  </P> <P> "A new movement, a new unity will start from here," he said. "I swear by the  grave of Zia ul-Haq. I will be the first to sacrifice my life."  </P> <P> Ijaz led a huge procession to the mosque from the neighboring city of  Rawalpindi, the headquarters of the army that has ruled Pakistan for more than  half of its 43-year history.  </P></p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Leeds Tec cuts training places REDUCTIONS of up to 22 per cent in the number of training places for the long-term unemployed are being made by Leeds Training and Enterprise Council, Lisa Wood writes. The cuts, at a time of rising long-term unemployment in the area, are because of government reductions in funding for Employment Training (ET), the main scheme for the long-term jobless. In 1992-93 total ET funding is being cut by Pounds 60m in real terms. Tecs have been engaged in tough negotiations with the Department of Employment over their budgets for both ET and Youth Training, the scheme for people aged 16 to 18. Leeds is one of the first Tecs to announce the results of its negotiations. Mr John Hartley, chief executive of Leeds Tec, said he had bid for 2,400 places this year and the Employment Department had made a final offer of 1,880. His Tec was concerned by both the cut in numbers and the government tying payment to the achievement of a high number of qualifications. The department said the difference between the number of places Leeds Tec wanted and the number it received was not typical of Tecs at large.</p>

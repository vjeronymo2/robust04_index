CPC committee secretaries, commissioners,  mayors from all the province's prefectures and cities, leaders  of provincial departments, county CPC committee secretaries and  county magistrates from all counties, as well as leaders of all  prefecture and city bureaus, committees, and offices concerned  attended the conference.    In his report, Sun Wensheng emphasized several points  concerning the province's economic work and reform tasks for  1994. First, he spoke about economic work during 1993 and the  current situation in the province. He said that in 1993 new  achievements had been scored in economic construction, reform  and opening to the outside world, and work in all regards. These  were manifested mostly in the following: 1) Sustained and rapid  growth of the national economy, with across-the-board growth of  the three major industries. According to preliminary estimates,  the province's GNP for the year reached 62 billion yuan, an  approximately 12 percent increase over 1992. The rural economy  saw all around increase. Gross output of grain reached 9.902  billion kilograms, up 15.4 percent from 1992 and exceeding the  all-time high. Township and town enterprise gross output value  increased by more than 70 percent. Industrial gross output value  for the year (not including industries at the village level and  below) totaled 62.6 million yuan, up 11 percent from 1992.  Tertiary industries grew very rapidly. Social commodity retail  sales were up 14 percent over 1992. 2) The "three  constructions." In the important project construction realm, as  of the end of November, cumulative investment in capital  construction in the main areas of energy, transportation,  communications, water conservancy, and raw and processed  materials production totaled 8.81 billion yuan, and investment  in technological transformation totaled 2.62 billion yuan. This  was a respective 37.3 and 34.6 percent increase over the same  period in 1992. 3) Results were achieved in macroeconomic  regulation and control, marked improvements occurring in finance  and banking and fiscal revenue procedures. Overly rapid rise in  prices was held down, and the province's fiscal revenues for the  year totaled 6.7 billion yuan, up 16 percent from 1992. 4) The  intensity of economic system reform increased, substantial  advances being made. The 14 business decision making rights were  substantially applied in most enterprises. Pilot projects for  the transportation of operating mechanisms moved ahead smoothly  in 100 large- and medium-sized enterprises, the number of  enterprises instituting internal "three systems reforms"  totaling more than 3,000. The number of share system enterprises  increased from 64 in 1992 to 260 in 1993, the amount of equity  capital totaling 3.5 billion yuan. The Fenjiu Share  Corporation's open issuance and listing of share succeeded.  Joint stock system enterprises proliferated in cities and in the  countryside throughout the province. 5) Achievements in opening  to the outside world to bring in and use foreign capital were  rather outstanding. Eight economic development zones are  operating in the province. The four province-level development  zones in Taiyuan, Datong, Changzhi, and Fenglingdu signed 220  project contracts for a total investment of 1.5 billion yuan.  The province's foreign trade exports earned a total of $634  million, up 9 percent from 1992. 6) Heartening advances were  made in linking scientific and technical education to the  economy, the enthusiasm of scientific and technical personnel  for making a contribution on the main battlefield of economic  construction finding further expression thereby. The provincial  CPC committee and government publicized the experiences of  Yangquan, Jincheng, and Luliang prefectures in linking  "agriculture and scientific education." Despite a funds  shortage, funds were appropriated for the payment of special  technical vocational allowances to highly qualified  intellectuals, and to increase the wages of middle and primary  school teachers. 7) The income of both city and countryside  residents further increased, peasant per capita net earnings  exceeding the 70 to 80 yuan increase set at the beginning of the  year. The per capita income available for living expenses of  city and town residents reached 1,680 yuan, an 18 percent  increase over 1992. Peasant per capita income was 718.33 yuan,  up 14.6 percent from 1992.    Second, in talking about economic development goals and the  work emphasis for 1994, acting provincial governor Sun said that  in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of  the Fourteenth Party Congress and the plenary session of the  provincial CPC committee, the guiding thought in the province's  economic work during 1994 is as follows: to take the building of  a socialist market economic system as the goal, to seize new  opportunities for reform and development, to blaze new trails in  the enterprise system, to expand the opening to the outside  world, to accelerate structural readjustments, to promote  technological progress, to continue the further building of the  "three foundations," to strive to improve overall economic  returns, to improve further the people's livelihood, and to  promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development  throughout the province. By way of following this guiding  thought, the provincial government has preliminarily set the  main economic development goals for 1994. The provincial CPC  committee and the provincial government believe that attainment  of these goals requires adherence to the "three principles," and  close attention to the "five tasks."    The first of the three principles is to give priority to  economic returns. Attention to economic returns is necessary to  the operation of a market economy. With reform of the taxation  and finance and banking systems, and commercialization of the  specialized banks, a large number of not well run enterprises  making poor returns are facing a grim situation in which the  banks provide no loans, the treasury provides no refunds, and  there are no tax reductions or exemptions. Unless they improve  their earnings, they are in danger of having to halt production  or close their doors. This may give rise to social problems.  Therefore, the more the market economy develops, the more the  main emphasis in economic work must be on improvement of  economic returns. The second of the three principles is making  scientific and technical progress first. With reform of the  investment system, enterprises will increasingly become main  investment entities. If they continue to follow the old road of  expansion rather than internal improvements, not only will  finding the money for construction become the greatest problem,  but existing concerns -- particularly old concerns -- will be  unable to carry out technological transformation. The most  direct and effective means to promote scientific and technical  progress is to speed up the technological transformation of  existing enterprises, applying new techniques to the creation of  new technologies for the development of new products and improve  the inherent quality of products. The third of the three  principles is balanced and coordinated development. The essence  of the development of a market economy is effective exercise of  the market's role in the allocation of resources. It cannot be  denied, however, that a market economy operates blindly in some  respects. When market signals are distorted, in particular, a  rush headlong into mass action, redundant construction, and  blind competition are most likely to occur. In Shanxi Province,  pronounced problems exist in the production, sale, and  transportation of coal. Beginning now, governments at all levels  must pay close attention to the adoption of policies to provide  guidance and needed organizational coordination measures to  ensure that output is based on sales and on transportation  capacity.    Next, acting governor Sun talked about close attention to  the  "five tasks" in building the province's economy during 1992. The  first of the five tasks is to make increase in peasants income  the main goal, making a major effort to develop the rural  economy. The main tasks in the province's rural work during 1994  are as follows: to carry out the spirit of the central  government's rural work conference, to buttress the basis  position of agriculture, to readjust the province's industrial  structure, to increase the peasants' income, and to advance  all-around development of the rural economy. Leaders at all  levels must pay close attention to agriculture, to the peasants,  and to rural problems. They must use the spirit of the central  government's rural work conference as a vehicle for unifying  thinking. Peasant enthusiasm must be rallied, protected, and  brought into play. The key issue is paying a high degree of  attention to the peasants' interests, doing all possible to  increase peasant income. Township and town enterprises must be  developed further. Attention must be given to linking the  development of township and town enterprises with the  development of three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned  enterprises, private enterprises, and cooperative share  enterprises, to linking readjustment of the rural industrial  structure and development of high yield, high returns, premium  quality agriculture, and linking improvement of the socialized  services system and the integration of trade, industry, and  agriculture. The second main task is emphasizing readjustment of  the product mix and the industrial structure to hasten  industrial development that improves economic returns.  Improvement of economic returns and the technical level must be  the goals. The future readjustment focus and development  orientation of existing enterprises must be spelled out while  simultaneously providing active support to the development of  new industries and dominant industries. Investment in fixed  assets must be prudently redirected, investment in technological  transformation increased, investment in some redundant  construction and low returns capital construction projects  curtailed, the scale of investment in some projects cut back,  and priority given to ensuring urgently needed enterprise  technological transformation. An enterprise research and  development system must be established and strengthened, more  attention given to translating research into production. High  technology industries must gradually become a new growth point  for the province's national economy. The third main task is  liberalizing policies to accelerate development of tertiary  industries. We must make sure that the state, collectives, and  individuals rise together. Specifically, we must use policy  guidance for the vigorous development of the non state-owned  component of the economy. The fourth main task is continued  close attention to the building of key projects and  infrastructure. The province's key projects and infrastructure  constitute the reserve strength for the entire province's  economic development. The tasks have been set; now they must be  carried out unflaggingly year after year. In capital  construction, energies must be focused on key points. Projects  that are inconsistent with national industrial possible, for  which market prospects are difficult to predict, and for which  no investment is available must be resolutely halted. There can  be no yielding on this issue, and positively no vacillation. The  fifth task is close attention to fiscal and price matters. A  firm hand must be taken on fiscal matters at the very beginning  of the year, tax collection and supervision improved according  to law to ensure payment of tax revenues into the treasury. At  the same time, unnecessary fiscal expenditures must be  controlled and held down. The stabilization of prices, and  holding down inflation must be given an important place in the  economy, the degree of increase in retail prices for the whole  year held within 10 percent.    Acting governor Sun also set forth requirements for reform  in  the province as follows: 1) Do a good job of dovetailing work  with reform of the national macroeconomic regulation and control  system. 2) Strive for marked progress in the six key fields that  the provincial CPC committee has set. 3) Transform functions,  actively moving ahead with reform of administrative control  organizations.    Finally, acting governor Sun emphasized that reform and  construction tasks for 1994 are very strenuous. Smooth  completion of all the 1994 tasks will require that leading  cadres at all levels diligently study, update their concepts,  rally their spirits, do solid work, improve their sense of  urgency, their sense of responsibility, and their sense of  mission, and unify and guide the people of the whole province in  their efforts.</p>

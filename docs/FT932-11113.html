			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Farm group presses G7 over Gatt AUSTRALIA is trying to organise a meeting of the Cairns Group of agricultural exporting nations to put pressure on the Group of Seven industrialised countries to complete the stalled Uruguay Round of world trade talks. Mr Peter Cook, trade minister, has called for a meeting of trade ministers from the 14-country group on the eve of the next G7 summit, expected to take place in Tokyo in July. Officials said the government believes that a formal meeting of the group would step up international pressure on the G7 nations to resolve the remaining areas of disagreement, which include liberalisation of farm trade. The group, chaired by Australia, was formed to press for the extension of Gatt rules to agricultural trade, which had been excluded in previous rounds. It has said it will not accept a Uruguay Round deal which fails to achieve reductions in farm support, border controls and tariff protection. The group, includes New Zealand, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, Fiji, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Hungary.</p>

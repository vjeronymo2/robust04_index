			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Mitrofanov: "White Terror Announced: </F> Novodvorskaya Tries on Kornilov Tunic"]    [Text] A truly historical party meeting of capital  organizations of the Russian Democratic Union was held in Moscow  during the last days off.    "We decided to deal with the Communists with our own forces,  and to switch to white terror." Valeriya Novodvorskaya, leader  of the DS [Democratic Union], agreed to comment for MOSKOVSKIY  KOMSOMOLETS on the results of the party gathering of radicals.  "To personally see to it that the newspaper ZAVTRA does not come  out, that they do not conduct their rallies, and that communist  and fascist symbols do not appear on the streets. To establish  in Moscow detachments of White Guards, which already exist in  the country--Kornilov detachments with very nice skulls on their  sleeves. The Constitution and the president have no support  other than self-defense and even attacks of the anti-Communists.  Because it is stupid to defend ourselves from them with words."    Well, then, does Valeriya intend to physically destroy the  Reds? "Well, to start with, physically as well," says Miss  Novodvorskaya. "We simply want them just to sit at home and be  afraid to come out on the street."    There are about 50 people now in the Moscow Democratic  Union,  but what kind! All those who had a "propensity for socialism or  cowardice" were discharged from the Democratic Union back in  March, according to Novodvorskaya. And now the Democratic Union  "represents a potential combat organization, only not a social  revolutionary one, but one that is completely White Guard."</p>

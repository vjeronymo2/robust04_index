			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by State President F.W. de Klerk in </F> Chatsworth, Durban--live; broadcast in progress]    [Text] [SABC announcer Lester Venter] Let's interrupt  ourselves once again because I think we can get the opinion of  yet another person. We are flying around the country, and we  are making excellent contact here. In fact I understand that we  are in touch with Jennifer Wilson, who is in Chatsworth and has  Mr. De Klerk, Mr. F.W. de Klerk, leader of the National Party  there. Jennifer is that so.    [De Klerk]...and every effort is being made. May of the  problems are caused by the late entry of the IFP [Inkatha  Freedom Party], and I am sympathetic towards the problems. I am  also concerned and critical where things haven't gone as they  should have gone, but we must seriously consider what will the  implications be if this election does not succeed. For the  country it will be bad. The mood of the people is -- they want  this election to succeed. I want it to succeed and all of us  must go out of our way to make it succeed and I would call upon  Chief Minister Buthelezi to be cooperative in that regard and to  ... to advise his people to make use of tomorrow, a full polling  day, which can stretch over 14, 16, 17 hours if necessary, to  come and vote. The opportunity is there.    [Unidentified correspondent] If other political leaders may  ask for some extension for voting dates, like, tomorrow is the  last day -- what would be your advise to them?    [De Klerk] Well we have now made tomorrow also a public  holiday to enable people who couldn't today vote -- without the  problem of having to get off from work -- to do so also  tomorrow. And I've been assured by Judge Kriegler and by others  that I consulted, inter alia, also Mr. Mandela, that that  concession, because it is a very late stage to call a public  holiday, will facilitate the position of people to vote to a  great extent, and with the extension of the hours, I think it  will be possible for everybody to vote.    [Correspondent] The other complaint from Chief Buthelezi  was that in some other KwaZulu areas, in rural areas, where he  has got strong support, the voting booths were not installed in  those areas. Are you looking forward to have some of the voting  stations -- with discussions from...[pauses] after discussing  with the IEC to you have those voting booths in that...    [De Klerk, interrupting] Well I've been supportive of it all  along. Chief Buthelezi is of course in charge of most  government buildings and semi-government buildings in  KwaZulu-Natal, and I know that he said all magistrate's courts  will be made available, and I have no problem if...if they open  up new polling booths or if they bring in more mobile polling  booths. I've received such a letter yesterday from Chief  Minister Buthelezi and I asked Minister Schutte, the Minister of  the Interior, to be as helpful as he can and to go out of his  way. We must, if we cannot have a hundred percent-perfect  election, I think we must go for having a 95-percent or a  96-percent perfect election. This is the first time ever for  many people. The fact of the matter is that at a certain stage  there was a lack of cooperation, although it was offered, it was  very cool and very reserved from within KwaZulu, with regard to  their establishment, so everything which had to be done there  was almost crisis management. It had a crash course element to  it, and when he entered the election he knew it would be like  that, because of his late entry and because of the late full  cooperation between all the instances. My attitude is, and I  think that should be the attitude of all South African leaders,  is that we must exhort our people to use their opportunity and  we must be helpful in overcoming whatever problems are remaining  with regard to the operation of the election. We must make this  election succeed.    [SABC correspondent Jennifer Wilson] Sir, in the meantime,  our TV 1 viewers have joined us live on air. Could you repeat  for us, your reaction to the Chief Minister's threat to withdraw  from the elections?    [De Klerk] I am deeply concerned about the threat. I don't  think that any political leader should at this stage of the  election make such threats. All the legal avenues will be open  afterwards to contest the election for somebody who would like  to. My attitude is a positive and a constructive one. There is  a full day left for voting, a full evening because hours,  wherever there is a need, will be extended late into the night.  A full day tomorrow, and already I have been given the  assurance that, if there are people outside waiting to vote at  7PM, the booths won't close. It will carry on even if it is  late into the night to allow everybody to vote, and what should  now be done is that all leaders should advise their followers,  should actually motivate their followers to make use of this  full day during which each and every South African has an  opportunity to bring out his or her vote.    [Wilson] We've just had a situation here where they actually  ran out of stickers. So what happens if that occurs throughout  the rest of the country?    [De Klerk] Well, the fact is that they have proof that they  are getting better because they didn't wait long for the  replacements. The stickers are here, the people are voting again  and they'll stay beyond the hours. Yes, it asks some sacrifice  of the people who are standing in long queues and I am  tremendously impressed by the way in which South Africans have  shown patience. This election is the most historic event,  maybe, in the history of South Africa. Let us not grouse and be  difficult about the dots on the I and the strokes on the T. Let  us look at the larger picture. We must make this election  succeed. That is my message to my supporters. That is my call  on all other political leaders, that they should also ask the  same of their supporters.    [Wilson] Thank you very much, Mr. President.    [De Klerk] Thank you.    [Unidentified correspondent] Is there any possibility of the  voting being extended to Friday?    [De Klerk] I think it would be very difficult to do so. If  circumstances arise that there's a great percentage of the  voters who have not been able to vote because of logistical  problems, not because they were lazy but because of logistical  problems, then one will be forced to look at it, but I think we  should rather solve it through the extension of voting hours,  and there's a full day left as I have said, and it can go on  through to midnight tomorrow evening. Let us rather finish it  now. There's a grave risk should we extend it. It has not been  planned in advance -- of that also running into serious trouble  -- and I've discussed this with Judge Kriegler, and he agreed  with me. I discussed it with Mr. Mandela and he agreed with me  that we should do our level best to avoid at all cost extension  to Friday.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, the ANC is  already predicting a sweeping victory in all nine provinces,  including the so-called marginal areas in Natal and Western Cape  and northern Cape. How do you feel about the chances in Natal  ...    [SABC announcer Lester Venter, interrupting] Yes, indeed  well  we'll leave that conversation and those interviews there with  Mr. de Klerk, leader of the National Party and we are crossing  straightaway to Nyaka Sofako who is at an ANC press conference  on the same subject.</p>

			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Guards sacked in BR dispute THOUSANDS of passengers at Manchester's Piccadilly station were delayed yesterday after an unofficial dispute over rostering led to the sacking of four guards. Some InterCity trains between Manchester, London, Brighton and Bournemouth were cancelled. Trains serving south Manchester, Cheshire and beyond were also hit as the RMT rail union and British Rail tried to solve the dispute. BR said it was running between 35 per cent and 50 per cent of services on the lines affected, but advised passengers to make alternative travel plans to avoid disruption. The dispute started when guards alleged trainee drivers were doing their jobs. BR said the four guards terminated their conditions of employment by inciting other staff to stay off work. The RMT said BR had broken a code of practice issued by Acas, the conciliation service, on disciplining staff representatives.</p>

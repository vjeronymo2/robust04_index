			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (42): New strongholds in the east - Steel / Production and consumption as a proportion of the world total is falling in the mature markets. By 2000, China could be the biggest steel producer in the world MORE THAN most industries, steel is shifting in its economic importance to the world economy, in line with the dramatic growth of the developing countries and the maturing of western economies. This is a process which can often be overlooked in a recession, which inevitably focuses attention on issues such as overcapacity in traditional western producing countries - notably in Europe. Similarly, developments such as the collapse of the communist regimes of eastern Europe, and the consequential question marks placed on its steel production, can obscure the broader global picture. Mature economies have relatively less long-term need for steel than developing or industrialising ones. Steel is a basic, mother product used for automobiles, construction, white goods, factory equipment. These are all owned in abundance in the west yet - at least in the case of consumer goods  -still aspired to by the majority of the population in countries such as India and China. Technological change also tends to create product substitution, with plastics, aluminium, or newer composite materials making inroads into traditional steel markets. Again, this trend is more prevalent in developed economies. Because of these factors, growth in steel consumption lags behind overall economic growth in developed countries. It has been estimated that gross domestic product in the European Community needs to rise by 1.5 per cent a year simply to keep steel consumption - about 105m tonnes last year - static. Figures from the International Iron and Steel Institute bear out the changing patterns of steel production, which match the surging economic growth rates achieved recently by developing countries. In 1950, the western world accounted for 153m tonnes of total world production of 190m tons. In 1992, the west accounted for 488m tonnes out of the 721m tonnes total. Among main steel producing nations, China is already in third place at 80m tonnes of crude steel last year, and in 1993 is likely to overtake the US, which produced 84.3m tonnes last year. By the end of the century, China could be the biggest steel producer in the world, eclipsing Japan which had output of 98.1m tonnes last year. As for consumption of steel, developing countries accounted for 15.1 per cent of the world total in 1982, and 20.4 per cent last year. The share of China and North Korea, which are treated by the IISI as centrally-planned economies rather than developing countries, rose from 6.9 per cent to 11.7 per cent over the same period. The rise in consumption in developing countries has led to big increases in employment in the steel industry, partly because productivity has failed to keep pace with demand and old-fashioned production methods are still used. In India, for example, the two dominant companies, state-owned Steel Authority of India (Sail) and Tata Iron and Steel (Tisco) increased total employment from 197,000 in 1974 to 294,000 last year, according to IISI statistics. In western Europe and the US, by contrast, the need for capacity cuts to reflect steel's relatively declining importance has been accompanied by heavy investment in modern production techniques and the complete disappearance of inefficient open-hearth production. As a consequence, employment in the ten biggest steel producers in the European Community has fallen from 887,000 in 1974 to 352,000 last year. Over the same period, employment in the US has fallen from 521,000 to 190,000, and in Japan from 459,000 to 304,000. Forecasts by US-based WEFA Group for world steel production over the five years from 1992 bear out all these trends. It predicts that total world steel production will rise from 714.2m tonnes last year to 763.9m in 1997. EC production is seen hovering between 126m and 135m tonnes a year, and North American production is predicted to range between 101m and 105m tonnes annually. But production in Latin America is predicted to grow from 43m tonnes this year to 54m by 1997, while output in developing Asia (mainly South Korea and India) is forecast to rise from 70m tons to 81m tons over the same period. Chinese production, WEFA predicts, will rise from 85m tons of crude steel this year to 95m tons in 1997. This seems a reasonable target even with the attempts by the Chinese government to cool down the country's sharply rising economic growth. The growth in the Chinese market has had a ripple effect in Europe. In the first half of this year, as European producers and the European Commission grappled with planned capacity cuts and the thorny issue of state subsidies, output reductions followed by buoyant demand from China for long products helping to keep prices firm. Apart from China, one of the most interesting steel markets over the next decade could be India. A recent report by Lehman Brothers noted that Indian GDP could grow by an average 5 per cent a year over the next 10 years, which could double steel consumption from its current level of 16m tonnes a year. India is currently the world's 10th largest steel producer - or ninth if Russian and Ukrainian output is combined. But the report says India could easily be higher up the list by the early years of the next century as rapidly growing production overtakes static or declining output in industrialised countries.</p>

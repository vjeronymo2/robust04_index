			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr -- Vitaliy Churkin, Russian  Federation president's special envoy, again met Serb President  Slobodan Milosevic today. They discussed the situation in  Bosnia and Russia's new proposals on overcoming the current  Bosnian crisis caused by NATO airstrikes against Bosnian  positions near Gorazde.    In a brief statement to the press after the meeting, the  Russian deputy foreign minister refrained from revealing the  content of these proposals. They relate to halting hostilities  and restoring normal life in Bosnia, which is a prerequisite for  a political solution to the Bosnian crisis, he said.    As an ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from well-informed  sources, a joint meeting of the Serb president, Bosnian Serb  leadership, and the Russian Federation president's special envoy  can be expected in the near future to discuss Russia's new  proposals and determine the Serb side's relevant position.</p>

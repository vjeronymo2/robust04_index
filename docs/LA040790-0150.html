			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCOUTING A NEW IMAGE;  </P> <P> MOVEMENT LOOKS TO DEMOGRAPHICS, SOCIAL RELEVANCE  </P> <P> Dressed in their classic khaki and green, standing in a solemn line between the  Stars and Stripes and their unit banner, the 17 boys of Troop 239 recited the  words that are as main-street America as a Norman Rockwell painting.  </P> <P> Duty to God and country. To help others. To be physically strong, mentally  awake, morally straight.  </P> <P> The rest of their weekly night meeting at Wilshire Presbyterian Church hall in  Santa Ana was spent working on their next merit badges, planning the next  campout, and being taught the principles of exemplary character, citizenship  and fitness.  </P> <P> This was, of course, yet another gathering of the Boy Scouts, one of the most  enduring of world institutions, whose alumni in America since 1910 have  numbered well into the tens of millions.  </P> <P> And Troop 239's leader, Paul Rodriguez, views his Santa Ana unit as no  different from all the others. "We believe in the Scouting principles. We go by  the book here," the 42-year-old scoutmaster, a one-time Boy Scout, said.  </P> <P> Then Rodriguez, whose sons, Ruben, 16, and Anthony, 11, are in the troop,  added: "It isn't just having fun and being part of a group. Scouting gives you  great goals and guidelines. It stays with you all your life."  </P> <P> Yet there is a shadow on this picture-perfect traditional image. It has to do  with a bit of demographic reality for the Boy Scout movement in Orange County.  </P> <P> And the fact that Troop 239 is one of only six troops in Orange County's  predominately Latino areas -- a very small number in the face of current  statistics.  </P> <P> For the county's Latino population, which has grown dramatically in the past  decade, is now about 440,000, or 19% of the county's overall population. And in  the Santa Ana Unified School District alone, the trend is even more impressive:  more than 80% of the district's 33,000-student enrollment is now Latino.  </P> <P> But the Orange County Council of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) says that only  1,200 -- or fewer than 3% of its overall 48,800 members -- are from  predominately Latino areas.  </P> <P> Thus, while the Orange County Council has reported steady membership gains  throughout the 1980s and is the ninth largest council in the BSA network, this  growth is still chiefly in white areas, not among Latinos and other ethnic  minorities.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the Latino trend isn't the only fast-changing demographic that  concerns the Orange County Council, which prides itself on attempting to be a  true cross-section of economic and ethnic groups.  </P> <P> Although the county's Vietnamese population is estimated at around 120,000,  there are only about 145 members in Scout units serving predominately  Vietnamese areas.  </P> <P> These lags have led to the launching this year of new campaigns to recruit  Latino and Vietnamese youths and adult volunteers. Each of the two newly  created, countywide "districts" -- the first of their kind for the Orange  County Council -- offers greater access to staff aides, funds and other support  provided by the council itself.  </P> <P> "This county's demographic landscape is changing so fast, especially in the  Hispanic and Asian communities," said A. Buford Hill Jr., the Orange County  Council's top executive since 1977. "We have to meet that challenge. We have to  make that a part of our Scouting mission. We have to be able to confront social  changes."  </P> <P> Social relevance, or the presumed lack of it, has always been an issue for the  Boy Scout movement.  </P> <P> To many during Vietnam-era protests of the 1960s and early 1970s, the Boy  Scouts seemed woefully out of step with the times. Nationally, BSA membership,  which had peaked at 4.8 million in 1971, plummeted to 3.1 million by 1979.  </P> <P> Even in Orange County, traditionally one of the BSA's biggest strongholds, the  membership plunged from 42,000 in 1973 to 26,000 in 1977.  </P> <P> "Institutions like ours, which championed the traditional values, took the  brunt of criticism," Hill recalled. "Mind you, no one questioned the  worthwhile-ness of our work, the positive qualities. But they kept saying we  were too goody-goody, too old-fashioned."  </P> <P> But in the 1980s, as the BSA worked to update its image and be more competitive  in the leisure-activity field, nationwide membership again climbed, reaching  4.3 million last year. And last December, the Orange County Council reported a  year-end membership of 48,800, a record high for the county.  </P> <P> In Orange County, Cub Scouts (ages 7 to 10) are the largest group with 43% of  the membership, while Boy Scout troops (ages 11 to 17) totaled 22%. Explorers,  the career and sports-oriented program for the 14-to-20 age bracket that also  includes girls as members, totals 35%. The most typical sponsors of Scouting  units are still churches, schools, parent groups, service clubs and businesses.  </P> <P> This membership resurgence has helped prod the Orange County Council to embark  this year on a $11-million capital improvements campaign, the biggest yet,  headed by developer William Lyon, the council's past board chairman.  </P> <P> One reason for Scouting's comeback, Hill argued, is quite simple. "The pendulum  has swung back to the old values, the ones that have always been the  foundation, the essentials of Scouting. Organizations like ours are back in  favor," he said.  </P> <P> George Argyros, the Orange County Council's current board chairman, put it this  way: "Our goal of building future leaders hasn't changed. But we have to be  even more aggressive in our outreach. We have to appeal even more to all  segments of the community."  </P> <P> In order to help remain in favor in the 1990s, the BSA movement is not above  marketing its revamped image with greater-than-ever zeal.  </P> <P> For example, the BSA is promoting a tougher, "contemporary cool" and "high  adventure" aura for Scouting. In the works is a BSA-produced commercial for  prime-time television that features MTV-styled music and visions of Scouts  riding the rapids, engaging in cross-country skiing and in other trendy outdoor  exploits.  </P> <P> The changing times are also reflected in more controversial arenas of  image-changing. Two years ago, the BSA lifted its last gender ban: Women are  now allowed to become troop scoutmasters or assistant scoutmasters. About 20  women now hold those posts in Orange County Scout troops.  </P> <P> (However, the ban against homosexuals as adult volunteers still stands. "They  are not considered proper role models," said BSA national spokeswoman Susan  Teplinsky.)  </P> <P> Most of all, the BSA likes to emphasize its latest versions of  good-deedsmanship on a massive scale, such as its newest nationwide drives to  assist the needy. For instance, in February, in the Orange County Council's  second annual Scouting for Food drive, more than 15,000 youths collected a  million cans of food -- the largest such drive in the county -- for  distribution to 217 agencies serving the hungry and homeless.  </P> <P> But no effort in social activism has been more touted by the BSA than its  expanded "community awareness" campaigns on substance abuse and child abuse.  </P> <P> The BSA has issued newly detailed materials -- included in the 1990 Boy Scout  Handbook itself -- for family and Scout-unit discussions on how to deal with  drug and alcohol use and with molestation and other child abuse.  </P> <P> The latest handbook, the first revised edition in 11 years, also provides  information on how children can recognize, resist and report potential or  actual molestation situations. There is an expanded section on "sexual  responsibility," including a discussion of the consequences of premarital sex.  </P> <P> "Such an awareness program can't help but be extremely supportive to what is  already being done by the schools, law-enforcement agencies and other  organizations," said Dawn Ahart, past chairwoman of the Orange County Substance  Abuse Prevention Network, a coordinating body for public and private agencies.  </P> <P> "After all, there isn't any organization that reaches families more directly  than the Scouts," added Ahart, who is also a board member of the National  Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence/Orange County. "This program provides  one more significant and trusted source of information to which families can  turn."  </P> <P> The BSA's anti-substance abuse campaign has resulted in direct-action projects  by some individual units. Consider the Safe-Rides Program run by Explorer posts  based at 20 Orange County high schools.  </P> <P> The Explorer teams, who respond to calls from the Safe-Rides hot line, are on  duty from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. each Friday and Saturday. They drive home students  who have been drinking or who don't want to ride home with a friend who has  been drinking. One post, the Los Alamitos High group, has provided about 100  such rides in the past 1 1/2 years, including 15 last New Year's Eve.  </P> <P> The ethnic-minority recruitment drives are the very latest Orange County  Council effort at keeping up with the times.  </P> <P> A countywide Scouting district, coordinated more directly by the council staff  and devoted to a specific group, is not new. Such a district was formed in  1982, bringing together the various units for the physically and mentally  handicapped. Most of the 1,600 members, which include mentally disabled persons  in their 40s, are based at public and private schools and institutions for the  handicapped.  </P> <P> The Vietnamese district was established in January. Its chairman, Dr. Huyen  Tran, has been in Scouting for years -- in the early 1970s, he was general  secretary of the 13,000-member Boy Scouts association in South Vietnam.  </P> <P> But when attempts were made to form Scouting units in Orange County in the  1980s for recently arrived Vietnamese refugees, the results were  disappointingly sporadic, Tran said.  </P> <P> "The problems of resettlement, such as language, jobs and a new culture, were  very difficult and certainly had an impact on (Scouting) here," Tran said. In  1982, the membership in all-Vietnamese units totaled 400. Today it is only 145,  spread among six Explorer posts, five Scout troops and one Cub pack.  </P> <P> But Tran and other Vietnamese organizers argued that the chief problem is one  common to all Scouting units, regardless of ethnic or cultural backgrounds.  </P> <P> "Everyone is so busy with other obligations and activities. So we have to  convince them that devoting their time to our programs is vital to them. We  have to get the word out but more aggressively," said De T. Nguyen, staff  coordinator for the Orange County Council.  </P> <P> Another community organizer, Phu V. Nguyen, an alumnus of the all-Vietnamese  Explorer Post 279, said the program helps refugees to assimilate. "It gives us  more understanding of (American) culture and how it works," said the  29-year-old engineer. "It builds a bridge for us into the system."  </P> <P> These same organizing themes are sounded for the Latino district, now being  formed by a community advisory committee headed by County Supervisor Gaddi H.  Vasquez and backed by key Latino organizations.  </P> <P> The Latino district has a financial head start: it is underwritten by a  $100,000 grant from the James Irvine Foundation. Also, membership in  predominately Latino areas has grown in the past two years from 800 to 1,200,  staff coordinator Ralph Parker said.  </P> <P> But only half of the 1,200 youths are in regular units -- the new district  includes 35 Cub packs and six Scout troops. The other youths are in public  school programs in which one class a week is devoted to the Scouting program.  </P> <P> Another 700 boys are part of a Scouting-organized soccer group. Although this  program is not tied to any traditional Scouting organization, it does offer  occasional camping treks and seeks to recruit boys for the regular units.  </P> <P> "These special projects have been very effective because we're reaching many  boys who would not otherwise be reached in the traditional (Scouting unit)  way," Parker said. One factor, he added, may be that Scouting in Mexico is seen  as a pastime limited to affluent families.  </P> <P> While Scouting is not viewed as a program directly aimed at combating the  problems of gangs, backers say the positive impacts are obvious.  </P> <P> "Scouting has always taught you self-esteem, the value of team work. It is  crucial that we reach kids at the earlier ages and provide them with the kind  of positive images and role models that you get in Scouting," said Bob Miranda,  a member of the Latino district advisory committee.  </P> <P> "Sure, we hope that we can win over kids who might be attracted to drugs and  gangs," said Miranda, himself a former Scout. "We see Scouting as a real great  alternative."  </P> <P> To Scouting veterans like Troop 239 scoutmaster Paul Rodriguez, the prospects  for growth in the Latino areas are more encouraging than ever.  </P> <P> "More parents are beginning to come out to our meetings. More boys are getting  interested in us by word of mouth," said Rodriguez, whose own troop, which had  dwindled to only a few members a few years ago is now thriving.  </P> <P> "We're seeing (Scouting) grow in our community." he said. "OK, it's not very  fast. But we're here. We have never given up."  </P></p>

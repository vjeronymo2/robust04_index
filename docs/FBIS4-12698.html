			<p>BFN     [Text] In a statement to the magazine AL-AMN [Security] on  security in Lebanon and Israel's role in the recent crimes  committed because of its failure to make the peace talks  succeed, Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij has blamed Israel for  the stumbling of the Middle East peace talks. He noted that  given Israel's social and political structure and the aggressive  and expansionist theory dominating its institutions, Israel  finds it difficult to continue the peace process and ensure the  conditions and concessions necessary for its success. He said  that Israel's failure to instigate a civil war among the  Palestinians prompted it to commit the crime of the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque and then to attempt to disturb security and foment  sedition in Lebanon, particularly with the horrific crime in the  Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il. He pointed out that  there is a clear link between the two crimes at the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque and Sayyidat al-Najat Church, with the aim of avoiding  peace.    On the goal behind the recent security incidents, Mirhij  said  the perpetrators sought to harm the economic and social  situation in Lebanon and to play on sensitivities to aggravate  the situation and foil the formula that the Lebanese people  agreed upon in al-Ta'if.    Asked about explosives being placed in Ghidras and the  Lebanese Army surrounding the area, Mirhij attributed the  security and political focus on the Kasrawan area to the bombing  of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church and the French cultural center,  which took place in that area.</p>

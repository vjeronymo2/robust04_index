			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Presidential Council of the Democratic  Republic of Yemen has issued a call to the sons of the Yemeni  people, in which it pointed out that there was irrefutable  evidence that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is the one who is issuing  orders to his forces to carry out barbarous acts in peaceful  towns and villages. [passage omitted]    The call confirmed that Aden and every inch of the territory  of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which he imagined in his  sick dreams he would control, were beyond him. The call said  that it was time to get rid of this bloody regime, whose hands  had been smeared by blood since he took control of the northern  governorates. It appealed to the sons of our Yemeni people to  assume their patriotic duties to destroy this malignant microbe,  which had corrupted many aspects of life in all parts of the  coutnry.    The call confirmed that the Sanaa regime was approaching its  end and was facing its last hours. It called on citizens to cut  off supplies to its forces, because they had become tired and  exhausted, and because the regime had failed to achieve its  promises to them that they would be in Aden within two days.</p>

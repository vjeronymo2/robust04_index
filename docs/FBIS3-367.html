			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There was no plenary meeting at the Lusaka peace  talks yesterday, but important steps were nevertheless taken to  restore peace in this country. The Voice of Resistance of the  Black Cockerel has learned that the mediators have presented a  new general document to the negotiating parties, who responded  to it yesterday. It is not known yet how the two sides responded  to that document because the official mediator continues to  demand secrecy.    Meanwhile, Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim, National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] information secretary,  told Radio France Internationale yesterday that talks were on  the right track and progress was being made.    [Begin recording] [Valentim] The talks are going very well  indeed. In practical terms, we have reached consensus  concerning more than 50 percent of all the issues that have been  raised. I would like to [words indistinct] the sides have  agreed that there should be a major campaign after an accord has  been signed to promote a spirit of tolerance and trust that  would allow its implementation. We have also reached an  understanding concerning a very important role by a free press  that would serve the whole nation. Obviously, decentralization  is a very important point. We have not reached complete  agreement on that score yet, but we have covered more than three  quarters of the ground needed to achieve that goal.    As for the issue of participation by UNITA deputies in the  National Assembly, or Parliament, it is true that there is an  understanding but, unfortunately, that issue has run into some  difficulties because we are of the opinion that there must be no  interference in the choice of UNITA deputies to take up seats in  Parliament. It will be up to the UNITA leadership to choose the  deputies who will be in Parliament, those who will be in  government -- at whatever level -- and those who will be working  in other areas.    [Unidentified correspondent] What about the government posts  that UNITA has been demanding?    [Valentim] The talks are continuing but we have reached an  agreement that that matter should be discussed (?on the ground).  [end recording]</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Belgian unions refuse to talk BELGIUM'S Socialist trade unions yesterday refused to negotiate with employers and the government on measures aimed at cutting labour costs, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.

Belgium's other large union bloc, the confederation of Christian unions, said it would continue to negotiate.</p>

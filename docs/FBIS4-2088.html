			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of  China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met  with visiting Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki and his party  here this afternoon.    Their conversation mainly focused on the growth of  relationship between China and Eritrea.    Noting that the peoples of the two countries have  traditionally enjoyed friendship, Qiao said that since they  established diplomatic ties one year ago, their contacts have  increased and areas for cooperation have gradually broadened.    The NPC intends to establish ties with the national assembly  of Eritrea so as to promote exchanges and cooperation between  the two parliaments, he said.    Isayas said Eritrea has always worked hard for the  enhancement of its friendly relations with China, adding that  Eritrea's independence has laid a solid foundation for  furthering such a relationship.    He noted that since the two countries established diplomatic  ties, bilateral ties have grown rapidly, which, he said,  conforms to the fundamental interests of the two countries.    Qiao said he admired the unremitting efforts that the  Eritrean Government and people have made in healing the wounds  of war and rebuilding the country's economy under extremely  difficult conditions.    He said the key to avoiding a road of twists and turns for a  newly independent country depends on whether it will strictly  act in accordance with its national conditions.    Qiao said he was sure that under the leadership of President  Isayas, the diligent and wise Eritrean people will achieve  success in exploring a new way for development suitable to its  national conditions.    Isayas said he agreed with Qiao's view on learning from  other  countries' experiences and not copying from others.    He said that Eritrea and China may differ in national  conditions. However, he added, there are many useful things that  Eritrea can learn from China. China's assistance to Eritrea is  particularly playing an important role in the latter's  reconstruction.    Tan Qinglian, chairman of the Chinese Government reception  committee and vice-minister of construction, participated in the  meeting.</p>

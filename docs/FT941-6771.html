			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets FRANKFURT The Bundesbank is unlikely to add to last week's uncertainty by opting for a variable rate at Wednesday's repo operation, says NatWest Securities. With the IG Metall ballot in Lower Saxony likely to show strong support for a strike, the bond market is likely to be most reassured by a fixed rate repo 10 - 20 basis points below the current 6 per cent. This would be enough to show that European rates are still free to move downwards, but not so much as to arouse fears that the Bundesbank, whose council meets on Thursday, is losing its grip. AMSTERDAM The results season gets under way in earnest this week. Polygram reports today with UBS expecting a 20.3 per cent increase in net profits on 10.5 per cent higher sales. Bols Wessanen is forecast to report a 5 per cent rise in net profits on Wednesday and Philips is seen posting a Fl 805m net profit on Thursday, after 1992's Fl 900m loss. ZURICH Credit Suisse and Swiss Volksbank present full-year consolidated results together for the first time on Friday. The figures will represent about 70 per cent of the total CS Holding result. PARIS Chargeurs, the textile and communications group, which has undergone a major restructuring during the last year, is expected to post a net loss of FFr200 on Thursday, down from a profit of FFr366m in 1992. MILAN The privatisation of Banca Commerciale Italiana begins today and is scheduled to conclude on Friday. The offer could, however, close early if, as was the case in the recent IMI sell-off, it is heavily oversubscribed. TOKYO Domestic investors will continue to take a cautious stance as companies take profits on their investment portfolios before the March-end book-closing. Although some economists expect tomorrow's tankan, the Bank of Japan's quarterly report on business sentiment, to indicate a bottoming out of the economy, domestic institutions, unlike overseas investors, are unlikely to accumulate positions ahead of the fiscal year-end.</p>

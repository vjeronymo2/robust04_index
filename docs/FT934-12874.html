			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Tokyo nears rice decision JAPAN is close to a decision on whether to lift its controversial ban on rice imports, a government spokesman said at the weekend. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said Japan needed to make a decision to open its rice markets soon, to avoid isolation at the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks. 'Discussions between Europe and the US are making headway, and we cannot resist (tarification) much longer,' he said. Mr Takemura's comments follow last week's three-day visit by Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt. Mr Takemura said Mr Sutherland had responded positively to a plan that Japan accept tarification of rice imports after a six-year grace period. His statements reflect the government's efforts to build public consensus over the rice issue. Until now Tokyo has repeated its protests against the opening of the market, and has avoided any suggestion that the import ban be lifted. However, earlier this month reports that Japan was offering a compromise plan were leaked to the press. The offer included a six-year moratorium period for tarification on rice imports, during which it would import 3 to 5 per cent of its domestic rice needs. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, faces the arduous task of convincing other members of the coalition government who oppose rice imports. The Socialist party, which depends heavily on rural votes, has threatened to leave the coalition if the government were to open the market. Meanwhile, Japan's farm co-operatives are planning to stage as many as 14 rallies throughout the country next month on the issue.</p>

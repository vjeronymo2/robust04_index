			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Caracus Stock market THE CARACAS stock market closed yesterday with only 'a slight decline' from the previous day, according to Mr Mario D'Alfonso, at the brokers Rafael Alcantara, writes Joe Mann. On Thursday, when the market reopened after Tuesday's unsuccessful military uprising, 22 stocks fell, four were stable and one (Banco Caracas) gained. Yesterday, small investors first pushed down share prices sharply, but most had recovered by the close, Mr D'Alfonso said. However, foreign investors had additional worries. On the Caracas foreign exchange market, the Venezuelan bolivar took a beating, falling almost 3 per cent against the US dollar on Thursday.</p>

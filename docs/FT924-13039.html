			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Leading Article: In the slough of despond A PALL OF gloom has descended over Britain. The recession is deepening as the latest wave of redundancies confirm, and market forces show no mercy, as the humbling of the coal industry makes clear. But the government has proved unable to offer the leadership that the crisis demands. Simply blaming a lack of political leadership for the continued downward slide is too simplistic. The roots of the current crisis lie deep in the past - in the failure of Britain's industrial and education establishments to remain competitive since the second world war, the inflationary errors of the 1970s, the depth of the last recession and in the policy errors of the Lawson years. Nor is the UK the only country that is enduring a painfully long recessions as penance for the excess of the 1980s, as Mr Alan Greenspan of the US Federal Reserve said in Japan earlier this week. It will take years for consumers, banks and companies in the US, Australia, the Scandinavian countries and Japan to shake off the bad debts that they accumulated during the fat years following the 1982 recession. The non-inflationary route to balance-sheet health is the virtuous way to work off these debts, but one which causes maximum pain. Relatively debt-free Continental Europe is not faring much better. The combination of Germany's fiscal policy errors, its impending recession, and the efficiency with which the exchange rate mechanism is spreading the burden of Germany's economic woes across the rest of the Continent, make the next year look bleak for the non-English speaking world as well. As a result, the OECD now expects growth in the organisation's 24 member states to be only 2.1 per cent in 1993, compared with the 3 per cent it was forecasting for next year in June. Yet it is not true that the world is to blame for the UK's current economic plight, however much the government wants the country to believe that is the case. Explosive cocktail The UK recession has been deeper and longer than anywhere else in the developed world, in part because the expansion of the late 1980s was stronger and the imbalances in the economy were greater than elsewhere. With hindsight, sterling stayed too long at too high a rate within the ERM, the result being an explosive cocktail of high European real interest rates with an extremely demanding exchange rate and an Anglo-Saxon debt problem. Past errors of judgment were widely made outside the UK Treasury. But the monetary easing that has occurred since Black Wednesday - the 10.8 per cent decline in the trade-weighted exchange rate and the 1 percentage point reduction in base rates before yesterday's cut - have been more than offset by the slump in both business and consumer confidence of the past few weeks. For that slump, the government's failure to articulate a credible new policy framework must bear a part of the blame. Manufacturing output declined last month, while job vacancies fell by 11 per cent in September, both figures suggesting there is more pain to come. Striking failure Nowhere has the failure of government to explain its actions been more stark than in the handling of the closure of much of what remains of the mining industry. The closure of these pits was probably inevitable on economic grounds. Whether it was necessary now, at the bottom of a recession and while the rest of the government's energy policy remains murky, is more open to question. In any event, the outcome has been a surge of public feeling on a scale which the government failed to foresee. Equally striking is the failure to define a new economic policy outside the ERM. The prime minister has made no proper attempt to explain the errors of judgment which undoubtedly occurred in the run-up to Black Wednesday. Nor has the chancellor been able adequately to explain the government's economic policy. His declared strategy amounts to little more than 'trust me to do what I think is best for you'. That is why yesterday's interest rate cut, however welcome to borrowers and even justifiable in itself, seems like a tit-bit to pacify disgruntled backbenchers. The markets know that economic policy with a floating pound and fragile confidence demands keen judgment rather than fixed policy rules. The government must balance any fall in real interest rates with credible fiscal tightening in the longer term. Monetary policy needs also to be managed by an institution protected against short-term political pressures, and credible to business and labour. An approach on these lines is required in order to re-establish confidence in British economic management and ensure that sterling does not fall too far too fast on the foreign exchanges. A sharp easing of monetary policy, endorsed by a panicked government, will send all the wrong signals. Until the government defines its strategy, everything it does, right or wrong, will still be suspect.</p>

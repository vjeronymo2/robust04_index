			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERATION RESCUE  </P> <P> Re: "Anti-Abortion Protesters Get Terms Up to 215 Days," (Metro, July 17)  </P> <P> Can anyone seriously doubt that we are witnessing judicial tyranny? Who in his  right mind would not be aghast at a seven-month jail term for misdemeanor  trespassing?  </P> <P> It seems the only minority that can be persecuted with impunity are vocal  Christians.  </P> <P> In recent months, jail terms for first- offense trespassers have become common.  This is a violation of both justice and common sense.  </P> <P> The fact that there isn't a national uproar over the unjust and tyrannical  oppression of these conscientious people tells me that as a nation we don't  want to face the reality of abortion.  </P> <P> Those who call our attention to this national disgrace deserve the same respect  and legal protection that the civil rights protesters gained in the '60s.  </P> <P> PETER WARNER  </P> <P> Gardena  </P></p>

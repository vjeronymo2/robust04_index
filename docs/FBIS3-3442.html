			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Nan: "Ford To Fully Participate in China's Auto </F> Industry"]    [Text] Dearborn, Michigan, March 18 (XINHUA) -- Ford Motor  Company, expecting to announce its first joint venture in China  as early as next month, is fully prepared to tap the Asian  country's vast vehicle market.    The Ford-China joint venture, which has been under  consideration for nearly two years, was expected to be announced  "in next couple of months or even sooner than that," James  Paulsen, president of the Ford China operations, said in an  interview with XINHUA here today.    "We are optimistic that we can put together a good program  and meets the needs of the Chinese people and Chinese business,"  Paulsen said. "We will get the approval we would like to see."    Paulsen became the president of the newly established Ford  China operations on March 1. With some 60 people involved in  China businesses in the Ford's world headquarters here, Paulsen  described the principle task of his unit as "to provide one  voice for Ford and a single point of contact" with China, with  the top priority of exploring manufacturing joint venture for  vehicles.    He said that since the Chinese government is still in the  process of rationalizing and harmonizing China's auto industry,  Ford is prepared to fully participate in China's efforts of  industrial consolidation.    Paulsen noted that in China, whose economic growth is the  fastest in the world, vehicles presently may not be affordable  to average individuals.    "There certainly is a great institutional need for more  vehicles," he said, adding that when the individual market for  cars develops in the future, "we will be there."    "With the volume and expected growth (in China's car sales),  there is much more potential than what is already in place  there," the president of Ford's China operations said.    According to Paulsen, the sales of passenger cars in China  is  expected to increase from the present 200,000 units a year to  1.8 million by the year 2000. The Chinese market for the car,  which carries seven to eight passengers with enough space for  luggage, will witness "very very high growth rate," he said.    China's vehicle market is as large as one million units a  year, with 80 percent of domestic production and 20 percent of  imports. Annual sales of vehicles will reach two million by the  year 2000, China said.    Paulsen noted that a great deal of feasibility studies were  still going on in Ford as to produce what kind of vehicles in  China. Besides multipurpose vehicles, ford is reportedly showing  interest in the market of cargo trucks in China.    "We need to look at the market demand and understand what  the  demand is," Paulsen stressed.    Ford sold over 3,000 and 6,200 vehicles in China in 1992 and  1993 respectively, including the Tempo, Taurus, Crown Victoria,  Aerostar and Lincoln town car, mostly coming from government  purchase. Ford is reportedly targeting China's private sectors  for car sales of as many as 4,000 units this year.    As early as in 1987, when Henry Ford II became one of the  first U.S. businessmen to visit the people's republic, the  company showed interests in the development of the automotive  industry in China.    Its 750 F-series trucks sold in China in the middle of 1979  were the first of its kind coming from the U.S. since 1949, the  piece of history that Ford today still proudly recalls.    Despite its time and energy in negotiating a joint venture  in  China, Ford, the fourth largest manufacturer in the world, is  still behind the General Motors Company and Chrysler Corp. in  locating vehicle assembly lines in China.    "Our products are the best in terms of quality and value.  They are well-styled, well-designed to represent the very high  value for dollar and yuan," which is the Chinese currency,  Paulsen said.    He said, "our objective would be to participate fully in the  (Chinese) market, eventually have a full line of vehicles that  would meet the various market needs in China. It takes time."    Paulsen, who will be in Washington next week, said, in  particular, that ford hopes that the Clinton administration  would support Ford's on-going efforts in China.    On the Most Favored Nation trade status (MFN) for China,  Paulsen stressed that "if MFN is not extended, it will be more  difficult for us," calling it "disruptive" which might force  Ford to change its China strategy.    "As a businessman, I would hope that the MFN is extended. I  believe that business prospering in China should help the  Chinese people to raise economy and I think that would also help  the social situation," he said.    Ford's operation in China is now mainly in the form of  component manufacturing, technology licensing and joint  scientific and technology research. It has dealers in 10 major  Chinese cities plus some service facilities.    Paulsen, 55, described his first two weeks in office as  "very  very busy." he will visit China for three weeks in April to  announce the finalists for Ford-China Joint Research Fund, with  Ford contributing 800,000 U.S. dollars.</p>

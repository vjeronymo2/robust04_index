			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (b) proposes that the impact of mining activities be directed away from the Wilderness Lands and Wild and Scenic Rivers to the extent practicable. This would enable the impacts of developmental drilling operations and the construction of access routes, among other things, to be concentrated on lands which may be better suited to such uses or which may not possess the number or degree of resource values exhibited on Wilderness Lands or Wild and Scenic Rivers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (c) and (d) concern the extraction and use of mineral materials in the HCNRA. Mineral materials include, but are not limited to, common varieties of sand, gravel, and stone and are governed by the Mineral Materials Act of 1947, 30 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , rather than the mining and mineral leasing laws. As a result, activities related to mineral materials are not subject to the withdrawal of federal lands from the operation of the mining and mineral leasing laws in Section 11 of the Act. These standards, in addition to the applicable provisions of Subpart C of 36 CFR part 228, specify the circumstances under which exploration, extraction and use of common variety mineral materials may occur in the HCNRA. Paragraph (c) would provide that mineral materials may only be used in the HCNRA for the purpose of constructing or maintaining facilities such as roads, existing airfields, trails and other recreation developments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d) would require that mineral materials needed for use in the HCNRA for one of the enumerated purposes in paragraph (c) or for use outside the HCNRA on a project with specific and identifiable benefits for the HCNRA must come from sources located outside the HCNRA unless (1) the cost associated with using non-HCNRA mineral materials adds significantly to the costs of the material, or (2) the transportation of mineral materials from outside the HCNRA presents a safety hazard to the motoring public.When mineral materials are obtained from inside the HCNRA, environmental impact at the source must be mitigated by contouring the land, re-establishing vegetation, and other appropriate measures. This paragraph would further prohibit the extraction of mineral materials from sources inside the HCNRA if the use would be outside the HCNRA and would not directly benefit the HCNRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (b)(1) would incorporate the standards and guidelines in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) for Other Lands and apply them to Wilderness Lands. This would ensure the consistency of Forest Service administration of mining activities within the HCNRA and further the protection and enhancement of the values which caused Congress to designate the HCNRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(2) would prohibit the extraction of mineral materials from the Wilderness Lands. This is a restatement of existing authority in 36 CFR 293.14(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effect of the foregoing standards is to provide for the continued maintenance and development of facilities and transportation routes necessary for the administration and safe use and enjoyment of the HCNRA while at the same time minimizing the impacts of such activities on HCNRA lands and directing such activities to non-HCNRA lands wherever possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 292.48&blank;Grazing Activities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;292.48 would create four standards to guide Forest Service administration of grazing activities on National Forest System lands throughout the entire HCNRA. The agency felt that one set of standards and guidelines for the entire HCNRA would be simpler to administer and would adequately provide for the continuation of grazing and the protection and enhancement of the HCNRA resource values. Though not expressly referenced, the relevant provisions of the Granger-Thye Act, 16 U.S.C. 580  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, 43 U.S.C. 1701  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Public Rangelands Improvement Act, 43 U.S.C. 1901  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and regulations at 36 CFR part 222 would also apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a) would authorize the grazing of domestic livestock only on National Forest rangeland that has been found to be in satisfactory condition. In those situations where the land is suitable and in satisfactory conditions, livestock grazing could only take place in such numbers, seasons, and methods which will ensure that the satisfactory condition is maintained. This provision will ensure that domestic livestock grazing will not occur on rangelands that are currently in substandard condition nor will it occur in such a way as to degrade rangelands that are currently in satisfactory condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (b) requires the Forest Service to administer the grazing program to minimize or eliminate conflicts between domestic livestock and fish and wildlife, outdoor recreation, and the preservation and conservation of the other natural values for which the HCNRA was established by adjusting the level, type of livestock, or manner of grazing. This paragraph further requires that the domestic livestock grazing must cease in the event that the adjustment in the grazing activity has failed to eliminate the conflict. This ensures that grazing will not continue if it can not be conducted in a manner that is compatible with the purposes for which the HCNRA was established. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

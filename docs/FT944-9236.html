			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Difficult third term for Portuguese banks Third-quarter results for Portugal's banks were the worst for almost a decade. The once-buoyant sector has been hit by recession, tougher competition and a collapse in bond trading profits. Of the 12 banks that have posted results for the first nine months, nine have recorded a decline in net earnings, compared with the same period last year. State-owned Caixa Geral de Depositos (CGD), the biggest bank, is the only one of the top ten to report a profit increase. Competitive pressures have intensified since liberalisation of the previously state-dominated sector began in the mid-1980s. As a result, financial margins - the difference between the rates at which banks raise funds and lend to customers - have fallen to an average of 3 per cent from 7 per cent in 1989. This has hit one of the main sources of bank earnings. Mr Miguel Namorado Rosa, an economist with Banco Comercial Portugues, calculates revenue from financial margins for the banking sector as a whole at about Es620bn (Dollars 4.8bn) in 1994, Es84bn less than last year. Two years of recession to mid-1994 have squeezed bank profits. Credit to the private sector is forecast to grow by 8.5 per cent this year, down from 13.3 per cent last year. Non-performing loans are increasing as a proportion of total credit and deposit growth has been almost stagnant since 1992. Banco Totta e Acores, which posted the biggest drop in earnings among the top five banks, blames a 16 per cent increase in provisions against bad debt for a 21.6 per cent slide in net profits to Es14.9bn. Bankers expect business to deteriorate further in the last quarter before beginning to pick up, with an economic recovery forecast for 1995. Banks are estimated to have lost nearly Es90bn this year as a result of a sharp drop in interest rates on government debt securities. The combined loss from lower margins and trading losses is more than the sector's total 1993 profit of Es172bn. But the real impact of the bond markets' collapse may not yet have emerged because many Portuguese banks register bonds in their investment portfolios at purchase value and fail to report trading losses in their accounts. The fall of only 1.7 per cent in non-consolidated pre-tax earnings for Banco Portugues do Atlantico, the second biggest bank, might have been considerably larger if such losses had been fully reflected in results, one Lisbon stock market dealer said. Analysts also said some banks 'window dress' results by domiciling credit in offshore centres to escape provisioning requirements, and generally underprovision for credit risks, although meeting their legal obligations.  ------------------------------------------------------------ PORTUGAL'S LEADING BANKS BY ASSETS: 1994 third-quarter results (Es bn)  ------------------------------------------------------------ Bank                             Net consolidated   Change on                                            profit    year (%)  ------------------------------------------------------------ Caixa Geral de Depositos                     32.4      16.9 Banco Portugues do Atlantico*                16.8      -1.7 Banco Totta e Acores                         14.9     -21.6 Banco Espirito Santo                         14.4      -7.7 Banco Comercial Portugues                    13.2      -9.7  ------------------------------------------------------------ * Non-consolidated pre-tax profit  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Carnegie Portugal  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

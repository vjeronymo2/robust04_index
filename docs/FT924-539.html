			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / People: Renishaw David McMurtry, chairman and chief executive of Reni-shaw, the metrology company he built from his invention of touch-trigger probes, is to resume a more active role in new product development. McMurtry, who developed probe technology in the early 1970s while developing the engine for Concorde, will also take responsibility for manufacturing technology in addition to his enhanced R&amp;D role. Renishaw has been working on substantially cutting the cost of high precision engineering at its Gloucestershire manufacturing facilities. Ben Taylor, currently joint managing director, will become assistant chief executive. In particular, he will assume responsibility for worldwide sales and will relieve McMurtry of some of the day-to-day duties of running the company. John Deer, the deputy chairman and other founding partner of Renishaw, has now fully recovered from a heart condition and is to assume greater responsibility for production.</p>

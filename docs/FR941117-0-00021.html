ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(C), An Operator's Obligation to Reimburse the Department for the Cost of the Services Rendered under SOAP <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Arkansas proposed a new paragraph at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(C) that requires a coal operator that has received assistance under SOAP to reimburse the State for the cost of the services rendered if Arkansas finds that the operator's actual and attributed annual production of coal for all locations exceeds 300,000 tons during the 12 months immediately following the date on which the operator is issued the surface coal mining and reclamation permit. Proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(C) is substantively identical to section 507(h) of SMCRA. Therefore, the Director finds that proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(C) is no less stringent than section 507(h) of SMCRA, and approves it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> IV.

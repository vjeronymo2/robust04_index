			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Rutskoi urges Moldova buffer zone MR Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian vice-president, yesterday appealed to the Congress of Russian People's Deputies to sanction the use of the former Soviet 14th army - now under Russian control - to establish a buffer zone along the River Dnestr between warring Moldovans and Russians. Mr Rutskoi also suggested in a fiercely nationalist speech that Russia might recognise the self-proclaimed Trans-Dnestr republic, where the Russians are concentrated. No vote was taken on his appeal. But it drew a sympathetic response from many deputies, and shows a substantial number of legislators are willing to protect by military force the interests of the millions of Russians living in former Soviet republics. A foreign ministers' meeting, meanwhile, agreed a ceasefire between Moldovan government forces and Russian-speaking separatists from this afternoon. The accord was reached at talks between foreign ministers of Moldova, Russia, Ukraine and Romania in Kishinev. Mr Rutskoi, just returned from a visit to the Trans-Dnestr republic, told congress in Moscow that 'unless Russia guarantees the protection of its citizens wherever they live . . . there will be military conflict on the former territory of the Soviet Union and there will be thousands of refugees, as we already see.' Mr Rutskoi's visit was opposed by Moldova, which complained that Russia was interfering in its internal affairs. The Russians in Trans-Dnestr fear that the Kishinev government will try to incorporate Moldova into Romania; most of the Moldovan population is ethnic Romanian. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, had proposed in Kishinev that Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and Romania act as guarantors of the independence and integrity of Moldova, and also of the right to self-determination of the mainly Russian population on the left bank of the Dnestr. The Azerbaijani prime minister, Mr Hasan Hasanov, has been ousted in an apparent power struggle in the former Soviet republic, Interfax news agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow.</p>

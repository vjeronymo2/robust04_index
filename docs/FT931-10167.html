			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Contractors warn over threat to tendering: Companies tell Catherine Milton and Gillian Tett that EC rules may wreck the government's plans GOVERNMENT contractors yesterday issued a warning that confusion over employment legislation could wreck the Conservatives' plans to increase market testing and competitive tendering for public services. Contractors say the process of competitive tendering would be undermined if European Community regulations protecting the terms of employment of staff in mergers and acquisitions were held to apply to the contracting-out of government and council services. Mr Robin Oakley-Smith, chairman of the Cleaning and Support Services Association, said yesterday that applying the Transfer of Regulations (Protection of Employment) rules would make it harder for private firms to compete effectively. Under Tupe private companies that win public-sector contracts would have to retain employees on their existing terms of employment. 'If the regulations were to apply, the process of competition would be virtually meaningless, as every company would be obliged to maintain the same cost base,' said Mr Oakley-Smith, whose association represents 160 companies with total annual turnover of Pounds 1.3bn. His comments reflect a mood of growing frustration among government contractors over the uncertainties surrounding the regulations, which implement the EC's 1977 Acquired Rights Directive. Recent decisions of the European Court of Justice have extended the regulations' scope to cover contracting out some public services. Of 20 large and medium-sized contractors contacted this week, five said the legislation applied to their bids, while seven said it did not, while the balance insisted that the situation varied on a case by case basis. Some contractors believe they will be unable to compete effectively with in-house departments because of the European legislation. All agree that clarification and consistent advice are needed. 'It seems that the British government just wants to sit back and let the courts decide - but even the lawyers disagree,' complained one large contractor, who said he was 'utterly fed up' with the situation. Some contractors suspect this confusion is deliberate - government departments or local councils that are opposed to private contractors or market testing are, they say, using the threat of Tupe to fight privatisation. 'The real frustration is that we have been flying the flag for the government with compulsory competitive tendering. But now they've pulled the plug at the eleventh hour,' said Mr Mike Wardle, joint managing director of a company which provides sports and leisure facilities for local authorities. Mr Wardle's company is, like several other contractors, facing legal action over its failure to observe Tupe regulations on previous local authority contracts. However, as he points out, even a decision in the British courts will not necessarily resolve the issue. 'The annoying thing is that if we win in this country, we would still go to Europe and lose,' he said. Some businesses in the waste management sector - where terms of employment often change significantly under private management - believe Tupe could kill their business. 'If we are obliged to offer employment to all the previous employees we just couldn't be effective against the public sector,' said one large contractor. This message is echoed by other catering, cleaning and security groups. However, the majority of companies contacted said they would still be able to compete with in-house teams even if the regulations applied. Specialist and information technology service groups appeared to be least affected by Tupe. 'We would normally expect to take on most of the workforce anyway,' commented a specialist defence contractor. 'In IT, you need the existing staff to deliver a service from Day One,' says Mr Charles Cox, director of Hoskyns, the computing services group. Mr Nigel Brocklehurst, personnel manager for CFM, a subsidiary of ICL which provides computer management services for about 25 local authorities, said the regulations can make transfers simpler: 'If you are transferring more than about 50 or 100 staff it is a logistical nightmare to transfer them any other way.' Mr Brocklehurst admitted there are cost implications. 'You inherit things like liability for 30 years' service which could be expensive. But you reflect the cost in your charges to the client.' Other contractors said inheriting collectively bargained agreements and 'outdated' council working practices was 'irritating'. Nevertheless, the one issue on which there was unanimity across the sectors is the need for clarification. As Mr Simon Cox, managing director of ISS Mediclean, one of the largest health service contractors said: 'What we want to see is some consistent advice coming out of the government. That's the most important thing.'</p>

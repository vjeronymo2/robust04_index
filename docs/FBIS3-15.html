			<p>SUMMARY                                After publicly protesting his exclusion from important  deliberations on nationality affairs and threatening to resign  his post as Minister of Nationality Affairs and Regional Policy,  Sergey Shakhray appears to have halted and even reversed his  political decline following the December elections.  After losing  deputy premier status in the recent cabinet reorganization,  Shakhray appears to have rebounded by means of a presidential  decree giving him special status as a member of the Government  Presidium.  Although the decree appears to mark at least  Shakhray's partial return to President Boris Yeltsin's good  graces, he continues to split with the president on major issues  such as the recent amnesty for Yeltsin's opponents, suggesting  the apparent reconciliation may be short-lived.                           END SUMMARY     A presidential decree dated 12 February elevated newly  reappointed (See Note 1) Minister of Nationality Affairs and  Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray above the status of rank-and-file  Russian government ministers, announcing that he would be  included in the Government Presidium (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 15  February).  According to the Council of Ministers press service,  Shakhray will be the only "regular" minister attending the weekly  meetings of the Presidium--which also includes Premier Viktor  Chernomyrdin and his four deputies--as a "full member"  (Kommersant-Daily, 15 February) (See Note 2).  Shakhray had made  inclusion in the Presidium a condition of his acceptance of the  ministerial port folio on 20 January.  After being offered the  portfolio, Shakhray reportedly said that he would accept only if  the Nationality Affairs and Regional Policy Ministry were made  directly subordinate to the premier and he as minister were  included in the Presidium (Interfax, 19 January).     (Note 1)  Shakhray was previously chairman of the Russian  Federation State Committee for Nationality Affairs and Regional  Policy, which was changed into a ministry in the post-election  cabinet reshuffle.  See the Trends of 26 January 1994, pages 16-  22, for a summary of changes to the cabinet.     (Note 2)  On 15 February ITAR-TASS reported that Economics  Minister Aleksandr Shokhin--also a leader of Shakhray's Party of  Russian Unity and Accord (PRES)--is a member of the Presidium.     Shakhray had held the nationalities portfolio and the rank of  deputy premier until Chernomyrdin reorganized the cabinet,  reducing the number of deputy premiers and redistributing their  responsibilities.  The reshuffle decreased the number of deputy  premiers from six to four, and the remaining deputy premiers were  given more responsibilities  (Mayak Radio, 31 January; ITAR-TASS,  15 February).  Following the reorganization, Chernomyrdin signed  a decision tasking First Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets with the  coordination of the activities of 15 ministries, state  committees, and departments (ITAR-TASS, 15 February).  Chernomyrdin's reshuffle also assigned each of the deputy  premiers oversight over specific areas of social and economic  policy but did not explicitly assign the nationalities portfolio  to any of them, suggesting that Shakhray will have considerable  latitude in this area.     End of Eclipse     Recent media commentary on Shakhray's situation interpreted the  decree as a victory for him, ending a period in which his  influence on nationality affairs was visibly declining.  Following his demotion from deputy premier to minister in the  cabinet reshuffle (ITAR-TASS, 20 January), an article in the 25  January issue of Moskovskiy Komsomolets reported that nationality  affairs were being handled by other officials, leaving Shakhray  out of the loop on important developments:     --Deputy Premiers Yuriy Yarov and Aleksandr Zaveryukha had been  given joint jurisdiction over nationality affairs, and Shakhray  was now complaining that he was being used as a "front" instead  of being "the man in charge" of regional policy.     --Chernomyrdin had met with Chechen Republic Deputy Premier  Mairbek Mugadayev in disregard of "Shakhray's directive" not to  treat representatives of the Chechen Government as leaders of an  independent republic.     --Shakhray had complained tHhat government officials invited him  "to study" Tatarstan's draft "Treaty on the Mutual Delegation of  Authority and Terms of Reference" only after he expressed in an  Interfax interview his bewilderment at not being included in the  treaty negotiations.     Other media reports also noted that Shakhray appeared to be  losing influence.  According to Interfax (21 January), "well-  informed" sources within the government had said that Shakhray  had been "virtually debarred" from handling regional issues.  Kommersant-Daily reported that before he was elevated to the  Presidium, Shakhray had been complaining to journalists that  urgent problems such as Tatarstan and Chechnya were being handled  without his involvement.  Shakhray was also apparently excluded  from a 20 January telephone conference with the heads of  administration of "a number of regions" discussing preparations  for upcoming local elections.  According to Rossiyskaya Gazeta  (21 January), Presidential Administration Leader Sergey Filatov  led the conference and Yarov participated.     Background to Eclipse     Shakhray appeared to overcome what the Moskovskiy Komsomolets  article called his "rather dubious status" by threatening to  refuse to accept reappointment to the nationalities portfolio.  Interfax (21 January) quoted Shakhray as saying that if "vital  issues of regional and nationality policies" continue to be dealt  with "without participation of the government member responsible  for these issues . . . , I will not be able to work in the  cabinet."     Shakhray's eclipse from nationality issues and his loss of the  deputy premier post were probably retaliation by Yeltsin for  Shakhray's limited support of the president and his reform team  at crucial moments before and during the December election  campaign.  Yeltsin disdained Shakhray's establishment of the  Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES) for splitting his reform  team and contributing to the reformers' December national  election defeat by splitting the vote.  (Although Yeltsin avoided  direct association with any party during the national election,  he had been perceived as favoring Russia's Choice "in spirit"  (Mayak Radio, 16 October 1993)--inasmuch as many of his close  associates formed the party and actively promoted his reforms.)  During the October 1993 crisis, Shakhray pushed for compromise  and simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections rather  than fully supporting Yeltsin's decisions.  Shakhray had also  undermined Yeltsin's authority at a preparatory regional  conference by openly disagreeing with Yeltsin's decision to urge  the voluntary dissolution of local soviets (Interfax, 6 October  1993).     Outlook     Shakhray's special status as a member of the Presidium puts him  on a par, in effect, with the deputy premiers and probably allows  him, as he had demanded, to report directly to Chernomyrdin on  nationality affairs.  The arrangement may also facilitate the  division of labor among the deputy premiers, allowing the cabinet  to make fuller use of Shakhray's experience in nationality  affairs and freeing the others to concentrate on priority  economic issues.  With Shakhray apparently positioning himself as  a future presidential candidate and staking out positions opposed  to Yeltsin on key political issues--most recently on the issue of  amnesty for Yeltsin opponents arrested in 0ctober (Interfax, 28  February)--Shakhray's apparent return to influence in the cabinet  may not last long.

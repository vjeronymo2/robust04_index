			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SEXIER WAY TO EDUCATE TEEN-AGERS  </P> <P> In a state with a population of just 700,000, about 47,000 in-state telephone  calls -- many of them presumably from young men -- have flooded a Delaware  number that offers frank talk about sex.  </P> <P> But state officials aren't in an uproar, and, in fact, are pleased by the heavy  traffic on the toll-free "In Touch" line, which offers advice on such topics as  "How to Score."  </P> <P> That's because it is part of an innovative program by the Delaware Division of  Public Health to educate what has been the toughest to reach and most poorly  informed group on human sexuality: teen-age males.  </P> <P> With posters and brochures, health officials have tried to entice teens to call  "In Touch" to listen to 50 tapes with such titles as "How to Score," "How to  Say 'No,' " "Big Muscles and Manhood," and "What She Would Tell You If She  Could."  </P> <P> So just what do callers hear?  </P> <P> After punching in a code for "How to Score," for example, a man's voice tells  them: "You want to get lucky, right? You want to get what you want. If you're a  man, you want to get a little . . . from whomever OK? You know what that means.  . . .  </P> <P> "We interviewed some incredible studs on this one and here's what they said:  One said he held off (having sex) because he learned -- correctly, by the way  -- that, if you try to make love under pressure and you don't know what you're  doing, it's usually not very satisfactory.  </P> <P> "Another said he took care of his urges by himself. Not a bad idea, by the way.  And he kept on having great fantasies and really enjoying them, without acting  on them."  </P> <P> That message might not have been exactly what some callers might have expected,  especially based on the tape's title.  </P> <P> But "if we came up with very clinical titles, the kids wouldn't be interested,"  said Lucille Siegel, director of Delaware's Office of Adolescent Health  Services. "What we tried to do is come up with titles to the messages that  would encourage kids to call up and listen.  </P> <P> "They think it's going to tell them how to go find a boyfriend or a girlfriend.  In fact, it gets into things related to peer pressure and issues like whether  you have to have a lover or a sex partner to be cool and accepted."  </P> <P> That the "In Touch" line has become so popular since it began in 1986 -- it now  receives nine calls an hour on weekdays in the peak period from just after  school ends until dinner time -- has attracted national attention.  </P> <P> Siegel, who recently published a brief essay describing the program in the  American Journal of Public Health, said her agency has received inquiries about  it from agencies across the country.  </P> <P> Why? Siegel and Planned Parenthood chapter officials nationwide said it is  frustrating trying to educate teen-age males, because the American ethic  requires them to pretend to friends and peers that they know about sex, and  that they are experienced with it.  </P> <P> The privacy of the call-in service -- which can be reached only by callers in  Delaware -- allows teen-agers to maintain appearances for their peers while  still providing them accurate information they can relate to, Siegel said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Federal Funds  </P> <P> The program -- funded by a federal grant that pays for the phone machinery,  production of tapes and a statewide advertising and promotion campaign linked  to high school sex education courses -- had its genesis in a similar service  once run by the Los Angeles Planned Parenthood chapter, Siegel said.  </P> <P> That program, which a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said went out of existence  six years ago, was less extensive. Baltimore's Planned Parenthood -- as well as  chapters in San Diego and Marin County and at least one county health  department in Virginia -- have run similar programs, though none as explicit as  Delaware's.  </P> <P> Though the Delaware tapes are explicit, they are carefully crafted. They are  reviewed by a panel of several dozen representatives of church and community  groups.  </P> <P> None of the 50 tapes focuses on abortion -- a recognition that that topic,  especially for a public agency, is too controversial for the call-in format.  </P> <P> Because of its format, statistical records can't determine the sex of the  callers. But 42% of the callers, who push buttons to ask for specific tapes,  requested selections designed for a male audience; 35% of the callers requested  tapes on female-oriented topics; and 23% heard tapes considered "gender  neutral."  </P> <P> Despite extensive local media publicity about the program, there have been no  complaints about it from any group, said Barbara Ryan, director of education  for Planned Parenthood of Delaware, the agency which houses the "In Touch"  answering machine.  </P> <P> The service, Ryan said, must be filling a large, unmet need because the machine  "is going all the time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public Health Messages  </P> <P> "How to Score" is the most popular selection, and it, like the other messages,  contains a carefully structured, classical series of public health messages.  </P> <P> In addition to thinly veiled references to sex, seduction and masturbation,  "How to Score," for example, also advises about: effective birth control;  religious and other concerns about sex, masturbation and sex among unmarried  teens; and the importance of caring, communicative relationships over sexual  flings.  </P> <P> It closes with a quiz on responsible sex and ends with the male voice  observing: "So how did you score? Or, how important is scoring to you? Unless  you scored well on this little quiz, you may need some work before you get  lucky. If not, you may be just very unlucky and your partner may be, too."  </P></p>

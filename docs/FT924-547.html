			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Schlesinger remarks lift dollar THE DOLLAR rose by more than 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday after comments from the Bundesbank president suggested that an easing in German monetary policy might come sooner than expected, writes James Blitz. In a newspaper interview, Mr Helmut Schlesinger said it was possible for long-term interest rates to decline to below 6 per cent, and that inflation might be down to 3 per cent by next year. Dealers interpreted these comments as a totally unexpected piece of Christmas cheer from the otherwise rather conservative Mr Schlesinger. The dollar rose on the back of the news to finish at DM1.5865, after a previous close of DM1.5680. The gain was moderately extended in New York with a closing DM1.5885. In very thin trading the French franc made progress against the German currency for the first time in a week, momentarily rising above FFr3.41 to the D-Mark, before settling back to a close of FFr3.4110, more than 1/2 centime up on the day. Although the D-Mark was weaker against most currencies, a significant loser in yesterday's events was sterling. The pound lost some 2 1/2 cents against the dollar, ending at Dollars 1.5390. In New York it eased further to Dollars 1.5365. Dealers said that although Mr Schlesinger's comments had triggered thoughts of a possible cut in German interest rates, they were hedging themselves by selling sterling for dollars rather than the D-Mark. However, the UK currency was weak enough to lose against the D-Mark as well, falling 1 pfennig to close at DM2.4425. Several analysts confessed that it was hard to see any new information contained in Mr Schlesinger's interview. Nobody in the markets doubts that interest rates will come down next year. And, although German inflation may rise a few more points, the forecast of 3 per cent inflation by the end of next year is not unusual, bearing in mind the German recession. However, Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said the D-Mark's weakness was due to a creeping feeling in the market that governments can cut interest rates with impunity, without following what the Bundesbank is doing. Italy, for example, yesterday lowered its discount rate by 1 percentage point to 12 per cent, but the lira actually improved against the D-Mark, finishing at L896.4 In recent days, the Canadian authorities have cut their key interest rates by 150 basis points, but the Canadian dollar has rallied and the Canadian central bank has had to sell its currency in markets. Enthusiasts for lower interest rates in Germany were also cheered yesterday by news of a full 1 percentage-point fall in Germany's M3 money growth in November. Economists said the dip reflected the unwinding of September's currency intervention by the Bundesbank.</p>

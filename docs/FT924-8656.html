			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Costain/Hanson Whatever the outcome of the little spat between Costain and Hanson over Costain's Australian coal interests, both sides look like losers. Hard on the heels of losing RHM to Tomkins, Hanson could do without the public relations headache of another deal turning sour. Given Costain's need to reduce debt, it is hardly in its interest for the whole thing to be bogged down in the courts. The difference between the two is that Hanson can better afford the inconvenience. That Costain needs to sell its prime asset is underlined by how little the shares have risen since the original deal was announced. Even when the money comes in, gearing will be about 50 per cent. If the preference shares are repaid next year and cash flow remains negative, gearing may well rise to around 70 per cent, even without further asset writedowns. To add to its woes, much of Costain's debt is denominated in dollars: it will not benefit from falling UK rates, but will be hurt by the devaluation of sterling when its hedging runs out. Meanwhile the company is stuck with an underperforming US coal operation and its basic UK contracting and construction business. Costain badly needs an upturn in the UK construction market to revive its fortunes. The Autumn Statement notwithstanding, that looks as depressingly far away as ever.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / People: Non-executive directors Paddy Linaker, former managing director and deputy chairman of M&amp;G, the City fund manager, is taking over as non-executive chairman of FISONS as from yesterday. He replaces Patrick Egan, 64, executive chairman, who in March signalled his intention to step down and was known to have been keen to step down as soon as a replacement was in place. Stuart Wallis, 48, the chief executive since September, takes over executive control of the company. His predecessor, Cedric Scroggs, was sacked in December and the company since shed jobs and sold off some businesses. Fisons says the changes are ere taking place with immediate effect because 'the handover to Wallis has gone exceptionally smoothly'. Linaker, 60, joined the Fisons board in July as a non-executive director after he left M&amp;G. He is also a non-executive director of the TSB Group.</p>

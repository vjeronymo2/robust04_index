			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report under the "Special Services" rubric: </F> "Russian Intelligence Service in Top League"]    [Text] All sorts of conjectures about the decisive  contribution made by "nuclear spies" -- which include "agents"  from among Western nuclear scientists -- to the creation in our  country of nuclear weapons do not correspond with the historical  truth. This was stated by Colonel General Vyacheslav Trubnikov,  first deputy director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence  Service [FIS].    "In reality the creation of nuclear weapons in our country  came as a result of the efforts of our science, of such  outstanding representatives of which as Kurchatov, Khariton,  Zeldovich, and many others. The atomic bomb is no simple device  you can steal a look at somewhere and then copy it back home.  Had not our science come close to unraveling the secrets of the  nucleus, it would simply not have been able to understand and  appreciate the information on the range of nuclear problems that  our intelligence service was obtaining," the general underlined.    Vyacheslav Trubnikov pointed out that the role of the  Foreign  Intelligence Service in assuring Russia's security is very  appreciable although it is not always in the public eye. He  also thinks that "the tendencies of world development are on the  whole favorable for our country, while the spectrum of threats  still remains rather broad." In his words, the Russian  intelligence service stands up well to "competition" from such  recognized leaders of world spying as the U.S. CIA, the Israeli  Mosad, and the secret service of Great Britain: "We have always  been in this league and, one would like to believe, will always  remain in it." There he stressed: "Were the personnel of our  "competition" in the sort of conditions the Russian intelligence  service is at the moment, few would stand up to them. Ours  carry on serving and will serve!"</p>

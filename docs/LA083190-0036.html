			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> CANADIAN BRASS RETURNS TO BOWL  </P> <P> Few people go to Harlem Globetrotters games expecting to see a real basketball  contest. Similarly, few go to hear the Canadian Brass for the music; it's there  simply to provide material for sight and sound gags, or for showing off the  players' considerable virtuosity.  </P> <P> Which is not to say that the show Wednesday night at Hollywood Bowl wasn't  funny. That would be humbug. It's just to point out that these days the  Canadian Brass, in live concert at least, is essentially a comedy group that  performs music, not vice versa.  </P> <P> Even what potentially could have been the musical anchor to its program, Bach's  Toccata and Fugue in D minor, emerges not so much as great music as it does  display piece, revealing that brass instruments can do more than most expect.  And this most famous of brass quintets performs virtually no music originally  written specifically for such an ensemble. Wednesday, the closest it got was  with excerpts from Pezel's "Funf-stimmigte blasende Musik." Arrangements made  up the entire program.  </P> <P> Fine. But they are not always 100% effective. The arrangements of Mozart's  "Rondo alla Turca" and the Queen of the Night's aria, for instance, while  impressively played, didn't do proper justice to the music.  </P> <P> The most effective arrangement of classical music turned out to be of Barber's  Adagio, which the group performed completely straight, in a somber, smoothly  flowing account.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, "The Tribute to the Ballet," the group's oft-repeated spoof of  balletic conventions, complete with pas de deux, splits and a tutu, remains  fresh and funny, as do the adept verbal introductions to each work.

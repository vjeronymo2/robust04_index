			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 (YONHAP) -- Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen, saying the North Korean nuclear issue is heading in  the right direction, asserted the problem should be resolved  through dialogue, the TOKYO SHIMBUN reported Thursday.    Qian made the remark in an interview with the newspapers's  publisher, Kato Kiichiro, at the official Chinese guest house in  Beijing.    Qian also said it is understandable that Pyongyang rejected  a  UN Security Council presidential statement because North Korea  opposes the council taking up the nuclear matter. The  presidential statement, adopted unanimously by the council,  urges North Korea to allow outside inspections of its nuclear  facilities.    The North Korean nuclear impasse, nevertheless, is "moving  in  the right direction bit by bit," Qian was quoted as saying.    He said China favors talks through three channels -- between  North Korea and the United States, between North and South Korea  and between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA).    Qian said China pushed the Security Council president's  statement, which has no binding power, since it is against the  United Nations handling the issue.    Asked whether North Korea had nuclear bombs, Qian said he  could not be sure. This seemed to indicate a slight change in  China's previous position that North Korea has neither the  intention nor the ability to develop nuclear weapons, the TOKYO  SHIMBUN reported.</p>

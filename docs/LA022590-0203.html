			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUCKLOAD OF TROUBLES;  </P> <P> AMERICA'S TRUCKING AND TRUCK-BUILDING INDUSTRIES ARE RIDING THROUGH DIFFICULT  TIMES. AFTER A DECADE, TRUCKERS ARE STILL WRESTLING WITH THE IMPACT OF  DEREGULATION AND SUFFERING FROM A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF DRIVERS. AND COMPANIES  THAT BUILD LARGE TRUCKS, ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE LITTLE TO FEAR SO FAR FROM JAPANESE  COMPETITION, ARE STRUGGLING WITH GROWING LOSSES.;  </P> <P> TRANSPORT: THE LIFTING OF GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS LEFT THE INDUSTRY IN  COMPETITIVE TURMOIL. MANY FIRMS HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS. OTHERS ARE IN IT FOR  THE LONG HAUL.  </P> <P> Sterling Transit, a longtime California trucking firm, had an enviable safety  record -- the company won a safe-driving award from the California Trucking  Assn. last year -- but it wasn't enough to steer it away from disaster.  </P> <P> Last November, the 57-year-old Montebello trucking company slammed into a  mountain of debt and closed its doors, one of 1,000 trucking firms nationwide  to do so last year.  </P> <P> Ten years after the federal government lifted most of its restrictions on  interstate trucking, the industry is still in turmoil. Intense competition  among trucking companies has led to vicious rate wars that have weakened some  firms and wiped out thousands of others.  </P> <P> Besides fighting it out among themselves, a large number of trucking companies  face increased competition from railroad intermodal networks. With special flat  cars, railroads transport container cargo inland after it arrives on ships from  overseas.  </P> <P> A few years ago, virtually all container cargo was shipped by truck. But now,  said Bernard Campbell, a transportation analyst with the consulting firm Data  Resources in Cambridge, Mass., "the railroads have gotten their acts together.  In many cases, they are just as quick and cost-efficient as trucks."  </P> <P> Trucking executives said in interviews that when the lengthy, post-deregulation  shakeout is finally over, only two kinds of companies -- nimble local firms and  national giants -- will remain. These executives said continued rate wars will  drive regional firms -- such as Sterling Transit -- out of business, or into  the arms of larger, acquisition-minded competitors.  </P> <P> Jerry Lundberg, owner of Sterling Transit, said deregulation helped kill off  his firm. Lower-cost, non-union trucking companies were able to attract his  regular customers with lower rates. Last year, Sterling lost 10 accounts worth  a total of $300,000 a month -- one-quarter of its monthly revenue. "We simply  couldn't compete," he said.  </P> <P> Other companies have disappeared through mergers. In California, one of the  strongest regional carriers, Viking Transit of San Jose, was gobbled up in 1988  by Roadway, one of the nation's top three trucking companies. More recently,  Los Angeles-based Transcon agreed to buy Coastal Corp.'s money-losing ANR  Freight Systems in a deal that would create the country's fourth-largest  trucking firm. (The acquisition is being contested in federal court, however,  by an Illinois investment firm that claims Coastal had agreed to sell ANR  Freight to it.)  </P> <P> Deregulation has not been a disaster for all trucking firms. Given the freedom  to operate anywhere in the country and to set rates, a number of companies have  grown and prospered. The big firms, such as Consolidated Freightways, Roadway  and Yellow Freight, have especially benefited from deregulation because they  have the financial wherewithal to withstand rate competition and the size to  compete in many markets.  </P> <P> Smaller firms have grown in a deregulated marketplace by carefully selecting  their market and watching costs. Donald Freymiller, owner of a Bakersfield firm  that transports refrigerated freight, said deregulation has allowed his company  to grow from 95 trucks in 1980 to 625 today. "Those who cry foul haven't  learned how to curtail costs," he said.  </P> <P> Consolidated Freightways, based in Palo Alto, has probably pursued the most  aggressive expansion plan since deregulation. It has broadly diversified from  basic long-haul service into regional trucking, ocean shipment and air freight,  evolving from simply a trucking concern into a well-rounded transportation  company.  </P> <P> Consolidated's February, 1989, acquisition of Emery Air Freight, for example,  is an integral part of the company's plan to expand in Europe. Consolidated  President and Chief Executive Lary R. Scott envisions a network that would fly  goods from the United States to Europe on Emery, then deliver them on  Consolidated's trucks.  </P> <P> Other large trucking companies have taken a more conservative approach.  </P> <P> Yellow Freight, the nation's largest trucker, has no intention of straying from  its specialty, long-haul trucking.  </P> <P> Bob Burdick, Yellow Freight's marketing vice president, said part of the reason  that Yellow, headquartered in Overland Park, Kan., has not diversified is that  it was not prepared when deregulation occurred. Unlike its chief rivals,  Consolidated and Roadway, it lacked a terminal and communications network and  needed to play catch-up to compete with them.  </P> <P> "We will continue to emphasize our core business" and, unlike Consolidated, "we  will not set up regional companies," Burdick said. "Each company is pursuing  its own strategy and, in time, the stockholders will decide which was the  correct course of action."  </P> <P> Transcon, Consolidated Freightways and Yellow Freight are among the firms that  focus on delivery of small shipments for a variety of customers. Known in the  industry as less-than-truckload carriers, these firms collect shipments from  customers and distribute them from a central terminal in much the same way that  United Parcel Service gathers and delivers packages.  </P> <P> The less-than-truckload business is generally in better financial shape than  the rest of the trucking industry, primarily because fewer companies focus on  it. One reason is cost. The ability to efficiently juggle many deliveries for  many customers requires investment in sophisticated computer equipment. Often,  the less-than-truckload carriers supply their customers with computer terminals  so they can track their shipments themselves.  </P> <P> The costly equipment is essential, trucking executives say. "If we didn't have  it, we wouldn't be in business right now," said Scott of Consolidated  Freightways.  </P> <P> However, the less-than-truckload business is not immune from the rate wars that  have bothered the rest of the industry.  </P> <P> The rate wars are a direct result of government deregulation, which gave  shippers the right to negotiate rates. Deregulation also opened the door to  many new trucking firms, creating an increase in capacity and more rate  pressure.  </P> <P> Trucking firms routinely bargain rates down to capture business, at the expense  of profits. Last year, a 4.7% rate increase announced in April by  less-than-truckload shippers was discounted away by late fall.  </P> <P> In some markets, trucking firms charge special weekend rates that are nearly  half the regular rate to keep trucks from sitting idle when business is slow.  </P> <P> This year, trucking firms have raised rates 5% to 7%, in part to cover fuel  costs. But trucking executives say they are not sure that the increase will  remain in force, especially if the economy slows.  </P> <P> "We're concerned," Scott said. "Our profits are not what they should be.  Something has to happen to stop the rate erosion."  </P> <P> The pressure on profits has led trucking firms to trim costs where possible.  Freymiller Trucking of Bakersfield replaces its fleet every two years to keep  fuel and maintenance costs low. The fuel efficiency of its fleet has doubled  since 1980, owner Donald Freymiller said.  </P> <P> He also said his liability insurance rate has fallen sharply since 1985, when  he started testing his drivers and job applicants for drug use. (Federal law  requires all trucking firms to test employees for drug use beginning this year,  although the start of those tests has been delayed by legal challenges.)  </P> <P> Many trucking firms have taken aim at labor costs, which normally account for  about 47% of a company's operating expenses.  </P> <P> A growing number of trucking firms are giving employees a stake in their future  through employee stock ownership plans or profit-sharing programs, in return  for wage concessions. But those solutions don't work if the company isn't  successful.  </P> <P> Sterling owner Lundberg said his company's 180 drivers took a 13% wage cut two  years ago in return for an ownership stake, but it wasn't enough to keep the  company going.  </P> <P> Consolidated Freightways took an unusual approach to lowering its labor costs.  Rather than expand its network by selectively buying regional firms, it started  new companies from scratch -- but with non-union labor.  </P> <P> Employees of these regional companies, which are called Conway and specialize  in overnight delivery, earn nearly as much and have many of the same fringe  benefits as Consolidated Freight-ways' long-haul drivers, Scott said. But the  Conway drivers aren't restricted by union work rules that limit their tasks.  For example, the non-union drivers also load and unload freight.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, Consolidated Freightways' tactic hasn't ruffled the Teamsters  Union, which represents most union drivers but hasn't tried to organize Conway.  California Teamsters official Alex Ybarolaza said he understands Consolidated's  strategy and that it seems successful. But in general, he said, non-union  workers earn less and have fewer benefits than union workers.  </P> <P> Deregulation has led to some unusual alliances. Two months ago, J. B. Hunt  Transport Services, a full-truckload company, joined forces with its  traditional rival, Santa Fe Railway, to form a door-to-door delivery service  for business customers. Rather than compete with the railroad along the Los  Angeles-to-Chicago route, J. B. Hunt will pick up and deliver freight  transported between those two cities by rail.  </P> <P> Campbell, the trucking industry analyst, said he expects other truckers to seek  similar deals. "It's hard for truckers to attract drivers to these long-haul  markets, and the competition is cutthroat. Why not back away a little bit and  form a venture where they can have a better chance of making money?"  </P> <P> As the scores of trucking failures testify, not every company is doing well.  Even large companies, burdened by high labor costs and a lack of modern  equipment, have trouble. For example, many trucking industry analysts question  the proposed merger of Transcon and ANR, two money-losing companies.  </P> <P> Executives at Transcon say they think that they can consolidate the two  companies' distribution networks, cut the fat and make money. But industry  watchers wonder whether Transcon can actually pull off the financial alchemy  and turn the red ink into black.  </P> <P> "It is going to be very difficult to put the two companies together," said  George G. Morris, an analyst with Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, an investment  firm in Cleveland. Morris described Transcon as having been in "financial free  fall" before the merger.  </P> <P> "If we go through another recessionary period, it will very difficult," he  said. "I guess only time will tell."  </P></p>

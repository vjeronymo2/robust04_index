			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IZVESTIA ASSAILS SAKHAROV OVER REFORM STANCE  </P> <P> After weeks in which they stood silent before an increasingly critical Andrei  D. Sakharov, the Soviet authorities struck back Wednesday, accusing the Nobel  prize-winning physicist and human rights advocate of undermining their reform  program by making negative statements to the foreign press.  </P> <P> The blow was in the form of an editorial in the government newspaper Izvestia,  ostensibly responding to comments Sakharov made in an interview published by  the French newspaper Le Figaro last week.  </P> <P> The editorial's appearance suggested a shift in the complex relationship that  has evolved between the 67-year-old former dissident and the Kremlin  leadership, which restored him to official respectability two years ago.  </P> <P> Izvestia's main complaint appeared to be a statement attributed to Sakharov by  Le Figaro warning that because Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has failed  to seek popular support in direct elections, "the conservatives will overthrow  Gorbachev or at least impose their views on him."  </P> <P> "It seems appropriate to ask on what data this claim is based and what  arguments there are to save it from (being) political fantasy?" Izvestia  demanded in a prominent back-page editorial. Using the Russian word by which  Gorbachev's reform program has become known, the newspaper complained that such  statements "give rise to all manner of conjectures, which in turn cause  confusion in the minds, uncertainty and suspicion, which naturally does not  help perestroika and the transformations themselves."  </P> <P> Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner, told reporters Wednesday that her husband's  remarks in Le Figaro were taken out of context from what he thought was a  casual conversation -- rather than an interview -- with a visiting journalist.  </P> <P> Izvestia indicated that it was particularly offended at Sakharov's criticisms  because he has proclaimed himself a supporter of reform, and because he chose  to criticize its course in the foreign press.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some of Same Criticisms  </P> <P> Sakharov was quoted by Le Figaro as stressing that perestroika is "absolutely  necessary" but that this does not mean "that you have to support Gorbachev  without reservation." Also, the Izvestia editorial came on the same day that  the Moscow News, a reform-minded local newspaper, carried an interview with  Sakharov in which he repeated some of the same criticisms he made to Le Figaro.  </P> <P> "A man who considers himself to be a true supporter of perestroika cannot judge  it from the positions of an aloof observer," declared Izvestia. It singled out  Sakharov's protests over the recent arrests of Armenian leaders campaigning for  the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh and commented, "It would be more logical to  take actions which will promote further normalization of the situation, rather  than to cast doubts about the correctness of the measures taken."  </P> <P> Nagorno-Karabakh is the region of Soviet Azerbaijan where 78 people died last  year in clashes between its majority Armenian population and the minority  Azerbaijanis.  </P> <P> The Armenians are mostly Christian while the Azerbaijanis are predominantly  Muslim.  </P> <P> While in the past it may have been understandable that Sakharov used "the pages  of foreign newspapers and microphones to criticize our internal problems,"  Izvestia stated, "this time has passed." Referring to a call in the Le Figaro  interview for the West to keep holding Moscow strictly accountable for its  human rights record, it added: "Of course, everyone is free to choose the  audience and channels of propaganda. But one can hardly agree with the ethics  of calling upon foreign governments and the public to put pressure on the  U.S.S.R."  </P> <P> The Izvestia editorial follows weeks of increasing tension between Sakharov and  the authorities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Freed by Gorbachev  </P> <P> The physicist, who was exiled to the closed, provincial city of Gorky in 1980  for criticizing the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, was released nearly  seven years later on the personal order of Gorbachev.  </P> <P> He became both a supporter and a powerful symbol of the Kremlin leader's  reforms, particularly among Soviet intellectuals and in Western capitalist  countries, both areas where Gorbachev is anxious to enlist support.  </P> <P> By last November, however, Sakharov was clearly disappointed with the extent  and pace of democratic reforms. A new election law fell far short of the ideal,  he said, and it would even give Gorbachev a dangerous monopoly on power.  </P> <P> There have followed a number of critical interviews in the foreign media, and  last month he condemned the arrest of the Armenian leaders as a dangerous  resumption of repression. Sakharov has also called, during an uphill campaign  to win a seat in a new Soviet legislature, for parliamentary control over the  KGB secret police, the Interior Ministry and the Ministry of Defense.  </P> <P> His candidacy is itself a source of potential embarrassment for the  authorities. After being rejected in a controversial maneuver for one of the  assured parliamentary seats assigned to the Academy of Sciences, of which he is  a popular member, Sakharov was nominated for a territorial constituency in  which the Communist Party's candidate was Politburo member Vitaly I.  Vorotnikov.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the Moscow National-Territorial Election  District commission confirmed that Vorotnikov had withdrawn his candidacy to  run in a different district, where he will not face such well-known  competition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One of 15 Nominees  </P> <P> It is still not certain that Sakharov will be accepted for the March 26 ballot,  the spokeswoman said. He is one of 15 candidates nominated from the district  for what are billed as the Soviet Union's first-ever multiple-candidate  national elections. However, it is now up to the party-controlled election  commissions to finalize the ground rules under which the candidate list is  whittled down to the anticipated two or three who will actually appear on the  ballot.  </P> <P> Among Sakharov's supporters in the election is a group about which the  authorities are clearly nervous, a fast-growing, anti-Stalinist movement called  "Memorial." Sakharov was a featured speaker at Memorial's formal, founding  convention last weekend. The Kremlin sees in the group the potential of a  nationwide political movement that would be outside Communist Party control.  </P> <P> While the Izvestia editorial makes clear that the authorities are concerned  enough about Sakharov's criticisms to at least respond, they apparently aren't  anxious for open warfare.  </P> <P> "What we want least of all is for all this to be regarded as criticism or  admonition," Izvestia wrote. However, it added, "neither is it appropriate to  keep silence on matters of principle."  </P></p>

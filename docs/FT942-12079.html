			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Mandela's cabinet choices will signpost way to future - The toughest appointment will be that of first deputy president, with the winner becoming Mandela's heir-apparent Everyone has known for months who will be South Africa's next president: Mr Nelson Mandela. So the betting classes have had to focus their wagers on the post of first deputy president, effectively the prime minister. Mr Mandela has so far given away no secrets on his intentions for this post, or for any other in the 27-minister cabinet. Before making these appointments he is required to consult the leaders of other parties represented in the planned government of national unity: all parties with more than 5 per cent of the vote are entitled to representation in proportion to their share of the national vote, and others may be invited in at his discretion. But the final decisions are his, and it seems unlikely he has made them yet. Indeed, ministerial horse-trading probably cannot begin until after the final electoral results are known and it would take a clairvoyant to know when that will be. Under the constitution, the National party (as the second largest) is guaranteed the post of second deputy president. This post will be filled by Mr FW de Klerk, the incumbent president. Beyond that the NP wants ministers in three broad categories: security, economy, and social affairs. And Mr Mandela seems inclined to cede powerful posts in each category. However, the odds are that these will not include the important post of minister of finance. Businessmen and international investors, who have pinned their hopes on the incumbent minister Mr Derek Keys continuing in office, will probably be disappointed. Mr Mandela's African National Congress sees the upliftment of black South Africans as the central mission of its 80-year liberation struggle; it is unlikely to put the main economic portfolio in the hands of a member of the outgoing government. While Mr Chris Stals, the central bank governor, will remain in office (Mr Mandela has guaranteed this), Mr Keys could be offered the post of minister of trade and industry. He previously indicated no interest in the job but may have reconsidered. Indeed, the Finance Ministry could turn out to be the linchpin of the whole cabinet structure. Once this post is filled it will determine other appointments for there is only one man in the ANC team who would make a remotely credible minister of finance - Mr Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's shadow foreign minister. Mr Mbeki is a class act, and the ANC has used him as a kind of unofficial ambassador to white South Africa. Businessmen breathe an almost audible sigh of relief when they know they have the urbane and charming Mr Mbeki to deal with. He has a masters degree in economics from Sussex University, although no background in finance. But he is well known internationally, and has the confidence to handle international negotiations well. Under the circumstances, Mr Mandela could probably make no better choice. The decision could have a significant long-term impact on the future of South Africa. For if Mr Mbeki was appointed finance minister he could not become first deputy president. The leading contender for that post then would be Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general. The winner will become undisputed heir-apparent to Mr Mandela. It is a difficult choice, for both men are well qualified for the job. Mr Mbeki, 51, is older and more experienced. Mr Ramaphosa, 10 years his junior, has a ruthless political instinct which he used to win a constitutional deal which vastly favours the ANC. Few politicians can better him in battle. At the moment he looks the more likely choice, although only Mr Mandela knows for sure. The ANC leader must also find cabinet space for one of his closest advisers, Mr Joe Slovo, chairman of the South African Communist party, who could win a security port-folio. Mr Jay Naidoo, the union leader, could be made minister of reconstruction and development, a special economic post. National party ministers must also be catered for. Mr Mandela has said he would look favourably on Mr Kobie Coetsee, the incumbent justice minister and a hardliner whom the ANC leader came to know while still in jail, Mr Roelf Meyer, the National party's chief constitutional negotiator and a leading 'enlightened' nationalist, and Mr Pik Botha, the long-serving foreign minister. Far more difficult will be what to do with Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, who could be made a third deputy president in the interests of national unity, and Gen Constand Viljoen, leader of the right-wing Freedom Front, whom Mr Mandela has said he would like to accommodate even if the front wins less than 5 per cent of the national vote. Bets can still be placed, but time is running out. By the end of this week, or early next, the die will be cast.  ----------------------------------------------------------                 WHAT THE VOTERS VOTED FOR               Government of National Unity  ---------------------------------------------------------- President               Elected by the National Assembly Deputy Presidents       One each nominated by the two                         parties with the most votes Cabinet                 Maximum of 27 ministers with                         places allocate proportionately                         from parties holding a minimum                         of 20 National Assembly seats  ---------------------------------------------------------- Parliament              The two houses also sit jointly as                         Constituent Assembly  ----------------------------------------------------------                 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 400 SEATS  ---------------------------------------------------------- 200 members elected proportionately from national election lists, except in the case of the National party, which had no national list and will choose all its representatives from provincial lists  ---------------------------------------------------------- 200 members elected proportionately from provincial lists  ----------------------------------------------------------                      SENTATE OF 90 SEATS  ---------------------------------------------------------- 10 members nominated by each of the nine provincial legislatures  ----------------------------------------------------------                   PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURES   Elected proportionately from provincial election lists  ---------------------------------------------------------- 86 seats      Pretoria/Witwatersrand/Vereeniging (PVW) 30 seats      North-West 30 seats      Northern Cape 42 seats      Western Cape 40 seats      Northern Transvaal 30 seats      Eastern Transvaal 81 seats      KwaZulu/Natal 56 seats      Eastern Cape 30 seats      Orange Free State  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

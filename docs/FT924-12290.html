			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar quota cut to cost Caribbeans Dollars 15m CARIBBEAN suppliers of sugar under quota to the US will earn about Dollars 15m less for deliveries in the current US financial year, following an 11 per cent global cut in US imports. Sugar industry officials in the region say that the latest reduction in US imports will reduce the region's cumulative quota for the year, which begins this month, to 276,341 tonnes. Several beneficiaries of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, a US preferential trade programme, and the Generalised System of Preferences, are allowed to ship pre-determined quantities of sugar to the US duty-free. The Caribbean exporters to the US are the Dominican Republic, Belize, Jamaica, St Kitts-Nevis, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana. It is the second consecutive cut for the Caribbean holders of US quotas which were allowed to supply 471,710 in 1991.</p>

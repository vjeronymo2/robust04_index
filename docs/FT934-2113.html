			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Deutsche ABB unveils top-level shake-out Deutsche ABB, the German arm of the world's leading power engineering group, yesterday announced a top-level organisational shake-out designed to improve efficiency. The changes, which follow similar moves at the Zurich-based parent, unveiled in August, include early retirement for Mr Manfred Simon, the director responsible for the core power generation division. His job will be taken by Mr Hubert Lienhard, 42, currently a member of the three-man board of ABB Kraftwerke in Mannheim. Mr Tom Sjokvist, 46, responsible for power distribution, is to move to group headquarters in Zurich, where he will take charge of global operations in electrical and mechanical installation and low-voltage apparatus and systems. Electricity distribution will be bundled together with the transmission business and run as one division by Mr Sune Karlsson, in charge of transmission alone. Construction and installation technology are also to be combined under the control of the current construction chief, Mr Georg Demling. The industrial technology and automation sector will include robotics and electric motors, and come under the control of Mr Michael Pohr, 51, who takes charge as chairman of Deutsche ABB in May. The current chairman, Mr Eberhard von Koerber, was named as group European director in last summer's reorganisation of the main board. In that reshuffle, the number of main board directors was reduced from 12 to eight, and the six operating divisions were cut to four. The organisational changes in Germany mirror those at group level, which were introduced to help improve ABB's ability to compete for large-scale integrated projects. According to Mr Percy Barnevik, group chief executive, ABB needed a less 'parochial' management structure to better bring together all its resources. Deutsche ABB accounts for around 20 per cent of the group's DM50bn (Dollars 29.4bn) annual turnover.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Product recalls drive Matsushita unit into loss MATSUSHITA Refrigeration, the home refrigerator subsidiary of the Matsushita group, yesterday reported a net loss of Y28.9bn (Dollars 259m), after having been forced to book extraordinary losses for the recall of defective products, writes Robert Thomson. The loss, after a Y4bn profit a year ago, was the first since its listing in 1955, and was cited as one of the causes for the recent boardroom reshuffle in the parent company. Sales for the year slipped 13 per cent to Y176bn as domestic demand for consumer goods was unusually weak. But the most important reason for the red ink in the year to March was a special charge of Y31.4bn linked to the recall of about 420,000 refrigerators with flawed compressors. As a result, executive bonuses are to be cut by 30 per cent this year. The company, which also makes vending machines and air conditioners, managed a pre-tax profit of Y145m, but there was an operating loss of Y4.6bn. Makita, the leading Japanese maker of electric tools, said pre-tax profit fell 6 per cent to Y12.6bn in the year to March, while sales fell 4.5 per cent, the first fall in 30 years. The company blamed the appreciation of the yen and the slowing of the domestic economy for the downturn in sales, which totalled Y123bn, while it has also been troubled by a US anti-dumping action on Japanese hand tools. Demand is strongest from the rapid-growth countries of south-east Asia, but the company expects that sales this year will fall 12 per cent to Y108bn, while pre-tax profit is forecast to fall 35 per cent to Y8.2bn. Consolidated sales were 0.8 per cent higher at Y178.9bn, and pre-tax profit was down 5.7 per cent at Y20.2bn.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Old failings cloud brighter economic outlook If the BBC presenter Martyn Lewis were to produce one of his 'good news' bulletins on the UK economy, he would have plenty of items. Unemployment is falling, inflation and interest rates are at their lowest for more than 20 years, retail sales are growing and companies' investment intentions are on the increase. Figures for gross domestic product in the first quarter of this year are certain to show further growth, which will mean that the recovery has lasted eight quarters, longer than the recession which preceded it. But the average British television audience might find such an optimistic picture hard to believe. Consumer confidence is close to a record low, according to a Gallup poll published earlier this week. This discrepancy between headline statistics and the public mood is not too hard to explain. For a start, consumers are well aware of the impact of this month's tax increases on their pay packets. Second, the fall in unemployment still leaves some 2.72m people out of work, even if one does not believe Labour's claim that the 'real' figure is 5m. Furthermore, jobs created in the recovery have tended to be part-time or in small businesses. The official forecast is for 2.5 per cent growth in GDP this year, following 1.9 per cent in 1993. The problem for the government is that this growth is not sufficient to create a feel-good factor among the population. During the 'Lawson boom' of the mid-1980s, GDP grew at 4 per cent or more for four successive years, including a heady 5 per cent in 1988. Of course the Lawson boom did not turn out well - the current account deficit widened to Pounds 22.5bn in 1989 and headline inflation accelerated to double figures during 1990. The authorities, and in particular Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, are anxious to prevent a recurrence. But old habits die hard. Britain has continued to run a current account deficit throughout the recession. In spite of the devaluation in September 1992, the deficit seems to be widening - exporters have exploited the lower pound by increasing prices rather than sales, while continental European companies, faced with sluggish domestic economies, are exporting to UK consumers. Another traditional UK problem is inflation. Here the news is rather better; annual underlying inflation fell to 2.4 per cent in March, in the lower half of the government's target range. Many commentators believe that the UK economy is still operating well below capacity; this so-called 'output gap' means that GDP can continue to grow for some time without inflationary pressures emerging. However, the government is handicapped by past policy failures. After the ignominy of sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992, the government has had to work hard to restore its credibility in the financial markets, necessitating a much more prominent role for the Bank. Experience has made financial markets reluctant to believe that Britain can control inflation. An adverse reaction to the last base rate cut, in February, may have made the Bank even more cautious about future reductions, especially while it is possible to find some indicators, such as this week's average earnings figures, which point to inflationary pressures. To avoid Britain's old trade and inflationary problems, a sustained recovery may require a shift from personal consumption, at present at a record high as a proportion of GDP, towards investment. Unfortunately for the government, cutting consumption, through taxes or low wage growth, is unlikely to create a feel-good factor among voters.</p>

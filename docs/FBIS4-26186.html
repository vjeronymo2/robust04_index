			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap LAM] </F>   [Text] Beijing and Sichuan are locked in disagreement over  the outflow of migrant labour from the country's most populous  province.    Sichuan, which has more than 100 million people and China's  largest number of superfluous farm labourers has come under  criticism from Beijing and other provinces for failing to curb  the outward movement of migrant workers. But the leadership of  the province, headed by maverick Governor Xiao Yang, has  protested that stopping the migration would harm the local  economy.    In a recent internal meeting, Mr Xiao defended the practice  of the superfluous farm hands looking for work, mainly in the  rich coastal provinces.    "During harvests and other busy times, the rural work hands  stay in the fields," Mr Xiao said.    "In slack seasons, they go outside the province and look for  work. They provide cheap labour for the richer provinces and  remit their earnings back home. This is a sound economic  principle for labour management."    Other Sichuan cadres have also complained that they lack the  funds to provide social insurance or unemployment benefits for  extra rural labour.    Beijing and the coastal provinces, however, have put  pressure  on the Sichuan Government to at least set a quota on the number  of its "exports" of migrant labour.    It is understood that Guangdong as well as some of its more  prosperous cities, including Guangzhou and Shenzhen, have agreed  to make financial contributions to Sichuan in exchange for an  end to unwanted Sichuanese labourers.    Chinese sources said no agreement had been reached between  Sichuan and Beijing on the "quota" to be set or the  "compensation" the province would get in return. Meanwhile,  sources said Beijing was working on a nationwide strategy to  control the flow of population. This follows the de facto  breakdown of the old system of residency permits, where  government permission was required for rural people to live and  work in the cities.    Employers, including managers in state factories in  prosperous coastal cities like Shenzhen, however, are often  reluctant to expel "underground" labourers from other provinces  because they are a source of cheap labour.</p>

In a routine check at Sokolac heliport, it was found that in  addition to a Muslim delegation, UNPROFOR was attempting to  transport a large number of packages containing electronic  equipment, uncleared documents, and a huge quantity of foreign  currency from Sarajevo to Gorazde.    When a control team of the army of the Srpska republic  insisted on continuing a thorough search, a member of the Muslim  delegation, Edib Bukvic, deputy prime minister in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina government, opposed it. He decided that the  delegation should not continue its journey. The two UN  helicopters then returned safely to Sarajevo.    The general staff communique says that UNPROFOR had asked  for  permission from the general staff for the Muslim delegation and  the chairman of the Srpska republic commission for POW exchange  to be flown by helicopter to Gorazde. It was explained that  this was a humanitarian mission that was necessary for the  speedier resolution of the POW problem.    The flight was not permitted at first for security reasons,  and the UNPROFOR command was advised to recommend that the  delegation travel by land. Permission was nevertheless granted  after the UNPROFOR command had asked the president of the Srpska  republic and after both the Muslim side and UNPROFOR had given  firm guarantees about the safety of the flight over the  separation lines.    The general staff says that it had been precisely set out  that the helicopters could only transport members of the  delegation with their personal belongings and lists of POW's.  When the helicopters arrived in Sokolac the chairman of the  state commission of the Srpska republic was not to be found in  either helicopter.</p>

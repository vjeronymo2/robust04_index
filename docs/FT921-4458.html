			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Arts: Some Jam Tomorrow/Once Upon a Song - Arts Theatre/King's Head, Islington Two of London's most amiable small theatres have just launched two new and inept musicals. But the one at the Arts, Some Jam Tomorrow by Neil Innes, has a bonhomie and an openheartedness that are not always resistible - whereas at the King's Head the wall-to-wall cliches of Anthony Newley's Once upon a Song are made leaden by their unvarying predictability and, seeping up through that, by a certain whinging meanness. Some Jam Tomorrow is actually by far the less ept. On purpose. The title comes from Lewis Carroll's Alice books; and Neil Innes, who is his own main performer, tries to combine Wonderland with Nowadays. Nothing about the show is slick, and half the time we are being nudged to laugh at its crummy daftness. Innes puts a red nose on to sing 'I'm an Urban Spaceman' or goes all country-and-western to sing 'I've Got my Hand up the Skirt of Mother Nature.' The more self-consciously silly, the duller. When, however, Innes dislocates his jaw in a country cadenza, he shows real comic talent. He switches styles easily. Talking, he sounds like Tony Hancock; singing, he moves between the idioms of Country, Lennon-McCartney, Elton John, French crooner ('croon-aire') and more. He is actually less close to Alice than he is to pantomime. He brings a man up onstage to honk a car-horn during a song, he throws sweets, he keeps changing costume and he makes the audience join in. Never have I known more audience participation. It was positively therapeutic. At the ends of the lines of one song we cried 'Balls]', 'Zoomzoomzoom]' and 'Bong]' (if we were male) or 'Cuckoo]' (female). I thought we had reached our climax when we all joined in blowing raspberries as loudly as we could, but I was wrong. Later, after we had all sung along in 'We are the Slaves of Freedom,' he called out 'Give me an S]' 'S]' we yelled. 'Give me an O]' Then D. Then O, F and F. 'What does that spell?' he urged. So we told him. And he took the point to heart and slunk offstage. Once upon a Song is altogether more crafted, neat and stale. All-singing, with no linking dialogue, it tells the story of Every Nuclear Family. The Father (Newley himself) and The Mother (Diane Langton) have The Daughter (Natalie Wright) and The Son (Kristopher Milnes the night I went; the role is double-cast), but have the usual marital problems. Father leaves, everyone mopes, Father comes back. Everything is generalised; nothing is particular - save that the family keep presenting themselves as song-and-dance show-people. When Newley sings 'I'm just a Middle-aged Silent-majority On-the-dole Rock-n-roll Star,' he opens a vein of truth and you blush for him. There is not a fresh lyric or line in the show. Langton has a welcome vocal power, and young Milnes has talent. Wright overdoes the starry-eyed fervour that won her the title role in (remember?) Bernadette (goodness]). Newley himself, a mannered and limited performer, likes to sing with slouched posture, his shoulders lopsided and hunched and his eyes shut. His voice has a tremolo so heavy that at times it is a slow trill covering the span of a minor third. His hand gestures, though, are something else; they kept reminding me of Dusty Springfield. He has a whole lexicon of them, and nary a one is spontaneous.</p>

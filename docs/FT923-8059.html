			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Quality of water is not cheap: The industry could have to spend up to Pounds 60bn to meet EC rules. But who should foot the bill? Cleaner water means much higher water bills. That is the unpalatable logic which Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water industry watchdog, wants to drive home with his report The Cost of Quality, published today. Mr Byatt, who has won a reputation as a confrontational regulator, will give the the first formal estimates of how much it will cost the 39 water companies of England and Wales to meet new European Community environmental rules. He will also say how much customers' bills might rise between 1995 and 2000 as a result. The report, known as the Strategic Assessment, is expected to give a range of figures for capital spending, from the minimum needed to meet regulations up to the 'pure green' standards favoured by environmental groups. Its projections are likely to be controversial on several fronts. First, it will show that new environmental rules have pushed the industry's capital spending obligations far above the Pounds 28bn estimated in December 1989, when the 10 large water and sewerage companies of England and Wales were privatised. Second, the increase will reopen the question of who should foot the bill - shareholder or customer. Customers' bills, already set to rise by 60 per cent above the level of inflation during the 1990s, could rise even more steeply. That will add to the row about whether the Scottish water industry should be privatised, already set to be one of this autumn's political battlegrounds. Third, Ofwat wants water companies to spend the next six months asking customers how much they are prepared to pay for higher water quality. But users may find the choice between quality and price perplexing and worrying, although most customer complaints to Ofwat are now about high bills. In the words of one water company's finance director: 'If you suggest lower water standards to most people they back away as if you are handing them a glass of filthy poison.' The degree to which Ofwat's report stirs up debate will depend on the figures it gives for water companies' investment obligations because of new EC environmental rules. The government's original estimate of Pounds 28bn struck three years ago was made up of the cost of meeting EC directives on drinking water and beaches, plus some 'catching-up' after a decade of under-investment. The 29 small water supply companies which remain in state hands had to pick up Pounds 4bn of the burden, but the other Pounds 24bn was to be borne by the 10 public water and sewerage companies, which planned to spread it evenly throughout the 1990s. However, several large water companies now estimate that the total investment programme, if all directives are interpreted as stringently as possible, could total some Pounds 60bn, double the original figure. The most expensive new obligation since privatisation is the EC directive on municipal waste water. Companies have to begin to treat more thoroughly the water and sewage they discharge into rivers and the sea. But the alternatives to present methods - such as building incinerators - are expensive. The Water Services Association, which represents the 10 public companies, suggests that complying with the directive could cost Pounds 10bn. Individually, the companies put the cost to the industry at anything from Pounds 8bn to Pounds 15bn. One reason for the wide range is that the exact interpretation of the directive by UK regulators is not yet clear, and companies hope the Ofwat report will help clarify the choices. Since privatisation, the Department of the Environment has also accelerated the clean-up of beaches, following the European Commission's threat of court action. Several water companies estimate this could add several billion pounds of spending. They also estimate that it could cost Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn more than originally expected to meet the existing EC directive on removal of pesticides from drinking water. This month's report by the Drinking Water Inspectorate of England and Wales showed an apparent slight increase in the level of pesticides, but was unable to determine whether the increase was real or was due to a change in sampling techniques. A World Health Organisation report later this year on acceptable levels of lead could also add Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn pounds to spending, the companies say. Almost all lead present in drinking water comes from the pipes connecting the customer's house to the mains, not from mains water itself. But replacing those supply pipes would be an expensive and lengthy process. The cost of fitting water meters to households is a further unknown; estimates range from Pounds 500m to Pounds 3bn if most of the country was covered. Both Mr Byatt and Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, have thrown their support behind some metering as one of several measures to help curb the growth in demand for water. But even with meters, the south-eastern water companies still foresee a water shortage, which could force them to build reservoirs. The cost could be Pounds 2bn to Pounds 5bn, City observers estimate. Ofwat will do both the water industry and customers a great service by turning its spotlight on these costs, which have been the subject of intense debate in the UK since privatisation. Of particular importance will be the regulator's views on the minimum investment needed to meet quality standards. Several water companies have argued that little of the total is discretionary. However, City observers, who suggest that it is in the water companies' interest to warn of the high cost, argue that the inescapable new investment is probably as low as Pounds 10bn to Pounds 15bn. They point out that much of the spending can be postponed until the next century, beyond the five-year window of Ofwat's projections. What do the new investment burdens mean for customers' bills? This is the section of Ofwat's report that will provoke the most intense debate. Share prices of the water companies have been sliding in the past week on City fears that Mr Byatt may suggest that profits and dividends take some of the burden off water bills. On the crudest calculations, if all the impact were passed through to customers, then the rise in bills would be steep. Consumer groups fear that bills could rise even more than the estimate made at the time of privatisation - 60 per cent above the rate of inflation. However, the water companies emphasise that the relationship between capital spending and customers' bills is complex. The eventual rise in bills depends acutely on the rate of return on investment, the choice of debt or equity for funding, and the assumptions made about possible gains in efficiency. The most sensitive of those issues, from the companies' point of view, is whether Ofwat allows them to earn as high a rate of return on their new investment as they have on past projects. They are worried that Mr Byatt would want to see a lower figure for future investment. The water companies will also want to establish quickly whether the investment can be funded by debt, or whether they will have to raise new equity on the stock market. A precise estimate of the extra spending between 1995 and 2000 is critical, as this is the period when the public companies will be under greatest financial strain. On present plans, City stockbrokers predict that the companies will have debt-to-equity ratios of about 50 per cent at the worst point, and that interest charges will eat up about a quarter of operating profits. Shareholders are unlikely to welcome a worsening of those ratios. Mr Byatt's comments on these points will give a clue to his current thinking on the thorny issue of how profitable the water companies should be. The Strategic Assessment is one of the few formal statements that Ofwat will make before the Periodic Review in 1994, when it will review the companies' pricing structure. At privatisation it was agreed that water prices would rise each year by the retail price index plus a factor K, where each company was alloted a different K. Ofwat and the water companies tangled last year year over the issue of future levels of K, when Ofwat questioned in a consultation paper whether profitability was too high. The issue has resurfaced in the past month with the failure of British Gas and its regulator Ofgas to agree acceptable levels of return. Questions of profitability and the level of water bills will also come under intense scrutiny this autumn when the Scottish Office is due to announce whether the Scottish water industry should be privatised. Mr Tom Clarke, shadow Scottish secretary, says that in his view 'there is no doubt bills will soar' under privatisation, and the Scottish TUC has pledged to fight the proposals 'tooth and nail'. Equipped with today's report, the water companies will have a further chance to debate these points with Ofwat. However, Mr Byatt also wants them to spend the next six months turning Ofwat's national projections into local figures, and asking their customers what level of service they want. That is admirable in principle, but could prove tricky in practice. The water companies have long argued that many of the present standards are far higher than those needed to protect health. They have some basis for their claim that parts of the 1980 EC drinking water directive were passed in a wave of environmental enthusiasm with little regard to the costs. But as the directive is already in force and much of the investment has been made, the scope for customer choice on that and many other topics may be limited. Mr Colin Skellett, group managing director of Wessex Water, said: 'There needs to be a debate, but customer choice is only at the margin.' The real choice may lie not with customers but with the Department of the Environment, the National Rivers Authority and the Ministry of Agriculture, Farms and Fisheries when they decide how stringently to interpret the small print of the EC waste-water directive. In bringing the full cost of environmental rules into the open, Mr Byatt's report may also discourage new regulations from being set without considering the impact on the customer. If it does that, it will have performed a public service. It will also be welcomed by the City if it removes some of the uncertainty hanging over the companies. But if its conclusion is that bills are set to rise even more steeply, it is likely to inflame the wider debate about the water companies' profitability and about the benefits of privatisation - a debate that is a long way from being settled.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MAXIMUM INCREASE IN INVESTMENT NEEDED TO MEET ENVIRONMENTAL RULES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds 8bn-15bn extra spending to meet the new EC municipal waste water directive Pounds 1bn-2bn on accelerating the clean-up of beaches Pounds 2bn-3bn to meet the existing directive on pesticides in drinking water Up to Pounds 3bn to install water meters Pounds 3bn to remove lead from drinking water, requiring replacement of some supply pipes - depends on World Health Organisation report later this year Pounds 2bn-5bn for new reservoirs to alleviate drought in south-east  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

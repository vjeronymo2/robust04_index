			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The outside world views the region of Central Europe  through the prism of Slovak-Hungarian relations, Slovak Foreign  Minister Eduard Kukan told Ildiko Nagy, our correspondent in  Bratislava.    [Nagy] For Slovakia, its relationships with the Czech  Republic and Hungary are most important in the Central European  region, at present. The latter is so in spite of the fact that  it is not as we would like it to be, Eduard Kukan, Slovak  foreign minister, told a Hungarian radio correspondent today.  Then he continued as follows:    [Kukan, in Slovak, fading into Nagy's report in Hungarian]  The outside world views this region in which we live, Central  Europe, through the prism of Slovak-Hungarian relations. It is  in the interest of the international organizations--and the  minister was convinced of this as UN ambassador--to stabilize  this relationship, so that the number of sources of tension in  the world does not increase, so that this region does not  constitute a serious problem for the international organizations.    The current Slovak Government observed with pleasure that  its  first statements, by which it would like primarily to encourage  the Hungarian side to start a dialogue, were received favorably  by its Hungarian counterparts, the foreign minister said.    To my question of whether the start of a dialogue could take  place in April, Kukan replied that no decision had been reached  on this yet, but a relationship ought to be developed between  the two neighboring countries, regardless of the governments  that happen to be in power. The Hungarian elections are the  country's internal affair, and the people have the right to  decide what kind of government they want.    The Slovak Government, regardless of what Hungary's new  leadership will be like, would like to shape the two countries'  relationship so that this leads to a solution of the existing  questions, Kukan told the correspondent of Hungarian radio.</p>

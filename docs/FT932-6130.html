			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Are the rich more trouble than they are worth? - Love them or hate them, we need our millionaires and billionaires FOR THOSE who enjoy a little vulgarity, the behaviour of the rich in the 1990s is a marked disappointment. What a contrast with the 1980s when, in the words of Ronald Reagan's first budget director David Stockman, 'the hogs were really feeding.' It wasn't just the hogs. The Trumps were trumping, the Milkens milking, the Goldsmiths greenmailing and Thatcher's entrepreneurial children were jumping joyfully from the play pen. Even at this short distance the 1980s look the finest years for would-be nouveaux riches since the forebears of many of today's ducal families grew fat on the dissolution of the monasteries. The billionaires and millionaires who are making the headlines in the 1990s are a notably more austere bunch. George Soros, the high-minded philosopher-speculator who found the fault lines in the European exchange rate mechanism and recycled the British taxpayer's money to Bosnian Moslems and needy Hungarians; Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft and richest bachelor in the US, whose recent decision to marry one of his managers shows no sign of transforming him from a computer-world frog into glamour-world prince; David Sainsbury, one-time backer of Britain's Social Democratic Party, charitable donor and eponymous chairman of the food retailing group that remains one of Britain's most remorseless money-making machines. The tricoteuses of the French Revolution - who knitted as the tumbrils rolled - would scarcely have known what to make of them. The new austere tendency, if that is what it is, has nothing to do with any wave of popular feeling against the rich. If anything, the extraordinary feature of the past dozen years has been the lack of any serious backlash on the part of the world's underdogs, despite the failure of First World wealth to trickle to the Third. Numerous poor countries have suffered a protracted decline in the price of the commodity exports on which their economies depended. And within individual countries, notably in Latin America, the trickle down theory of economics failed to work because so much of the money trickled out in capital flight, as the rich tried to escape the depredations of incompetent or corrupt politicians. Yet the political response to impoverishment has increasingly been to adopt the prevailing ideology of the developed world: the market. The result in Latin America, once the home of dependency theory and the economics of despair, has been that capital, both native and foreign, has trickled back to finance an unprecedented experiment in liberal economics. Meantime the dragon economies of Asia have reasserted the merits of self-help in spectacular style. Their millionaires are busily exporting a uniquely potent brand of workaholic materialism to the ramshackle economy of China. In the developed - and more especially the English-speaking - world, the present sober condition of the rich is no more than a natural evolution from the ideological 1980s. The Reagan-Thatcher years delivered lower marginal tax rates, financial liberalisation, balance of payment deficits and buoyant stock markets. For the first time in recent memory the political culture turned pro-business. And in this frothy, consumption-led cycle, the service industries - finance, advertising, entertainment, trophy wives - boomed as never before. Bejewelled dames apart, these were not commodity-intensive pursuits. And those manufacturing industries that did flourish in the 1980s, such as computing, relied not on expensive commodities like metals, but on a cheap form of sand called silicon. Hence the poor performance of the less developed countries in the prolonged recovery of the 1980s. But the rich of the developed world are now infected by the curse of the Third World nations: since economic activity was financed in the previous decade by unprecedented resort to borrowing, much of the First World has suffered a debt-induced recession. The new millionaires have thus been culled not by sans culottes, but by the laws of financial gravity; and the extent of their financial and ethical misdeeds, rather than the nature and substance of their particular business, has been the chief determinant of their fate. Witness how printer and publisher Robert Maxwell, scourge of the widows and orphans, succumbed to the grim reaper; Michael Milken of junk bond fame to the zealous prosecutor; Asil Nadir of the fruit-to-fraud conglomerate Polly Peck to the administrative receiver, if not to the courts. Meanwhile, entertainment figures such as Andrew Lloyd Webber, Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney, representatives of one of the frothiest of all service industries, are alive, and well and very rich. The attrition has been worst in property, an industry that has a peculiar knack of exposing the banking fraternity's propensity for collective aberration. For those of envious disposition, one of the most satisfying falls from grace has been that of US real estate man Donald Trump. He it was who, in a moment of intense hubris, wrote an improving tract called The Art of the Deal. The 1990s demonstrated that the only artistry in his balance sheet was pure trompe l'oeil. Others whose art proved similarly insubstantial were the Reichmann brothers of Canada, Godfrey Bradman and Trevor Osborne in the UK and the frenetic Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond. Bond, like US junk bond financier Michael Milken and arbitrageur Ivan Boesky, found that one of the squares on the Monopoly board said 'Go To Jail.' Gerald Ronson, the property man jailed for his role in the share scandal surrounding the Guinness takeover of Distillers, was another to make that discovery. Yet so persuasive is Ronson in dealing with his bankers that he has achieved the unique distinction of being the first man to combine de facto bankruptcy with millionaire status. His recently agreed pay package, which includes an annual salary of Pounds 500,000 indexed against inflation, is estimated to be worth more than Pounds 4.4m over five years - an astonishing reward for one who brought one of the world's biggest private companies to its knees, even though he built it originally. At least Ronson's outfit is a private concern. The quickest path to riches in recent years has been for the directors of quoted companies to wreck the business after taking the elementary precaution of demanding the longest possible contract. This ensures hefty compensation for loss of office at the shareholders' expense. Many who have failed to wreck their companies have been equally shameless in paying themselves risk-free fortunes regardless of performance. Still more have milked the pension fund by manipulating pre-retirement salaries. This exploitation of slack accountability in the Anglo-Saxon financial system is a gravy train that rolls on regardless of recession. Why on earth do institutional shareholders, in effect the legal owners of the corporate sector, allow it to continue? The biggest loser of recent years has been Old Money. According to an index compiled by the agents Savills, the value of agricultural land at the end of last year had fallen in real terms to a mere 37 per cent of its value at the start of the 1980s. As Savills' Bertie Ross points out, there have been off-sets against this fall in values, such as big productivity improvements in farming and surpluses from planning gains on development land. But for the really big landlords with holdings in commercial property as well, there has been a double bind. While equities have generated unprecedentedly high returns, commercial property has been one of the worst performing investment categories of the past dozen years. Investment Property Databank's index indicates that the capital value of commercial property has fallen by more than 30 per cent in real terms since 1980. Since many of the older aristocratic estates are averse to borrowing, the attrition is long term and will be felt mainly when property is passed from one generation to another. Yet for Queen Elizabeth II, the pain is more immediate, in that any capital loss will be compounded by her new settlement with the tax man - conscience money, in the eyes of the tabloid press, for the colourful ways of the younger members of her family. For less regal landed estates, an unexpected twist has come from John Major's government, in the shape of legislation to enfranchise leaseholders. This assault on property rights gives new meaning to Keynes's phrase about the euthanasia of the rentier. It has also caused the Duke of Westminster, Britain's biggest landowner after the Queen, to resign from the Tory party in protest. But does anyone care much any more when the highest in the land discover that they are downwardly mobile? What, come to that, is the point of the rich? Are they really doing their stuff? The bien pensants of the 18th century had no difficulty with these questions. As Dr Johnson put it: 'You cannot spend money in luxury without doing good to the poor. Nay, you do more good to them by spending it in luxury than by giving it; for by spending it in luxury you make them exert industry, whereas by giving it you keep them idle.' Unfortunately (if you share the Johnsonian point of view) the spending power of the rich is too small, nowadays, to offset the rise in the savings of the masses that brought about the recession. From an economic point of view, the very rich are not very relevant. A more political justification comes from those who trumpet the merits of maintaining a class of people who are rich enough to stand up to the powerful and to stand down on matters of principle. An unlikely apologist of this ilk was the post-war Labour leader Clement Attlee. It was he who said of the Cecil dynasty in the Tory party: 'Cecils don't give a damn, and that makes a lot of difference.' Certainly it is striking that the only high-profile, voluntary departures from ministerial office in recent years in Britain have not come from those like Major or Norman Lamont who made the biggest mistakes, but from those who made or inherited the most money. Michael Heseltine could well afford, in a purely financial sense, to resign over the Westland saga; and former defence minister Alan Clark could equally afford to resign over . . . no one is quite sure what. Yet Heseltine all too transparently does care about his own advancement in politics, which is presumably the mark of new money. Clark, in contrast, appears not to care about high office, but has left less of a mark on politics than on the lives of those who were acquitted in the Matrix-Churchill arms-for-Iraq affair, where his candour about Whitehall duplicity prevented serious injustice. For a better example of what a rich maverick can do in politics, one has to look to the US and to Ross Perot, that peculiarly American version of the Socratic gadfly. But while Perot unquestionably enlivened last year's presidential election and continues to stir the debate on the US budget deficit, he holds no office and smacks too much of the quack to bear comparison with the Cecils. Even then, the striking thing about the last politically influential Cecil, the fifth Marquess of Salisbury, was the ineffectiveness of his principled departure from politics. He bowed out after attacking the colonial secretary, Iain MacLeod, for his conduct of Britain's retreat from empire. Yet the resulting battle in the Tory party petered out without causing lasting damage or securing political change. History's verdict would seem to favour the meritocrat rather than the aristocrat on both the point at issue and MacLeod's subsequent career, which took him to the cabinet as a sadly short-lived chancellor of the exchequer. That leaves a more subtle and provocative case for the rich, advanced by the libertarian philosopher Friedrich Hayek. Hayek argued not only that people of independent means are essential for the preservation of competitive enterprise, but that the rich are even more valuable when pursuing aims that bring no material return. In a majoritarian democracy, he argued, the state simply cannot provide sufficient diversity of patronage in arts, education, politics, morals and religion. There would even, he adds, be a strong case for selecting at random one in 1,000 and endowing them with fortunes to dispose of at whim; but since inheritance is already random, and those who inherit wealth less prone to the grosser pleasures than the newly rich, inheritance will do very nicely instead. For Hayek, such a system justifies itself even if a mere handful of these inheritors spends in a beneficial manner, because waste, however shocking, is the price of freedom. And measured by this undemanding criterion, the present-day rich are clearly doing a splendid job. In less fiscally stressful times the British government might have put up the money for the National Gallery's Sainsbury wing. But it would surely have had misgivings about the superb Saatchi gallery in St John's Wood, which embraces the kind of contemporary art that can sometimes embarrass government ministers. Nor would any government be likely to put the taxpayers' money into prizes for religious research, as the octogenarian fund manager Sir John Templeton has done. The pluralist's response might be that the rich are not as diverse, in their tastes, as they might be; and that Hayek underestimates the diversity of the wonderfully imperfect democratic process. Ken Livingstone's Greater London Council might not have been every libertarian philosopher's ideal - though Livingstone is closer to the anarchist than the authoritarian wing of the Labour Party - but it backed far wilder ventures, artistic and otherwise, in its time, than most private millionaire patrons would wish to contemplate. Even a quango like the Arts Council can be astonishingly and quirkily creative  - or destructive - under the direction of such lords as Keynes, Goodman or Rees-Mogg. That said, in a world marked by structural budget deficits, the 19th century campaigners who were able, thanks to a sufficiency, to abolish slavery, reform the prisons and bring humanity to the treatment of the insane, are almost certainly due for a late 20th century renaissance. Perhaps, also, as university funding is squeezed, are the gentlemen scholars like Darwin, de Tocqueville or Henry Adams, and the recipients of patronage like Marx. Love them or hate them, millionaires are the only people in the straightened 1990s who can fill many of the intellectual, cultural and social gaps left by a state that is in obligatory retreat. The rich, of necessity, are always with us.</p>

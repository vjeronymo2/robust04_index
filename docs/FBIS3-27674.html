It was learned that 26-year old Liu Hui was formally a sales  manager of a company in Hubei's Huangshi city. In March 1992,  he illegally left the country and was recruited by a foreign  branch of the military intelligence bureau of Taiwan's KMT. He  received espionage training and operational funds. In August  the same year, he was sent by the military intelligence bureau  of Taiwan's KMT back to the mainland and laid low under the  cover of conducting business. After returning to Hubei, Liu Hui  went to Wuhan, Huangshi, and other places to incite defection  and develop a spy network. He attempted to infiltrate our key  departments. Meanwhile, he also sent intelligence related to  our country's secrets to Taiwan's espionage organization.    Liu Hui candidly confessed his espionage activities after  being arrested in accordance with the law. The case is being  investigated and handled.</p>

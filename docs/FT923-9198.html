			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Reagan free of Iran-Contra investigation FORMER President Ronald Reagan is no longer a target in the criminal investigation being conducted into the Iran-Contra affair. His lawyer said yesterday he had received a letter from Mr Lawrence Walsh, the special prosecutor, stating he was now regarded only as a witness, not a subject, in the probe. Mr Walsh has said other indictments against senior figures in the Reagan administration might be brought by the end of the summer. So far only Mr Caspar Weinberger, the former defence secretary, has been charged.</p>

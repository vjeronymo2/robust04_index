			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / World Trade News: UK seeks to reverse import curbs on toys The Department of Trade and Industry has taken the EU Council of Ministers to the European Court of Justice in an attempt to annul the Council's decision earlier this year to place stringent quotas on imports of teddy bears and other toys from China. The DTI's legal action follows complaints by European toy importers that quotas are severely damaging business. Though Britain opposed the decision to impose the curbs, it was outvoted by 11 to 1. The European Commission, which drew up the original quota proposals, said it was 'surprised' by the legal action, because ways were already being sought in Brussels to soften the impact of the curbs on the European toy industry. EU member governments regularly challenge Council decisions in the court after they have been overruled. But legal experts said the DTI action was most unusual because it did not allege that the Council had misused its treaty powers. Instead, the DTI argues that the Council 'failed to exercise discretion properly' by ignoring objections from European toy manufacturers. It also says an EU-wide quota was unnecessary, because only Spain had demanded protection against toy imports from China. Toy Manufacturers of Europe, the main industry association, said the quotas would cut EU toy imports from China this year by about Ecu 1.8bn at manufacturers' selling prices to half the level forecast before they were imposed in February. It said that at least 500 jobs would be lost in Europe and that toy manufacturers, many of whom sourced products and components in China, would suffer falls in sales and profits.</p>

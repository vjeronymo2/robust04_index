			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE OF HUD AND ITS PROGRAMS  </P> <P> As the director of a social service agency that has worked closely and  successfully with the Orange County Housing and Community Development  Department for 15 years, I am surprised and troubled by your article on HUD in  Orange County.  </P> <P> Orange Children &amp; Parents Together, Inc. provides survival services for 245  deprived children and their families.  </P> <P> Thanks to the Board of Supervisors, Bob Pusavat and the HCD staff, OCPT has  buildings in which to house its programs, a brand new Child Care Center and  funds for critical needs that include: a new roof for one of the Head Start  structures; a handicap ramp for special needs children; and a myriad of other  essentials for providing a safe and sanitary environment for young children.  </P> <P> Through it all, the Orange County HCD staff provided professional assistance  and monitoring of the actual projects. They also audited our books for  expenditures related to HUD and made sure we had the necessary documentation.  </P> <P> During my 15 years as director of OCPT I have seen the El Modena community  transformed by HUD projects that provided: curbs and gutters, street lights,  resurfacing of badly rutted streets, sidewalks put in for safe passage and  renovated housing. I participate in the HCD community meetings where El Modena  residents are able to communicate their needs to the HCD staff, the most recent  of which resulted in low-cost housing projects for families and seniors.  </P> <P> For a truer picture of the Orange County Housing and Community Development  Department, perhaps you should interview those of us who have long benefited  from Orange County HCD projects.  </P> <P> ELECTRA ADAMS, Director  </P> <P> Orange Children &amp; Parents Together Inc.  </P></p>

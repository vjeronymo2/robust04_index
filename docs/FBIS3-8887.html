The French  Constitution did not make it possible for de Gaulle to be  elected directly by the citizens, and he thus proposed, acting  in contravention of the Constitution, that he be granted this  right in a referendum. Otherwise, he would step down. He was  accorded this right in a referendum and this [the direct  election of the French president] is still valid. This means  that a referendum can go beyond the constitutional framework and  that even questions can be asked in it that are not quite in  conformity with the Constitution. This is the case because a  referendum is the most democratic form of expression. The  conclusions of an all-popular vote are generally valid and  respected everywhere, and, because this referendum [initiated by  the HZDS] is the first ever in this state, it deserves support  and not to make voters disgusted.</p>

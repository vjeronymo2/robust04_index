Hideaki Kumano, vice minister at the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI), was referring to an  accord on industrial cooperation between the two countries for  increased foreign access to the Japanese semiconductor market.  The agreement was reached during a two-day regular meeting in  Hawaii that ended Wednesday.    Japan agreed to a U.S. request for Tokyo's efforts to help  expand use of U.S.-made microchips by Japan's automobile,  telecommunications and game equipment sectors.    The Japanese Government is prepared to encourage these  industrial sectors to step up purchases of U.S. semiconductors,  Kumano told a press conference. But he added that does not  represent "any government guarantee" that the foreign share of  Japan's market will stay above the benchmark 20 percent.    Kumano noted that the government does not ensure any results  on ongoing voluntary efforts within the auto industry to expand  purchases of U.S.-made auto parts and automobiles.    "It is impossible for the government to ensure results  regarding private-sector matters," he said.    On Japan's restraints on car exports to the U.S., Kumano  said  MITI has yet to decide if it will extend the practice for fiscal  1994 starting in April. U.S. officials have said there is no  need for Japan to continue the restraints.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Bellwinch cuts losses to Pounds 98,000 Bellwinch, the Wembley-based builder which finalised its reconstruction in January, reduced pre-tax losses to Pounds 98,000 in the year to June 30. The company said the five-month delay meant that interest costs of Pounds 595,000 (Pounds 2.68m) depressed the final result, which compared with a Pounds 15m deficit last time. A tax credit of Pounds 113,000 resulted in a net profit of Pounds 15,000 this time. The exceptional item of Pounds 14,000 (Pounds 11.8m) reflects the over-run on the reconstruction costs.</p>

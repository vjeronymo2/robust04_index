			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / The ERM Crisis: Ministers back current parities - Communique EC finance ministers and central bank governors issued the following statement after their meeting in Brussels: 'THE ministers and central bank governors of the member states of the EC have decided to widen temporarily the obligatory marginal intervention thresholds of the participants in the ERM to plus or minus 15 per cent around the bilateral central rates. This measure of limited duration is in response to speculative movements which are exceptional in amount as well as in nature. Indeed, having regard to the fundamental economic situation of the member states participating in the system, the current parity grid is fully justified. The ministers and governors therefore reaffirm support for the current parities and are confident that the market rates will soon approach these parities once again. The monetary authorities of the member states will continue to direct their monetary policy towards the aim of price stability. All the member states reaffirm their determination to put the treaty on European union into operation as soon as its ratification is complete, including the evaluation procedure which according to article 109E must take place before January 1 1994, the start of stage two. Moreover, they reaffirm their support for the procedures and criteria laid down in the treaty with respect to the attainment of a sufficient degree of convergence in order to allow the realisation of economic and monetary union. The new compulsory intervention rates will be communicated by the monetary authorities in time for the opening of foreign exchange markets on August 2.'</p>

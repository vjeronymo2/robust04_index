			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MARTHA STEWART MUM ON CHARITY  </P> <P> Home writer Martha Stewart has angered some in her hometown for refusing to  disclose how much she raised for charity through a benefit decorator show  house.  </P> <P> The show house was open for 20 days in May to benefit the Hole in the Wall Gang  Camp Fund, a charity for seriously ill children and their families founded by  Stewart's Westport neighbor, Paul Newman.  </P> <P> The show house and other events raised $210,000 for the charity, Stewart told  The Advocate of Stamford. But she won't say how much was raised specifically  through the house.  </P> <P> About 9,000 people visited the house for $15 each, which would make the gross  proceeds $135,000. Stewart said the house turned a profit for the camp, but  that volunteers and visitors do not have a right to know what it is.  </P> <P> "I don't think we should give the dollar amount," Stewart said. "They all got  $15 worth of information out of that house. Think of it this way: It's like  going to the movies."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Transcript of an interview with Budapest Metropolitan Mayor </F> Gabor Demszky by Gyorgy Nej on a 168 ORA radio program; date not  given: "Bargaining and a Hairsbreadth: Party Television Is Not  Good Television"]    [Text] Individual applicants will soon be able to  know whether it was worth their while to queue up for frequency  allocations, and then the state's monopoly of the [electronic]  media will essentially have ceased in Hungary. Among the  applicants in the queue we find also the metropolitan  administration's television station. According to the intentions  of its founders, it will have also a public-service role, but  after a time it is to become self-supporting. Gyorgy Nej  interviewed Metropolitan Mayor Gabor Demszky about the plans for  the TV station and, naturally, about related media matters as  well.    [Nej] The metropolis [Budapest Metropolitan Council] has  filed an application for a frequency allocation. But recently  the newspapers reported that the metropolis has received a  temporary license for trial operation, valid for three days. Are  we dealing with two separate matters, or do the two items  pertain to one and the same thing?    [Demszky] The issue is the same in both cases. The  metropolis  has formed a broadcasting corporation, with an initial capital  of 100 million forints. The metropolis is the principal  shareholder, with 99 percent of the equity, but a foundation is  also a shareholder. The foundation's board of trustees comprises  the metropolitan clerk and the directors of the metropolitan  public utilities. The foundation was established in the late  1980's and is called Television Broadcasting for Budapest. The  foundation and the broadcasting corporations have filed separate  applications for frequency allocations. A combination of  land-based television broadcasting and cable TV is involved in  the first instance; and in the second instance, an opportunity  for direct reception, to which every resident who owns a TV set  and an ordinary TV antenna will be able to tune in. With the  judging of the applications and the allocation of frequencies,  the state's monopoly of the electronic media will essentially  cease. I think it is also very much in the government's interest  that henceforth nobody be ever able to say that in Hungary there  is only government-operated television, financed and controlled  by the state.  <H5>  A Media Charter From Europe? </H5>   [Nej] Yet how is it possible that the five-member licensing  committee consists exclusively of persons whom the government  has somehow placed in office? They include the prefect of  Budapest with the rank of state secretary; a close associate of  the late Jozsef Antall; a deputy state secretary; a jurist from  the Ministry of Justice; and someone else appointed to similar  office.    [Demszky] As an applicant, it would not be in my interest to  analyze the government's considerations that have led to this  situation. There are jurists on the committee, probably because  of the argument that this is a legal question that must be  decided. Of course, this is merely my assumption. Obviously,  however, you should be putting this question not to me but to  those who appointed the members of the committee. And you should  ask also the committee members as to why specifically they have  been chosen. But I believe that all this goes far beyond the  committee's competence and jurisdiction, which is actually the  issue here.    Thus when I seek government considerations of greater  importance and say that this is in the government's interest, I  do so because, on the one hand, I am familiar with the  international responses to the clashes in Hungary's media war,  and to the government's actions in this matter. And on the other  hand, because I attended the Strasbourg Conference sponsored by  the Council of Europe and the European Union, where this  question was on the agenda. The state of the media in the  countries of East and Central Europe was discussed, on the basis  of a report that presented a thorough analysis of the situation.  The matter of the media in East Europe is a political issue of  sufficient importance to warrant that the Council of Europe  adopt an international charter to serve as a guide for these  erring democracies, on how to create independent electronic  media, how far government influence over them may extend, and to  what that influence may relate at all. In my opinion,  incidentally, government influence may relate only to financing.    An international charter could spell all this out in the  form  of recommendations. This could be of considerable help, and not  just to Hungary. After all, this problem exists in the  neighboring countries as well. The charter could contribute also  toward easing domestic political tensions, and the government  ought to consider it for that reason as well.    [Nej] On the basis of all this, how do you assess the  metropolitan administration's chances of obtaining a frequency  allocation?    [Demszky] The metropolitan administration's prospects for  obtaining a frequency allocation in the near future are very  good. For the metropolis, by applying for a frequency  allocation, wants to provide useful information for the benefit  of local residents, as a public service. In addition, it wants  to concern itself with political matters that affect the lives  of Budapest residents. And there are also economic reasons why  we may be hopeful. The venture is well provided with capital.  <H5>  A Billion Forints To Start With </H5>   [Nej] Is there more money than just the 100 million forints?    [Demszky] Much more. About ten times as much. Which can  truly  guarantee that this television station will be able to stand on  its own feet and finance its own programs even during the  transitional period until it becomes self-supporting. According  to the television station's business plans, it will be able to  support itself on revenue from commercials.    [Nej] And will it be public-service television, financed by  the metropolis and some foundation respectively, or will it be  commercial television that is partially self-supporting?    [Demszky] It will be commercial television that broadcasts  also public-service programs. In other words, the television  station's structure will be a mixed one. The metropolis will  establish the television station and hold a certain amount of  equity in it, but will not have a majority stake. We do not want  to continue financing the station with ever newer grants each  year; instead, we would like to see it become self-supporting.  At the same time, through our share of equity, we would like to  attain a degree of participation in the corporation that will  enable us to prevent its dissolution. In other words, to prevent  the majority shareholder from pushing through at anytime a  resolution for the corporation's dissolution. And we also want  to be able to influence programming policy in a way that will  preserve by all means the station's public-service nature.    [Nej] The Budapest Metropolitan Council's application for a  frequency allocation has met with opposition from the very  outset, even within the council itself. The objections against  it were that the station would be oppositionist, and its  promoters would include also persons like George Soros, for  instance, who is not exactly popular among people to the right  of our government circles. Another objection was that the  television station would be using public funds, but its  operation would be managed primarily by members of the  opposition with liberal leanings. How can all this be organized,  and where will the money come from?    [Demszky] Primarily the First Hungarian Investment Fund will  provide the money, although also George Soros will actually  invest a smaller amount. The Budapest television station will  broadcast public-service programs locally, rather than  nationally, which automatically excludes the station's ability  to compete with the national electronic media. And the station  will not be oppositionist in the sense that the opposition  parties, and oppositionist tone and ideology will be the  dominant in it. It would be foolish to strive for that. And not  just because the ruling party has warned against it, but also  because we are learning from the bad example. Aside from all  that, party television, politically influenced, proselytizing or  strongly ideological television, is simply bad television.    [Nej] But it can be assumed that you people would want to  offset what, many people claim, is happening in the  public-service electronic media.    [Demszky] I wish to repeat, that is not possible. After all,  our area coverage is much smaller, to begin with. The solution  is simple: one has to offer good television broadcasting.    [Nej] By the way, how did the Metropolitan Council vote on  the proposal to establish the television station?    [Demszky] The SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], FIDESZ  [Federation of Young Democrats] and MSZP [Hungarian Socialist  Party] voted for the proposal. The governing parties were  against it. I do not remember exactly how many votes there were  for and against respectively. But the proposal did pass, with a  qualified majority. Anyone who expects to earn revenue from  commercials cannot afford to be biased or to have proselytizing  tendencies. Instead, he must strive primarily to satisfy the  viewers' demands.  <H5>  Expo and the Metropolis </H5>   [Nej] The year of Expo is approaching. This television  station could easily turn metropolitan residents against Expo,  but it could also support Expo just as easily. Since the  metropolitan administration is not exactly Expo-friendly, what  will its television station do?    [Demszky] We have to get ready for 1996, to welcome the four  million people who foreseeably will visit Expo. We are not  denying that, and it would be foolish to do so. It is in the  interest of the metropolitan administration to have the  necessary infrastructure in place by then. Because, on Expo's  account, the metropolitan administration will be able to obtain  developmental resources [from the government]. In other words,  this way the metropolitan administration will be able to build  more than if the construction projects were financed solely from  its own resources. This is something we have always emphasized.    The problem was that the metropolitan administration did not  receive any developmental resources during the past two years,  because an agreement was lacking between it and the program  bureau. In other words, there was no decision on who would be  responsible for which investment projects, whether financing  would be time-commensurate or based on performance, and so  forth. Now only a hairsbreadth separates us from an agreement  that clarifies these questions, and in 1994 the metropolitan  administration will receive 6 billion forints for development,  from the funds appropriated for Expo. In addition, the  metropolis will also receive budgetary grants. We will have no  objections if the television station presents these investment  projects and shows that the work is actually progressing. After  all, that too is news about our city.    [Nej] Is it possible that you will be getting a frequency  allocation merely to make the metropolis interested in staging  Expo? Is this actually political bargaining? This way the  metropolitan administration will also get its 6 billion  forints...    [Demszky] Last summer and autumn the government actually  realized that the metropolis was in a bargaining position.  Therefore the fiscal administration decided to provide grants  for us, over and above the appropriations for Expo. Actually the  metropolis is being compensated for losing its 35-percent share  of the revenue from individual income tax collected on its  territory. We are indeed bargaining continually.    [Nej] Is the television station included in the deal?    [Demszky] In the form of a frequency allocation, the  television station is not a part of this deal.    [Nej] From where will the television station recruit its  professional staff? If someone at PESTI HIRLAP, for instance,  wanted to work for the liberal metropolitan administration's  television station, regardless of who controls it, would he get  a job? Or would someone from a liberal workshop have a better  chance of getting the same job?    [Demszky] The metropolis has 290 institutions, but I have  never yet interfered in their personnel policies. Nor in what  activity an institution ought to pursue. Of course, there is an  abundant supply of unemployed professionals on the labor market,  and therefore it will not be difficult to assemble a team.  Incidentally, the team has partially been assembled already.  Only one name has been made public so far: Janos Betlen will be  the station's news editor. Naturally, he has been chosen by the  station's general manager, and not by me. Thus the metropolitan  administration must be aware of its exact limits, and neither  the metropolitan mayor nor the [Metropolitan Council's] media  committee may interfere in questions of editorial or programming  policy. Aside from enforcing one aspect: namely, that the  television station must broadcast also metropolitan  public-service programs.    [Nej] The addressee of the temporary license for trial  operation during the Christmas holidays is TV-3 Budapest. Will  that be the name of the metropolitan television station also in  the future?    [Demszky] There is no final decision on this question as  yet.  That too will have to be clarified at the next meeting of the  media committee. The strategic investor will also have to be  consulted on what name would be acceptable to him. Regrettably,  the call sign BP-1 is already reserved. That will also have to  be taken into consideration in our final decision regarding the  station's call sign.</p>

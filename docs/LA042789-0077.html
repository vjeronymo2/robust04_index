			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALHAMBRA;  </P> <P> PLANNING PANEL SEAT FILLED  </P> <P> Mark Juarez, son-in-law of Councilwoman Barbara Messina, was appointed to the  Planning Commission Monday night by Councilman Talmage Burke.  </P> <P> Juarez, a 28-year-old attorney, will begin serving on the nine-member  commission next week after he takes the oath of office.  </P> <P> There are no rules prohibiting relatives of council members from serving on  city commissions or committees, City Clerk Francis Moore said. Messina said she  did not ask Burke to appoint Juarez.  </P> <P> "I just liked his background," Burke said. He said Juarez's application stood  out from others because of his record of community involvement. Burke also  pointed out Juarez's experience as a manager of local softball teams.  </P> <P> "That's getting in there and working with young people," Burke said. He added  that Juarez, who is fluent in Spanish, will be an asset in a community where  30% of the residents are Latino.  </P> <P> In another announcement Monday, Burke appointed Paul Talbot to the Parks and  Recreation Commission. Talbot, 27, is a co-owner of two Wendy's Old Fashion  Hamburgers restaurants in the city.  </P></p>

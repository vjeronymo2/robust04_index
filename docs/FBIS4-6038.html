			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  said on Monday that now is a crucial period for national  security and what is most important in this stage is the morale  of the armed forces. "A high military morale springs from  courage, confidence and hope. You military leaders should be  clean-handed and imposing if only to earn love and trust from  people," Kim said.    The president, the supreme military commander, made the  remarks while meeting at Chongwadae [presidential office] a  group of senior Army and Air Force officers who were reassigned  in Saturday's reshuffle.    He also asked military officers to try to contribute to  forming a better relationship between Korea and the United  States. "Since the U.S. Administration values reports from  field military commanders, we can have smoother relations with  Washington depending on your efforts," he said.    The military leaders the president met included Gen. Chang  Song, deputy commander of the Korea-U.S. Combined Forces  Command, and Lt. Gens. Kim Sok-won, Kwak Tong-to, Yu Chae-yol,  Kim Chong-nam, Yu Chong-kap and Pak Chon-taek.</p>

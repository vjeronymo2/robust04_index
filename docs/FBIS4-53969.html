			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Japan, Australia and the  United States have forged bilateral accords on milk products in  the face of liberalization next year, the ASAHI SHIMBUN reported  Tuesday [24 May].    The leading Japanese daily on its front page said Japan in  secret bilateral negotiations with Washington in late March  pledged to import 20,000 to 30,000 tons of milk products  annually for use in bread and confectioneries through a  semigovernment channel.    The paper reported that the bilateral accord with Australia  was reached last year.    But the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries  denied the allegation. "These measures are not a  country-by-country accord, being prohibited by GATT," the daily  quoted a ministry official as saying.    Japan will liberalize imports of milk products in 1995 with  a  minimum foreign access level of 137,202 tons annually under the  Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT).    The amount, which is imported on low tariffs, is allocated  to  the Livestock Industry Promotion Corp. The other importers will  be permitted to buy the foreign farm products at high tariffs.    The semigovernment body also promised Australia that it will  buy three-quarters of Japan's total imports of the allocated  skim milk and butter annually, according to the daily.</p>

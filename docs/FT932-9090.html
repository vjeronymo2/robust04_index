			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Tunnel remarks 'misinterpreted' TRANSMANCHE Link, the Anglo-French consortium building the Channel tunnel, yesterday sought to distance itself from comments that the project might be delayed until 1995 made earlier this week by Mr Philippe Montagner, the consortium's vice-president. TML said that his remarks had been misinterpreted. The contractors had told Eurotunnel, the tunnel operator, that it might not open until the middle of next year unless agreement could be reached on the contractor's claims for additional payments.</p>

Since the Japan-U.S. economic consultations broke down, the  U.S. retaliatory measures against Japan, as seen in the high-yen  offensive, have been growing on a daily basis. It is time for  Japan to consider taking some actions. The government, at an  informal meeting of foreign economy issues-related ministers on  25 February, agreed to expedite actions in four areas, like  deregulation, but it was assumed that specific plans would be  completed by the end of March.    But with the U.S. offensive intensifying, Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa has announced preparation of the specific  plans would be hurried. The government offices concerned,  meanwhile, are lost. They cannot come up with any good ideas. A  senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry said, "After all, the Japan-U.S. summit decided we  should have a cooling-down period. Right now, there is nothing."  On the other hand, some of the officials charged with the  Japan-U.S. consultations complained, "To be absorbed only in a  cabinet reshuffle at a time like this can mean forgetting about  Japan-U.S. relations."    The cabinet reshuffle plan eventually was given up, but many  people think the leadership and gathering power of the prime  minister are bound to erode. These people felt uneasy, and  said, "According to the way things are going, the restoration of  relations with the United States will only be delayed. The  situation is now so bad that if we do not do something, we can  end up in a trade war."    Meanwhile, a senior official of the Ministry of Finance  [MOF]  was pleased with the outcome, saying, "This was better than  having the coalition be damaged by enforcing the reshuffle."  The MOF officials had strongly hoped that Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii (of Shinseito), who himself once was a bureaucrat  serving in the ministry, would "be retained." There is even a  mood of welcoming this development, as such.    But in the ministry there is a voice expressing concern that  the restoration of relations between Prime Minister Hosokawa and  his housekeeper, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura,  which have soured would "be very difficult," according to a  senior official of the ministry's Budget Bureau. The MOF has  tended to work closely with Shinseito and Komeito in the past to  get its economic policies adopted. The same ministry official  said, "It is possible that the rift within the Prime Minister's  Office will impact adversely on the Diet deliberations on the  1994 budget."</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell probe on hold again THE investigation by the Commons social security committee into the theft of funds from Maxwell company pension schemes was put on hold yesterday for a second time, Alison Smith writes. MPs on the cross-party committee cancelled a session today in which they were due to take evidence from Lord Rippon and from Mr Basil Brookes, former Maxwell Communication Corporation finance director. Instead, they will meet solely for their first full discussion of the request from the Serious Fraud Office to halt public hearings because many of those to be called are material witnesses in forthcoming trials. The SFO's request, late last month, led to a delay in the original plans for questioning Mr Brookes. Committee members are roughly evenly divided as to whether they should carry on with the inquiry, taking evidence in private, or whether their work would be so hampered that they should abandon it for the time being.</p>

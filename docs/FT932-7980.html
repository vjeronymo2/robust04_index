			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Maastricht mayhem ends as bill clears Commons BRITAIN last night took a big step towards ratifying Maastricht when MPs ended a year-long House of Commons battle and voted by a wide margin to give the bill implementing the treaty its decisive third reading. In an atmosphere verging on anti-climax, MPs delivered their verdict after more than 200 hours of often rancorous debate spread over exactly a year. After months of Commons' mayhem and manoeuvring, the bill now moves to the Lords where Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit lie in wait to spearhead fresh attempts to force a British referendum on the treaty. The former prime minister and the former Tory chairman are expected to marshal a noisy and no-holds-barred campaign. But ministers are confident the bill will clear all its parliamentary hurdles by late July and be sent for Royal Assent shortly afterwards. In a final act of defiance, a total of 41 Conservatives and 65 Labour Euro-sceptics last night voted against the bill, which was carried by a margin of 180 votes (292 to 112). A further five Tories joined Labour in abstaining. After the vote, a gaggle of Tory Euro-sceptics were ironically among the few MPs to show any signs of elation, taking comfort from the number of Conservatives who had defied the whips. 'We are delighted with these figures  -they will make the government approach other European bills as though they were walking on eggshells,' said one. After this week's Danish Yes vote, Britain is likely to be the last of the member states to ratify the treaty. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday warned of 'lasting damage to British interests' if the UK now destroyed it. The prevalent emotion throughout a strangely subdued day at Westminster was one of relief at finally seeing the back of the most minutely scrutinised piece of legislation in years. The anti-climactic note was most apparent as chancellor Mr Norman Lamont delivered the final speech. But this stemmed less from the chancellor's remarks than the largely vacant opposition benches. Though Labour MPs were under no obligation to attend after the front bench's decision to abstain, the suspicion was that the competing attraction of the FA Cup final replay played a part in the sparse attendance. The foreign secretary had been in playful mood, mocking Labour for deciding to abstain in last night's vote after MPs had sifted 600 amendments. He brought the House down with the claim, attributed to an unnamed EC foreign minister, that '40 per cent of the intellectual content of the Community today owed its origin to Lady Thatcher'. The highlight of a speech by Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, came when he brandished a scrap of paper more than half covered in lime-green marker pen. This turned out to be the text of the Maastricht bill. The bits in green were the parts included as a result of Labour proposals. Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister who took Britain into the EC in 1973, was in magisterial form, criticising Mr Hurd for being 'out of date' and Labour for being the only left-of-centre party in the EC not to have voted to support the treaty. The Maastricht bill began its Commons passage a year ago when MPs gave it a second reading with a majority of 244. But within days the Danes voted narrowly No in their first referendum on the treaty. The upshot at Westminster was a sustained period of backstage manoeuvring, with the Labour front bench trying to force Maastricht's social chapter on the government without derailing the treaty and Euro-sceptics on both sides of the House striving to destroy it.</p>

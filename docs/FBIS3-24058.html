			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Filippov, IZVESTIYA staff: "Arkhangelsk </F> Politicians Do Their Jobs and Do Not Fight With Anyone"]    [Text] Arkhangelsk--Arkhangelsk is like Odessa in felt  boots: people are never at a loss for words here, either. The  impressive building of the oblast party committee, located, as  it should be, int he very center of the city, has been  sarcastically dubbed the "accordion." Not so much for its  architecture as for the "music" that came out of it, music to  which the entire Maritime Oblast used to dance. The nickname was  kept during the time of the building's next tenant: the oblast  soviet. Evidently its "music" too closely resembled the party  music.    And since last 12 December the famous building became the  residence of the new representative authority--on that day  Maritime Oblast residents elected their oblast assembly. Whether  the ironic legacy will attach itself to the assembly, we won't  try to guess. So far, people in Arkhangelsk speak of their  parliament without irony. And we also will take a look at it  with serious eyes, since such elections lie ahead for other  regions of Russia, as well.  <H6>  Mirror of the Russian Provinces </H6>   Thirty-five deputies were elected to the 41 seats in the  Arkhangelsk Oblast Assembly. Elections of six more are to be  completed at the end of March. The new deputy corps has provided  some idea of what can be expected from province authorities  today.    First of all, professionalism. The communist patriots'  favorite argument about the cook a the helm of state has been  totally refuted. All the deputies to the oblast assembly have  higher-school diplomas and are between 30 and 60 years of age,  which is considered the most productive for work. Fifteen  deputies are executives of industrial, construction and  agricultural enterprises, eight are from rayon and rural  administrations, and the rest are physicians, teachers, lawyers  and journalists.    Second, the province clearly does not want a revival of  Soviet practices. Only nine of the legislators out of 35 were  formerly deputies to a soviet.    And third, the voters are hoping that their deputies will  engage in lawmaking, not political struggle. Maritime Oblast  inhabitants have elected to their oblast assembly only those who  have not linked themselves unreservedly to any one party or  movement.    "We don't have any factions," says Nikolay Isakov, chairman  of the oblast assembly. "We have come here in order to put the  oblast's economy in order, and one's political coloring is  unimportant for economic laws.  <H6>  Speaker-Diplomat </H6>   Nikolay Isakov is 47 years of age. He was born on the Pinega  River and is a fellow countryman of the writer Fedor Abramov.  And he himself is an exceptional person for the Arkhangelsk  backwoods. He was graduated from the Friendship of People's  University in Moscow, is a historian and economist by training,  and is fluent in Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. He worked in  Cuba on the staff of an economic adviser. Then he governed  Pinezhskiy Rayon as head of the administration. It was through  his diligence that a museum was opened in Fedor Abramov's house  in the village of Verkola, and that a granite monument was  placed on the writer's grave. The rayon chief has accomplished a  number of other, perhaps more prosaic, but equally good deeds,  for which Pinezhskiy Rayon's inhabitants elected him to the  oblast parliament. And when the assembly's deputies were  deciding who should be speaker, Nikolay Isakov proved to be  without competitors.    "There is nothing for us to divide up with the executive  authority," Nikolay Isakov believes. "The oblast administration  is working hard to enable the producer of goods to operate  normally. And we will use the means at our disposal to try to  accomplish the same objective. Saving jobs in remote areas means  saving the people who live there. But where are the muzhiks in a  forest village to go if their only timber station closes. And  what will they feed their children?"    An interesting note: the "accordion" has its own cafeteria,  but the speaker has made a habit of dining in the oblast  administration building, with the governor. According to Nikolay  Isakov, it is better to go over common problems in an informal  atmosphere.  <H6>  Not a Word About Privileges </H6>   Of the 41 deputies to the oblast assembly, 16 may work on a  permanent basis. But only three professionals have joined the  speaker and two deputy speakers. The rest of the deputies have  not quit their jobs. The deputies meet in Arkhangelsk only once  a month--for a session that lasts five days.    The oblast assembly began its work at the same time as the  State Duma. But while their colleagues in Moscow were arguing  over what privileges to establish for themselves, the  Arkhangelsk legislators were concerned with the socioeconomic  state of the oblast, its budget, local tax rates and the  structure of local government. None of the deputies said a word  about privileges for themselves.    "It's disgraceful, to stuff one's own pockets at the expense  of the impoverished people," Nikolay Isakov says.    The Arkhangelsk parliament lives modestly. Only the chairman  has an official car. The deputies are reimbursed for their hotel  and travel to sessions. They also have the free use of city  transportation, except for taxis, of course. The oblast  assembly's staff is half the size of the deputy corps. Those who  work on a permanent basis receive salaries: the speaker's is  equal to the governor's, his deputies get the same as the  vice-governor, the chairman of a standing commission gets the  same as the director of an administration, and so forth.    "Sensible deputies have been elected," says Governor Pavel  Balakshin. "This is no longer the same thing as the former  oblast soviet, which contrived to govern everything. I express  my own position at sessions of the oblast assembly, and even if  it differs from the deputies', we find agreement."    Nonetheless, I am wary of drawing the conclusion that the  elections of local parliaments that are slated for the end of  March in many regions of Russia will bring long-awaited  political peace as has been the case in Arkhangelsk. Practically  everywhere, heads and deputy heads of administrations of various  levels are running for deputies. Seven of such "dual job  holders" have gotten onto the Arkhangelsk Oblast Assembly.  However, it is not out of the question that the dual job holders  will take the majority in the parliaments of other oblasts, and  that the representative branch will be suppressed by the  executive branch. Consequently, autocratic regimes may be  established on part of Russian territory.    Our country has many faces, and there is no doubt that the  regions' bodies of representative authority should be in accord  with their historical traditions. But at the same time, there is  a need for a federal law on the general principles of local  authority that would guarantee the indivisibility of Russia. And  it makes good sense that the March elections in the regions  should be postponed until the time when the State Duma adopts  such a law.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UN may enforce no-fly zone, says Owen MILITARY action may be needed to enforce the no-fly zone over Bosnia if efforts to secure compliance through negotiation fail, peace mediator Lord Owen said yesterday. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, had been warned that if his forces continued to flout the no-fly zone, imposed by the United Nations last October, the UN security council would be called on to consider enforcement, Lord Owen told a UK parliamentary select committee in London. 'The patience of the world is not limitless and the strengthening of military action might be necessary,' he said. Lord Owen said enforcement could still be achieved through negotiation but if flouting of the ban continued 'despite constant warnings, we would be forced to enforce it'. Enforcement of the no-fly ban was the only military option the international community should be considering at the moment, but it had to retain the option of force to bring about a settlement in the former Yugoslavia. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, cautioned yesterday over military measures to enforce the no-fly zone. He told Nato colleagues that any action against Serb helicopters or aircraft could endanger UN troops on the ground. British officials indicated that the position was broadly supported by other allies. They added that no proposals had been put forward by defence ministers on new ways of resolving or containing the Bosnian conflict. Nato military authorities were undertaking preparatory work to ensure they were better placed to respond to any new request from the UN to help the peacekeeping effort. They said the political mandate for further action had to come from the UN. Moves to strengthen Nato's role in assisting peacekeeping efforts are to be formalised by allied foreign ministers next week, including France. US officials said yesterday it was unlikely that Washington would earmark military units for peacekeeping. Lord Owen told the select committee yesterday that the strength of feeling in the Islamic world about the killing of Moslems in Bosnia should not be underestimated. Substantial quantities of arms supplies had got through to Moslems defending themselves against Serb forces, but these were mainly light and unsophisticated weapons. Bosnian foreign minister Haris Silajdzic said at peace talks in Geneva yesterday he hoped US President-elect Bill Clinton would lift the arms embargo on Bosnia.</p>

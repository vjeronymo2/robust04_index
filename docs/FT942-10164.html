			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US quartet wins Seoul phone stake Four US companies were selected yesterday to take a total shareholding of 22.2 per cent in a consortium that will operate South Korea's second mobile telephone network. This deal is the latest example of South Korea demanding technology transfers in return for allowing foreign companies market access. The US companies were chosen because of their willingness to transfer hardware and operating software for the code-division multiple access (CDMA) system, which is competing against the European Groupe Speciale Mobile (GSM) standard for advanced digital telecommunications. The four US partners are AirTouch Communications, the wireless communications company which was spun off from Pactel and which has a 10 per cent stake, Southwestern Bell (7 per cent), GTE (4 per cent), and Qualcomm (1.2 per cent). Pohang Iron and Steel and the Kolon textile group are the biggest shareholders in the Sinsegi mobile telecom network, which also includes Korea's leading telecommunications equipment manufacturers among the 221 domestic companies in the consortium. South Korea is one of the first countries to embrace CDMA technology. Korean companies hope to sell CDMA equipment to other markets. The Sinsegi network is to go into operation by the end of 1995 and will compete against Korean Mobile Telecom (KMT). The number of cellular telephone subscribers in Korea has grown by almost 90 per cent a year since 1988 and reached 500,000 this year.</p>

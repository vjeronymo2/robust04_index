			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Jobs figures put Fed under pressure: Improved employment statistics raise fears of tighter monetary policy The publication yesterday of stronger than expected employment figures put renewed pressure on the US Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. The Labour Department said non-farm payroll employment rose 379,000 in June, well above Wall Street projections of an increase of about 280,000. Officials, however, said some of the increase could reflect distortions - labour markets are particularly fluid in early summer as many temporary positions are created. In another sign of economic strength the unemployment rate (which is based on a survey of households rather than employers) held steady at 6 per cent last month. After a seemingly erratic decline in the jobless rate from 6.4 per cent in April to 6.0 per cent in May, most analysts had expected a rebound to about 6.2 per cent. Bond prices fell sharply in early trading on fears that monetary policy might need to be tightened again to prevent rapid economic growth eventually putting upward pressure on inflation. Earlier this week the Fed concluded a two-day policy meeting without signalling an increase in rates - despite other signs of economic vitality and the dollar's continuing weakness on foreign exchange markets. The Fed's failure to move prompted speculation that it believed economic growth was decelerating of its own accord, justifying a 'wait and see' attitude on rates. Between February and May, the Fed raised short-term rates by 1 1/4 percentage points to 4 1/4 per cent, a level that it described as close to 'neutrality' - meaning that it represented neither an expansionary nor a contractionary monetary policy. After this week's meeting it appeared that the Fed wanted to wait and see what effect these earlier rate increases would have, before tightening again. That may still be its preferred approach, but the strength of the employment data is likely to make Fed policymakers uneasy. Payroll employment has risen by 1.6m since January, considerably faster than last year, when gross domestic product grew 3 per cent. The jobless rate has fallen sharply from 6.7 per cent to 6.0 per cent - at or below the level at which inflation has begun to rise in the past. Even if the June employment increase was erratically high, there were few signs in yesterday's figures of any deceleration in the pace of job creation. Preliminary GDP figures for the second quarter, to be published later this month, are likely to show economic growth at an annual rate of well above 3 per cent, implying that the economy is still growing faster than its long-run potential rate of expansion. Mr Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street firm, said the June jobs figures overstated underlying employment growth and would not prompt an early increase in interest rates. However, the Fed would raise rates in coming months: a neutral stance might require rates as high as 5 per cent before the end of the year. Ms Katherine Abraham, head of the labour statistics bureau, described the payroll increase as 'substantial'. Although most of the gain occurred in service sectors such as healthcare, restaurants, retail trades and leisure industries, there was also a 'notable' 34,000 increase in manufacturing employment.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> QUOTABLE  </P> <P> "I had this perception in the air around me that there was something wrong with  me, and I knew that what was wrong with me wasn't wrong with anyone else.  </P> <P> And I saw that if you talk in a loud voice people will think you have something  to say, so I cultivated a loud voice. And I learned to say all my vowels and  consonants. I developed grandeur at a very early age. Say, 4."  </P> <P>  -- Actress Linda Hunt, in the New Yorker  </P></p>

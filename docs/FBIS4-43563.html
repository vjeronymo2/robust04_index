			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Patrick de Saint-Exupery: "French Initiative </F> Breaks Lethargy"]    [Text] [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe has dared to take the  first step. For the first time since 1945, a Western country  has recognized, through the mouth of its foreign minister, the  existence of a "right to intervene" in the case of genocide.    Until now, one intervened "charitably," more to placate  public opinion troubled by the images of the world's misfortunes  on its TV screens than in the name of a "moral and political"  imperative. But in calling publicly for such a step, Alain  Juppe has broken a taboo and encouraged a number of states which  were until now too pusillanimous. Belgium's Defense Minister  Leo Delcroix welcomed the initiative, which "breaks the  lethargy" of the international community.    Among Alain Juppe's entourage, nobody is hiding the fact  that  this decision was made rapidly. It is also admitted that media  pressure played a major role. "It is obvious," a senior official  from the French Foreign Ministry recognized, "that last  Saturday's [11 June] massacre of 160 orphans acted as a  catalyst. It was too much!" Finally, one does not hide away  when certain observers accuse France of seeking to "make good  past mistakes." As the same official commented: "We were slow  in reacting, but does that mean we should do nothing?"  <H5>  Many Questions </H5>   Now it is time for action, or rather reaction. Because it is  very late. The massacres began on 6 April. Reports and eye  witness accounts flowed in. Unanimous conclusion: A genocide  was under way and, far from hiding away, those responsible for  this monstrous act were claiming credit for it.    The silence of the different states became deafening and had  to be broken. This has been done. But, in practical terms,  this does not resolve anything. Moving from symbol to action  raises a host of questions.    First of all, about the form. Like Francois Mitterrand  traveling to Sarajevo without warning his European counterparts,  Alain Juppe moved ahead without consulting his partners. UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali was warned by telephone,  but Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, the  Italians...were all caught off guard. London, Brussels, and  Washington appear to reluctant to the initiative. Only the  Italians and Spaniards appear to be ready to consider action  with the French, who have become veritable "snipers," according  to one of Juppe's close colleagues.    With regard to substance: The French Government is starting  out with a severe handicap, due to its blind support, since  1990, of a now totally discredited regime. A senior diplomat  summed it up: "We have to get the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]  to understand that we are not against it. We have no intention  of intervening to stay. We are looking to push forward a  reconciliation initiative."    This is where the ambiguity lies. How far is Paris ready to  go in the name of "reconciliation?" Is it ready to discuss with  those responsible for the "genocide," or should it distance  itself from the former regime in order to construct the future  with the few moderates, Hutus and Tutsis alike, who have managed  to escape the massacre?    Despite its precipitousness, Alain Juppe's initiative  represents a deliberate political choice. The time limit which  the foreign minister has given himself before deciding, if  necessary, on a purely French intervention, will therefore be  very short. His entourage is specific: "In a few days, a week  perhaps, if nothing has moved forward from an international  viewpoint, a decision will be made."    Alain Juppe is playing for high stakes. Africa, too, whose  leaders this time have been able to merit Western interest in  its fate. A few days ago, Salim Ahmed Salim, the secretary  general of the Organization for African Unity (OAU), recognized  at the Tunis summit that "the tragic lesson we have to learn  from events in Rwanda is that Africa must prepare to assume its  responsibilities. We need to have the courage to criticize our  mistakes."</p>

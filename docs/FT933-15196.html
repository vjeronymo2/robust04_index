			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Technical factors fuel copper surge COPPER'S PRICE burst back to 90 cents a lb on the London Metal Exchange yesterday, boosted by technical and options-related factors which encouraged buying by commodity funds. Defying its poor fundamental situation - the copper market seems likely to record a substantial supply surplus this year - the metal has bounced back by nearly Dollars 300 a tonne or 17 per cent since early May to close last night in London at Dollars 1,997.50. This followed market turmoil in April when the price collapsed from 98 cents a lb to a 5 1/2 -year low of 78 cents, a descent so swift that it caused severe financial losses at several LME trading houses. At present copper was 'being driven by brilliant technicals', said one trader yesterday. Options activity pointed to 'potentially an explosive situation', he added. Dealers suggested that, in spite of China's attempts to slow its over-heating economy, Chinese trading houses were still taking 20,000 to 30,000 tonnes of copper a month from LME warehouses in Rotterdam, which would help to account for the recent fall in the exchange's warehouse stock levels from 456,125 tonnes reached in late-June - a 15-year peak. Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda natural resources group, said it was difficult to justify present copper prices. But producers had for the time being stopped selling forward, perhaps waiting for the price to go to Dollars 2,000. Sentiment was helped yesterday by news that Codelco, the state-owned Chilean group, was to buy 60,000 tonnes of copper cathode during the rest of this year to meet sales commitments.</p>

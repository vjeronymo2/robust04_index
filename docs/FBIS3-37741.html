He also pointed to recent military successes by Karabakh  forces which regained control of the Omar Pass in the Azeri  region of Kelbajar and to the tough stand taken by Russian  Defence Minister Pavel Grachev during recent talks between the  Armenian and Azeri defence chiefs. The official said Baku must  have realized that if Grachev wound up his mediation, "its only  hope will be a military option which leads nowhere".    The Armenian official hopes the agreement will be  implemented  in stages. A permanent cease-fire must be followed by troop  withdrawals, exchange of prisoners and negotiations on the  status of Nagorno-Karabakh. He said the main thing now was to  stop the bloodletting because negotiation was a lengthy process.    The source expressed regret that the international community  should proceed from the principle of territorial integrity on  resolving the conflict. He described it as a superb principle  unless applied to the Karabakh issue. "This is the internal  issue of Azerbaijan of which Karabakh used to be part until  recently but it declared its independence following the  national-liberation struggle", the source said. Therefore, the  principle of integrity should not be applied to the disputed  territory, he said.    In the meantime, head of the information and analysis center  of Armenia's large opposition Dashnaktsutyun Party Bagrat  Sadoian fears that any cease-fire will only play into the hands  of Azerbaijan which ran out of its military resources after the  failure of an offensive it began at the end of December.    Sadoian thinks Baku cannot put up with the idea of losing  Karabakh and is now trying to regain it.</p>

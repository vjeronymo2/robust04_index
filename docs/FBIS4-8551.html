			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Albanian Delegation in the Council of Europe Protests </F> Against the Criminal Act of Greek Terrorists" -- ATA headline]    [Text] Tirana, April 13 (ATA) -- On the request of the  Albanian permanent parliamentary delegation, headed by Mr.  Eduard Selami, a meeting was organized yesterday evening with  Mr. Martinez, the president of Parliamentary Assembly of Council  of Europe [CE]. The aim of this meeting was to inform Mr.  Martinez and to protest against the criminal act of Greek  commandos in Albanian territory.    After the presentation of Albanian Government, note of  protest to the Greek Government, Mr. Selami set forth to Mr.  Martinez a review of the relationship between the two countries,  and informed him on the policy of certain Greek ultra  nationalists circles as well as their continuous attempts that  aim at thwarting the relations and destabilizing the situation  in Albania. The policy of these circles has affected Greek  official policy, added Selami, which is reflected in its  attempts to hinder Albanian integration to European structures  and in their anti-human stand towards Albanian emigrants as well  as the unprecedented case of the open aggression against  Albanian people and its sovereignty. This policy, pointed out  Selami, is against the peace process in the region and runs  contrary to the EU [European Union] policy, member of which is  Greece as well. Further, Mr. Selami requested from Mr. Martinez  to intervene in the Council of Europe to examine this terrorist  act against the Albanian Republic and to arrest this attitude  that aims to put the whole Balkan region in fire. Greece, as a  member of Council of Europe, should be responsible for trampling  down international rules that adjust the relationship between  the two countries. On his part, Mr. Martinez thanked the  Albanian delegation for the information in relation to Greek  commandos terrorist act against Albania. We are worried about  the Greek policy in Balkans, added Mr. Martinez. This is a  grave incident and we will investigate it closely in order that  the culprits should bear the responsibility.    Albanian delegation had other meetings with several deputies  of many European countries and informed them about this  terrorist act. The delegation will present this issue in the  meetings of several parliamentary commissions and other  political groups. The note of protest was delivered to all the  delegations and members of Council of Europe as well as the  diplomatic corpses accredited in Strasbourg.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / World Trade News: Iran Air orders Airbuses IRAN Air has ordered two Airbus Industrie A300-600R airliners worth an estimated Dollars 171m (Pounds 96.6m), its first order from the European consortium since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Airbus said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. The sale could clear the way for more aircraft orders by Iran, which has not bought any large western-made commercial aircraft since the 1970s. The aircraft will be equipped with CF6-80C2 engines made by General Electric of the US. An Airbus official said the order had been approved by the US, which last year blocked efforts by Iran to buy four British Aerospace aircraft. 'Hopefully, the US approval is a sign of a change in US policy in this area,' a Boeing official said. Another industry official said Iran 'desperately needed to renew their aircraft fleet. Most of their equipment is from the 1970s'.</p>

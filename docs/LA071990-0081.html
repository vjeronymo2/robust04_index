			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL KEEPS ALIVE THEATER PROJECT FUNDING  </P> <P> Funding for the Los Angeles Theatre Center was kept alive this week by the Los  Angeles City Council, but several council members questioned the city's  expenditure of nearly $20 million in public funds since the pioneering downtown  theater first opened in the early 1980s.  </P> <P> The council voted 9-3 to funnel $750,000 from the Community Redevelopment  Agency to support the theater's building and operating costs. But even those  voting in favor of the additional funds cautioned that city subsidies to the  financially troubled theater must be reviewed.  </P> <P> Many council members praised the efforts of LATC -- located near Skid Row to  bring the arts into a troubled area.  </P></p>

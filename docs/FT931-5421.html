			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Strong rally in bonds fails to lift US stocks Wall Street ANOTHER strong rally in bond prices failed to lift stock market sentiment, which was depressed by disappointing economic news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 5.13 easier at 3,398.91 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.92 at 447.34, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 3.19 to 680.73. NYSE volume was 232m shares. Weak overseas markets set the tone for a downbeat opening to trading in the US. The latest sharp advance in bond prices, which at one point sent the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond issue down to another record low of below 6.7 per cent, was ignored, primarily because the rise in bonds was sparked by economic figures that disturbed stock market investors. The day's data showed that state unemployment claims for the third week of February rose by 26,000, far more than the 1,000 increase analysts had been expecting, and that factory orders fell 1.3 per cent in January. The jobs numbers were especially worrying - today the government releases the February employment report. Investors are worried that the figures will show that jobs growth continues to languish in an economic recovery that may even be slowing. Trading remained heavy in RJR Nabisco, which eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 8 1/2 in volume of 4m shares. RJR announced on Tuesday plans to sell a separate group of shares that would give investors a stake in its worldwide food operations; but after a gain that day RJR shares have since failed to respond positively to news of the deal. Wal-Mart was another of the day's most heavily traded stocks, dipping Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 32 7/8 in turnover of 4.7m shares after the retailing group announced flat sales for the month of February. Other leading retailers were generally weaker on news of disappointing monthly sales - although the weak sales were blamed on bad weather conditions during February. Some of the market's biggest drug stocks remained under pressure on continued concern about possible price caps on pharmaceuticals prices. Johnson &amp; Johnson fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 , Bristol-Myers Squibb dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 56 and Merck slipped Dollars 1 to Dollars 37 3/4 . Salomon declined Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 39 5/8 after stating that it had a Dollars 250m pre-tax operating deficit in the first two months of this year because of losses from proprietary securities trading. Canada TORONTO closed sharply higher, fuelled by a rally in banking shares, as volume swelled to the best level since the stock market crash in October 1987 and was the third highest on record. The TSE 300 index added 34.1 at 3,501.3, while advancing issues led declines by 398 to 265 after volume of 68.6m shares. Interest rate cuts and first-quarter earnings reports from the banks in line or better than forecast boosted the banking sector, its index forging ahead 3.17 per cent.</p>

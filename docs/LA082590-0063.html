			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 5 LEGISLATORS IN S. CAROLINA FACE BRIBERY CHARGES;  </P> <P> INDICTMENTS: THEY ARE ACCUSED OF ACCEPTING MONEY IN EXCHANGE FOR SUPPORT OF A  PARIMUTUEL BETTING BILL. LOBBYIST WORKED FOR FBI IN PROBE.  </P> <P> The cloud hanging over the South Carolina Legislature burst dramatically Friday  as five lawmakers were indicted on federal charges that they "sold their votes  for cash."  </P> <P> A federal grand jury in Columbia, the state capital, returned felony  indictments against state Sen. William Lee and state Reps. Daniel Winstead,  Robert Brown, Robert Kohn and Luther Taylor, charging them with accepting  bribes in exchange for support of a parimutuel betting bill.  </P> <P> "The indictments, simply put, allege that each of these public officials sold  their votes for cash," U.S. Atty. Bart Daniel said in a statement in Columbia.  He said also that there will be more indictments.  </P> <P> The indictments result from a 16-month investigation that included a sting  operation, code-named Operation Lost Trust.  </P> <P> Investigators charge that lobbyist Ronald Cobb, working undercover for the FBI,  offered thousands of dollars in cash to the legislators -- and they took it.  Cobb, a cigar-smoking, back-slapping former state legislator, allegedly  conducted the transactions in a Columbia hotel room.  </P> <P> The case had cast a pall over the capital since it came to light last month  that federal agents had subpoenaed the spending records of every one of the  state's 124 House members and 46 senators. The indictments signal that the  scandal will run a long course, opening the state up to even more political  trauma as trials unfold.  </P> <P> Moreover, Daniel said: "This investigation is continuing. We expect more  indictments in the coming months."  </P> <P> In the wake of the disclosures about the sting operation, there were frantic  calls for reform of the state's liberal campaign finance laws. In South  Carolina, politicians are allowed to accept unlimited cash contributions, and  lobbyists are not required to itemize the contributions. By contrast, North  Carolina allows a candidate to accept no more than $100 in cash.  </P> <P> In commenting on the likelihood that reforms will be enacted, First Assistant  U.S. Atty. John McIntosh said that such action "is up to the Legislature.  They're the ones to enact it. We hope the public will demand it."  </P> <P> Aware of the negative impact the scandal has had on the public's opinion of  state legislators in general -- even those not implicated -- Daniel said: "The  vast majority of our elected officials in the state Legislature are honorable  men and women who serve the public in the finest sense of the term."  </P> <P> John Harley, special agent in charge of the FBI in South Carolina, confirmed  that meetings with legislators were recorded on audiotape and videotape and  that a phony business was used as a front.  </P> <P> Sting operations similar to the one in South Carolina have been aimed at  lawmakers in several states, including California.  </P> <P> In Columbia, the five legislators are charged with violating the federal Hobbs  Act, which makes it illegal for a public official to accept money as an  inducement for promising to perform an official act.  </P> <P> The one-count indictment against Lee alleges that he accepted "a $2,000 cash  bribe" for his support of the parimutuel betting bill that was pending during  the 1990 legislative session. Winstead is charged with one count of accepting  $1,000 and another count of obstruction of justice. Brown is charged with one  count of taking $2,000. Kohn is charged with one count of conspiracy, alleging  that he agreed to accept cash and to recruit colleagues to support the betting  bill. Taylor is charged with one count of conspiracy and five counts of  accepting cash totaling $2,500.  </P> <P> Each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment and a fine of  $250,000.  </P> <P> Although trials have yet to be held, the case has already created fallout. Kohn  has announced he will not seek reelection. Taylor was suspended Friday, in  accordance with House rules. Winstead and Brown resigned Thursday. In his  resignation letter, Brown said: "I hope my work and dedication to improving the  quality of life in my county and our state will not be totally overshadowed by  any mistakes I have made."  </P></p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Books: Balancing Terry Maher's books - The rise and fall of the man who built Pentos AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGEMENT by Terry Maher Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 15, 222 pages A balance sheet on Terry Maher - founder of Pentos, iconoclastic creator of Dillons Bookstores and now autobiographer - might read somewhat as follows. On the credit side, Maher merits respect as a high-flyer propelled by sheer talent. He is the classic poor boy made good: humble beginnings in Manchester, compounded by childhood TB, offered an unpromising start, but once his foot was on the business ladder he climbed fast - and would have done so in politics too, except that he chose the Liberals. Two unsuccessful efforts as a parliamentary candidate inclined him to accept a head-hunter's offer in the City; in two years he had launched Pentos. Daring and finesse helped Pentos's success but there were ups and downs, the latter mainly associated with recessions. Pentos evolved from an eclectic holding company into a specialist retailer, with Dillons Bookstores as its jewel. The growth of Dillons from a single university bookshop to a highly visible nationwide chain was spectacular. In much of this there was high skill on Maher's part, especially in brilliant marketing and some novelties of financial management, justifying his colourful reputation. Experience has given Maher a sharp eye. Many will applaud his comments about the unhelpfulness of banks, City short-termism, inflated commercial rent levels, and the fact that too much money channels into pension funds, starving smaller companies of investment. The debit side brings more recent events into focus. In September last year Maher was forced out of Pentos with a handshake of Pounds 392,000. The recession had hit Pentos hard, and although Maher thought the company was roughly at break-even point ('accounting,' he wistfully remarks, 'is not an exact science') his colleagues on the board reckoned otherwise: Pentos was facing a Pounds 70m loss. Maher had over-reached. Dillons' expansion went too far and fast in a race for market share against WH Smiths-Waterstones. The fate of overblown companies - dismemberment and dispersal - threatens Maher's life-work. The story Maher tells is austerely a business autobiography - there is barely anything of his personal life in it - and although its aim is to vindicate the Maher side of the Pentos saga, it is agreeably less vaunting in one direction, and less bitter in the other, than it might be. After all, there are Shakespearean elements here: ambition, success, hubris, betrayal by friends, failure. Others can judge Maher's business adventures, but a book reviewer must be forgiven for concentrating on what he takes to be the largest item in the debit column: Maher's attack on the Net Book Agreement, the arrangement by which booksellers charge no less than the publisher's cover price. Some markets benefit from constraint, and some are better without. In Maher's opinion the book trade falls into the second category. 'The NBA,' he argues, 'prevents us from exploiting the full potential from expanding book sales; has kept book prices unnecessarily high; and has propped up inefficiencies in the book trade.' He wants to pile 'em high, as the phrase has it, and sell 'em cheap. Defenders argue that if the NBA goes, price-cutting retail superstores of the kind invented by Maher will undercut small bookshops. The range of books will narrow into the bonkbuster and cookery parts of the spectrum, and there will be fewer titles ('a good thing,' Maher opines). Small publishers and small-circulation, specialist, literary and recondite books will be squeezed to vanishing. The NBA maximises choice by maximising the number of books, publishers and book shops available, which is why almost all authors, publishers, booksellers and - when informed - readers agree with the 1964 decision of a restrictive practices court that the NBA serves the public interest. If it goes, impoverishment of the book world will result, and not even the superstores will benefit for long. The French abandoned their version of the NBA in 1979, only to restore it in 1981, aghast at the effects. In the US there is no NBA, with stark results: only big second-hand city shops give genuine range, while university bookstores are echoing halls stacked with teetering piles of pre-ordered textbooks. Thirty per cent fewer books are published in the US annually than in the UK, in spite of its vastly larger domestic market; and the UK exports more. To their immense credit WH Smiths-Waterstones supports the NBA because it recognises that it keeps diversity in books and bookselling alive. But Maher, alas, might have done enough to take the book world down with him in his own plunge from the heights.</p>

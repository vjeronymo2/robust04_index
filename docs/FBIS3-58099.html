			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN)-- Rainer Mueller, ambassador of  the Federal Republic of Germany to Gabon, has been arrested on  suspicion of spying for the former GDR state security service,  according to a report in the BILD newspaper. According to  information from the paper, Mueller, who was also press  spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, worked for the Stasi on an  "ideological basis"--and, therefore, free of charge--since 1974.  Security authorities described the extent of betrayal as  "considerable," the paper writes (Friday [7 January] edition).    Mueller went to Gabon as ambassador last spring. Although he  has so far denied the charges, the arrest warrant is still in  force. The investigations are continuing.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Nadir fails to lift court order Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive former head of Polly Peck International, has failed in an attempt to lift the bankruptcy order in place on him in the UK, Andrew Jack writes. The High Court yesterday extended the order indefinitely. It could otherwise have expired after three years. There has been concern that pressure would be applied to allow the order to lapse after the initial period. Mr Neil Cooper, of accountants Robson Rhodes, said that to apply for the order to be lifted Mr Nadir would have to demonstrate that he had co-operated with his court-appointed trustee in bankruptcy. This is unlikely given that Mr Nadir failed to co-operate on a number of occasions and fled last year to his native northern Cyprus.</p>

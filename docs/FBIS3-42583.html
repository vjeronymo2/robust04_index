			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Crisis solution strategy: "Socioeconomic Crisis: Strategy </F> of a Way Out"]    [Text] An entire kaleidoscope of different parties  and movements, each of which is proposing its own strategy of a  way out of the economic and social and political crisis, has  appeared in the political arena at this time.    We offer for readers' attention the strategy of a way  out of the crisis formulated by the Organizing Committee of the  People's Party of the Republic of Tajikistan and the Executive  Committee of the Tajik Association of Furtherance of the  Cooperation and Progress of the Peoples of Central Asia (TASS  PNTsA).    This strategy was formulated on the basis of specific  features based on a scientific historical analysis of all the  conditions of the real life and a recognition of the cultural,  national, and historical traditions and customs of the peoples  of Tajikistan and the use of what is best from the experience of  the world community. It proceeds from the fact that there are  real opportunities--the scientific and technological potential,  the major industrial base, competent personnel--for overcoming  the crisis in the republic.    The Organizing Committee of the People's Party of the  Republic of Tajikistan and the TASS PNTsA Executive Committee  believe that it is possible with prudent and professional  government to considerably replenish the domestic market and  increase the export potential and that it is still possible to  halt the outflow of the Russian-speaking population and the  interconnected processes of the impoverishment of society and  the decline in production. It is essential to this end to  undertake in practice economic reforms and privatization in  order that they serve the emancipation and recovery of the  economy; to transfer ownership, of the land included, to those  who are capable by honest labor and economic enterprise of  enriching society and themselves; by means of economic,  political, ideological, law enforcement, and all other measures  permitted by law to eliminate the omnipotence of bureaucratism  in the organs of power and administration and to put a stop to  the orgy of crime and corruption; to ensure glasnost for  decision-making on questions of the formation of the Armed  Forces, the National Guard, the National Security Service, and  the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and also of the use of  material resources; to actively contribute to the preservation  and strengthening of the all-around ties of the Republic of  Tajikistan to the independent states, which have taken shape  over many decades, and to the establishment of equal, mutually  beneficial relations with countries of all continents.    The denationalization of property and privatization could  serve to revitalize production, preserve the existing and create  new jobs, lift the restrictions on the growth of wages, and  realize the right of the participants in the economic process to  the results of their labor.    The first step on a way out of the crisis should be the  restoration both of the intrarepublic market and the common  economic space. All production and service structures may  function normally only with mutually acceptable agreements on  prices and tariffs providing for guarantees of their fulfillment  and penalties for those who violate them. Everyone should grasp  the obvious fact here that for a way out of the crisis and the  all-around recovery of production, the imposition of world  prices on the domestic market would be the final blow to the  economy and the reduction of the population to total poverty.    The organs of power and administration must draw up and  implement specific (in terms of sector and time frame) and  long-term programs of the enlistment of producers in the market  economy. Required for this are the reorientation of the  production structures and the infrastructure connected with them  toward commercial success, consideration of the requirements of  the consumer, an expansion of the market, the emancipation of  the distribution mechanism, advisory and research services and  technical assistance, long-term bank loans on justified terms,  and the introduction of the progressive taxation of profits from  the products of monopoly enterprises, for which free prices are  established, and also a system of taxation that does not fetter  enterprise. State support for small and medium-sized business  and the development of new forms of ownership in the countryside  are needed likewise.    On the whole, it is impossible to accomplish the economic  tasks without a solicitous attitude toward the production  potential created by many generations. It is essential to this  end to restore to an economically and socially justified level  the working capital of the state-owned enterprises, which has  been reduced in recent years; establish maximum prices of energy  and products of the structure-forming sectors; determine the  criteria and procedure of the computation of production costs;  put an end to the flawed practice of the establishment of "free  prices" of products in short supply, imported products included,  merely with regard to the growing demand for them, but without  consideration of their prime costs and transport and  merchandising outlays.    The program of enterprise privatization should provide for  the competition of privatization scenarios (projects), including  guarantees of an increase in product competitiveness, and  conditions of the employment and remuneration of the work force.  Employees who have actively contributed to its privatization may  enjoy preferential terms for the purchase of stock. And the  enterprises should be authorized to sell their products  themselves, bypassing the commodity markets.    With any diversity of forms of ownership in the Republic of  Tajikistan, the land, water, major hydraulic engineering works,  mineral resources, and enterprises of defense significance shall  for the transitional period be property of the state. The  highest representative body--the Supreme Council--should ensure  the firmness of the proposition that no law may be adopted and  no tax may be imposed without its consent.    Evaluating the present position of the unions of the  republic, we believe that they are failing to display due  persistence and scrupulousness in the defense of the interests  of the working people and the unemployed, and in assuring high  employment and higher pay, with regard to the galloping rate of  price rises for consumer goods and services, and also on matters  of an improvement in work conditions. The traditional collective  contracts between the employers and the unions have become an  empty formality. A reform of the unions would be expedient under  these conditions.    Structural policy, whose purpose is the development of the  consumer sector and an increase in export potential, should be  flexible and "sparing" in order to preserve the structures whose  elimination or reduction would cause a sharp increase in  unemployment. Power engineering and the branches of the economy  without which effective structural changes are impossible  require serious government support. Investments here should be  tax-exempt, and the public sector should for the transitional  period be determined as a percentage.    Agrarian policy is determining in the surmounting of the  food  and raw material crisis, in an improvement in society's dietary  ration and the environmental situation, and in the recuperation  of the social position of the countryside. A diversity of forms  of land ownership should be established in the countryside to  ensure that agrarian policy really serves these goals. It is  essential to free the high-income kolkhozes and sovkhozes from  administrative-economic interference, and they should be  reorganized only in accordance with the wishes of the employees,  farmers, and other structures.    It would be expedient to submit for public consideration the  question of the differentiated (in terms of the natural and  climatic zones of the republic) transfer of the land to the  peasants, but without the right to purchase or sell it for 20-25  years. The state is called upon to ensure the parity of the  price of food and agricultural raw material on the one hand, and  goods for the inhabitants of the countryside and agricultural  production on the other.    The social policy of the transition to a market economy  should prompt the citizens to socioeconomic activity, preventing  the formation of dependent sentiments among the able-bodied part  of the populace.    A system of material and spiritual support for those who  objectively are incapable of ensuring by their own labor  satisfaction of a minimum of consumption and cultural  requirements should be created in the republic.    Henceforward, until the economy has recovered and the social  position of the populace has strengthened, the state is required  to regularly (not less than quarterly) index wages, pensions,  allowances, lump-sum payments, and grants and the public's  savings bank deposits.    Pensions should be paid on the basis of fair  differentiation--with regard not simply to length of service but  also to previous labor contribution and services to society and  the republic. Mother and child, particularly in environmentally  unfortunate areas, are in need of serious social protection. The  economic costs of the transitional period and the manifestly  insufficient attention of the state authorities have  predetermined the extremely calamitous position of institutions  of public education, health care, and research.    We consider urgent an increase in government appropriations  to these spheres, thanks to a reduction in the swollen  administrative machinery of the organs of power and  administration and thousands of contrived positions in the  national economy included. A society in which institutions of  public education, health care, research, and culture and their  employees are tied to the residual principle of distribution  cannot be morally healthy.    Employment policy, being geared not only to a solution of  problems of the training, retraining, and improvement of the  employees and jobs for the able-bodied part of the population  which is not in work, should serve as a factor of the relaxation  of social tension, a reduction in the level of crime, and a  strengthening of public morals. For this reason, it is essential  together with the measures that are being implemented currently  for the creation of jobs in the republic to legislatively offer  the enterprises the opportunity to provide with jobs young  people, mothers, the handicapped, and retirees who did not work  earlier. The resources allocated for social programs shall be  tax-exempt.    Inasmuch as, by virtue of a number of factors, the problem  of  jobs for all the unemployed cannot be resolved in the republic  itself, the Republic of Tajikistan should acquire the status of  a developing state. This would give the unemployed the right of  travel from the republic (on a contract basis for work in  foreign countries, with their remuneration by international  standards).    Foreign economic policy should serve as an appreciable  support in the recovery of the economy and the social sphere of  Tajikistan. But foreign economic relations should not be of any  ideological focus here.    It is expedient to undertake national-state building in  multinational Tajikistan on the basis of a balance of the real  interests of the republic and the oblasts of Tajikistan.    We support a clear separation of the legislative, executive,  and judicial authorities, with the unconditional supremacy of  the law. We believe together with this that realization of the  commonly accepted right of the peoples to self-determination  should not conflict with civil rights or stimulate trends toward  national-state exclusiveness or a one-sided orientation in  foreign policy and a weakening and severance of economic and  spiritual ties to the states that are members of the CIS.    The spiritual potential and cultural wealth of the Republic  of Tajikistan are of world significance and an integral part of  general civilization. But Tajikistan's integration in the world  civilization process is impossible without the imperative of  social reforms in the sphere of education, science, culture, and  health care. The state is required to materially support the  employees of these spheres and the scientific-pedagogical and  artistic intelligentsia in their struggle against the onerous  and humiliating consequences of the economic crisis and the  uncontrolled transition to market relations and adopt effective  measures to stabilize the situation and consolidate all  political parties and public organizations of the republic and  adopt constructive measures that will contribute to the  speediest development and formation of a democratic secular  state.</p>

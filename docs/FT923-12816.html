			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: Revised warning at Cigna hits confidence CIGNA, one of the largest composite insurers in the US, warned yesterday that its second-quarter results would be below analysts' expectations. It gave no specific reason, and made the announcement at the instigation of the New York Stock Exchange. Cigna shares fell by Dollars 1 1/8 on Tuesday to Dollars 55 1/8 , before trading was halted. When trading resumed yesterday morning, Cigna had recovered Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 54 3/8 . Analysts had already been predicting a fall in earnings, year-on-year when Cigna reports figures for the quarter on August 3. Earnings per share were forecast, on average, to be around Dollars 1.25, compared with Dollars 1.88 in the same period a year earlier. Most pundits had expected a good performance from the life and health business, but warned that the property-casualty operations would be hit by heavy catastrophe losses - including the impact of the Los Angeles riots, the London bombings, and weather-related claims in the US. Cigna's mortgage loan portfolio is also seen as a problem area, with the US west coast property market continuing to weaken.</p>

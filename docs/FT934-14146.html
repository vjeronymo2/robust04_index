			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Wall St firms agree contributions ban: Self-imposed step will have impact on future local elections A GROUP of 15 of Wall Street's most powerful investment banking and securities firms have agreed to stop making political contributions to US government officials and election candidates who could award them contracts to underwrite issues of local government securities. The agreement on the voluntary ban, which has earned the support of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was officially unveiled at the SEC in Washington yesterday. The group, including industry leaders Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney Shearson, Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers, urged law firms, accountants, financial advisers and other companies involved in the municipal finance process to join the ban. A leading New York law firm, Skadden Arps, was part of yesterday's pact. Wall Street has been considering ending political contributions related to the municipal bond business for over a year, but publicity surrounding several recent political scandals helped persuade the firms to reach early agreement. No criminal action has been taken over any of the recent scandals, but they reinforced the assumption among many voters that some Wall Street firms may have been making financial contributions to local politicians in the hope of bond underwriting business worth millions of dollars. Yesterday's signatories said they hoped their initiative would restore public confidence in the municipal securities market. The ban will have a considerable impact on future local elections across the US, because securities and investment banking firms have traditionally been among some of the biggest financial backers of city and state politicians campaigning for public office. Mr Arthur Levitt, SEC chairman, said he remained concerned that some firms might try to use political contributions by consultants, affiliates or employees to attempt to influence municipal finance decision-making. The ban should soon be backed by a new federal regulation proposed by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. It is expected to come into effect later this year or early 1994.</p>

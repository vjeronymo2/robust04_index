			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: French buy for Coutts Consulting - Placing and open offer to fund GBA purchase for up to FFr85.9m Coutts Consulting Group, the career consultancy, outplacement and residential training company, yesterday agreed to acquire GBA Group of France for a maximum FFr85.9m (Pounds 10.1m). The proposed acquisition of GBA, one of the leading outplacement and career counselling groups in France with 130 employees, will consolidate Coutts' position as Europe's largest outplacement group with 33 offices in six countries. Mr Stephen Johnson, chief executive, said the deal would enable the expanded group to serve its multinational clients across Europe better. He said the expansion of outplacement operations into continental Europe had been a vital element in the strategy for developing the group. Coutts will pay an initial FFr47.2m, including FFr39.7m in cash, with the balance satisfied through the issue of 971,366 shares to the vendors. Up to a further Pounds 4.5m will be paid subject to GBA meeting profit targets in 1994 and 1995. GBA reported pre-tax profits of FFr7.7m for 1993. The acquisition will be funded in part through a placing and open offer at 85p designed to raise Pounds 6.4m including Pounds 1.1m net of new money. The shares are being offered on the basis of 8 new shares for every 29 existing shares and 13.137 new shares for every 100 convertible preference shares. The 7.56m new shares have been conditionally placed with institutional shareholders by Collins Stewart, subject to claw-back. Coutts' shares closed unchanged yesterday at 91p. Part of the proceeds of the share issue will be used to pay Pounds 730,000 of dividend arrears on convertible preference shares, enabling the group to resume dividend payments on the ordinary shares at the interim stage later this year. The company has undergone a substantial restructuring over the past 30 months, including replacing Mr Barry Topple, its chief executive, and appointing Sir Kit McMahon, former chairman of Midland Bank, as non-executive chairman. Following the acquisition and the completion of the sale of Winkfield Place, the group's vacant Berkshire property, for Pounds 1.4m due at the end of May, the enlarged group will have net borrowings of Pounds 4m, equivalent to gearing of about 50 per cent.</p>

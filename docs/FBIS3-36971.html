The  newspaper informs its readers of a meeting held by the Interior  Ministry collegium, which called on the Russian Government "not  to save money on support for law enforcement bodies".    The same newspaper writes about a legislative initiative by  the Russia's Choice faction at the State Duma (lower house of  the Russian parliament) on crime control considered by the  faction as the main present-day problem.    However, the newspaper notes, the Russia's Choice initiative  is blocked at the Duma by the factions of Agrarians, Communists  and the Liberal Democratic Party.    Pointing to the fact that "a new stage starts in the  development of organised crime in Russia", the NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA newspaper regards this as "the beginning of political  terrorism".    The same newspaper states that "Russia now experiences dire  hunger for an ideology of reforms". It notes in this connection  that "the creation of an economic policy out of illusory  contradictory ideas on restoring industry and on continued cuts  of state expenditures has now more to do with public relations  than with real possibilities of the government to pursue this  policy".    Newspapers also concentrate attention on the continuing  strike by mine builders at some collieries in Vorkuta (Russia's  north). Noting that Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin will meet the  miners' delegation on Friday, the TRUD newspaper expresses hope  that the conflict will be settled.    The PRAVDA newspaper, comparing mining strikes with "a  winter  hurricane after a shock therapy", stresses that other strikes  also started. For instance, "Thousands of lecturers from  hundreds of Russian higher educational establishments" went on  strike.    TRUD features an interview with Chairman of the State  Property Committee Anatoliy Chubays, dealing with progress in  privatisation in Russia.    Examining the situation with privatisation in Russia, he  notes that "to all appearances, privatisation has been  accomplished. It has been accomplished, despite the fierce  resistance of bureaucratic structures at all levels and some  political forces".    Commenting on the results of a trip by Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev to Central Asian republics, the KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA newspaper stresses that "the joint statement made by the  Russian and Uzbek Foreign Ministries in Tashkent on February 9  reflects the principal position on Afghanistan".    "Apart from expressing deep concern over events in the  neighbouring state, the statement confirms principles of strict  neutrality and non-interference in Afghanistan's domestic  affairs."    The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper carries an article by  prominent American politilogist Steven Cohen entitled "Who Lost  Russia". The author writes that "seriously wounded, polarised  and riled Russia direly needs reasonable, concerted and gradual  reforms".    He notes in this connection that a broad coalition of  Russian  moderate centrist politicians seeks to become a political force  which could review the process of reforms.    This moderate bloc is Russia's hope, possibly, its last  chance to carry out democratic changes based on market  relations, Cohen stresses.    Commenting on international events, the press singles out  the  aggravated problem of the Bosnian crisis. Newspapers point to  the determination of NATO, using the ultimatum put forth before  Bosnian Serbs, to tackle the problem by force.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA points to different approaches of NATO  and Russia to this problem. The newspaper even writes that  "although it is highly improbable, but a full-scale war may  break out nine days later" (eds: deadline of NATO's ultimatum to  Serbs).</p>

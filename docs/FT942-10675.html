			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Memory fails Bond in asset hearings: The court questioning of a bankrupt Australian tycoon For the past week Alan Bond has sat in a packed Sydney courtroom facing a barrage of questions about the whereabouts of his former assets. The questions have come from the former tycoon's bankruptcy trustee, appointed by the court to act on behalf of his creditors, and from the liquidator of Dallhold Investments, Mr Bond's privately-owned investment holding company. These are the hearings which the Perth-based entrepreneur had long sought to avoid, saying that illness, depression and brain damage resulting from open-heart surgery rendered him unfit to take the stand. Now that he is under oath in the witness-box in terms of Australia's bankruptcy procedures, his performance has ranged from that of a sorrowful amnesiac to a feisty barracker. Starting with a one-man painting company, Mr Bond built an international media, brewing and property business led by Bond Corporation Holdings, a quoted flagship with assets of about ADollars 10bn (Pounds 4.8bn). It all began to fall apart with the stock market crash of 1987 and ended in bankruptcy in 1992 with debts and contingent liabilities of more than ADollars 700m. The main contention of Mr Francis Douglas QC, acting for the bankruptcy trustee, is that a series of companies or trusts were set up in the Channel Islands during the 1970s and 1980s to hold Mr Bond's personal assets, but that these were never declared in the statement of affairs when Mr Bond went bankrupt in 1992. The names of the entities included Kirk Holdings, Icarus Trust, Engetal, Piaonla, Bittern, Lindsay Trading, and Panamanian-registered Juno Equities, which supposedly operates out of Switzerland. According to the trustee, Kirk Holdings was used to buy property in the UK, paintings from Neville Keating Pictures, art consultants of London, shares (including shares in Bond Corporation) and horses for Mr Bond's daughter, Suzanne. According to Mr Douglas, it eventually became too well-known as a 'Bond company' after Suzanne's divorce proceedings in 1987 and was wound up, its assets being transferred to Juno. Mr Douglas has produced enough paper work to suggest that Kirk Holdings was dealing in large sums. In late 1986, for example, Kirk allegedly instructed Touche Ross's Jersey office, via Allied Irish Bank, to transfer USDollars 2.75m (Pounds 1.88m) to Mr Bond's account at Arbuthnot Latham, the London merchant bank. In early 1987, Dollars 541,700 went to James Capel, to buy shares on behalf of Kirk, Mr Douglas said. The trustee's problem is that Mr Bond says he cannot recall anything about most of these entities. He cannot remember Touche Ross in Jersey, which organised and administered the offshore companies. He thinks he might have been to Jersey once, but only to the airport, to sign some papers. Where evidence to the contrary has been presented - for example, bank payments or letters signed by Mr Bond - he has modified his response. Without admitting any knowledge of the Channel Islands vehicles, he has tended to suggest that they must have been related to other entities in the complex Bond group. When Mr Douglas produced a deposition (the result of a question-and-answer session with lawyers) from Mr Geoff Davies, in which the Touche Ross partner said that he believed Kirk was for the ultimate benefit of Mr Bond, his wife and his family, Mr Bond said simply that he had never dealt with Mr Davies. Mr Bond has also insisted that certain assets which the bankruptcy trustee believes were the former tycoon's, belong (or belonged) to Mr Jurg Bollag. Mr Bollag, Mr Bond acknowledges, is a Swiss businessman and friend, who was one of the four people permitted to give instructions to Touche Ross on Mr Bond's behalf. He has also helped pay Mr Bond's legal fees. Included in the Bollag category of assets was a house in Chelsea, in which Mr Bond's son lived for several years, and which was sold last year for Pounds 610,000, and a London apartment sub-leased to Diana Bliss, Mr Bond's former girlfriend. Mr Douglas asked. 'Was there any reason why Diana Bliss should be able to persuade Mr Bollag to buy and sub-lease' a property? 'I don't recall. I don't think we were seeing each other at the time. She met Mr Bollag separately,' Mr Bond replied. But while the hearings have constituted a public forum for the discovery work done by the trustee, and will, perhaps, persuade creditors that efforts are still being made on their behalf, what happens now is not clear. Pursuit of more information, via Mr Bollag in Switzerland, is a possibility and a task which the trustee has begun. But it will be time-consuming. And even if the trustee's suppositions are correct, there is little guarantee that assets will be sitting in a Swiss bank waiting to be returned. Meanwhile, hearings on behalf of the liquidator of Dallhold, which began late yesterday morning were adjourned after Mr Bond reported dizzy spells and pains in the chest.</p>

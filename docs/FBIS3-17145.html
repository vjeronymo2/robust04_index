Speaking at a press conference in Tallinn on Tuesday,  Estonian Premier Laar disapproved of the proposals that the  problem be resolved under mediation by other states put forward  by some Estonian politicians. However, he suggested that  international mediation might be useful when resolving the issue  on the borders with Russia which had reached a deadlock.    Estonia does not recognize the unification of several  regions  which belonged to Estonia under the Russian-Estonian treaty of  1920 but then were joined to Russia in 1944-1945.    Commenting on the coming round of the Estonian-Russian  negotiations on April 5-6, Estonian Premier Laar stated that  Estonia would make no concessions on the issue concerning  residence permit for Russian retired servicemen living in  Estonia.    "We will act in accordance with our legislation and we are  not going to change it," Estonian Premier Laar emphasized.  However, he believes that the treaty on the Russian troops'  withdrawal will be signed at the next round of the negotiations  despite the fact that Russia conditions this issue with the one  on retired servicemen.    There are about 2,500 Russian servicemen remaining in  Estonia  who are expected to be withdrawn by August 31, 1994.</p>

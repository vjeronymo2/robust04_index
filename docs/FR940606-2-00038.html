The petition requests that OHA formulate and implement procedures for the distribution of funds received pursuant to a consent order entered into by the DOE and Telum, Inc. (Telum).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Telum was a ``reseller-retailer'' of ``covered products'' as those terms were defined in 6 CFR 150.352 and 10 CFR 212.31. Therefore, Telum was required to price middle distillate fuel in accordance with the price rule of the Mandatory Petroleum Price Regulations set forth at 10 CFR part 212, subpart F, and antecedent regulations at 6 CFR part 150, subpart L. As a result of an audit, the ERA alleged that Telum and entities under Telum's direction violated the price regulations in sales of middle distillate fuel to Salt River Project (Salt River) during a five month period from December 1, 1973, through April 30, 1974 (the audit period). <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The auditors determined that during this period Telum made sales of middle distillates to Salt River at prices in excess of the maximum lawful selling price (MLSP) permitted by the regulations. Consequently, the ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Telum on May 28, 1980, alleging pricing violations in the sale of middle distillate fuel to Salt River. After revising its selection of the ``nearest comparable outlet'' with regard to the ``new market'' determination under 10 CFR 212.111(b), the ERA issued an Amended PRO on September 15, 1986, alleging that Telum had overcharged Salt River in its sales of middle distillate fuel in the amount of $357,587. On April 7, 1988, that Amended PRO was remanded by OHA to the ERA, for a new determination regarding Telum's nearest comparable outlet and a recalculation of MLSPs and any overcharges in sales to Salt River. Telum, Inc., 17 DOE &para;83,010 (1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Telum was incorporated as Bonus Oil Company on August 13, 1968. Bonus Oil Company's name was changed to Telum, Inc. effective December 3, 1974. For the purposes of this Decision, we will refer to the firm only as Telum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other entities under Telum's direction, as listed in the consent order, are: Industrial Fuels, Inc., an Arizona Corporation, and Giraud Corporation, a Utah corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ERA did not issue a second Amended PRO. Instead, on May 30, 1990, the DOE entered into a consent order (No. 820H00020Z) with Telum to resolve all administrative and civil claims related to Telum's compliance with the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations in its resale transactions of petroleum products during the period December 1, 1973 through April 30, 1974. Specifically, Telum agreed to remit $60,000, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in an interest-bearing escrow account. Telum has remitted $56,149.35 to the DOE, consisting of $51,626.18 toward payment of the $60,000 principal amount due and $4,523.17 toward payment of interest due on principal. The DOE has authorized a write-off of the remainder of the amount due for reasons of uncollectability. Telum is no longer in business, and Earl K. Cook, the former president of Telum, has indicated that he is unable to pay the remainder of the amount due. As of March 31, 1994, $9,028.85 in interest had accrued in the DOE escrow account on the amount paid by Telum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Jurisdiction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The procedural regulations of the DOE set forth general guidelines by which the Office of Hearings and Appeals may formulate and implement a plan of distribution for funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. 10 CFR part 205, subpart V. It is the DOE policy to use the subpart V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion of subpart V and the authority of the Office of Hearings and Appeals to fashion procedures to distribute refunds obtained as part of consent orders, see Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE &para;82,553 (1982); Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE &para;82,508 (1981); Office of Enforcement, 8 DOE &para;82,597 (1981). After reviewing the record in the present case, we have concluded that a subpart V proceeding is an appropriate mechanism for distributing the Telum consent order fund. We therefore propose to grant the ERA's petition and assume jurisdiction over distribution of the fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

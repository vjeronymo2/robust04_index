			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Dissidents oust Etonbrook board REBEL shareholders at Etonbrook Properties yesterday wrested control of the former BES company from the board, ousted the directors and pledged expansion with new capital. The board's removal at an extraordinary meeting marked the climax of a bitter 10-month struggle and a victory for property dealer Mr Andrew Perloff, the rebel leader. Shareholders with 51 per cent of the 2.9m voting shares backed nine resolutions dismissing the board and appointing the rebel leaders as directors. Welcoming the result, Mr Perloff - who with his associates owns 29.9 per cent of Etonbrook - said he hoped to provide 'an exit route' at 79p a share for investors wishing to sell. When he purchased a 19.4 per cent stake last summer, Mr Perloff paid 67p. The shares closed down 2p yesterday at 77p. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Perloff warned there was no guarantee that he would now make a bid for Etonbrook. He pledged instead to concentrate on generating income from the commercial property and warehouse portfolio and told shareholders that bankers had tentatively offered Pounds 10m to expand the business. The outgoing board said the rebels had gained control 'by the backdoor' and Mr Keith Moss, managing director, accused Mr Perloff of using the prospect of negotiating an agreed takeover to dilute opposition to his moves. 'We should have fought more aggressively. Shareholders were waiting for an agreed offer which wasn't forthcoming,' Mr Moss said. He also claimed the rebels had used delaying tactics during talks on a general offer so that the issue would not be resolved before yesterday's meeting, which was requisitioned last month. Fighting the rebel action had cost the company up to Pounds 250,000 and prevented it from moving forward, he added. Mr Perloff rejected the claims and blamed the delays on Etonbrook's failure to agree terms and a decision by the Takeover Panel not to allow a two stage takeover involving a partial offer at 79p followed by an offer for the rest at a price and time to be agreed. The new board, meanwhile, announced plans to embark on a detailed study of Etonbrook's business and in particular its relationship with Palmerston Investment Trust, which holds more than 1m preference shares.</p>

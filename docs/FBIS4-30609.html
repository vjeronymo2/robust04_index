			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- A prominent businessman  said Monday [27 June] Japan should urge the United States to  raise interest rates and cut its deficit in order to cap the  sharp appreciation of the yen against the dollar.    In a statement released Monday, Takeshi Nagano, president of  the Japan Federation of Employers Association, said he is  worried about the impact on the economy of the dollar's collapse  and the political turmoil resulting from Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata's resignation.    Nagano warned an excessive appreciation of the yen could  kill  the Japanese manufacturing sector.    He called on the government for a speedy stimulation of  domestic demand through deregulation and the opening of Japanese  markets to imports.    The dollar temporarily plummeted to a new post World War II  lows of 99.50 yen Monday morning in Tokyo.</p>

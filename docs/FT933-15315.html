			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Survey of Lebanon (2): It's going to take time and money - Blueprint for Reconstruction MR RAFIK HARIRI'S masterplan to rebuild Lebanon, dubbed Horizon 2000, was unveiled on March 17, 1993, less than 18 months after the last shell of the civil war added its part to 17 years of destruction. By that time the country's infrastructure was in a severe state of disrepair: Beirut's city centre was a wasteland of prime real estate, only 30 per cent of the country's telephone lines were in order, electricity supplies were minimal, water was in short supply and often polluted, and the country's other public services were on the verge of total collapse. The announcement of the plan was greeted with euphoria. Nearly four months on and visibly very little has altered. The initial excitement has given way to cautious optimism. Lebanese are slowly realising that the formidable scheme will take time, considerable external aid, and a sustained turnaround in the political and economic situation. While most wait impatiently for the government's promises to materialise, the Council of Development and Reconstruction (CDR), which is the power-house behind Horizon 2000, has been preparing the ground. The CDR, originally set up in 1977, was resuscitated by Mr Hariri in 1991, before he took power, to oversee the reconstruction programme. It is a dynamic and fairly semi-autonomous administrative body which aims to sidestep government bureaucracy. This has led to some friction between the CDR and various ministries, but overall it has been highly successful. Essential infrastructure - electricity, telecommunications, water, sewerage, schools, hospitals - and the reform of government institutions have been given priority. The rehabilitation and development of Beirut's international airport, the ports, and lavish plans for the downtown city centre are still either on the drawing board or waiting to overcome bureaucratic hurdles. The total cost of Horizon 2000 is estimated at Dollars 13bn at current prices over 10 years (Dollars 10bn at constant prices). So far the CDR has managed to raise Dollars 1.2bn in grants, soft and commercial loans. Of this, in spite of Mr Hariri's excellent Gulf credentials, only Dollars 250m has come from Arab funds. Italy is the foremost foreign donor having signed protocols worth Dollars 450m. The EC and European Investment Bank (EIB) have committed Dollars 285m and the World Bank Dollars 175m. According to Mr Nohad Baroudi, the CDR's secretary-general, the government expects to raise a total of 36 per cent of the nominal capital, less than Dollars 4bn, in loans and aid. The rest will be financed by internal borrowing and government revenue. For an economy that registered a GDP of only Dollars 3.5bn-Dollars 4bn last year, such sums will be difficult to deliver. The CDR and government firmly believe that private investment and foreign aid will flow as a result of increased business confidence in Lebanon. But until the country rehabilitates its basic infrastructure, and political stability appears more assured, investors and donors are bound to remain circumspect. THE CENTRE OF BEIRUT The jewel in the crown of Horizon 2000 is the reconstruction of Beirut's central district. The area, which covers 784,609 square metres of real estate, was previously the zone which bridged the east and west sides of the divided city during the war. Its collapsed buildings, riddled with shell holes, suffered the brunt of the fighting and over 60 per cent of the area has to be completely demolished and cleared. A masterplan for its reconstruction has been prepared by the Lebanese consultancy company Dar al Handasah. It aims to resemble the Beirut of pre-1975, with its lively souks and residential areas, while at the same time creating an international business and banking centre. Before major reconstruction could begin, a solution had to be found to the myriad ownership and tenants' rights to the land and buildings. With an estimated 50,000 possible claims of ownership the government responded by passing an ingenious, although controversial, law in November 1991 to facilitate the setting up of a real estate company. Solidere, the company which is due to be formalised soon, will represent the property owners while also raising capital needed to fulfil the area's rebirth. Its creation will follow a final judgment by a government committee on the value of the real estate, currently put at Dollars 1.073bn (averaging Dollars 1,400 per square metre). Property owners will then have the choice of either exchanging their land rights for shares in the company or reclaiming property, for a fee, and carrying the expenses of reconstruction which has to be completed within two years. Shares will also be sold to private investors at a total value equal to that of the area's land value. This should raise over Dollars 1bn in cash for construction work. Priority will be given to the property owners, the Lebanese government, and then other Arab nationals. Individual holdings will be limited to 10 per cent. Construction companies will be invited to bid for the work and Mr Nasser Chamaa, secretary general of the Board of Founders charged with establishing Solidere, predicts that extensive reconstruction will begin in earnest by the end of this year and will continue in the next century. RESTORING ELECTRICITY In the power sector, work is underway to increase electricity generating capacity from 400 MegaWatts to 1,000 MW by the end of the year, and eventually 1.500 MW, at the cost of about Dollars 300m. As most people in Beirut receive only around six hours of government supplied electricity a day, and far less outside the city, the sector is a priority for the CDR. Italy's Ansaldo Energia has won a Dollars 66m contract to repair existing power stations. South Korea's Hyundai Corporation is to supply transmission equipment for Dollars 80m, and France's Bouygues has out-bid rivals to supply Dollars 44m worth of equipment. Electricite de France is acting as consultant on the project to the CDR which hopes to provide power 24 hours a day within 18 months. The project is being partly financed by Dollars 110m from Arab funds, Dollars 30m from the Italian protocol and Dollars 35m from the World Bank. MILLION NEW PHONES Over the next 18 months, more than 1m new telephone lines are expected to be installed at a nominal cost of Dollars 80m. There are currently around 350,000 local lines and 700 international lines in operation. France's Alcatel-CIT and Sweden's Ericsson have each been awarded contracts to install around 270,000 lines, worth Dollars 22m to each company. Germany's Siemens is currently negotiating the installation of 385,000 lines for Dollars 40m. Meanwhile, MCI International has set up a direct-dial international service that can offer up to 5,000 lines. Parliament has also approved a law to allow the establishment of a local cellular telephone network of up to 250,000 lines. Work is being partly financed by some Dollars 90m from the Kuwait Development Fund and Dollars 15m from the Italian protocol. TRANSPORTATION Beirut International Airport is set for substantial expansion over the next four years. Plans include a new runway, 16km of runway approaches, the rehabilitation and expansion of terminal buildings to handle 6m passengers a year, and a new air traffic control tower, along with a hotel, conference centre and an extensive duty free shopping area. The Dollars 350m package goes for tender later this year. Mr Hariri has boasted that the airport will be one of the most modern in the world when completed in 1997, although it is not yet clear how it will be financed. Beirut's main port is also to be upgraded with a new container terminal and a 280m breakwater extension to be added to the fourth basin. The first two basins need to be cleared of vessels hit by shells during the war, and loading equipment and the port's technology will be modernised. The total package will cost around Dollars 150m and finance is expected to come from the EIB and Arab funds. Lebanon's two other main ports, Tripoli in the north and Sidon in the south, are also to be improved. The CDR plans to inject Dollars 10m into Tripoli, which handles petroleum, and Dollars 7m into Sidon. In addition, a Dollars 2bn upgrading of Lebanon's roads, which will include a Beirut ringroad, a Beirut-Damascus motorway, and a coastal motorway, is expected to take place over the next 10 years. Plans for this are still at an early stage. WATER AND SEWERS None of the country's six sewage treatment plants is in operation and the water supply system works at less than 60 per cent of capacity, with 50 per cent of the water lost through leakages. The CDR is pre-qualifying contractors to upgrade the water and wastewater systems, and provide solid waste disposal equipment and compactor trucks. New landfill areas are also to be developed to prevent further dumping of waste along the coastline. This is of particular concern in Beirut where there is a vast rubbish tip on the sea shore. The total nominal cost of work is expected to be around Dollars 300m and completion is scheduled within 18 months. Finance will come from the World Bank, the EIB and Arab funds. SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS The war severely disrupted state education at all levels and 1,270 schools throughout the country are in need of rehabilitation at an estimated cost of Dollars 65m. Contracts are at the pre-qualification stage and work is expected to begin later this year, as is a Dollars 20m rehabilitation programme for the country's only state university, L'Universite Libanaise. Money will come from the World Bank and the EEC. Horizon 2000 also entails a long term Dollars 800m restructuring of the state school system which will close some of the smaller classrooms in rural areas and provide transport to larger schools with more facilities. As in education, the scarcity of adequate facilities in health care was compensated for by the private sector. According to the Minister of Health, there are currently 700 public sector beds against 7,000-8,000 private ones. A rehabilitation programme of 17 of the country's 24 state hospitals will begin this year at a nominal cost of Dollars 67m. A Dollars 14.5m plan to build two new district hospitals is underway. Finance will come from French and Italian protocols, and Arab funds.</p>

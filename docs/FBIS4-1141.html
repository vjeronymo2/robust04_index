			<p>CSO   <F P=106>   ["Bill of Rights" issued by ANC Department of Information </F> and Publicity -- page numbers in original Table of Contents do  not correspond to translated version; all quotation marks,  square brackets as published]    [Text]  CONTENTS    Article 1:Equality2    Article 2:Personal Rights3    Article 3:Political Rights7    Article 4:Freedom of Speech, Assembly and Information  8    Article 5:Rights of Association, Religion, Language and  Culture9    Article 6:Workers' Rights11    Article 7:Women's Rights13    Article 8:Gender Rights14    Article 9:Disabled Persons15    Article 10:Children16    Article 11:Introductory Note17    Article 12:Land and the Environment19    Article 13:Property22    Article 14:Affirmative Action24    Article 15:Positive Measures25    Article 16:Limitations27    Article 17:Enforcement29    Article 18:Measures for Control and Accountability during  a State of National Defence or Emergency32    Article 19:Proclamation of Defence and Emergency  Measures33    Article 20:Supervisory Power of National Assembly34    Article 21:Non-derogable Rights36    Article 22:Detention in Times of National Defence or  Emergency37    Article 23: Expropriation and Commandeering of Property  in Times of National Defence or Emergency38  (March 1993)  <H5>  INTRODUCTION </H5>   In the light of a vast number of comments received in many  forms on the Draft Bill of Rights prepared by the Constitutional  Committee of the ANC, this new text has been prepared.    NOTE:The notes are intended to draw  attention to controversial areas--they do not form part of the  text.  <H5>  ARTICLE 1. EQUALITY </H5>   (1) All South Africans are born free and equal in  dignity and rights.    (2) No individual or group shall receive privileges or  be subjected to discrimination, domination or abuse on the  grounds of race, colour, language, gender, or creed, political  or other opinion, birth or other status.    (3) All men and women shall have equal protection under  the law.  <H5>  ARTICLE 2. PERSONAL RIGHTS </H5> <H5>  The Right to Life </H5>   (1) Every person has the right to life.    (2) No-one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her  life.    (3) Capital punishment is abolished and no further  executions shall take place.    NOTE:The question has been raised as to  whether the use of the phrase `right to life' indicates an  anti-abortion position in the Constitution. In our view, the  issue is left open in this clause. We feel the matter should be  left open for legislative action after democratic discussion in  future. The issue needs sensitive and informed debate with  extensive participation by all interested parties and a respect  for differing views. Uninformed debate could be extremely  divisive and distract attention from the basic question of equal  political rights. The Constitution should not in any way  pre-empt proper debate. We regard the issue as of great  importance and would recommend that it receive high priority as  soon as democratic institutions are in place.  <H5>  The Right to Dignity </H5>   (4) No-one shall be subjected to slavery, servitude or  forced labour, provided that forced labour shall not include  work normally required of someone carrying out a sentence of a  court, nor military service or national service by a  conscientious objector, nor services required in the case of  calamity or serious emergency, nor any work which forms part of  normal civil obligations.    (5) The dignity of all persons shall be respected.    (6) No-one shall be subjected to torture or cruel,  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.    (7) Everyone shall have the right to appropriate  protection by law against violence, harassment or abuse, or the  impairment of his or her dignity.  <H5>  The Right to a Fair Trial </H5>   (8) No-one shall be deprived of his or her liberty except  after due process of law, and the courts shall have the right to  order the release of any person held without due legal  authority.    (9) There shall be no detention without trial, banishment  or house-arrest. Legislation may provide for legitimate  restriction of movement in relation to illegal immigrants and  persons of unsound mind.    (10) No persons shall be arrested or detained for any  purpose other than that of bringing them to trial on a criminal  charge.    (11) Arrest shall take place according to procedures laid  down by law, and persons taken into custody shall immediately be  informed of the charges against them, shall have access to a  legal representative of their choice, and shall be brought  before court within 48 hours or, where that would be a Sunday or  a public holiday, on the first working day thereafter.    (12) Bail shall be granted to awaiting-trial persons  unless a court rules that in the interests of justice they  should be kept in custody.    (13) No-one shall be deprived of liberty or subjected to  other punishment except after a fair trial by an independent  court.    (14) Trials shall take place within a reasonable time.    (15) Everyone shall be presumed innocent until proved  guilty.    (16) No conduct shall be punished if it was not a  criminal offence at the time of its occurrence, and no penalty  shall be increased retrospectively.    (17) No-one shall be tried or punished twice for the same  offence.    (18) Accused persons shall be informed in writing of the  nature of the allegations against them, and shall be given  adequate time to prepare and conduct their defence.    (19) Everything that is reasonable shall be done to  ensure that accused persons understand the nature and the import  of the charges against them and of the proceedings, that they  are not prejudiced through illiteracy or lack of understanding,  and that they receive a fair trial.    (20) Accused persons shall have the right to challenge  all evidence presented against them, to be defended by a legal  practitioner of their choice, and if in custody, to have access  to a legal practitioner at all reasonable times.    (21) If a person is unable to pay for legal  representation, and the interests of justice so require, the  State shall provide or pay for a competent defence.    (22) No persons shall be required to give evidence  against themselves, nor, except in cases of domestic violence or  abuse, shall persons be required to give evidence against their  spouses, whether married by civil law or custom, their parents  or their children.    (23) No evidence obtained through torture or cruel,  inhuman or degrading treatment shall be admissible in any  proceedings.    (24) Juveniles shall be separated from adult offenders.    (25) Punishment imposed by any Court shall be humane and  any term of imprisonment shall be reviewed periodically.  <H5>  The Right to Judicial Review </H5>   (26) Any person adversely affected in his or her rights,  entitlements or legitimate expectations by an administrative or  executive act shall be entitled to have the matter reviewed by  an independent court or tribunal on the grounds of irregularity,  including abuse of authority, going beyond the powers granted by  law, bad faith, or such (gross) unreasonableness in relation to  the procedure or the decision as to amount to manifest  injustice.    NOTE:This clause will in all likelihood have  to be revised in the light of recommendations of the workshop,  held in Cape Town early in 1993, on the future of the  Administrative law and also after further discussions.  <H5>  The Right to Home Life </H5>   (27) No-one shall be deprived of or removed from his or  her home on the grounds of race, colour, language, gender or  creed.    (28) The privacy of the home shall be respected, save  that reasonable steps shall be permitted to prevent domestic  violence or abuse.    (29) People shall have the right to establish families,  live together with partners of their choice and to marry.    (30) Marriage shall be based upon the free consent of the  partners, and spouses shall enjoy equal rights at and during the  marriage and on its dissolution.    NOTE:Many people marry by ante-nuptial  contract, and thereby create separate property regimes for the  husband and wife. Should this situation be over-ridden by the  above clause? Should there be specific reference to possible  legislation on matrimonial property taking into account a just  distribution on termination of the marriage [union]?  <H5>  The Right of Privacy </H5>   (31) No search or entry shall be permitted except for  reasonable cause, as prescribed by law, and as would be  acceptable in an open and democratic society.    (32) Interference with private communications, spying on  persons and the compilation and keeping of secret files about  them without their consent, shall not be permissible save as  authorised by law in circumstances that would be acceptable in  an open and democratic society.  <H5>  The Right of Movement </H5>   (33) All South Africans shall have the right without  discrimination to move freely and reside in any part of the  country, to receive a passport, travel abroad and to emigrate if  he or she so wishes.  <H5>  The Right to Conscience </H5>   (34) The right to conscience shall be inviolate, and  no-one shall be penalised for his or her beliefs.    (35) No-one shall be required to bear arms or perform  military service against his or her conscientious beliefs.    NOTE: The question of whether there should  be conscription is left open. There are strong arguments for and  against the concept of serving in the armed forces as a  constitutionally acceptable duty. In any case, the right of  conscientious objection should be respected.  <H5>  ARTICLE 3. POLITICAL RIGHTS </H5>   (1) South Africa shall be a multi-party democracy in  which all citizens shall enjoy basic political rights on an  equal basis.    NOTE: Is it necessary to include the word  `citizens'? Should we not return to the earlier formulation:  `all men and women'?    (2) Government at all levels shall be subject to the  principles of accountability to the electorate.    (3) Elections shall be conducted in accordance with an  electoral law which shall make no distinction on the grounds of  race, colour, language, gender or creed.    (4) Elections shall be regular, free and fair and based  on universal franchise and a common voters' roll.    (5) All men and women entitled to vote shall be entitled  to stand for and occupy any position or office in any organ of  government or administration.    (6) All citizens shall have the right to form and join  political parties and to campaign for social, economic and  political change, either directly or through freely chosen  representatives.  <H5>  ARTICLE 4. FREEDOM OF SPEECH, ASSEMBLY AND INFORMATION </H5>   (1) There shall be freedom of thought, speech, expression  and opinion, including a free press, which shall report and  comment fairly and respect the right to reply.    NOTE: Should there be a qualification on  honest and fair reporting and comment, or would this appear to  open the way for impinging unduly on freedom of the press?    (2) All men and women shall have the right to assemble  peacefully and without arms, and to submit petitions for the  redress of grievances and injustices.    (3) All men and women shall be entitled to all the  information necessary to enable them to make effective use of  their rights as citizens, workers or consumers.  <H5>  ARTICLE 5. RIGHTS OF ASSOCIATION, RELIGION, LANGUAGE AND </H5> CULTURE  <H5>  Freedom of Association </H5>   (1) There shall be freedom of association, including the  right to form and join trade unions, religious, residents,  students, and social and cultural bodies, and to form and  participate in non-governmental organisations.    (2) Legislation shall provide for the right of such  associations to be heard in appropriate cases before any action  is taken or measures proposed by any public or private body  which could directly affect the interest of members of the  association.    NOTE: This is an entirely new constitutional  provision designed to give some measure of protection to organs  of civil society, such as religious, cultural or language  bodies, residents' associations or trade unions.  <H5>  Freedom of Religion </H5>   (3) There shall be freedom of worship and tolerance of  all religions, and no State or official religion shall be  established.    (4) The institutions of religion shall be separate from  the State, but nothing in this Constitution shall prevent them  from cooperating with the State with a view to furthering the  objectives of this Constitution, nor from bearing witness and  commenting on the actions of the State.    (5) Places associated with religious observance shall be  respected, and no-one shall be barred from entering them on  grounds of race.    Language Rights    (6) The languages of South Africa are, in alphabetical  order Afrikaans, English, Ndebele, Pedi, Sotho, Swati, Tsonga,  Tswana, Venda, Xhosa and Zulu.    NOTE: This proposal has been widely  commented on. Many countries do not have an official language or  official languages. In some countries, such as Ireland, the  official language is hardly ever used, though its existence has  considerable meaning for the inhabitants. We feel that language  rights should be general, so that languages presently  discriminated against shall have a higher status without  down-grading English and Afrikaans. Sub-section 9 is intended to  deal in a practical way with the practical difficulties  associated with multi-lingualism. The essence will be to tailor  solutions to concrete situations and give great weight to choice  and voluntary agreement in the context of acknowledging basic  rights.    (7) The State shall act positively to further the  development of these languages, especially in education,  literature and the media, to engender the respect for different  languages and to prevent the use of any language or languages  for the purpose of domination or division.    NOTE: The question of providing proper  translation services as well as encouraging multi-lingualism  becomes urgent.    (8) When it is reasonable to do so, one or more of these  languages may be designated by the National Parliament as the  language to be used for legislation or any other defined  purposes at the national level or in any region or area where it  is widely used.    (9) Subject to the availability of public and private  resources, and limitations of reasonableness, primary and  secondary education should wherever possible be offered on the  language or languages of preference of the students or their  parents.    (10) The State shall promote respect for all languages  spoken in South Africa.  <H5>  Creative Freedom </H5>   (11) There shall be freedom of artistic activity and  scientific enquiry, without censorship, subject only to such  limitations as may be imposed by law in accordance with  principles generally accepted in open and democratic  societies.  <H5>  The Right to Sporting, Recreational and Cultural Activities </H5>   (12) Sporting, recreational and cultural activities shall  be encouraged on a non-racial basis, drawing on the talents and  creative capacities of all South Africans, and autonomous  organisations may be established to achieve these  objectives.  <H5>  ARTICLE 6. WORKERS' RIGHTS </H5>   (1) Workers shall have the right to form and join trade  unions and regulate such unions without interference from the  State.    (2) Workers shall be free to join trade unions of their  choice, subject only to the rules of such unions and to the  principles of non-discrimination set out in this Constitution,  and no worker shall be victimised on account of membership of a  union.    (3) The right to organise and to bargain collectively on  any social, economic or other matter affecting workers'  interests, shall be guaranteed.    (4) In the furtherance of these rights, trade unions  shall be entitled to reasonable access to the premises of  enterprises, to receive such information as may be reasonably  necessary, and to deduct union subscriptions where  appropriate.    (5) No law shall prevent representative trade unions from  negotiating collective agreements binding on all workers covered  by such agreements.    (6) Workers shall have the right to strike under law in  pursuance of their social and economic interests subject to  reasonable limitations in respect of the interruption of  services such as would endanger the life, health or personal  safety of the community or any section of the population.    (7) Workers shall have the right to peaceful picketing,  subject only to such reasonable conditions as would be  acceptable in a democratic society.    (8) Trade unions shall have the right to participate in  lawful political activities.    (9) Trade unions shall have the right to form national  federations and to affiliate to international federations.    (10) Employers shall be required by legislation to  provide a safe and clean work environment that respects the  dignity of the workers, and to offer reasonable pay and  holidays.    (11) There shall be equal pay for work of equal value,  and equal access to employment, training and advancement.    (12) The State shall make provision by way of legislation  for compensation to be paid to workers injured in the course of  their employment and for benefits to be paid to unemployed or  retired workers.    NOTE: It has been argued that a simple  clause would be better guaranteeing trade union autonomy, the  right of collective bargaining and the right to strike. By  putting in extensive clauses, it is said, we are shifting  workers' rights from their base in industry and from being  subject to the industrial courts, to the constitutional court,  which is far more likely to favour pro-employer nineteenth  century ideas of freedom of contract. While there is obviously  merit in this argument, we feel it can be addressed by ensuring  that in industrial questions judges of the Industrial Court  participate alongside the other judges. The whole question of  the relationship between workers' rights in the Bill of Rights,  a Workers' Charter and a possible Industrial Code embodied in  legislation, needs to be looked at globally.  <H5>  ARTICLE 7. WOMEN'S RIGHTS </H5>   (1) Men and women shall enjoy equal rights in all areas  of public and private life, including employment, education and  within the family.    (2) Legislation may provide for reproductive rights, and  rights associated with child-birth and child-raising shall be  respected.    NOTE: See Note to Article 2. This is an  important question that has to be handled in a democratic way,  recognising a pluralism of opinions, and with as much  sensitivity as possible. The implication of the above  formulation is to guarantee child-birth and child-raising  rights, and to permit but not to require legislation dealing  with reproductive rights, especially rights relating to the  control of fertility.  <H5>  ARTICLE 8. GENDER RIGHTS </H5>   (1) Discrimination on the grounds of gender, single  parenthood, legitimacy of birth or sexual orientation shall be  unlawful.    (2) Legislation shall provide remedies for oppression,  abuse, harassment, or discrimination based on gender or sexual  orientation.    (3) Educational institutions, the media, advertising and  other social institutions shall be under a duty to discourage  sexual and other types of stereotyping.  <H5>  ARTICLE 9. DISABLED PERSONS </H5>   (1) There shall be no discrimination against disabled  persons.    (2) Legislation shall provide for measures to promote the  progressive opening up of employment opportunities for disabled  men and women, the removal of obstacles to the enjoyment by them  of public amenities and their integration into all areas of  life.    NOTE: This addition is in line with  recommendations by the Disabled People of South Africa, which is  actively promoting discussion amongst disabled people on their  future constitutional rights, and which points out that there  are nine million disabled persons in our country.  <H5>  ARTICLE 10. CHILDREN </H5>   (1) All children shall have the right to a name, to  health, to security, education and equality of treatment.    (2) The State shall, to the maximum of its available  resources, seek to achieve progressively the full realisation of  these rights.    (3) No child shall suffer discrimination or enjoy  privileges on the grounds of race, colour, gender, language,  creed, legitimacy or the status of his or her parents.    (4) In all proceedings concerning children, the primary  consideration shall be the best interests of the child.    (5) Children are entitled to be protected from economic  exploitation and shall not be permitted to perform work that is  likely to be hazardous or harmful to their education, health or  moral well-being.    (6) It shall be unlawful to oblige children to work or  perform services for the employers of their parents or other  family members.  <H5>  ARTICLE 11 </H5>   INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO THE FOLLOWING ARTICLES:  While the basic thinking of the Articles on social,  economic and property rights remains the same, the formulations  in these areas have been substantially re-worked. The main  difference has been to insert an entirely new section on land  rights. Coupled with this is a formulation on property rights  which gives greater emphasis to the protection of personal  possessions.    At the same time, the difficult question of how to give  meaningful protection to social or so-called second generation  rights, has been dealt with by making their presentation more  compact, and spelling out in the Enforcement section how they  should be made effective.  <H5>  SOCIAL, EDUCATIONAL AND WELFARE RIGHTS </H5>   (1) All men, women and children have the right to enjoy  basic social, educational and welfare rights.    (2) Legislation shall ensure the creation of a  progressively expanding floor of minimum rights in the social,  educational and welfare spheres for all in the country.    (3) Such legislation shall take into account national  priorities, the availability of resources and the capacity of  the beneficiaries of such rights to contribute towards the costs  involved.    (4) In order to achieve a common floor of rights for the  whole country, resources may be diverted from richer to poorer  areas, and timetables may be established for the phased  extension of legislation and minimum standards from area to  area.  <H5>  Freedom From Hunger, the Right to Shelter and the Right to </H5> Work    (5) Special attention shall be paid to securing freedom  from hunger, reducing and where possible eliminating  homelessness, unemployment and illiteracy, and to providing  basic utilities, such as water, electricity and waste disposal  for all.  <H5>  Right to Education </H5>   (6) Education shall be free and compulsory up to the age  of sixteen, and provision shall be made for facilitating access  to secondary, vocational and tertiary education on an equal  basis for all.    (7) Education shall be directed towards the development  of the human personality and a sense of personal dignity, and  shall aim at strengthening respect for human rights and  fundamental freedoms and promoting understanding, tolerance and  friendship amongst South Africans and between nations.  <H5>  Right to Health </H5>   (8) A comprehensive national health service shall be  established linking health workers, community organisations,  state institutions, private medical schemes and individual  medical practitioners so as to provide hygiene education,  preventative medicine and health care delivery to all.  <H5>  Right to a Minimum Income and Welfare Rights </H5>   (9) Comprehensive schemes of national insurance, funded  by general revenue, contributions or such other sources as may  be appropriate, shall be established to guarantee the furnishing  of old-age pensions, family income benefits, superannuation  payments, compensation for industrial injury and disease,  unemployment benefits, child benefits and such other welfare  entitlements as citizens in a modern state may expect.    NOTE: Normally in a country as developed as  South Africa, it would not be necessary to spell out the  different forms of social security that would have to be  provided. Because the limited forms of welfare started during  World War II were scrapped by apartheid, we feel it necessary to  specify the various schemes so that people understand what is  meant by social security.  <H5>  ARTICLE 12. LAND AND THE ENVIRONMENT </H5>   (1) The land, the waters and the sky and all the natural  assets which they contain, are the common heritage of the people  of South Africa who are equally entitled to their enjoyment and  responsible for their conservation.    (2) The system of property rights in relation to land  shall take into account that it is the country's primary asset,  the basis of life's necessities, and a finite resource.  <H5>  Rights to Land </H5>   (3) South Africa belongs to all who live in it.    (4) Access to land or other living space is the  birthright of all South Africans.    (5) No-one shall be removed from his or her home except  by order of a Court, which shall take into account the existence  of reasonable alternative accommodation.    (6) Legislation shall provide that the system of  administration, ownership, occupation, use and transfer of land  is equitable, directed at the provision of adequate housing for  the whole population, promotes productive use of land and  provides for stable and secure tenure.    (7) Legislation shall provide for the establishment of a  tribunal for land claims which shall have the power to  adjudicate upon land claims made on legal or equitable grounds,  and in particular shall have:    a)the power to order the restoration of land to people  dispossessed by forced removals, or where appropriate to direct  that compensation be paid, or other suitable acknowledgment be  made, for injury done to them;    b) the power to award particular portions of land, or  rights to land, to such claimants, where there are special  circumstances arising out of use, occupation or other similar  grounds, which make it equitable for such an award to be made.    (8) Legislation shall also make provision for access to  affordable land to be given as far as possible, and with due  regard to financial and other resources available to the state,  to those historically deprived of land and land rights, or  deprived of access to land by past statutory discrimination.    (9) All such legislation shall guarantee fair procedures  and be based on the principle of achieving an equitable balance  between the public interest, including the above objectives, and  the interests of those whose existing titles might be  affected.    (10) Any redistribution of land or interest in land  required to achieve the above objectives shall be subject to  just compensation which shall be determined according to the  principle of equitable balance between public interest and the  interest of those whose existing titles might be affected.    (11) In the case of a dispute regarding compensation,  provision shall be made for recourse to an independent tribunal,  with an appeal to the courts.    (12) All natural resources below and above the surface  area of the land, including the air, and all forms of potential  energy or minerals in the territorial waters, the continental  shelf and the exclusive economic zone of South Africa, which are  not otherwise owned at the time of coming into being of this  Constitution shall be vested in the state acting as trustee of  the whole nation.    (13) The State shall have the right to regulate the  exploitation of all natural resources, grant franchises and  determine royalties subject to payment of just compensation in  the event of interference with any existing title, mining right  or concession.    NOTE: Do the above provisions cover forced  removals under Group Areas Legislation?  <H5>  Environmental Rights </H5>   (14) All men and women shall have the right to a healthy  and ecologically balanced environment and the duty to defend  it.    (15) In order to secure this right, the State, acting  through appropriate agencies and organs shall conserve, protect  and improve the environment, and in particular:    a) prevent and control pollution of the air and waters  and degradation and erosion of the soil;    b) have regard in local, regional and national planning  to the maintenance or creation of balanced ecological and  biological areas and to the prevention or minimising of harmful  effects on the environment;    c) promote the rational use of natural resources,  safeguarding their capacity for renewal and ecological  stability;    d) ensure that long-term damage is not done to the  environment by industrial or other forms of waste;    e) maintain, create and develop natural reserves, parks  and recreational areas and classify and protect other sites and  landscapes so as to ensure the preservation and protection of  areas of outstanding cultural, historic and natural interest.    (16) Legislation shall provide for co-operation between  the State, non-governmental organisations, local communities and  individuals in seeking to improve the environment and encourage  ecologically sensible habits in daily life.    (17) The law shall provide for appropriate penalties and  reparation in the case of any damage caused to the environment,  and permit the interdiction by any interested person or by any  agency established for the purpose of protecting the  environment, of any public or private activity or undertaking  which manifestly and unreasonably causes or threatens to cause  irreparable damage to the environment.  <H5>  ARTICLE 13. PROPERTY </H5>   (1) All South Africans shall, without discrimination,  have the right to undisturbed enjoyment of their personal  possessions, and, individually, in association or through  lawfully constituted bodies, be entitled to acquire, hold or  dispose of property.    (2) The content and limits of these rights and the rights  to inheritance, shall be determined by law.    (3) Property rights impose obligations and their exercise  should not be in conflict with the public interest.    (4) The taking of property shall only be permissible  according to law and in the public interest, which shall include  the achievement of the objectives of the Constitution.    (5) Any such taking shall be subject to just compensation  which shall be determined by establishing an equitable balance  between the public interest and the interest of those  affected.    (6) In the case of a dispute regarding compensation,  provision shall be made for recourse to a special independent  tribunal, with an appeal to the Courts.    (7) Legislation on economic matters shall be guided by  the principle of encouraging collaboration between the public,  private, co-operative, communal and small-scale family sectors  with a view to reducing inequality, promoting growth and  providing goods and services for the whole population.    NOTE: This kind of clause would fit well  into a section called Directives of State Policy. For present  purposes we leave it here. There is much argument about whether  principles governing economic life should be in a constitution  at all. If there is strong insistence on having some  constitutional reference, then we would favour a balanced clause  such as the above.    (8) The above provisions shall not be interpreted as  impeding legislation such as might be deemed necessary in a  democratic society with a mixed economy which may be adopted  with a view to providing for the regulation or control of  property or for its use or acquisition by public or para-statal  authorities in accordance with the general interest, or which is  aimed at preserving the environment, regulating or curtailing  cartels or monopolies or securing the payment of taxes or other  contributions or penalties.    NOTE: Reference to a mixed economy may be  unnecessarily provocative both to those who favour an extensive  free market and those who wish for considerable state  intervention. It is not normal to have any constitutional  prescription on either issue.    (9) This Article shall be read subject to and in harmony  with the provisions of Article 12.  <H5>  ARTICLE 14. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION </H5>   (1) Nothing in the Constitution shall prevent the  enactment of legislation, or the adoption by any public or  private body of special measures of a positive kind designed to  procure the advancement and the opening up of opportunities,  including access to education, skills, employment and land, and  the general advancement in social, economic and cultural  spheres, of men and women who in the past have been  disadvantaged by discrimination.    (2) Any action taken in terms of the above shall not be  deemed to contradict the principle of equal rights for all South  Africans as set out in Article 1.    NOTE: The phrasing in the original text was  interpreted to mean that the principle of affirmative action  would be so powerful as to override all personal rights and  freedoms as well as to supersede the specific provisions of the  property clauses. The new formulation removes any ambiguity on  the subject, and makes it clear that its ambit is to supplement  and strengthen the equality clause, not to override other  provisions in the Bill of Rights. The property clause has  special provisions dealing with affirmative action in relation  to land. The following Article deals with special measures that  have to be taken to remove inequality.  <H5>  ARTICLE 15. POSITIVE MEASURES </H5>   NOTE: The word "affirmative action" is used  in this document only to deal with cases where in order to  overcome past discrimination special support is given to black  persons and women. Article 14 makes it clear that such kind of  intervention aimed at achieving real equality shall not be  regarded as unconstitutional, even if it expressly takes account  of race or gender. Article 15 goes beyond merely permitting  certain kinds of activity. It actually requires the taking of  steps to overcome the imbalances in our society created by  apartheid and to promote non-racism and non-sexism.    (1) In its activities and functioning, the State shall  observe the principles of non-racialism and non-sexism, and  encourage the same in all public and private bodies.    (2) All benefits conferred and entitlements granted by  the State shall be distributed on a non-racist and a non-sexist  basis.    (3) The State and all public and private bodies shall be  under a duty to prevent any form of incitement to racial,  religious or linguistic hostility and to dismantle all  structures and do away with all practices that compulsorily  divide the population on grounds of race, colour, language,  gender or creed.    (4) With a view to achieving the above, the State may  enact legislation to prohibit the circulation or possession of  materials which incite racial, ethnic, religious, gender or  linguistic hatred, which provoke violence, or which insult,  degrade, defame or encourage abuse of any racial, ethnic,  religious, gender or linguistic group.    (5) All organs of the State at the national, regional and  local levels shall pursue policies and programmes aimed at  redressing the consequences of past discriminatory laws and  practices, and at the creation of a genuine non-racial democracy  in South Africa.    (6) Such policies shall include the implementation of  programmes aimed at achieving speedily the balanced structuring  in non-racial form of the public service, defence and police  forces and the prison service according to the principles of  representativity, competence, impartiality and accountability.    (7) In taking steps to correct patterns or practices of  discrimination, special attention shall be paid to rectifying  the inequalities to which women in South Africa have been  subjected, and to ensuring their full, equal, effective and  dignified participation in the political, social, economic and  cultural life of the nation.    (8) Legislation may be enacted requiring non-governmental  organisations and private bodies to conduct themselves in  accordance with the above principles.  <H5>  ARTICLE 16. LIMITATIONS </H5>   (1) Nothing in the Constitution shall be interpreted as  implying for any group or person the right to engage in any  activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of  the rights and freedoms set forth in the Constitution, or at  their limitation or suppression to a degree other than is  authorised by the Constitution itself.    (2) Nothing in this Constitution shall be interpreted as  impeding the right of the State to enact legislation regulating  the manner in which fundamental rights and freedoms shall be  exercised, or limiting such rights, provided that such  regulation or limitation is such as might generally be deemed  necessary in an open and democratic society.    (3) Any restrictions permitted under the Constitution to  fundamental rights and freedoms shall not be applied to or used  as a cover for any purpose other than that for which they have  been expressly or by necessary implication authorised.    (4) Any law providing for any regulation or limitation of  any fundamental right or freedom shall:    a) be of general application;    b) not negate the essential content of the right, but  simply qualify the way that right is to be exercised or the  circumstances in which derogation from the right is permitted;    c) as far as practicable, identify the specific clauses  of the Constitution relied upon for the limitation of the right  and the specific clauses of the Constitution affected by the  legislation;    d) specify as precisely as possible the exact reach of  the limitation and the circumstances in which it shall  apply.    NOTE: These provisions follow the basic  format of limitation clauses used in the European Convention of  Human Rights and other similar documents. A general clause like  this is needed so as to avoid cluttering up the Bill of Rights  with detailed exceptions to each and every clause. Thus, it  would be inconvenient to have to spell out such generally  accepted limitations on freedom of speech as restrictions on  reporting the names of minor in court proceedings, or on speech  designed to put pressure on judges during a trial.  <H5>  ARTICLE 17. ENFORCEMENT </H5> <H5>  General </H5>   (1) The terms of the Bill of Rights shall be binding upon  the State and organs of government at all levels, and where  appropriate, on all social institutions and persons.    (2) The fundamental rights and freedoms contained in this  Bill of Rights shall be guaranteed by the courts.    (3) Without interfering with its independence, and with a  view to ensuring that justice is manifestly seen to be done in a  non-racial way and that the wisdom, experience and judicial  skills of all South Africans are represented on the bench, the  judiciary shall be transformed in such a way as to consist of  men and women drawn from all sectors of South African society.    (4) All persons who claim that rights guaranteed them by  this Bill of Rights have been infringed or threatened, shall be  entitled to apply to a competent court for an order for the  declaration or enforcement of their rights, or for the  restraining of any act which impedes or threatens such rights.    (5) Any law or executive or administrative act which  violates the terms of this Bill of Rights shall be invalid to  the extent of such violation, save that the court shall have the  discretion in appropriate cases to put the relevant body or  official on terms as to how and within what period to remedy the  violation.  <H5>  Constitutional Court </H5>   (6) Provision shall be made for the establishment of a  Constitutional Court.    NOTE: We favour a Constitutional Court which  will be representative and newly created. We do not support the  idea of simply making it a section of the existing Appellate  Division. Should this point be made here, or does it belong in  the part of the Constitution dealing with the judiciary?  <H5>  Human Rights Commission </H5>   (7) Parliament shall establish by legislation a Human  Rights Commission to promote general observance of the Bill of  Rights and in particular to help enforce the right to  non-discrimination.    NOTE: This body is conceived of as having  the functions similar to those of agencies, boards or  commissions established in countries like the USA, the UK and  Australia to secure compliance with anti-discrimination  legislation.    (8) Such Commission shall have the right to establish  agencies for investigating patterns of violation of any of the  terms of the Bill of Rights and for receiving complaints,  attempting conciliation and bringing proceedings in court where  appropriate, with special attention to violation of the  principles contained in Article 1.    (9) The Commission shall monitor proposed legislation  with a view to reporting to Parliament on its potential impact  on the realisation of the rights set out in the Bill of  Rights.    (10) The Commission shall also have the right to create  agencies to monitor progress being made in the materialisation  of basic social, educational and welfare rights, report on and  make proposals for the removal of impediments to their  achievement, and require the furnishing to Parliament, regional  and local authorities and to the public at large of all such  information as would assist in bringing about their  realisation.    (11) The Courts shall enforce such social, education and  welfare rights as are established by legislation, or identified  by the Constitutional Court through interpretation of the  Constitution and shall pay due regard to social, educational and  welfare rights when considering the interpretation of statutes,  the validity of subordinate legislation and the reasonableness  of administrative actions.    (12) Where justice and the achievement of the objectives  of the Bill of Rights so require, the state or any private body  or individual may be restrained by the Courts from doing  anything which interferes with or reduces enjoyment of these  rights or impedes their realisation.    NOTE: This is a form of making social rights  justiciable. The courts are given the power to restrain  interference with these rights (for example, bulldozing people's  houses). They are sometimes referred to social rights in the  negative sense, that is, that nothing may be done to diminish  them, even though the courts might not have the power to order  positive rights, say, that homes and jobs be provided.    Ombud    (13) With a view to ensuring that all functions and  duties under the Constitution are carried out in a fair way with  due respect for the rights and sentiments of those affected, the  office of Ombudsman shall be created.    NOTE: In Norway, the country that gave us  the institution, the person is now called Ombud and not  Ombudsman and we follow suit.    (14) The Ombud shall be appointed by the State President  subject to confirmation by the Senate.    (15) The Ombud shall be appointed for a term to be  determined by Act of Parliament, and may only be removed by the  President, acting on the advice of the Senate, on grounds of  gross misconduct or mental incapacity.    (16) The Ombud shall be independent in the carrying out  of his or her functions and shall serve in a full-time capacity  and may open offices in different parts of the country.    (17) The Ombud shall receive and investigate complaints  from members of the public concerning abuse of power or unfair,  insensitive, capricious, harsh, discourteous or unduly delayed  or discriminatory treatment of any person by any official of  government at national, regional or local level, or any attempt  by such official to extort benefits or corruptly to receive  favours.    (18) In accordance with his or her findings, the Ombud  may initiate legal proceedings, refer the matter for  prosecution, negotiate a compromise, issue a public  communication, or make a report to the department or organ  concerned containing recommendations with a view to remedying  the improper conduct, preventing repetition, and, where  appropriate, making amends, including compensation.  <H5>  Jurisdiction </H5>   (19) Recourse to the Human Rights Commission or to the  Ombud shall not oust the jurisdiction of the courts to hear any  matter.  <H5>  ARTICLE 18. MEASURES FOR CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY DURING A </H5> STATE OF NATIONAL DEFENCE OR EMERGENCY    (1) If there is a threat to the sovereignty of South  Africa, which in the opinion of the President calls for such a  declaration to be made, the President may by Proclamation  declare that a state of national defence exists in South  Africa.    (2) At a time of national disaster, or grave public  emergency, or danger threatening the life of the nation or the  democratic constitutional order and if the ordinary laws of the  land are not sufficient to meet the exigencies of such national  disaster, public emergency or danger, the President may, by  Proclamation, declare that a state of emergency exists in South  Africa.  <H5>  ARTICLE 19. PROCLAMATION OF DEFENCE AND EMERGENCY MEASURES </H5>   (1) When a state of national defence or a state of  emergency exists, the President may, by Proclamation, enact  defence or emergency measures which are necessary for the  protection of the sovereignty of South Africa, national  security, or public safety or for the defence of the  Constitution.    (2) Defence and emergency measures shall have the force  of law and subject to Articles 20, 21, 22, 23, may repeal, amend  or suspend the operation of any existing law, including certain  provisions of Chapter 2 of the Constitution. Such measures may  be proclaimed for the whole of the country, or for any part of  it.  <H5>  ARTICLE 20. SUPERVISORY POWER OF NATIONAL ASSEMBLY </H5>   (1) A declaration of a state of national defence or of a  state of emergency shall cease to have effect if it is not  ratified within fourteen days by a resolution of the National  Assembly. If the National Assembly is not in session when such a  declaration is made, the President shall immediately convene a  special session of the National Assembly to address this  issue.    (2) A state of national defence that has been ratified by  the National Assembly under Sub-article (1) shall continue until  peace has been declared by the President.    (3) A state of emergency which has been ratified by the  National Assembly under sub-article (1) shall continue until  terminated by the President: provided that if it has endured for  a period of six months from the date of proclamation, it will  automatically lapse unless the National Assembly by a resolution  taken prior to the expiration of the six month period, approves  its extension for a further six months or a shorter period. Any  prolongation of the state of emergency thereafter, shall be  limited to successive periods of not more than six months which  shall on each occasion require the approval of a resolution of  the National Assembly passed by a two-thirds majority.    (4) During the period of any state of emergency or state  of national defence -    (a) While the National Assembly is in session, the  President shall report to it at intervals of not more than one  month about the operation of the special emergency and national  defence measures and the National Assembly shall receive and  promptly consider such reports;    (b) If the National Assembly is not in session, the  President shall convene special sessions, of the National  Assembly at intervals of not more than three months from the  date of the declaration of the state of emergency or state of  national defence or from the date on which a report by him on  the operation of the special emergency measures was last made to  the National Assembly, for the purpose of receiving and  considering a report from him about the operation of the special  emergency measures and to conduct such other business as the  National Assembly may decide.    (5) The National Assembly may at any time by resolution  revoke the declaration of emergency or state of defence or  restrict the area of their operation or repeal or amend the  terms of any emergency measures.    (6) During the period of any state of emergency the power  of the President to dissolve the National Assembly and the  Senate may not be exercised unless a resolution of the National  Assembly is passed authorising him to do so. If the President is  required by the Constitution or the electoral law to call for  new elections during an emergency, then such elections shall be  held as expediously as possible in accordance with the  provisions of the existing law and the new National Assembly  shall be convened without delay.  <H5>  ARTICLE 21. NON-DEROGABLE RIGHTS </H5>   Neither the President nor the National Assembly shall have  the power to pass a defence or an emergency measure which:    (1) derogates from or suspends the rights and freedoms  guaranteed by the Bill of Rights other than those referred to in  Articles 2(9) [forbidding detention without trial], (10) [no  arrest or detention except for trial on criminal charge], (11)  [informed of charge, right to legal representation and brought  to court timeously; (12) [right to bail], (13) [right to public  and fair trial before independent court], (31) [no search or  entry to property without reasonable cause], (32) [interference  with private communication, spying, etc.], and (33) [freedom of  movement, passport, right to leave and enter country], Article 4  [freedom of speech, assembly and right to information], Article  13(1) [peaceful possession of property and goods], and Article  12 (14), (15), (16) and (17) [environmental rights], provided  that the derogation where permissible shall not be greater than  is necessary for the purpose of national defence or the  emergency; or    (2) suspends or derogates from the provisions of any  other chapter of the Constitution; or    (3) establishes special courts or tribunals, other than  the review board referred to in Article 21; or    (4) make provision for prospective indemnities; or    (5) is contrary to international law or international  obligations.  <H5>  ARTICLE 22. DETENTION IN TIMES OF NATIONAL DEFENCE OR </H5> EMERGENCY    Where any persons are detained without trial in terms of any  defence or emergency measure, the following provisions shall  apply:    (1) They shall immediately be informed of the reason for  their detention, an adult family member or friend nominated by  the detainee shall promptly be notified of the detention and  there shall be prompt publication in the Gazette of their names  and the legal provisions under which they are held;    (2) They shall have access to a legal representative of  their choice at all reasonable times.    (3) Their detention shall be reviewed within one month of  their detention, and thereafter if they remain in detention at  intervals of not less than three months, by a review board  presided over by a judge of the Supreme Court, which shall have  the power to order their release from detention if satisfied  that it is not reasonably necessary for their detention to be  continued for the purpose of national defence or the  emergency.    (4) Detainees shall be given opportunity to make  representations to the review board in such form as the board  may consider to be desirable in the circumstances, taking into  account the public interest and their interests, and for that  purpose shall be given access to such information as the board  may consider to be necessary, with due regard to such interests,  and shall also be entitled to be represented before the board at  the time when their cases are to be considered by the board.    (5) The decision of the review board shall be made known  to the detainee and to the adult family member or friend  nominated by the detainee.    (6) The right of the detainee to question the legality or  the conditions of detention by recourse to judicial review shall  not be affected by the provisions hereof.  <H5>  ARTICLE 23. EXPROPRIATION AND COMMANDEERING OF PROPERTY IN </H5> TIMES OF NATIONAL DEFENCE OR EMERGENCY    (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 14 (4), (5)  and (6) hereof, a defence or an emergency measure may authorise  the expropriation or commandeering of any property for the  purposes of national defence or the emergency.    (2) Such defence or emergency measure shall provide:    a)that the property commandeered, unless it has been  consumed for the purpose for which it was commandeered, be  restored to the person from whom it was taken when it is no  longer required for the purpose of national defence or the  emergency;    b) that compensation shall be paid for property that is  expropriated, or property which, having been commandeered, is  destroyed or damaged prior to its restoration to the person from  whom it was taken; and    c) that the compensation payable shall be assessed with  due regard to the needs and interests of the State which were  served by the expropriation or commandeering, and the interests  of the person who has suffered loss as a result of the loss of  or damage to such property.    (3) The defence or emergency measures may provide that  compensation shall not be payable for the temporary loss of the  use of property which has been commandeered in terms of such  measures, unless the person from which the property was taken  used or intended to use the property for the subsistence of his  or her family, or for the purpose of producing an income, in  which event the compensation payable shall be assessed in  accordance with the principles set out in sub-article (2)  hereof, provided that the compensation shall in no event be more  than is strictly necessary to compensate the persons concerned  for the loss they have actually suffered as a result of the  property having been commandeered.

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUTER TRAIN SYSTEM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> If the air quality in Southern California is to improve it will require that a  mass transit system be developed and successfully operated. Other than a few  buses and even fewer trains, mass transit in Southern California is  non-existent.  </P> <P> Since I moved to Southern California over 20 years ago, I have continually  heard politicians state that mass transit will not work in Southern California  because of the residents' love of the individual automobile.  </P> <P> One only needs to be at the San Juan Capistrano train station at 6:30 a.m. any  weekday morning to see this is absolutely false. Literally hundreds of  commuters board the train for Fullerton or Los Angeles. Perhaps the real reason  politicians have avoided the development of mass transit in Southern California  is the financial incentives afforded them by oil companies and automobile  manufacturers.  </P> <P> I find it interesting that six additional lanes can be added to the San Diego  Freeway, increasing air pollution, but insufficient funds are available for  additional trains for commuters. Commuters pay to ride the train, thereby  reducing any subsidies. I further understand that the San Diegan run from San  Diego to Los Angeles is running at a profit for Caltrans, which should be an  indication of individual support for more commuter trains.  </P> <P> I have been commuting every day on the San Diegan from San Juan Capistrano to  Los Angeles since June of this year. I have enjoyed not driving in the severe  traffic congestion on the freeways. However, I have observed that the system  could be improved with some effort from Caltrans and Amtrak.  </P> <P> On many occasions, the train arrives late into Los Angeles due to the Santa Fe  freight trains having priority over commuter service. It is imperative that the  train operate on a strict schedule.  </P> <P> To entice more commuters to ride the train and get off the freeways, there need  to be some improvements in service. I feel these improvements are not costly  and significantly less than additional freeway lanes. It is apparent that  additional commuter trains could be cost-effective. I do understand that the  funds for additional freeway lanes may be restricted for that purpose, but I  also realize that with a little bit of negotiating by the appropriate  administrators or elected officials, these "restrictions" could have been  modified to include other transportation enhancements.  </P> <P> I recommend: improved advertising of the commuter trains, a monthly pass for  commuters, improved exit procedures at Union Station, giving commuter trains a  higher priority than commercial trains to improve "on-time" performance and  improving tracks, trains, signals and whatever else is needed to speed up train  runs. It should be possible to have runs from San Juan to Los Angeles take less  than one hour.  </P> <P> DAVID M. KANTHAK  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

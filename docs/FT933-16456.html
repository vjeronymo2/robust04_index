			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: London Pride boosts Fuller Smith to Pounds 8.3m PROFITS OF Fuller Smith &amp; Turner, the USM-quoted Chiswick-based brewer, improved from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 8.26m pre-tax for the 53 weeks ended April 3. The 6 per cent advance was scored on the back of a 7 per cent rise in sales to Pounds 81.88m. Earnings per share dipped to 23.33p (25.18p) because of a one-off deferred tax credit of Pounds 977,000 last year. Without that adjustment earnings would have shown a 10 per cent increase. A proposed final dividend of 5p makes a 7.4p (6.71p) total. Managed house beer volumes were up 3 per cent but profits were marginally down partly because of start-up costs of several new pubs. The tenanted pubs 'struggled' and barrelage was down 4 per cent over the year. The hotels side was not expected to do well and profits from the division were down by 26 per cent. However, the hotels were still profitable although increasing competition in the Heathrow area continued to depress room rates. The downside in these activities was more than matched by a 33 per cent increase in free trade beer volumes and 23 per cent in the wholesaling side. In particular, sales of the premium brand, draught London Pride, were ahead by 26 per cent. Exports now total 5.5 per cent of production. A 53 per cent rise in sales mostly came from the US but recent months have seen contracts in the Gulf, Hong Kong and Scandinavia. The directors said the Chancellor had failed to 'harmonise excise duty following the advent of the single market, with the result that 10 per cent of all beer consumed at home is coming from France.'</p>

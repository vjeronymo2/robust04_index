The event, which will take place in Buenos Aires and will be  attended by Argentine President Carlos Menem, will gather  together representatives from 182 countries.    On 18 March USIS distributed a note reporting on the special  attention the United States is giving to the event, in that Vice  President Gore is involved in the issue of the development of  the "information superhighway." This network will enable the  United States to create the conditions to transmit images, data,  and voice through one physical medium.    Another important point to be viewed in Gore's speech will  be  the proposal to open the telecommunications area to bids,  because in several countries telecommunications are a monopoly,  under state control. Gore will go to Argentina to defend the  fast deregularization of the sector, as this is "a path that can  increase investment in the area and result in improving the  quality of the services."    This message, and the idea of ensuring harmonious  development, will also be presented at the G-7 conference  scheduled for July in Italy. Al Gore will stay in Buenos Aires  only for the opening of the conference, which will last nine  days. The U.S. delegation to the conference is comprised of  representatives from the Federal Communications Commission  (FCC), which regulates this sector; from the Department of State  and the Department of Commerce; and from private enterprises.  FCC Chairman Reed Hunt will take the opportunity to point out  to those attending the conference that "information" can be in  two places at the same time. He will address them via  satellite, live, from another meeting -- the National  Association of Broadcasters convention -- which will be taking  place in Las Vegas in the United States.    Gore will begin a series of discussions searching for  harmonious solutions to telecommunications development. What  has become clear is that it does not help to concentrate  physical means, optic fibers, and satellites in the northern  hemisphere while the world turns around a globalized economy.  The program contemplates the definition of practical actions.    Another goal of the meeting is to discuss the bases for ITU  regulations and programs aimed at developing telecommunications  during the 1995-1999 period.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: MTS close to agreeing restructure MARITIME Transport Services, which is developing the new Thamesport container facility at the Isle of Grain in Kent, is close to agreeing a financial restructuring with its banks. This follows mounting losses because of recession and lower than expected container throughput. MTS said its banks and shareholders had reached 'agreement in principle' for a restructuring, which remains subject to final documentation and approval by some lenders' head offices. Sources involved in the restructuring said it involved converting 'a large chunk' of Pounds 120m debts into equity. One institutional shareholder said he expected final agreement in 'four to six weeks'. The restructuring was triggered when MTS breached some of its banking covenants last May and made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 18.5m in 1991, mainly attributable to interest charges. The company agreed with its banks to defer about Pounds 9.5m of interest payments until the end of May and negotiated a Pounds 2m extension to its overdraft facility.</p>

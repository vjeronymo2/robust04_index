			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: Nevada gaming benefits Hilton's second quarter HILTON Hotels, the California-based casinos and lodging group, reported second-quarter profits of Dollars 32.4m, up from Dollars 23.6m in the same period a year earlier. The result follows sharply higher results from its Nevada gaming interests. Total revenue was just 3 per cent higher at Dollars 294.8m. Hilton saw markedly different performances from its two main business segments. The hotels division saw a 10 per cent fall in operating profits to Dollars 29.7m, while gaming reported a 49 per cent advance to Dollars 37.5m. Hilton said that, on the lodging front, hotel occupancy was 69 per cent, compared with 68 per cent a year earlier, but that the division was still beset by 'sluggish economic recovery and excess capacity'. Conditions in some key markets - such as New York, Chicago and Washington - were described as 'difficult', with room rates remaining under pressure. Hilton said, however, that all four of its Nevada gaming properties fared well. It added that it was still pursuing riverboat gambling plans in New Orleans, and the Chicago gaming centre scheme. The latter proposal is for a Dollars 2bn complex - combining gaming and a high-tech theme park - which would be built by a number of casino companies, including Hilton.</p>

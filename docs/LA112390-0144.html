			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SILVER WARES;  </P> <P> SHINING EXAMPLES OF HAND-ENGRAVED CRAFTMANSHIP COMING TO SAN JUAN IN TRAVELING  TIFFANY EXHIBIT  </P> <P> In 1889, Charles Tiffany and other New York merchants presented a signed scroll  to President Benjamin Harrison marking the 100th anniversary of the  inauguration of George Washington.  </P> <P> A century later, the scroll isn't nearly as significant as the vessel it came  in: an intricately decorated silver cylinder. Tiffany silversmiths were  obviously proud of the piece they had created, for on the bottom of the  cylinder they added the words:  </P> <P> "This cylinder was made and inscribed in less than a week's time!"  </P> <P> The silversmiths can be forgiven for tooting their own horn. Today, the highly  detailed floral pattern sculpted or "chased" on the cylinder is a premiere  example of a virtually lost art.  </P> <P> Tiffany &amp; Co. has included the cylinder in "A Celebrated Tradition: The  Silver of Tiffany," a traveling exhibit that will stop at the Decorative Arts  Study Center in San Juan Capistrano from Dec. 1 to 24.  </P> <P> The show spans 150 years of silversmithing and features 30 pieces organized  around five major themes -- birth, marriage, sport, achievement and state.  </P> <P> "The exhibit talks about the celebratory nature of silver," says Edward  Wawrynek, vice president of product development for Tiffany &amp; Co. in New  York City and an authority on American decorative silver.  </P> <P> Proof that fine silversmithing still exists is Tiffany's recently completed  Tattersalls Tiffany Highflyer Stakes Cup, to be presented at horse races this  summer in England.  </P> <P> "It's unique in modern times, in that it's so massive and required virtuoso  silversmithing and chasing," Wawrynek says.  </P> <P> The massive 40-pound bowl has two horses protruding from either side. From hoof  to hoof, it measures three feet wide and stands two feet tall. The trophy took  10 men 2,000 hours to complete.  </P> <P> Another racing trophy, this one made in 1873, is equally impressive. The trophy  features a sculpture of a running horse and a Comanche Indian, who has scarcely  a toehold on the animal.  </P> <P> "It's more sculpture than trophy," Wawrynek says. "It has so much kinetic  energy."  </P> <P> Many pieces in the exhibit have some small historical significance.  </P> <P> One of the children's table sets was given as a gift in 1881 to Ulysses S.  Grant III from his "Grandpapa," Ulysses S. Grant, then 18th President of the  United States. Each piece in the set has a die-rolled scene of marching  children playing musical instruments.  </P> <P> An 1878 Japanese-style tray might not be the grandest piece in the exhibit, but  for Tiffany &amp; Co. it is the most significant, Wawrynek says. The tray's  design, which forms a spider's web using copper, gold and platinum, helped earn  Tiffany the Grand Prix at the 1878 Paris Exposition Universelle.  </P> <P> "At the time it was revolutionary to leave hammer marks in the piece and to mix  some less noble metals," he says.  </P> <P> Chasing is the art of sculpting the silver by pounding it out with hammers.  Inside the Benjamin Harrison cylinder can be seen the impressions left where  the silversmiths' small punching tools pushed out the metal.  </P> <P> Chasers can achieve greater depth and detail than engravers, because they are  not limited by the thickness of the metal. Where engravers cut away the metal,  chasers displace and shape it to achieve more of a three-dimensional design.  </P> <P> "When you can count the petals on a flower, that's pretty remarkable," Wawrynek  says.  </P> <P> Because it demands both skill and time, chasing has become an endangered art.  </P> <P> The public didn't appreciate the extra work.  </P> <P> "People weren't willing to pay higher prices for the additional hand labor," he  says. "Lack of demand determined scarcity of supply."  </P> <P> Between 1870 and 1930 there were dozens of chasers in the United States. Today  Wawrynek counts only four who have truly mastered the craft. One of them, Alan  Jones, works as head chaser at the Tiffany Silver Workshop, creating a number  of Tiffany's presentation pieces including the Tattersalls trophy.  </P> <P> Silver engravers are another endangered group of artisans. Tiffany employs 12  of them.  </P> <P> Norman DiSalvo, director of engraving and crystal etching for Tiffany &amp;  Co., has etched gifts for U.S. presidents from Eisenhower to Bush. He has  worked on pieces for royalty and the world's social, political and financial  leaders. He engraved a silver box with the Romanian seal that was presented to  Nicolae Ceausescu by President Richard M. Nixon in 1969.  </P> <P> Hand-engraving is an art that goes back more than 100 years, DiSalvo says.  </P> <P> "It's one of the oldest crafts with no change in the way we do it."  </P> <P> During his 35 years with Tiffany, he has been called on to do finely etched  drawings of buildings, horses, oil derricks and tall ships.  </P> <P> "I love doing picture work," he says.  </P> <P> DiSalvo and the other engravers work out their designs from a sketch. The area  where the design will be engraved is painted white so the design can be copied  onto the actual piece.  </P> <P> Engravers use tools with different points and shapes to cut away the metal.  When the design is finished it is checked over for mistakes. If a word is  misspelled, the piece can be smoothed and recut. Occasionally, the engravers  must start over with a new piece.  </P> <P> DiSalvo has the same pride in his work enjoyed by the silversmiths who created  Benjamin Harrison's cylinder.  </P> <P> "I'm as proud of the little key rings I engrave as I am for something for the  President," he says. "Whether it costs $9 or thousands, I give it the same  detail."  </P> <P> He doesn't want anything inferior leaving his shop.  </P> <P> "Once it leaves, it's history," he says.  </P> <P> The Decorative Arts Study Center is at 31431 Camino Capistrano, San Juan  Capistrano.

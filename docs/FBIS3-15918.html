Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Ukolov  said that the court, as a body which applies the law, could not  disobey the decision of the Russian Parliament on amnesty.    Asked about how the decision on amnesty was applied to  former  Soviet Vice-President Gennadiy Yanayev whose case was considered  separately and Aleksandr Tizyakov, a large industrialist, whose  case was suspended, Ukolov said that the military board of the  Russian Supreme Court adopted a decision to amnesty them on  March 2, the next day after the original decision on amnesty was  passed.</p>

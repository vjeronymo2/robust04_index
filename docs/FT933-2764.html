			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Clinton consults about healthcare President Bill Clinton (above) yesterday invited 21 of the 700,000 people who have written to the White House to express their concerns about the health care system to come to Washington to tell their stories, writes George Graham. The tales - of struggling to pay for a relative's care, of being unable to change a job for fear of losing health insurance, of being charged Dollars 2,407 for a pair of crutches - are fuel to his fire. Mr Clinton has set about putting his populist campaigning skills to the service of governing, ahead of what is likely to be the most complex challenge of his presidency, the reform of US health care. Yesterday, the president tackled head-on the issue that is likely to become one of the most controversial elements of his health reform plan  - the requirement that all businesses must provide health insurance to their employees, paying at least 80 per cent of the cost. Mr Clinton said that employers who did not provide health insurance to their workers were getting a 'free ride' by using a health care system paid for by those who did. 'It seems to me that it is a fair thing to say everyone in America should make some contribution to his or her own health insurance, and all employers should make some contribution,' he added.</p>

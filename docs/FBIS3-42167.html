A sober building bedecked with  bright red bougainvilleas. This is the home of Shaykh Hasan  al-Turaybi, general secretary of the Arab Islamic People's  Conference. The man the Western chancelleries, Egypt, and Saudi  Arabia accuse of "leading a veritable Islamic International from  the Middle East to the Maghreb," led us into a drawing room with  walls covered with verses from the Koran. His slender figure  was wrapped in a wide white galabiyah, his bronzed face framed  with a neatly trimmed gray beard, his head covered with a silky  turban, his smile was dazzling and his eyes sparkling with  intelligence.    During three hours of conversation, this linguist who is  regarded as an authority among well-read people in the Muslim  world, spoke in excellent French interspersed with unexpected  signs of humor. It is difficult to imagine that this affable,  erudite person, holder of a masters' degree from Oxford  University and a doctorate in law from the Sorbonne [Paris  university], should be regarded as one of the most dangerous men  in the world, the leader of a "new empire of Evil" in  Washington's eyes.    [Darcourt] Who are you, Shaykh al-Turaybi?    [Al-Turaybi] It is for you to choose. For my enemies I am  the "green devil," the "guru" of Islamic extremism. For my  friends, I am Shaykh al-Turaybi, a title which the Sudanese  confer on a man of age and knowledge, a man of religion. To  understand better who I am, I must talk about my background. I  was born on 1 February 1932 in Kassala in northeast Sudan, a  village close to the Ethiopian border, by a whim of the  itinerant career of my father, who for 30 years had the job of  qadi, or Muslim judge. My father had graduated from the faculty  of religious sciences in Omdurman, which explains my attraction  to Koranic and legal studies.    Our family is descended from a famous line of religious  dignitaries. My ancestor Daf'allah, a renowned sufi, created a  Koranic school in the center of the country, frequented by many  disciples, and founded the village of Turaybi which has born his  name for 300 years. My wife Wisal al-Madi is the direct  descendant of Muhammad Ahmad, the Great Madi, who swept the  British troops from Khartoum in 1885. It was during those  terrible assaults that Gordon, British governor-general of  Sudan, was killed. The Madi had called on his faithful, the  al-Ansar, to fight against "the foreign infidels and the impious  Turks" to establish in Sudan the kingdom of God based on the  precepts of the Koran. The first Sudanese nationalism was born  with him.    [Darcourt] You studied abroad for seven years. Which  impressed you most, Britain or France?    [Al-Turaybi] France, without any doubt. I spent two years  in Britain. Long enough to complete a master's degree and no  more. And I continued my studies in Paris. At that time, going  to France was already an act of independence in opposition to  the British colonialists. The whole Sudanese elite was then  focused on London. English was still the official state  language. I stayed in France from 1959 to 1964. My wife was  with me and speaks excellent French. We have six children and  our first son was born in Paris. During my stay, I was struck  by the courtesy of the teachers and the comradeship of the  students. There was no segregation. I was excited by the  richness and precision of the French language, the culture, the  history of the Revolution, the relations between Church and  state, and the study of the different Constitutions. I was not  focused exclusively on my law studies. I went to the National  Library, I visited museums. During the university vacations, I  went to Strasbourg, Toulouse, and Albi, to Germany, and Italy.  I think that the world is like a book of which you have only  read the first page until you have left your own country.    [Darcourt] How did you enter politics?    [Al-Turaybi] My first public engagement was to launch a  campaign for the emancipation of Sudanese women and to give them  the right to vote. I thought that they should play a full part  in building a new Islamic society, well-anchored in this  century. They also needed to be taken from the exclusive  confinement of domestic tasks. It was a difficult enterprise,  but those reforms succeeded.    [Darcourt] You are the founder of the Arab-Islamic People's  Conference, which holds its congress in Khartoum each year. Are  you satisfied with its work?    [Al-Turaybi] The scale of this meeting is a unique event in  history. More than 500 delegates representing 56 countries from  four continents -- Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America --  took part in it. Nobody was excluded. Among the delegates were  around 20 leaders of the Sunni clergy; muftis from Bosnia,  Greece, and Albania; the rector of the Grand Mosque in Paris;  German imams; several mullahs; imams from the United States, and  others -- Belgians, Spanish, French -- many women; and even 12  American bishops in the framework of the Church-Islam dialogue  which we launched last year. This conference primarily aimed to  mobilize the largest number of groups and prominent individuals  to reconcile the Muslims divided among the four corners of the  world and unite them in the face of those who are relentlessly  hostile to them. Consensus was reached on a firm will: To  raise the idea of God in the face of American society in which  the supremacy of commercial materialism backed by an  overwhelming military power leaves room for no faith in divine  law.    [Darcourt] During the conference, the United States was  clearly named as "Islam's mortal enemy..."    [Al-Turaybi] The arrogance of the United States which has  become the only world superpower offends us. It subjects  countries which refuse to bow to its diktats to a harsh economic  blockade. This is true of Sudan, which is deprived of all  development aid, and blacklisted for "violation of human rights  and collaboration with terrorist organizations."    [Darcourt] This is also true of Libya...    [Al-Turaybi] The situation is different. Nobody is accusing  us of having blown up airplanes and we respect the embargo.  Colonel al-Qadhdhafi has been in power for a quarter of a  century. He started his national socialist revolution inspired  by al-Nasir, then he launched his revolution of the Little Green  Book. He apparently no longer believes in it. His current  preoccupation is to unite the tribes. But the Americans are  stepping up the pressure on his entourage and will continue to  stifle Libya. This is only a remark, but al-Qadhdhafi is likely  to end up in the next cell to General Noriega, the former  dictator of Panama.    [Darcourt] Sudan is regarded as one of the hubs of  international terrorism...    [Al-Turaybi] These accusations are unfounded. Sudan,  devastated by a civil war which has been going on for 10 years  and which is costing it $1 million per day, does not have the  money or material resources to maintain guerrillas abroad in  Egypt or Algeria. On the other hand, where American interests  lie, attacks on democracy are never condemned. Take the example  of Saudi Arabia: It is a country without a Constitution in which  nobody votes, governed for more than 60 years by an absolute  monarchy, the king and...3,500 princes of the blood covered with  dollars. For the Americans, Saudi Arabia, the main holder of  the world's crude oil reserves, is an untouchable preserve.    [Darcourt] France was not attacked once during the  Conference...    [Al-Turaybi] We have no complexes about France. It did not  colonize Sudan. France has major assets for becoming the  preferred interlocutor of the Muslim peoples once again -- its  feeling for law, its influence in Africa, its knowledge of the  Arab world, and its advanced technology. We are happy that our  government chose Air France, and not British Airways, to serve  Khartoum; Paris, and not London, as the main stop; and that  Sudan Airways, our national company, bought Airbus planes and  not Boeings.    [Darcourt] Among the delegations invited to the Conference  were several members of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], of  whom Abdallah Hannas was the spokesman. The FIS's armed groups  are stepping up summary executions of foreigners on Algerian  territory...    [Al-Turaybi] This conflict is starting in the same way as  the FLN's [National Liberation Front] Algerian war, by  assassinations, outbreaks of violence, and very harsh police  repression. Every time I met a member of the FIS I always said  to him: "Have you spoken with France?" He replied: "Out of the  question." I insisted: "You must talk, open a dialogue. Your  country is in danger of breaking up. If you come to power by  force, 3 million or even 4 million Algerians will probably flee  like boat people to the French coast."    France, already disturbed by the problem of immigrants, will  not be able to receive them. This chaos must be avoided, a  compromise must be found, and an agreement reached. For the  time being, you see, these armed groups are not controlled, the  FIS is a passionate movement without a precise program and not  yet structured. The first line is harsh. The second line is  intelligent. After two years of discussion, I have been able to  persuade them to talk with France and the FLN. Serious contacts  have taken place in Germany, in the United States, and in Sudan.  The civil war is a bad fever which must be brought down at all  costs.</p>

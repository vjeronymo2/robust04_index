			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Texaco faces close vote in buy-out bid Texaco, the US energy group, faces a close vote today in its attempt to buy out the minority shareholders in its 78 per cent-owned Canadian offshoot. The largest minority shareholder, Canadian 88 Energy, on Wednesday raised the value of its own counter-bid for Texaco Canada Petroleum. Mr Greg Noval, president of Canadian 88, said Texaco needs the support of holders of at least half the remaining 22 per cent before it can mount a compulsory buy-out of all the shares. On that basis, Canadian 88, which in the last two weeks has built its stake in Texaco Canada to 9.8 per cent, requires the support of only a few other shareholders to thwart the US group's plans. Texaco's offer of CDollars 1.40 a share for the 22 per cent was countered by a CDollars 1.60 a share offer from Canadian 88, which then lifted its offer to CDollars 1.65 a share, valuing Texaco Canada at CDollars 208m (USDollars 152m).</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> JUNGLE COMPUTER PROBES MAYAN RUINS;  </P> <P> ARCHEOLOGY: DESIGN SOFTWARE AND LASER MAPPING CAN CHART A SITE MORE ACCURATELY  AND QUICKLY THAN TRADITIONAL METHODS.  </P> <P> The Mayan culture remains an enigma. The remnants of roughly a thousand  communities have been identified, but in most cases not much is known about  them. Credit that to their locations -- often in the heart of some of the  world's most forbidding jungles -- and to the fact that Mayan history has not  been as well documented as that of the ancient Mediterranean civilizations.  </P> <P> What is left of this vast legacy is disappearing rapidly. Even those remains  that survive the elements may not survive the looters or the needs of modern  civilization. Today, Mayan statues might wind up in somebody's villa, while  building stones are recycled in modern schools or highway roadbeds.  </P> <P> Modern archeology has barely kept pace with the rate of deterioration. Even if  funding were infinite, there are not enough Mayan scholars to go around, says  archeologist and Mayan specialist Nicholas Hellmuth of Rollins College in  Florida.  </P> <P> And even when a ruin gets the right attention, the process of mapping it often  falls short. But that is changing now that Hellmuth has introduced the personal  computer into the heart of the jungle.  </P> <P> Using computer-aided design (CAD) and highly precise laser mapping techniques  to chart the ruin site, the researcher has produced animated displays of the  ruins as they are -- and once were, at the height of their splendor 17  centuries ago.  </P> <P> Traditional methods involve a lot of elbow grease and subjectivity. First, a  compass was used to determine a structure's orientation; measuring ropes or  tapes established its dimensions, and an artist's sketch provided the visual  rendering. Later, surveying techniques commonly associated with building or  highway construction added a degree of geometric accuracy, but they still fell  short. "These methods make a lot of assumptions, such as that the lines are  always straight and that everything is always squared off," said St. Louis  architect Daniel Hellmuth, Nicholas Hellmuth's brother.  </P> <P> Photogrammetry, a process using stereoscopic cameras, enabled archeologists to  visually reconstruct a site stone by stone (such a process is being used to  help reconstruct the Great Sphinx).  </P> <P> But photogrammetry is costly and time-consuming, requiring that the pictures be  assembled back at the lab to derive the building's geometric coordinates. By  the time a site is mapped, a hurricane could have washed most of the remains  away.  </P> <P> To gain a critical edge in the race against time, Nicholas Hellmuth tried yet  another tack: Backpack a personal computer into the heart of the jungle.  </P> <P> But computers can be delicate. Traditionally, large mainframe systems serving  businesses were housed in cooled control rooms. When the PC came along, it  became possible to operate units at room temperature -- as long as there was a  room in which to situate one.  </P> <P> There were plenty of rooms at the Mayan site -- a 44-room palace at Santa Rosa  Xtampak, an ancient regional capital in the heart of the Yucatan. But the  temperature inside was hardly what is thought of as room temperature.  </P> <P> "We had climate control from Mother Nature," said Hellmuth, noting that  temperature and humidity percentage both typically ranged in the high 90s  during the course of the project, which, as luck had it, was done during the  height of the rainy season. "People swore the computer wouldn't work, that  fungus would grow on the floppy disks, and that the power surges (from the  portable generator) would blow the computer."  </P> <P> But the computer lived to tell the story -- one with a few unlikely plot  twists. "None of the walls were perpendicular. Not one of them went up in a  straight line for more than a few inches," said team member Daniel Hellmuth,  who plotted the data on some of the palace's rooms, vaults and stairwells on  the PC using AutoCAD, a popular CAD program. "The Mayans weren't sloppy," said  Nicholas Hellmuth. "They were interested in monumental ideas, and the fact that  the walls weren't straight wasn't very important to them.  </P> <P> "These people were incredible engineers," he added, noting that many of the  palaces they constructed dwarf anything built in southern Mexico or Guatemala  since.  </P> <P> Ordinary surveying may not have caught all these irregularities, while  photogrammetry -- which was also used at Xtampak to validate the CAD data --  would not have revealed them until several months later. Furthermore, it is  difficult to take a stereoscopic photo inside a closed space and get it  properly correlated.  </P> <P> Currently, a team from the Technical University of Graz, Austria, is analyzing  the photogrammetric data of the palace exterior, while Hellmuth's team is  assembling CAD data to produce three-dimensional, shaded visualizations of the  winding internal staircases. The ultimate goal of the project, says Hellmuth,  is to train local archeologists to use inexpensive tools like CAD to document  their heritage before it disappears.  </P> <P> The presence of a CAD system on site also provided more immediate advantages.  CAD's precision, said Daniel Hellmuth, quickly revealed gaps in the data.  Furthermore, added Nicholas, the computer running the CAD program could also be  used to write the field report while the work was still under way, making it  more accurate and complete.  </P> <P> This is not the first time that CAD has been used in archeology, but typically  it had been run back in the lab to tabulate field data. "I wouldn't be  surprised if CAD will be used in the field a lot more in the future," said  University of Chicago Egyptologist Mark Lehner. "But I don't know of anyone  taking it out there now."  </P> <P> Besides filing more accurate and complete reports, perhaps the most significant  advantage of using CAD may be in visualization. Animated displays can depict  eerily accurate walk-through views of the ruins.  </P> <P> The animations are not just bells and whistles, insists Hellmuth. They could be  used to let people walk through the ruins on a computer screen in a museum,  rather than trampling all over the site. They could also become critical in the  increasingly competitive quest to solicit financial support from foundations.  </P> <P> In fact, such visualizations may soon become necessary now that the United  Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is frowning on site  restorations that, in the past, proved merely cosmetic. Under the new  international guidelines, archeologists will be allowed only to shore up  existing ruins, not rebuild them.  </P> <P> CAD may help in those consolidations, said Atlanta-based consulting engineer  James O'Kon, adviser on the project. CAD data could be fed into structural  analysis programs that can help project workers decide how to reinforce  existing ruins.  </P> <P> With all its advantages, noted the University of Chicago's Lehner, CAD still  lacks the fine detail of photogrammetry. (Lehner is using photogrammetry as  part of the Sphinx restoration project.) "If you want a detailed map on how the  stones are placed, you will need photogrammetry," he said. Such detail,  responded Hellmuth, is overkill when mapping individual sites cluttered with  vegetation, such as Xtampak, or ancient cities involving large numbers of  buildings.  </P> <P> But in the future, it might not be an either-or question. Hellmuth predicts  that CAD and photogrammetric technologies could merge within five years, thanks  to more powerful personal computers. With such a system, technicians would take  digitized stereoscopic pictures, rather than photographs, on the spot, readily  feeding them to a computer.  </P> <P> The Xtampak expedition, conducted in mid-1989, was a joint undertaking of the  Foundation for Latin American Anthropological Research, a publicly funded  nonprofit organization founded by Hellmuth, and the Universidad Autonoma de  Campeche in the southern Yucatan peninsula, where the ruins are located, under  the leadership of Prof. William Folan of Campeche.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS / LONNIE WHITE: AFTER SERIOUS CAR ACCIDENT, SAUGUS RUNNER SCOBIE IS  ON HER WAY BACK  </P> <P> Less than 15 months ago, Heather Scobie, a junior at Saugus High School, was a  talented runner of great promise.  </P> <P> As a freshman, she was one of the country's best cross-country runners, placing  17th in a field of 1,500 in the Kinney Western Regional meet. In the spring,  she placed eighth in the state track and field final in the 1,600 meters.  </P> <P> After an injury-plagued sophomore year, during which she placed third in the  high school mile in the Sunkist Invitational indoor meet, Scobie was hoping for  an outstanding junior campaign.  </P> <P> Then came the rainy afternoon of Halloween, 1987, when Scobie was involved in a  head-on car accident on Sierra Highway.  </P> <P> Scobie suffered many injuries, including broken ribs, fractured vertebrae in  her lower back and internal bleeding caused by severed abdominal muscles. Her  friends, Melissa Zidle and Shauna Bird, suffered cuts and broken bones, and a  passenger in the other car died.  </P> <P> Scobie underwent 3 1/2 hours of surgery on her stomach muscles. Doctors told  her parents that she might never walk again, let alone resume her running  career.  </P> <P> Her mother, Pat Scobie, said: "I just didn't believe that things were as bad as  they were. Heather couldn't move until she had surgery because of the danger of  severing nerves in her back. I stayed with her in the hospital for 2 weeks. We  never gave up hope."  </P> <P> Doctors had to wait 8 days after the stomach surgery to operate on Scobie's  back. After the 4-hour operation, in which two 8-inch rods were inserted in her  back, Scobie spent 3 months in a body cast.  </P> <P> Despite the seriousness of her injuries, Scobie did not have any doubts about  returning to the athletics.  </P> <P> "I did not want to think anything negative," said Scobie, who started to jog 6  months after the accident. "My parents were always positive when I saw them,  and that helped a lot."  </P> <P> Scobie, now 17, has made incredible strides since her setback. She ran in  several cross-country meets this past fall, including the Kinney Western  Regional. She again will run n the Sunkist Invitational, Jan. 20 in the Sports  Arena.  </P> <P> Scobie is not at the same level she was before her accident -- Saugus Coach  Mike Parker says she is about 80% -- but her competitive desire remains strong.  </P> <P> "My training now just consists of short jogs because of the pain (in her  stomach and back)," said Scobie. "But I will give it my best shot at the  Sunkist meet."  </P> <P> Scobie, who will have additional surgery this summer on her stomach and will  have the rods removed from her back, added: "I am just glad that I am still  able to run."  </P> <P> Reseda Cleveland (7-2) won the Las Vegas Holiday Tournament at Nevada Las Vegas  by defeating Fairdale (Ky.), 74-62, in the final. Cleveland's Lucius Harris,  who scored 21 points in the final, was named the tournament's most valuable  player.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills (9-3) reached the quarterfinals before losing to Cleveland,  85-67. John Hardy, a 6-foot 4-inch senior forward, averaged 32.8 points in the  tournament, second highest in its 12-year history. He also led the tournament  with a 12.8 rebounding average.  </P> <P> Inglewood (5-4), behind the play of USC-bound Harold Miner, also played well in  the tournament, winning 3 of 5 games. The 6-5 Miner, who did not play in  Inglewood's last game because of an ankle injury, averaged 29.8 points and 12  rebounds per game.  </P> <P> Westchester (6-3), which traveled to Pine Bluff, Ark., to play in the King  Cotton tournament, shot only 32% in a semifinal loss to Flint Hill Prep of  Oakton, Va., and 35% in a loss to Westwood of Memphis in the third-place final.  </P> <P> Prep Notes  </P> <P> The City boys' soccer preseason coaches' poll: 1.

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Manila equities back at record high BUYING BY public pension and insurance funds supported share prices, and the Nikkei average closed marginally higher on the final day for July delivery, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index was up 69.31 at 19,891.39 after a day's peak of 19,952.00 and low of 19,777.48. A higher futures market prompted buying by investment trust funds and index-linked demand by arbitrageurs, but most individual and overseas investors remained on the sidelines. Volume was below 200m shares for the third consecutive day, totalling 190m shares against 177m. Advances outscored declines by 565 to 339, with 225 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 9.90 to 1,625.45, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 0.57 at 1,237.50. Interest in issues related to Japan Tobacco, the state-owned company, grew as JT applied for listing yesterday. The company is scheduled to offer a third of its outstanding shares early next year. East Japan Railway is due to list its shares in October, while DDI, one of three new telecom companies, is likely to offer its shares in September. Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson said the new listings could become a powerful force for the market. However, some pessimists fear that extra supply at a time when investor confidence is far from restored, and economic fundamentals are weak, may depress share prices. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y1,000 to Y889,000 in spite of denials by the finance minister that the government would offer its remaining holding in NTT this fiscal year. Electric power companies gained ground on dealer-led buying. Tokyo Electric Power rose Y30 to Y3,590. Hopes of credit easing supported banks, with Industrial Bank of Japan firming Y20 to Y3,140 and Bank of Tokyo Y30 to Y1,680. Sumitomo Realty and Development lost Y14 to Y706 as former officials of Sumitomo Fudosan Finance, a financing subsidiary, and a leader of a speculator group, were arrested yesterday for alleged stock price manipulation. In Osaka, the OSE average moved ahead 111.57 to 21,953.57 in volume of 11.8m shares. Roundup THE Pacific Rim saw some strong performances. MANILA returned to its record-setting ways as bargain hunting and Philippine Long Distance Telephone's overnight rise in New York cut short Monday's correction. The composite index moved ahead 34.28 to 1,738.38 as PLDT climbed 25 pesos to 1,095 pesos following its overnight Dollars  3/8 rise to Dollars 39 1/8 on Wall Street. AUSTRALIA was pulled higher by soaring gold stocks, and the All Ordinaries index gained 19.2 at 1,814.9. A return of foreign buyers helped turnover to expand to a hefty ADollars 368.2m.

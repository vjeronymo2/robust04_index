			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Revenue faces 3,000 job cuts in tax system shake-up The Inland Revenue said yesterday that it would lose up to 3,000 jobs as a result of the introduction of self-assessment for tax by the end of the century. About half of the cuts will be made in the 1998-99 tax year and the rest in the following year. There are no plans to cut jobs during implementation of the system. Estimates of the number and timing of staff reductions have been circulating in the last few weeks as part of the process of planning for the introduction of self-assessment, which starts in the 1996-97 tax year. The system, details of which are contained in the finance bill, will shift the responsibility for assessment of liabilities from Revenue officials to up to 9m taxpayers and their professional advisers. Mr Tony Kuczys, project leader for self-assessment at the Revenue, said 3,000 was a net figure after significant shifts of staff from assessment to both greater taxpayer assistance and to increased compliance efforts. He said that self-assessment should bring similar savings to taxpayers. 'The current system is based on 19th-century legislation that leads to a great deal of rigmarole for both us and taxpayers. We are trying to cut through all that.' The job cuts will form part of the reduction of 10 per cent to 15 per cent in staffing over 10 years which was announced by the government two years ago. This equates to between 7,000 and 11,000 jobs. Details of the prospective cuts sparked strong opposition from unions yesterday. Mr Doug Gowan of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation said: 'We are not anti-efficiency but we do think because of the complexity of self-assessment it will require more staff helping taxpayers and in compliance.' The Revenue stressed that it planned to avoid compulsory redundancies wherever possible.</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: NAACP SEEKS REACTION TO BIAS CHARGE  </P> <P> In a letter sent to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors this week, the  county chapter of the NAACP has asked the board for a response to a county  employee's complaints of racial discrimination.  </P> <P> The letter, signed by NAACP President John R. Hatcher III, alleges that Myra  Kelley, a clerk who has worked for the county for 16 years, has been the victim  of "an institutional form of racism that has perpetuated itself and no action  has taken place to date" in the county.  </P> <P> Kelley, who is black, won a ruling last month from the federal Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission, which found that the county retaliated against her  because she filed a complaint with the EEOC.  </P> <P> The commission report found that Kelley "was disciplined, denied promotion and  returned to her previous position in retaliation for participation in protected  activities."  </P> <P> In her complaint, filed in 1985, Kelley said she was made to take written and  physical examinations that no other county employees were required to take, and  that she was denied a promotion even though she ranked first on a county  eligibility test.  </P> <P> Kelley, 45, of Oxnard, said she is awaiting a conciliation meeting with county  and EEOC representatives to discuss the case. She said she is seeking  reimbursement of about $15,000 in legal fees, a promotion to the position of  personnel analyst and back pay.  </P> <P> County Counsel James L. McBride said it is not county policy to comment on  personnel matters. ADRIANNE GOODMAN  </P></p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / US shifts stance on global warming THE US has taken a big step towards bridging its differences with other industrial countries over a global warming convention, possibly clearing the way for President George Bush to attend the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June. The Bush administration yesterday sent the EC a detailed analysis of the actions it plans to curb emissions of greenhouse substance - thus narrowing the gap between the two sides' positions. Europe and Japan have urged that a convention be built on the target of capping emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas, at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Despite intense pressure in negotiations leading up to the summit, the Bush administration has resisted commitment to specific goals. But in yesterday's US memorandum the administration estimates that the energy and clean air initiatives it has already undertaken will reduce projected net greenhouse gas emissions by about 125m to 200m tonnes in the year 2000. This reduction of 7-11 per cent of projected emission levels is estimated to be within a hair's breadth of the cuts needed to stabilise. 'What this analysis shows is that the US government can stabilise CO2 and other greenhouse gases easily,' said Ms Liz Barrett-Brown, a non-governmental adviser at the negotiations preparing for the summit. But, she said, it was still important to set specific reduction targets to ensure that there is no backsliding from deadlines and agency budgets. White House officials have complained that other countries, while calling loudly for carbon dioxide emission targets, have done little to spell out what actions they plan to control the gases. 'Many countries appear to have committed to targets, but they have not demonstrated to us how they are going to meet targets,' said Ms Teresa Gorman, a senior policy adviser to President Bush on energy and environmental issues. Ms Gorman also complains that a flat global target ignores the fact that US population is expected to grow by 7 per cent over the next decade whereas populations of Europe and Japan are likely to remain almost unchanged. Mr Bush has been dithering for weeks over whether he should attend the Rio summit. He has been fiercely attacked by Governor Bill Clinton, his probable Democratic opponent in November, for failing to commit himself. But Mr Bush has also been under pressure from some of his advisers not to commit himself to a convention potentially costly to the economy or set himself up as an Aunt Sally for attacks from Europe and the developing world on his environmental record. A substantial write-down of the third world's debt to commercial banks was urged yesterday by the World Commission on Environment and Development, which has spent three days in London debating the Earth Summit to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June, John Hunt reports. The commission said developing countries' debts were forcing them to sacrifice environmental assets.</p>

The Russian military prosecutor's office is carrying out the  investigation.    The arrested man is charged with treason in the form of  espionage, TASS was told by a source in the Federal  Counterintelligence Service on Tuesday who added that the spy  had been arrested on January 15, and admitted to the charges on  January 25.    The service said that, according to preliminary  investigation, the official had been supplied with materials for  invisible writing amd means of secretly passing information to  his control in the British embassy in Moscow.    "On orders from the British special services and for  monetary  remuneration, the Russian citizen collected and passed (to a  foreign power) classified information of military and economic  character", the source said.    The counter-intelligence service source said the spy had  sold  data about Russia's latest research in the field of new  armaments and their technical characteristics, on financing  military research and development, on the state and prospects of  Russian military cooperation with other countries.    Speaking to ITAR-TASS, a service spokesman, Aleksandr  Mikhailov stressed that the arrest "is in no way connected with  the Ames' case", but noted that while the American court has yet  to prove aims' guilt, "the arrested spy was caught in the action  with all the spying devices on him".    A British embassy official, directly out of a working  meeting  with a London official in the embassy, declined to comment,  saying the embassy would not normally issue comments for the  press. She denied the meeting in the embassy had anything to do  with the case.</p>

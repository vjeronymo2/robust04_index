Not all of the States were fully prepared to participate in the computer matching program at its inception and only those 28 States that had executed computer matching agreements were included under the first notice. The second notice announced the participation of an additional 12 States. This third notice announces the participation of the remaining 13 States in the computer matching program. Included are the States of Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The matching program will enable State agencies to determine appropriate periods of disqualification from participation in the Food Stamp Program for intentional program violations. To assign appropriate periods of disqualification, State agencies will match data on individuals recently determined to have committed intentional program violations with an FNS-maintained, centralized data bank list of individuals previously disqualified. Then, based on the number of times an individual has been disqualified, an appropriate period of disqualification will be assigned for the latest violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The matching program will also enable State agencies to prevent the certification or detect the participation of individuals who are in a disqualified status. At their option, State agencies may match the FNS-supplied data against their records of applicants and/or recently-certified individuals to insure that those currently in a disqualified status do not participate. Matches will be conducted in accordance with written agreements between USDA and each of the State agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice is required by Public Law No. 100&hyph;503, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988. The information provided is in accordance with paragraph 6.c. of the Final Guidance Interpreting Pub. L. 100&hyph;503 issued by the Office of Management and Budget, 54 FR 25818 (June 19, 1989). A copy of this notice has been provided to the Committee on Government Operations, U.S. House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, and the Office of Management and Budget. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  In accordance with section 2 of Pub.

L. 97&hyph;35, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, requires that individuals who intentionally violate Food Stamp Program regulations more than once be assigned increasingly longer periods of disqualification for each subsequent offense. To assign appropriate disqualification periods, State agencies must have access to information on individuals who have previously been disqualified in other jurisdictions as well as their own. Although Congress, in Pub. L. 97&hyph;35, did not specify a system for assuring State agencies access to information on disqualified individuals, it did require State agencies to report disqualification actions to FNS. Thus, to enable States to act on this information as Congress intended, FNS will make this information available to State agencies through the Disqualified Recipient Subsystem. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FNS will act as the central collection point for data on disqualified individuals, which States will then access through the Disqualified Recipient Subsystem. The data will include the name, social security number, date of birth, and sex of disqualified individuals. If data in the Disqualified Recipient Subsystem indicates that an individual had been disqualified previously, the information obtained from the Disqualified Recipient Subsystem will be verified before a new period of disqualification is assigned. If the information in the Disqualified Recipient Subsystem originated in another State, that State will be asked to verify the subject data. This procedure will also be followed before any action is taken to deny an individual's application or terminate an individual's participation based on a match with the Disqualified Recipient Subsystem. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Food Stamp Program regulations provide for notification and due-process rights for individuals adversely affected by computer match programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

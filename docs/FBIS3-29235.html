			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa suggested Wednesday [16 February] Tokyo will file a  complaint to the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  if the United States imposes trade sanctions on Japan.    "We will seek a settlement of unilateral sanctions in  accordance with international rules," said Hosokawa, during a  plenary session of the House of Representatives.    He said Japan has not violated trade rules, and expressed  concern about U.S. threats of sanctions.    Hosokawa's remarks came after the U.S. on Tuesday unveiled  steps to impose sanctions worth hundreds of millions of dollars  in a dispute over access to the Japanese cellular phone market.    The prime minister said Japan will "voluntarily" improve  government procurement procedures and foreign access to its  markets, but did not elaborate.    Hosokawa hailed his failed trade negotiations with U.S.  President Bill Clinton, saying the talks represented the outset  of new Japan- U.S. relations reflecting a stronger sense of  trust, in which both countries will make clear what they cannot  do.    Hosokawa told the lower house he and Clinton held "good"  talks in Washington on February 11 as they exchanged opinions on  various issues, including the international situation.    Hosokawa and Clinton agreed not to damage bilateral  relations  though they failed to strike a deal on a new "framework" to  slash Japan's trade surplus and increase the share of imports in  its markets, he said.    The premier said he and Clinton agreed to promote bilateral  cooperation on global issues such as the environment, population  and AIDS.    Hosokawa said he told Clinton that Japan would "do what it  could" if the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on North  Korea over its suspected nuclear arms development program.    He also called the planned one-time tax reduction an  "emergency measure," saying permanent reductions of income and  residence taxes will be included in the comprehensive tax reform  he has pledged to carry out by the end of the year.    The ruling coalition agreed February 8 to implement a  one-time 6 trillion yen income tax cut for 1994 as a means of  stimulating the sluggish economy.    The tax reform package will include financing of the tax cut  because, at the time of the agreement, Hosokawa was forced to  abandon his plan to replace the 3 percent consumption tax with a  7 percent "national welfare tax" mainly to finance the reduction.</p>

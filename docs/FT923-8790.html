			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / International Company News: Continental Airlines gets investment proposal CONTINENTAL Airlines, the US carrier which is trying to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, yesterday confirmed it had received an investment proposal from Houston Air, a new company owned by Mr Alfredo Brener of Houston. Continental said Houston Air would invest Dollars 385m in cash in exchange for Dollars 325m in notes and Dollars 60m of equity secu rities. Continental, the fifth biggest airline in the US, has been seeking an outside investor in order to emerge from Chapter 11 which it filed for in Decem ber 1990. The bid follows an offer of Dollars 350m last month by Maxxam, conglomerate led by Mr Charles Hurwitz, a Houston financier. His group signed a preliminary agreement with Continental to buy 72 per cent of the airline. A bankruptcy court judge in Delaware approved the deal but gave other interested par ties 10 days to make bids. That period ended on August 2. Continental said yesterday the Houston proposal meets the minimum requirements under its overbid agreement with Maxxam. But the carrier said it remains committed under its agreement with Maxair and added it will continue to work towards reorganising under the terms of the Maxair agreement unless it receives a firm commitment deemed higher and better than the Maxair offer. Air Canada, led by Mr Hollis Harris, the former Continental chief executive officer has expressed interested but the Montreal-based carrier has not yet made an offer. Mr Brener's family is the largest independent share holder in Mexico City-based Mexicana Airlines, once the largest carrier in Mexico that has fallen behind rival Aero mexico in market share. Maxxam has indicated it does not currently plan to increase its offer price of Dollars 350m, since the Houston offer is neither firm nor binding.</p>

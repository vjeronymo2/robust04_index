			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Fedor Ignatov] </F>   [Text] Alma Ata [Almaty] 23 June TASS -- More than 20,000  inhabitants of Kazakhstan have formally relinquished their  citizenship. The number is not seen as considerable when  compared to the Republic's total population -- only one in every  85,000 people does not want to be a citizen of Kazakhstan,  according to chief of the passport and visa department of the  Republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs Umirbai Musayev [name as  received].    The official said that most inhabitants of Kazakhstan will  soon exchange Soviet-era passports for plastic identification  cards for use inside the Republic.    Foreign travel passports will be issued only to those who  have to travel for business or other reasons. Those who so wish  may hold both a plastic ID and a travel passport. But while the  former is issued for a token price, the latter will cost the  individual a pretty penny.    Although the ID cards will carry information about the  holder's citizenship, they can hardly be valid for travel even  to the neighbouring countries. Free travel outside a republic  is a moot question for the governments of the former Soviet  countries.</p>

Turnover rose to Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 14.1m). Mr James Smillie, chairman of the West Sussex-based company, said that both the retail funeral and crematoria and cemeteries operations suffered from the lower number of funerals, 'particularly in London and other urban areas'. However, cost controls, lower interest charges - down from Pounds 859,000 to Pounds 654,000 - and an increased contribution from ancillary services, including the Chosen Heritage pre-arranged scheme, helped boost the pre-tax line. Gearing at the period-end was 81 per cent, down from 102 per cent 12 months earlier and 96 per cent at the December.

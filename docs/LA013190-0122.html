			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTDOORS;  </P> <P> NOTES;  </P> <P> FISH CONSERVATIONISTS WELCOME RULING ON WALKER RIVER CASE  </P> <P> Fish conservationists are celebrating a decision by a Mono County jury that  found Nevada farmers guilty of illegally killing thousands of trout in the East  Walker River when they drew excessive water from Bridgeport Reservoir in the  fall of 1988.  </P> <P> The jury of three men and nine women deliberated for an hour last week before  deciding that the Walker River Irrigation District had violated all three  sections of the California Fish and Game Code cited by District Attorney Stan  Eller.  </P> <P> "We're elated," said Rick Rockel, CalTrout stream keeper for what was one of  the state's best trophy trout waters.  </P> <P> Jim Edmondson, regional director for CalTrout, said: "This means they broke the  law and they're going to have to fix it or they'll have to pay."  </P> <P> The WRID owned rights to the water but, the jury found, it:  </P> <P>  -- Failed to notify the Department of Fish and Game of the substantial change  in flow.  </P> <P>  -- Released so much silt into the stream bed that the first mile below the dam  was ruined for years.  </P> <P>  -- Failed to account for the immediate welfare of the fish.  </P> <P> The violations are misdemeanors subject to fines of up to $2,000, community  service time or jail up to six months. A sentencing hearing is scheduled Feb.  13 in Bridgeport.  </P> <P> "I'd like to see somebody locked up as an example for wanton destruction of our  natural resources," Edmondson said.  </P> <P> But Eller said that is sometimes difficult "when you're suing an entity."  </P> <P> DFG biologist Darrell Wong said: "I'm more interested in fixing the river and  getting a long-term solution . . . (such as establishing) a minimum maintenance  flow and a sediment management plan."  </P> <P> In the three-day trial, Wong testified that the fish population was reduced  from 3,500 to 5,000 per mile the year before, to about 200 per mile in some  sections.  </P> <P> In addition, Rockel said, the stream bed insect population and trout spawning  beds were buried by sediment, which remains. Wong noted that when a similar  problem occurred in 1977, subsequent wet winters washed out the silt, but now  the Eastern Sierra is in its fourth dry year.  </P> <P> "It probably will be three to five years before it's back to what it was,"  Rockel said.  </P> <P> A feature of the Southern California Boat Show opening Friday at the Los  Angeles Convention Center is the new Hobie Power Skiff package. The 13- and  15-footers, designed by longtime Hobie engineer and surfing pioneer Phil  Edwards, come standard with EZ Loader trailers and Yamaha outboards of 40 or 50  horsepower.  </P> <P> The 15s offer Center Cockpit ($12,995), Fisherman ($12,495) and Utility  ($10,995) configurations. The 13s cost $8,995. Prices include motor and  trailer.  </P> <P> About 1,100 powerboats and sailboats will be on display, along with 350 booths  with equipment and services. Hours for the 10-day show are 2-10 p.m. weekdays,  11 a.m.-10 p.m. Saturdays and 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Sundays. Admission is $6 for  adults, $3 for children 6-12 and free for children under 6.  </P> <P> San Diego long-range: The big yellowfin tuna of the Revillagigedo Islands are  cooperating to such an extent for those presently aboard the Royal Polaris that  all fish weighing less than 150 pounds are being released.  </P> <P> Butch Greene of Los Angeles leads the jackpot race with his 280-pound tuna. The  boat is scheduled to return on Sunday or Monday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the 18 passengers aboard the Polaris Supreme returned Monday from a  16-day trip with 333 yellowfin, 115 wahoo and 132 grouper. Top fish: a  271-pound yellowfin caught by Billy Shimizu.  </P> <P> The biggest tuna taken aboard the Qualifier 105, which also returned Monday  after 16 days, was a 196-pound, 7-ounce yellowfin caught by Bill Blosser of  Spokane, Wash.  </P> <P> The American Angler, out for nine days, returned Saturday from the Alijos Rocks  with 372 yellowfin -- 25 weighing more than 100 pounds -- and a few yellowtail  and dorado.  </P> <P> Cabo San Lucas: Mostly striped marlin and dorado are being caught. Hotel boats  are reporting one to three stripers a day. Dorado are coming in between eight  and 25 pounds.  </P> <P> Roosterfish, sierra mackerel and an occasional thresher shark to 150 pounds are  also included in the catches. The water temperature is averaging slightly over  70 degrees.  </P> <P> Briefly  </P> <P> The Blake Jones Trout Derby at the Eastern Sierra's Pleasant Valley Reservoir  and Owens River will be held March 3. Entry fee: $3 for adults, $2 for  children. Information: (619) 873-8405. . . . Raahauge's Shotgun Sports at Norco  will play host to the U.S. Sporting Clays Association's first FITASC tournament  of the year Saturday and Sunday. FITASC is an acronym for the French name of  the sport's international governing body. Competition is held in 44 countries  on five continents.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Pete Thomas contributed to this story.  </P></p>

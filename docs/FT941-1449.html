			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Mexican Crisis: Clinton offers help to stabilise currency The US yesterday offered to help Mexico stabilise its currency should it prove necessary following the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, which President Bill Clinton deplored as 'a senseless act of violence'. Mr Clinton telephoned President Carlos Salinas shortly after the news reached Washington. In a statement yesterday, he emphasised his convictions that Mexican institutions were 'fundamentally sound'. He said he had asked Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, to 'make sure that if there was serious trading in the Mexican currency we could try to help stabilise that'. The US Federal Reserve and the Mexican central bank have arrangements to combat wild swings in the exchange rate. In a further gesture of solidarity, Ms Janet Reno, the attorney-general, offered 'any support that we can give' to Mexican authorities investigating the assassination. Mr Arturo Valenzuela, Mexican desk officer at the State Department, reflected the sense of shock in Washington by saying the assassination was 'a significant tragedy'. 'It is not something we should think in any way affects the stability of the Mexican political system, the Mexican government or the deepening relationship of the US and Mexico,' he said. Officials found it hard to see how the tragedy could affect the North American Free Trade Agreement that came into force at the start of the year. US opponents of Nafta, ratified by Congress after heated debate last November, had been critical of the democratic credentials and stability of the Mexican government. But unless it emerges that Mr Colosio's assassin or assassins were agents of elements in the Mexican ruling party, the re-opening of Nafta seems highly improbable. There was no immediate word in Washington of any US preference for a presidential candidate to succeed Mr Colosio. Most of the senior members of the PRI hierarchy are well known and respected in the US and Mr Colosio had been seen in the US as the logical successor to Mr Salinas.</p>

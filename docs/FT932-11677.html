			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Philips/Matsushita Perhaps the oddest thing about Matsushita's deal with Philips is the reluctance of either company to talk about it. On the face of it, Matsushita's offer of Y185bn for Philips' stake in their MEC joint venture looks excessive. Conspiracy theorists will doubtless conclude that there is hidden value for Matsushita. If so, it is hard to see what it is. Since Matsushita is MEC's main customer, full control may allow it to rationalise its component supplies. Matsushita is also more likely to avoid protectionist pressure in European consumer electronics if indigenous manufacturers such as Philips prosper. They, after all, have the ear of the Commission in Brussels. All that, however, is pretty small beer. What is clearer is the benefit to Philips. Borrowings will fall from Fl15bn to Fl12bn and gearing will be cut to 110 per cent. The medical and telecommunications businesses might also be usefully sold and the company has plenty of surplus property now that it has slashed its headcount. That would allow it greater flexibility to invest in its mainstream consumer electronics side, though Philips has yet to prove that such manufacturing has a long-term future in high-cost Europe. But the PolyGram stake is unlikely to go. With the links between such intellectual property and hardware growing, Philips would be mortgaging any hope of a high margin future in home entertainment if it sold the only jewel in its tarnished crown.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> O, WHAT A PLACE IT WAS;  </P> <P> PART OF ONTARIO MOTOR SPEEDWAY BECOMES A GRADE SCHOOL  </P> <P> Twenty years ago Thursday, the first California 500 for Indy cars was run at  Ontario Motor Speedway before 180,233 spectators, called at the time the  largest attendance at any sporting event in California.  </P> <P> Jim McElreath, driving a backup Coyote-Ford owned by A.J. Foyt, won the race at  an average speed of 160.106 m.p.h. and collected $156,000 from a purse of  $727,500.  </P> <P> The attendance, the speed and the payoff were never bettered at Ontario.  </P> <P> OMS, a $35-million state-of-the-art race track that had risen from the dusty  vineyards of Cucamonga, was called the Taj Mahal of motor racing. There had  been nothing like it before -- nor since.  </P> <P> It is gone now, nothing remaining on the site alongside Interstate 10 between  Haven and Milliken avenues but a small pile of dirt -- only a hint of the giant  berm that supported the three-story building that looked out over the 2  1/2-mile track with its two infield lakes.  </P> <P> It is as if someone with a giant eraser has scrubbed it off the face of the  earth. The erasing happened 10 years ago, when the Chevron Land and Development  Co. purchased the bankrupt site and razed the racing facility to make way for  its Ontario Center, a master-planned blend of office buildings, retail  businesses, hotels, restaurants and residential developments.  </P> <P> But the memory of Sept. 6, 1970, and the magnificent racing facility that  lasted a scant 10 years has been perpetuated at the Ontario Center in, of all  places, an elementary school.  </P> <P> The Ontario Center School, located on what was once the west parking lot for  the race track, was dedicated Thursday to the premise of "Winning Through  Education." The logo of OMS, known as the "Big O," has been taken over by the  school.  </P> <P> "The raceway theme has been used throughout the school," school principal  Donald Nicholson said. "The central hall is circular, similar to the race  track, and speedway graphics can be seen in the classrooms."  </P> <P> For instance, the kindergarten wing has green flags on its walls, signifying  the start of the educational race. And the sixth-grade area is adorned with  checkered flags -- the finish line. Other rooms have blue and yellow "move  over" motifs.  </P> <P> Three flagpoles in front of the school are from Ontario Motor Speedway. The  school also hopes to acquire the original bricks of Victory Circle at OMS. They  are reported to be in the basement of the Ontario City Hall, where they were  taken when the bulldozers and the wrecking ball took over.  </P> <P> "We found on past elementary school projects that creating a design motif  really gives the students and teachers something to identify with," said  Gaylaird Christopher, project architect for Wolff-Lang-Christopher, the  school's designers. "It was thought that the school should be reminiscent of  the speedway."  </P> <P> McElreath was at the dedication, having come from his home in Arlington, Tex.,  for the occasion. So was Parnelli Jones, a member of the original OMS board of  directors and once president of the speedway.  </P> <P> And so were the 550 students of the new school, all wearing blue T-shirts with  the school's logo and the motto, "Winning Through Education."  </P> <P> "It's nice to be back here again, but I wish it was to go to the race track,"  McElreath said. "That was the best in the world, no doubt about it, and it's a  real shame it wasn't saved by someone in racing. There'll probably never be one  built again like Ontario."  </P> <P> McElreath, 62, was wearing the 500 winner's ring from Ontario, with its Big O  centerpiece, and looked fit enough to climb into a car and go racing.  </P> <P> "How long has it been since you raced?" a school official asked McElreath.  </P> <P> "Last Monday," he said, grinning as he caught the shocked look on the face of  his questioner. "I haven't driven an Indy car since 1983 -- I only gave them up  because they got too expensive and sponsors were too hard to find -- and I gave  up sprint cars about three years ago, but I still drive my modified in  dirt-track races.  </P> <P> "We went to DuQuoin (Ill.) for a race Labor Day, but I hit the wall during  practice and didn't make the race. Most of the time I run on little tracks  around Waco and Ft. Worth and Dallas, places like the Devil's Bowl where they  run modifieds on a half-mile."  </P> <P> McElreath drove the car in which he won the 500 only twice. The first time was  in the 1970 Indy 500, where he qualified it late on the final day and had to  start 33rd.  </P> <P> "It was a real good car, just like the one A.J. was driving, and I passed eight  guys on the first lap and finished fifth," he recalled. "It was just a one-race  deal, and I had talked to Jack Brabham about driving his car at Ontario, so I  wasn't thinking about A.J. until he called me not long before the race. I  didn't have things set with Brabham so I told A.J. I'd take it.  </P> <P> "Late in the race when I was running about third and I saw LeeRoy (Yarbrough)  in front, I thought maybe I'd made the wrong choice because he was in Brabham's  car. But then his car quit and I felt better about the whole deal."  </P> <P> Al Unser, in the Ford-powered car he had driven to victory that year at  Indianapolis, one owned by Parnelli Jones and Vel Miletich, dominated most of  the race. Late in the running, after Peter Revson had lost nine minutes in the  pits, Unser had a two-lap lead.  </P> <P> "There wasn't anybody could touch Al that day," McElreath said. "But it was  real hot and his engine gave out, and that gave some of the rest of us a  chance."  </P> <P> It was so hot that only eight cars finished. Yarbrough led with nine laps  remaining when his engine expired. That moved Art Pollard to the front, with  McElreath close behind. Shortly after Pollard took over, Foyt hit the  fourth-turn wall and brought out the yellow flag.  </P> <P> "It looked like the race might end on the yellow and it if did, Pollard would  win," McElreath said. "A.J. knew I was right behind him and had qualified a lot  faster, so he jumped out of his wrecked car and helped the emergency crew get  it off the track. When we got the green (flag), Art and I passed each other two  or three times before I got ahead to stay before the last lap."  </P> <P> McElreath's personal share of the purse came to $62,353, the standard driver's  40% of the winning payoff.  </P> <P> "That's the only thing I got out of winning," he said. "I didn't get any good  offers for rides, no celebrity status and no deals. I never drove that car  again. It's in the museum at Indianapolis now."  </P> <P> McElreath raced six more times in the California 500 in a variety of equipment,  but he never came close to winning again. In 1977, he and his son, James, made  racing history when they became the first father-son entry in an Indy-car race.  </P> <P> "I bought a car from Fred Carillo for James to run and he qualified 18th and  was running pretty good until his engine gave out," McElreath said. "It was  pretty exciting. He and I had run together the first time in a dirt car race at  DuQuoin in 1975, but Ontario was the first big one we ran together."  </P> <P> James was killed a month later in a sprint car race at Winchester, Ind.  </P></p>

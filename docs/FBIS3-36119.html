			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>   [Text] Riga February 2 TASS -- Latvia's delegation ended  talks on Latvian-Russian relations, the withdrawal of Russian  troops from the republic and the fate of the Russian radar in  Skrunda in Washington on Wednesday.    The delegation met with U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, Pentagon officials and members of the National  Security Council. They assured Latvia that no joint tactics of  troop withdrawal or radar station close-down had been worked out  during the U.S.-Russian summit meeting in Moscow last month.    Their statements ran counter to a NEW YORK TIMES publication  of January 30, 1994 which said that American and Russian  specialists had agreed to keep the station for another four  years and dismantle it within 18 months after that. Latvian  President Guntis Ulmanis did not rule out the possibility of  holding a referendum on the radar station. However, Parliament  Chairman Anatoliy Gorbunovs believes the referendum may disrupt  negotiations.    Latvian parliamentarians who attended the session of the  Europarliament Inter-parliamentary Assembly in Strasbourg this  week expressed concern that some influential deputies from  France, Germany and Britain prioritise the signing of agreements  between Estonia, Latvia and Russia on troop withdrawal rather  than the pullout itself.    Local observers are at a loss trying to find possible  explanations to this position. Latvia insists on strict  observance of resolutions of the United Nations and the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe which call for  fast and organised withdrawal of troops. At the same time, head  of the Latvian Parliamentary Commission for Foreign Affairs,  Aleksandrs Kirsteins, vows that the troops can be withdrawn  without any agreement.    The delegation left the U.S. and flew to Sweden where it  intends to continue the talks.</p>

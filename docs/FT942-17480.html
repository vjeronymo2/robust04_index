			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Bosnian evacuation suspended The Red Cross has suspended plans for immediate evacuation of thousands of Moslems and Croats from Prijedor in northern Bosnia after Serb leader Radovan Karadzic placed tough limits on the number of people he would allow to go, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. The International Committee of the Red Cross had planned a mass evacuation of thousands of non-Serbs from the Prijedor area following reports that up to 20 Moslems and Croats had been killed in a new outbreak of ethnic violence. But Mr Karadzic agreed to let go only those people whose lives were considered under threat.</p>

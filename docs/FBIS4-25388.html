			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Zheng Zhihai (6774 1807 3189): "Wu Yi on </F> General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Uruguay Round of Trade  Talks"]    [Text] China has been making a dynamic effort to restore  its status as signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade [GATT] and has taken many courses of action to that end.  But the promises we make have to be within what China's economy  can tolerate. To safeguard China's social stability and  sustained economic development is of overriding importance. We  will not sacrifice our vital interests in order to "rejoin GATT"  and if it is an either-or situation, we would rather not "rejoin  GATT." This is a remark made by Wu Yi, minister of foreign  trade and economic cooperation, when interviewed by this  reporter the other day.    When commenting on the pros and cons of "rejoining GATT," Wu  Yi said: The analysis of pros and cons should be objective. On  the one hand, we must not entertain unrealistic illusions about  the benefits that "rejoining GATT" might bring and think that we  will reap a lot of economic benefits after "rejoining GATT."  Yet on the other hand, we should not paint a very dark picture  of the effects of "rejoining GATT" and believe that it will  cause a rampant influx of foreign goods, in the face of which  many of China's own industries will collapse. One should say  that there are more pros than cons for us in "rejoining GATT."  Today, when the world is moving toward multipolarization after  the cold war, we can, by joining a multilateral trading system,  maintain the markets we have opened up in a relatively stable  fashion and will find it easier to open up new markets. After  "rejoining GATT," we can, in accordance with the relevant  provisions of GATT, gradually get rid of discriminatory trade  behavior imposed on China by many countries and enjoy the fair  trade treatment stipulated by GATT. Secondly, we can also take  advantage of the multilateral rules of GATT to resist the  unilateral trade retaliation exercised by some Western powers  and put them under political and moral condemnation. In  addition, "rejoining GATT" can help boost the confidence of  foreign economic and trade circles in China's trade environment  and investment environment. It is even more true of those major  overseas companies and multinationals that are concerned with  medium-term and long-term interests. What are the cons? To put  it simply, we must further lower our tariffs and open up our  domestic market, which may have an impact on some products. But  we are following a policy of selective protection and gradual  opening in order to minimize such an impact.    On the hot topic of "when to rejoin GATT," Wu Yi said: It  has been eight years since we filed an application for rejoining  GATT, and the China GATT team has conducted 16 rounds of talks.  Now the procedure has entered the important stage of  negotiating on tariff reduction and deliberating the agreement  on China's "rejoining GATT." We wish to "rejoin GATT" before  the World Trade Organization is officially founded, so that  China can become one of the founding nations of the World Trade  Organization that is to replace GATT. The problem now is that  some signatories from the West are too demanding in such areas  as tariff reduction, market access, and service trade. In  particular, one or two countries appear to be supporting China,  but are actually creating all sorts of obstacles. The talks will  still take some time because there is still a wide gap between  the bargaining parties. Naturally, we will not try to "rejoin  GATT" at all costs simply for the sake of "rejoining GATT."  Despite the many problems at present, our attitude remains that  of striving hard to succeed.    Wu Yi spoke highly of the final document of the  Uruguay-round  talks that China recently signed. She said: China took part in  the entire process of Uruguay-round talks and in the end signed  the final document together with other participants. It marked  China's return to the world's multilateral trade system,  whereupon China solemnly undertook to observe the latest  international trade rules. This is of profound and far-reaching  significance to our establishing a socialist market economic and  legal system. Our promise will also help boost confidence in  China among world investors and businessmen.    The direct economic implications for us of the results of  the  Uruguay-round talks should be analyzed case by case. Wu Yi  said: Some of the many agreements contained in the final  document may have more pros than cons for us. Take the  agreement on textiles for example. Because the textile market  will be fully opened up, our country, enjoying a relative  advantage in the textile industry, may perform better in textile  exports. But in the case of the agreement on agricultural  products, because subsidies for agricultural exports will be  phased out, China will have to pay a high price as it is a major  importer of agricultural products. She believed that the  Uruguay round's impact on different countries is not even.  Whoever has faster economic development, more products that  enjoy greater advantages, and a bigger export volume will  benefit more from the results of the multilateral trade talks.  Therefore, the foundation of the work on foreign economic  relations and trade is at home and lies with domestic economic  development and industrial structural adjustment.</p>

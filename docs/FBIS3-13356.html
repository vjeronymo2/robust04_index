			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In light of the large scale barbaric attack launched  by tyrant Saddam's forces in the past few days on the marshlands  of the governorates of al-Basrah, al-Nasiriyah, and al-'Amarah  in south Iraq, a responsible source in the Supreme Assembly of  the Islamic Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI] has stated the following:    The forces of the tyrant Saddam's regime launched a sweeping  barbaric attack in the past few days on south Iraq's marshlands  in the Governorates of al-Basrah, al-Nasiriyah, and al-'Amarah.  Four divisions were used in the attack. Reports from SAIRI  sources in south Iraq have confirmed that this large attack was  launched on several fronts in the direction of the residential  areas and villages of the marshlands triangle in the al-Basrah,  al-Nasiriyah, and al-'Amarah Governorates. The tyrant's forces  prepared for this attack with intensive artillery shelling of  the residential areas of the marshlands, killing and wounding  dozens of civilians who fled in panic from their villages and  houses and are now living among the reeds without food, water,  or medicine. The regime's forces are continuing to chase the  fleeing citizens by firing their long-range artillery on them at  random.    Citizens coming from these areas have confirmed that the  regime's forces are continuing their acts of destruction and  burning in the areas of (Nahr Salih), (Abu Julan), al-Dal'ah,  al-Badriyah, [words indistinct], (Abu Jawlanah), (Abu Subat),  (Abu al-Nirki), and (al- Sihabi). The afflicted families fled  deep into the marshlands where they are now suffering from  thirst and hunger due to shortages of food and water.    The SAIRI reports added that the Republican Guards forces  remain in a state of maximum alert and deployed on the edges of  the marshlands in preparation for launching a still larger  attack than the current one. The reports also said that  criminal 'Ali Hasan al- Majid, tyrant Saddam's defense minister,  personally led the current offensive from the former  headquarters of the 11th Division which lies between the areas  of Umm al-Shuwayj and (al-Khuyut) in the (al- Mudaynah)  Governorate.    Tyrant Saddam's regime aims with this barbaric crime to  implement a new stage in its infernal scheme to destroy the  marshlands areas completely and turn them into a desert not fit  for habitation and to force its people who have been living  there since the dawn of history to leave so that the regime can  have full control of these areas which are known as centers of  steadfastness and resistance to Saddam's regime and his criminal  gang. The Saddam regime's real war of genocide against an  historic area known for its human civilization constitutes a  blatant challenge to the will of the international community and  the UN resolutions, including Security Council Resolution 688 of  8 April 1991, which prohibits the Iraqi regime from suppressing  the civilians of Iraq. This is a direct and grave threat to  security, peace, and stability in the region and the world. The  current situations in southern Iraq's marshland areas have  reached the stage where it has become difficult to remain silent  or maintain the position of spectator. Hence, we call on the  international community, its bodies, its humanitarian  organizations, and its media to condemn the barbaric aggressive  action of Saddam's regime and to support the Iraqi people in its  tribulation.    A responsible SAIRI source has also appealed to the United  Nations, and the Security Council in particular, to act quickly  to take measures to stop the genocide being waged against the  inhabitants of the marshlands, especially as the Security  Council and other UN organizations have the documents and  evidence that confirm that the marshland areas are being  subjected to a real war of genocide. This was also confirmed by  the reports of the rapporteur of human rights in Iraq [words  indistinct] who has repeatedly called for sending UN observers  to Iraq to monitor human rights violations in this country.    The source said: We call on the Security Council to  implement the rapporteur's report and to speed up the dispatch  of inspection and observer teams to the marshlands and south  Iraq where there is an urgent and persistent need for them more  than ever since there is no security for the civilian citizens  as a result of the oppression, campaigns of annihilation,  killings, and the economic and military siege. He added: We  appeal to the Security Council to compel the Iraqi regime to  comply with and implement the clauses of Resolution 688, the  most important of which is the clause on stopping the  suppression of civilians. As previous experiences have shown,  this regime complies with the Security Council only when it is  forced and coerced to do so because it has rebelled against the  international will and does not respect the laws and norms  approved by international law. We also call on all the world  humanitarian organizations, especially relief organizations, to  act quickly to relieve the inhabitants of the marshlands in the  south and declare our readiness to cooperate with these  organizations so as to get food, medicine, clothes, and other  relief to the afflicted citizens.    On this occasion, we address our appeal to the countries and  governments of the Arab and Islamic world and to all the Muslim  brothers in the world to condemn the Saddam regime's savage  actions against their Arab and Muslim brothers in south Iraq,  show solidarity with them, and to give them succor.</p>

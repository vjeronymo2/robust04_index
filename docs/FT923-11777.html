			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A slender new look - The design industry has recut its cloth for leaner times 'THE WORST is probably over,' says Mark Landini. 'It would be an exaggeration to say that the design industry is already recovering from the recession, but there are signs that life is getting easier.' RSCG:Conran, the retail design consultancy where Landini is joint managing director, has, like the rest of the UK design industry, undergone a painful rationalisation over the past two years. Every area of marketing services has suffered during the recession, but few have been as badly affected as design. The design market is still in the doldrums. There is fierce pressure on fees and intense competition for new business. But the cuts and company closures seem to be abating. Some consultancies, such as RSCG:Conran, now detect a slight improvement in prospects. Where does the design industry go from here? What is the long-term legacy of the recession? And how will it influence the future of the industry? The most obvious change is the industry's size. The design business flourished in the 1980s when companies were able, and willing, to spend heavily on new corporate logos or lavish retail schemes. But when the economy weakened, design was one of the first budgets to be cut. The number of designers employed by the 100 largest consultancies has halved in the past two years, to 3,800 in 1991, according to Design Week magazine. The recession has also affected the industry's culture. In the 1980s, design consultancies seemed bent on imitating advertising agencies, by adopting the same pyramidical structures and introducing similar functions such as account management and new business development. Most have since returned to the old model whereby they are run like architectural practices, with designers dealing directly with clients, rather than through intermediaries such as account managers. Fitch, one of the most marketing-oriented groups in the 1980s, has cut its staff from 300 to 150 over the past two years with most of the cuts coming from administrative areas. Two years ago RSCG:Conran employed 150, half of whom were designers. It now operates as a single-floor studio with 50 employees, including 35 designers who are responsible for new business and for managing their own projects. This team is augmented by up to 40 freelances at busy periods. The most resilient companies in the recession have been those that eschewed the excesses of the 1980s. Pentagram emerged unscathed by maintaining its original structure, devised in 1972, whereby the eight partners each run their own design studios but share central overheads. 'A few years ago when everyone else was expanding we were accused of being dowdy,' says John McConnell, partner. 'Now we feel vindicated.' Pentagram is now cited as a role model by younger consultancies such as Cartlidge Levene, a graphic design company run as a co-operative by five designers in their late 20s and early 30s. 'We all worked for big groups in the 1980s and watched them unravel,' says Adam Levene, director. 'Design isn't suited to a large scale. We've stuck to our guns and kept the company small so we can be more selective about our work.' The industry may have shrunk, but the nature of its work is becoming more complex. Some sectors of the UK market, notably retail design and corporate identity, are maturing. This means there are not only fewer new projects, but that the type of work is different. There is less demand from retailers for new design schemes and store concepts, but growing interest in merchandising and product development. Similarly, there are fewer new corporate identity programmes, given that so many UK groups have already done them, and designers are being hired on a consultancy basis to implement and adapt existing schemes. 'We need to recruit people with expertise in our new areas and to retrain existing staff,' says Wally Olins, chairman of Wolff Olins, a leading identity consultancy. 'The problem is that it has come at a time when we can't really afford it.' But these changes should benefit the industry by nurturing longer-term relationships with clients. One of the problems has been the ad hoc nature of design projects, which makes consultancies vulnerable to budget cuts when times get tough. Another important change is the role of technology. Advances in Cad-Cam, computer-aided design, have had a dramatic effect on graphic design, where consultancies can use computers to improve efficiency, but also to fulfil functions, such as typesetting, which used to be done externally. Most design companies are investing heavily in technology. Pentagram has spent Pounds 250,000 since 1990 and Wolff Olins around Pounds 750,000. These are substantial sums for an industry which has traditionally required very little capital investment. But the financial benefits are already apparent. Wolff Olins has been able to dispense with its old pool of up to 30 freelance designers because of Cad-Cam. Eventually technology could also help to strengthen client relationships. Wolff Olins and Fitch already have direct computer links to their clients. At the same time it should accelerate the industry's development in that only large consultancies can afford the really sophisticated systems needed for big projects. This may eventually make them less vulnerable to cut-price competition from small design firms with lower overheads. This polarisation should be accentuated by the industry's international expansion. During the recession the large consultancies have found big projects in other countries, to compensate for the UK downturn. 'Our international work has kept us alive,' says Rodney Fitch, chairman of Fitch, which now makes two thirds of its income overseas. 'I hate to think what would have happened without it.' International projects are not a panacea. There are logistical problems in servicing clients in other countries. Even the biggest design groups cannot afford to maintain large networks of overseas offices. Most prefer to work from London, sometimes supported by small local operations, although this involves investment in recruitment and retraining. Another problem is renumeration. The profitability of international projects tends to be lower than for domestic work, particularly in continental Europe. It is also difficult to recoup additional costs such as travel. 'We're still learning how to operate in other countries,' says Wally Olins. 'Most design companies have made a mess of it in the past and it's still not easy. But we're getting better. We have to. It's essential for the industry's future.'</p>

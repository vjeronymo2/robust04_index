Ambassador Volkan Vural, the  prime minister's adviser, said in a statement to reporters that  during the meeting Ciller stressed the importance Turkey  attaches to its friendship and cooperation with Iran. Vural  said: At the meeting, Besharati reiterated that Iran will never  allow activities against Turkey to take place on its territory.  He added that the issues of joint operations and an exchange of  terrorists were not discussed at the Ciller-Besharati meeting.    Besharati later called on Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. At  the meeting, Cetin said that the good relations between the two  friendly and neighborly countries greatly contribute to regional  stability. Cetin added that the good bilateral relations will be  further strengthened through high-level dialogues. Besharati  said that no group will be allowed to engage in activities  against Turkey on Iranian territory. He added that President  Suleyman Demirel's visit to Tehran next month will be an  important step in bilateral relations. Mentese was also present  at the Cetin-Besharati meeting.    Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Cetin,  Besharati  said that Turkey and Iran share the view that the disruption of  Iraq's territorial integrity will endanger regional stability.  Replying to correspondents' questions, Mentese said that there  are no border disputes between Iran and Turkey and that the  issue of border security was discussed. In reply to a question  on whether Besharati was informed of Turkey's expectations  regarding border security, Mentese said: We have jointly  included the issue of PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terror on  the agenda. We are discussing the issue. Iran has also  accepted that the PKK is a terror organization. In any event,  Iran agrees that there is no Kurdish problem in Turkey and that  the PKK is a terror organization.</p>

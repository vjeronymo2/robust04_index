			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- Under the wise guidance  of the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il, the Korean people and People's Army are  defending the sovereignty of the country and the gains of  socialism with honour, smashing the war manoeuvres of the  imperialists and [words indistinct] general secretary of the  Democratic Youth Federation of India, in an interview with the  KCNA reporter in India on April 18 on the occasion of the 62nd  founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army.    The general secretary said Comrade Kim Chong-il possessed of  rare wisdom and outstanding ability of leadership, has not only  built an invincible anthropocentric socialism based on the  singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses but  also put forward unique idea and theory of Army building and  consolidated the defences of the country as firm as rock.    The secret of the victory won by the Korean people and  People's Army at every step in the decisive battle with U.S.  imperialism and its allied force in recent years lies in the  outstanding leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme  commander of the Korean People's Army, who is possessed of iron  will and matchless grit, he emphasized.    Saying that the acute situation created on the Korean  peninsula is entirly attributable to the reckless military  adventures and interference of the United States, he demanded  that the U.S. withdraw its forces from South Korea, discontinue  all forms of war rehearsals and stop the deployment of Patriot  missiles in South Korea at once.</p>

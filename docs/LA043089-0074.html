			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> PROTEST WAS IN WRONG PLACE AT WRONG TIME  </P> <P> Last Saturday, Stop Taking Our Pets (STOP) held a demonstration at the central  San Diego County Animal Shelter to protest the selling of shelter dogs to UC  San Diego for research.  </P> <P> As members of several animal rights groups, including People for the Ethical  Treatment of Animals, Friends of County Animal Shelters, Animal Protection  Institute and the National Anti-Vivisection Society to name a few, we could  have been expected to join the protesters.  </P> <P> Instead, as shelter volunteers, we found ourselves on the other side of the  fence -- literally and figuratively.  </P> <P> Although we too are adamantly opposed to any shelter animal being used or  abused by researchers (or anyone else, for that matter), we were equally  opposed to this demonstration.  </P> <P> After last year's demonstration, we and other concerned shelter volunteers  lodged a protest with the organizers of the march. Our concerns were totally  ignored.  </P> <P> One of those concerns was that the central shelter is the wrong place to hold  such a demonstration, because no animals are taken from central for research  purposes.  </P> <P> Even more important, the decision to contract with UCSD is not made by the  Department of Animal Control. The Board of Supervisors directs the department  to sell dogs for research.  </P> <P> Just as the shelter is the wrong place, the timing of the demonstration  couldn't have been worse. Saturday is our busiest adoption day. This year and  last we saw potential adopters drive up, see the picketing and drive away --  without one of our animals.  </P> <P> Even worse, perhaps, was the interference with people bringing animals into the  shelter. Leaders of the group boasted that, during last year's demonstration,  no animals were turned in to animal control. Instead, they claimed that all  were taken by demonstrators who found them homes. When asked recently if the  new homes were good homes, one of the leaders replied: "How would I know?"  </P> <P> To some people, any home is a good home. To those of us who see the results of  neglectful, abusive owners every day, we know animals can suffer fates far  worse than ending up at the shelter. Shelter staff and volunteers are committed  to a careful screening of all potential pet adopters.  </P> <P> Another concern is that people who need to relinquish animals are turned away  by demonstrators. Animals not left at the shelter are far too likely to be  abandoned to starvation, illness or death on the highway.  </P> <P> Those who did brave the picket lines to relinquish an animal were subjected to  jeering and abuse. One elderly gentleman had trapped a sick, mange-ridden,  starving cat in order to prevent its further suffering. The demonstrators  heaped insults and worse on him, even telling him, "God knows who you are."  </P> <P> People relinquishing animals were not the only ones subjected to verbal abuse.  One longtime volunteer who always gives up her Saturday morning to exercise  adoption dogs was accosted by at least six brave demonstrators. They accused  her of not having the interest of animals at heart, of being responsible for  taking animals and selling them for research, of killing animals rather than  saving them. They even questioned her right to wear a Friends of County Animal  Shelters sweat shirt.  </P> <P> When the shelter closed, soon after this confrontation, we nursed our tension  headaches and discussed alternatives for STOP to consider.  </P> <P> Instead of demonstrating at the central shelter and disrupting the adoption of  our animals, we suggest they direct their attention to the decision makers and  picket the meetings and homes of county supervisors.  </P> <P> Better yet, we invite them to join us in the trenches where the real battle to  save animals is fought.  </P> <P> How hard is it to attend meetings and hold a picket sign for a couple of hours  a year? Easier we imagine than waking up every night and seeing the frightened  faces and pleading eyes of the animals we come to know and love.  </P> <P> Shelter volunteers work every day to find suitable homes for these animals and  to educate the public about responsible pet ownership. With the help of  additional volunteers, we could come even closer to our goal of emptying the  kennels of dogs and cats -- thereby leaving nothing for UCSD.  </P></p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Expensive vote of confidence: The injection of Pounds 500m of new funds into the UK property market may mark a turning point When the history of the 1990-93 property crash is written, yesterday's announcement that George Soros had teamed up with British Land to invest in UK property may be seen as confirmation that the market had turned. Property shares rose across the board in response to the injection of up to Pounds 500m of new funds and, more importantly, the vote of confidence in Britain's property market by Mr Soros. The investment decisions of the Hungarian-born investor have been followed closely by the investment community ever since he made a fortune during sterling's forced exit from the European exchange rate mechanism last September. For close followers of the UK property market, the involvement of Mr John Ritblat, chairman of British Land, was also encouraging. Mr Ritblat, a survivor of the 1970s property crash, is widely seen as one of the shrewdest players in the UK property market, having spent some Pounds 900m on property during the depths of the downturn. British Land is now the fourth-largest British property company by market capitalisation, at about Pounds 700m, having overtaken more established players such as Hammerson. The announcement of the joint venture between British Land and Mr Soros's Quantum Fund was made against a backdrop of steadily improving prospects for the commercial property industry. This is generally believed to date from sterling's withdrawal from the ERM, which paved the way for lower interest rates, economic recovery and potentially a revival over the longer term in inflation, which enhances the investment appeal of assets such as property. Improved confidence is most clearly seen in the performance of property shares. Since mid-September, they have risen by 88 per cent across the board compared with a rise of 26 per cent in the FTA-All Share index. Characteristically, Mr Ritblat maintains that the property market bottomed out long before anyone else noticed it. He publicly called the turn a year ago. 'For the first time since 1989, we think we have now seen the worst,' he said. Mr Ritblat, the son of a Hampstead dentist, began his career at 17 working for Edward Erdman, an estate agent. He soon formed his own agency, Conrad Ritblat, which was taken over by a company called Union Property, which was later reversed into British Land in 1970. British Land, with Mr Ritblat at the helm, virtually collapsed in 1974, when its share price fell to 3.5p. However, Mr Ritblat kept the support of the banks, and the company had gained back its health by the end of the decade. Although Mr Ritblat has increasingly won support from investors, his aggressive style is disliked by some big UK institutional investors. The friction came to a head in 1989 when he was forced to abandon a scheme to split British Land in two, after several institutions protested at the terms of the deal. When he called the turn in the market a year ago, most observers were unimpressed. Concern about the economy was deepening and high real interest rates were causing tenant defaults and inflicting heavy strains on the profit and loss accounts of highly geared companies such as British Land. Moreover, the property market was reeling from a spate of bad news, including the collapse of Mountleigh and Canary Wharf. But Mr Ritblat argues the pessimism was misplaced. 'A lot of less sophisticated people confuse bankruptcies in the corporate sector with the underlying strength or weakness of the property market,' he says. Any confusion can be forgiven: the behaviour of the property market is far from straightforward. Values generally are still falling, letting-boards litter cities, companies are still collapsing and most companies are still grappling with huge financial difficulties. So far, any improvement in asset values is tentative and limited to small pockets of the market, such as retail warehouses (where British Land has been a notable investor). Taken as a whole, the property market is still suffering from deep-seated problems. The building surge in the late 1980s has resulted in a large imbalance between supply and demand. In the City of London, one of the worst markets, vacancy rates of 17 per cent are still high by historic standards. In addition, there is a huge overhang of bank debt depressing the market. International bank loans to the UK property industry now stand at Pounds 37bn, part of which will have to be written off. Many of the loans were secured against property developments, which do not have rental income and so have little prospect of finding a buyer. The severity of some banks' problems was illustrated by last week's collapse of Speyhawk, a development company which went into receivership with debts of more than Pounds 350m. The banks' problems with existing property loanbooks are affecting their ability to make new loans. They are only prepared to lend against the very best properties, thus preventing a recovery in the second tier of the market. So far, the embryonic signs of recovery can be ascribed to the relationship of investment yields to interest rates. In recent years investment yields have risen to a point where they have exceeded the yield on gilts for the first time since the 1960s. When interest rates fell, the yield on property exceeded the cost of finance, making it an attractive investment. At the end of last year, the auction rooms reported brisk business as private investors switched into property. Overseas investors were conspicuous buyers. In particular, German investors were attracted by the high yields on City office blocks and the fall in sterling's value. Gradually, renewed interest spilled into institutional investors, which have also returned selectively to the market. Increasingly, investors are looking at property because they expect asset values to rise. Until now, many have bought because of property's bond-like income stream, but in future they anticipate capital growth. They expect growth in two ways: from a fall in investment yields and from a rise in rents. Investment yields respond to the amount of money going into property. Although there has not yet been any improvement in average yields, some sectors such as retail warehouses and office buildings in central London have already seen declining yields. Yesterday's announcement that Quantum and British Land intended to invest Pounds 500m (which, with borrowings, could total Pounds 1bn) in the property market could help this trend, not least because property owners are increasingly reluctant to sell good-quality property if they believe the market has turned. The Quantum/British Land announcement coincides with a spate of rights issues, which will ease the pressure on property companies to sell property and give them ammunition to do more deals. Property companies have made the most of the revival in their share prices: nearly Pounds 750m has been raised in the past three months. Industry observers believe that rights issues worth a further Pounds 250m are in the pipeline. It is possible that the stock market has exaggerated the extent of the recovery in the underlying property market. A decline in investment yields signals that investors believe rents are likely to rise. However, opinions differ widely on the prospects for rental growth. Mr Ritblat believes rents have virtually stabilised, although most agents report that they are still falling. The outlook for rental growth depends, above anything else, on the prospect for employment. The feeble outlook for job creation, together with the banking sector's property problems, means there is unlikely to be a rapid recovery in property values across the board. The fundamental problems in the industry will ensure that the decline will not give way to a sharp or immediate upturn. Nonetheless, there is growing conviction that the worst property decline since the 1930s is over. 'Historically it looked unlikely that we could have got into a sustained period of deflation and slump,' says Mr Ritblat. 'It was obvious the cycle was bound to turn.'</p>

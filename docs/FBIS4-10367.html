			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 11 Apr (EFE) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina said today that Cuba will not raise any obstacles to  returning to the OAS if the members ask for it.    Cuba was expelled from the OAS in 1962 at the request of the  United States. Cuba has taken a very harsh attitude since then  to this organization, which it labeled the "U.S. Ministry of  Colonies."    Robaina said that "nothing can be evaluated in the same  manner after 30 years," and that the Latin American countries  also are not "under the same conditions they were three decades  ago in relation to the OAS."    Robaina added: "Independently of the fact that the United  States remains the same, which is something I cannot evaluate, I  believe Latin America is not the same as 30 years ago.  Therefore, the OAS can be an organization where Latin Americans  can discuss their problems in an open, frank, and sincere  manner."    He said: "If this is achieved by the OAS, by [Secretary  General-elect] Gaviria, we would have nothing against it."    In reference to an eventual return of his country to that  Latin American forum, Robaina said his country "has nothing to  negotiate" and also does not demand that Cuba be allowed to  return.    Robaina said: "We were unjustly expelled from it and we will  return to it if voices emerge, like the ones now emerging,  proposing the idea that the OAS must be with Cuba and not  without Cuba."    He said: "If that idea becomes a reality, my country will  raise no obstacles."    Regarding relations with Peru, Robaina said that "they are  normal but we should strengthen them and not resign ourselves to  historic relations," in allusion to the participation of  Peruvians in the war for Cuban independence.    He added: "Strengthening relations means agreements like the  one we signed today, visits like this one, visits we expect to  receive in Cuba, and trade and economic agreements to put our  relations at that historic level."    Robaina today signed with his Peruvian counterpart, Efrain  Goldenberg, an agreement on customs cooperation and another on  the struggle against drug trafficking.    Before the meeting, Robaina met about 200 Peruvian  businessmen whom he invited to invest in Cuba after explaining  the incentives offered by his country for foreign investment.    In the afternoon, Robaina was received by Jaime Yoshiyama,  president of Congress and vice president of the Republic.  Robaina also met Industry, Tourism, and Integration Minister  Liliana Canale.    Tomorrow Robaina will pursue private activities and on 13  April he will leave for Paraguay to continue his South American  tour that started last week in Uruguay and includes Argentina.</p>

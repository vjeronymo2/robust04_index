			<p>BFN     [Text] Huancayo -- The dangerous Chilean terrorist  "Rodrigo," who heads the so-called MRTA [Tupac Amaru  Revolutionary Movement] Central Guerrilla Front (Junin, Pasco,  and Huancavelica), may be in hiding in the central jungle area,  according to Villa Perene authorities.    The dangerous terrorist is allegedly planning some terrorist  actions to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the clash with  security forces in Los Molinos, on 28 April 1989.    The spokesman added that a few days ago the Chilean  participated in several attacks perpetrated in Pampa, Tigre, and  Alto Celendin, in the central jungle in Chanchamayo.    The source added that in the meantime, a group of MRTA  members is steadily moving toward the higher areas of southern  Chanchamayo Province.    According to a source in the National Crime Investigative  Directorate (Dinincri), the Chilean "Rodrigo" arrived in Peru in  1990 to learn and later on participate in MRTA criminal  activities.    Once in Peru, the MRTA made him witness some attacks, such  as  the one perpetrated against the La Rosa Nautica restaurant in  1991.    Later on, following the orders of the third most powerful  MRTA leader, Chilean terrorist Jaime Castillo Petrucci, aka  Alfredo, Rodrigo started to take part in actions, because the  MRTA knew that he had already participated in several acts of  sabotage in Chile.    After participating in several actions, Rodrigo was made a  member of the MRTA Abduction and Extortion Special Force headed  by Petrucci and other Chilean terrorists. Rodrigo thus  participated in the murder of businessman David Ballon Vera and  Spanish citizen Carlos Manrique Acevedo, as well as the  abduction of businessmen Hiraoka and Furokawa.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. RAIDERS  </P> <P> Oakland, Sacramento, Irwindale and Fontana, don't blame Al Davis for your own  shortcomings.  </P> <P> If Oakland had it together, the Raiders would still be there. Sacramento  part-ownership, I think not; Irwindale couldn't get the money or the site in  order. Fontana, well, who cares?  </P> <P> The Coliseum Commission should be forced into hard manual labor for its  treatment of Davis. Thankfully, Spectacor stepped up and at least for now kept  the Raiders in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> M.A. SCHELSKE  </P> <P> San Dimas  </P></p>

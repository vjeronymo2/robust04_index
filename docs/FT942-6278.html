			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of the Computer Industry - Battle for the Desktop (5): Unfashionable giants / Mainframes, for 30 years regarded as the central focus of the data processing firmament, are being re-cast as high powered network servers Mainframe computers, large, expensive and energy-hungry are deeply unfashionable. They are, nevertheless, for a broad range of data processing tasks, indispensable. This is the mainframe manufacturers' chief dilemma. Each the suppliers in this sector - and there is only a handful left - has important customers: large enterprises, public utilities and the like, for whom mainframes are essential. Only a mainframe can provide the memory, the raw computing power and ability to support several thousand users and a multiplicity of tasks. But the number of such users is unlikely to grow much. Indeed, over the next decade or so, they will probably contract and with them the aggregate revenues manufacturers derive from mainframe sales. Overall revenues for Groupe Bull's UK subsidiary grew 35 per cent last year for example; mainframe revenues were essentially flat. All these customers have, however, to be supported. First, because mainframes remain a powerful source of revenue. Mr Louis Gerstner, IBM's chairman, might argue that the company 'no longer makes a lot of money on mainframe computers,' but gross margins on large systems, while much reduced from earlier years, are still appreciable. By comparison, a number of manufacturers - Groupe Bull is one - have been losing money on their personal computer operations. Second, because it is important to keep faith with customers if they are not to turn to other suppliers for their data processing equipment. All have critical 'legacy' systems on which their business turns and which would prove both inconvenient and expensive to rewrite. Third, because the leopard is changing its spots: mainframes, for 30 years regarded as the central focus of the data processing firmament, are being re-cast as high powered network servers, designed to co-operate with other computers instead of taking charge of the operation. Mr Philip Crawford, managing director of Bull (UK) says: 'If we can continue to drive down the cost of ownership while improving quality and maintainability, there is no reason for users to rush to get off mainframes. The only proper reason for downsizing is in pursuit of a business strategy, not fashion.' Many industry experts believe the move to client-server systems has been driven more by fashion than by real user need, and that the true cost, per workstation, of a client-server system is often under-estimated. They believe that within a few years there could be a backlash against client-server and Unix based systems which will see mainframes reinstated as the centre of the data processing hierarchy. The continued development, however, of mainframe technology is expensive. Manufacturers are having to trade off investment in mainframes against funding faster growing parts of the industry. And at the same time, the price of mainframes is falling fast - at a rate of about 33 per cent last year - both because the basic technology is becoming cheaper and because manufacturers have to price their hardware in competition with apparently cheaper industry-standard systems. Mr Gerstner at IBM in a striking reversal of past policy has already made it clear that the mainframe division no longer has first claim on the company's research and development funds. For some companies, mainframe ventures have proved a disaster. Digital Equipment, once the leader in minicomputers, moved into mainframes with its 9000 series. Sales, however, were a fraction of expectations. A number of alliances have been struck between companies to share costs and technologies. Earlier this year Amdahl, a US manufacturer of computers that are plug-compatible with IBM's announced an alliance with Fujitsu of Japan which holds a minority stake in the US company. It calls for the two companies to develop jointly the next generation of mainframes based on a semiconductor technology called CMOS. The agreement is expected to reduce research and development costs significantly for Amdahl. ICL in the UK has already benefitted greatly from its technology alliance with Fujitsu which has given it access to the Japanese company's semiconductor and component technology at an early stage. IBM earlier this year agreed to provide Hitachi of Japan - a bitter rival - with the microprocessors at the heart of its newest systems. These are CMOS chips that do not need the elaborate liquid cooling systems necessary with earlier systems. Earlier this month, NEC, the Japanese manufacturer which supplies Groupe Bull with mainframe computers said the two companies are discussing collaboration on the next generation of both mainframe and midrange computers with the object of reducing the research and development burden for both companies. The implementation of CMOS chips in the circuitry of the latest mainframe computers is significant. CMOS is widely used in personal computers where its advantages lie in low power consumption and heat dissipation. Increasingly, mainframe technology is being driven by personal computer technology. NCR, the US computer manufacturer taken over two years ago by AT&amp;T, led the way in 1990 announcing that its entire range would be based on microprocessors from Intel, the world's leading semiconductor company. Over the next few years, a number of microprocessors and and processing architectures are likely to jostle for position as the base technology for large computer systems. They include Intel's 80/x86 range, IBM and Apple's PowerPC, Hewlett Packard's PA Risc, and Digital Equipment's Alpha. The trick will be to develop sound and reliable systems running many of these chips in parallel. IBM, for example, is taking another crack at the supercomputer market with a machine announced last month, the SP2, which is claimed to offer up to 136 billions of floating point operations a second. It is based on IBM's reduced instruction set computing (risc) chips, first seen in the RS6000 workstation, running in parallel. The launch of the SP2 is a big cultural change for IBM. One of its senior executives once dismissed the significance of client-server computing with the jibe that if you network together a thousand pocket calculators, it does not make a mainframe. These days, given a little poetic licence, it does.</p>

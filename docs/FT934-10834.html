			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report News that OPEC cut crude OIL output in October failed to drive prices higher yesterday. London December futures for the world benchmark Brent Blend crude briefly fell below Dollars 15.90 per barrel, down 30 cents from Monday when the market tried a rally. A Reuter monthly survey of industry estimates put October production by OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) at 24.67m barrels daily. This was down 140,000 from the Reuter estimate for September and 450,000 lower than a year ago - when prices were Dollars 4.0 higher. If OPEC has curbed excess supply, however, demand for oil has remained stubbornly weak in a recessionary world economy and this was cited as the other reason for the decline of 20 per cent in world oil prices this year. OPEC leaders, however, believe that prices are poised to head higher. GOLD attempted a tentative recovery after the sharp fall, lead by silver, on Monday. But after being 'fixed' at Dollars 363 a troy ounce in the afternoon, gold closed in London last night down another Dollars 1.75 an ounce at Dollars 361. Silver closed another 3.5 cents down.

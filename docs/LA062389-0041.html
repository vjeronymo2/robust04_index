			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Hundreds of civil rights activists boarded buses in Philadelphia, Miss., to  retrace the trail of the 1960s Freedom Riders after honoring three civil rights  workers who were slain near the Mississippi town 25 years ago. Some 470  pilgrims had arrived in a caravan of 13 buses from New York and Philadelphia,  Pa., to attend ceremonies Wednesday honoring the three workers. The next day,  10 chartered buses left for Washington and additional ceremonies, with the  caravan modeled on the North-to-South Freedom Rides of the 1960s.  </P></p>

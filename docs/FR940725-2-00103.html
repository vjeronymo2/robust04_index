			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the Exchange's proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication on notice of filing thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Amendment No. 1 reduces the proposed position limits with respect to Nikkei 300 Index options from 50,000 contracts on the same side of the market to 25,000 contracts (provided that no more than 15,000 contracts, as opposed to 30,000 contracts as originally proposed, are in series in the nearest expiration month). By reducing the position limits, this amendment will serve to protect investors and the public interest, and further minimize the potential for manipulation. Further, the proposal containing the higher position limits was published for the full 21-day comment period, and no comments were received. Therefore, the Commission finds that no new regulatory issues are raised by Amendment No. 1. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 1 to the Exchange's proposal on an accelerated basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Treasury drops dividends probe after pressure The Treasury has abandoned its review of whether companies' dividend payments are too high and there will be no measures in the Budget next week aimed at controlling dividends. A senior government official said the issue was dropped after it was attacked by Lord Hanson, chairman of the Hanson conglomerate. The official said: 'The issue became too much of a hot potato after Hanson attacked the review. No one wanted to pick it up.' Mr Stephen Dorrell, as financial secretary to the Treasury, initiated an inquiry a year ago into whether the tax structure encourages companies to allocate an excessive proportion of retained profits to dividends compared with funds for investment. It was part of a wider review of the financing of industry. Mr Dorrell disclosed details of the probe in a speech to a Confederation of British Industry conference in the spring. He was immediately attacked by Mr Paddy Linaker, then chief executive of M&amp;G, the fund management group. But a far greater embarrassment was the leak of a letter to Mr Dorrell from Lord Hanson, accusing the minister of 'sounding like a socialist'. Lord Hanson then urged the prime minister to keep a firm hand on the dividend review. A government official said yesterday that since then the probe has been quietly shelved. Companies are making artificially high dividend payments to keep pension funds happy and protect themselves against hostile takeovers, a study by the School of Business and Economics at Leeds University said yesterday. All 700 respondents said companies were pressured by City opinion to be more generous with dividend payments than they would like.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> KLSX-FM morning deejay Peter Tilden, whose 6-10 a.m. show was floundering in  the ratings, has been fired and former KMET jock David Perry will take over his  duties on Monday. . He will be joined by Kate Hayes, who had been on the show  with Tilden. KLSX General Manager Bob Moore said Thursday that Tilden was  "miscast" in the morning slot. "I believe he's a very talented and creative  individual but all of our research and obviously the Arbitrons (ratings) said  our audience wanted a music-intensive and music-oriented person in the  mornings," Moore said. "Our particular people didn't want that type of talky  morning show. I think in the right environment he would have been very  successful. But, we had to listen to our audience. . . . It was a critic's hit  and an audience failure." Moore also pointed to the increasingly tough  competition locally among morning drive-time air personalities. Arbitron  ratings for the spring quarter released this week showed that the station had  plummeted in the ratings since Tilden started in September. The station had  ranked ninth last fall and dropped to 21st in the last survey. Perry, who had  worked most recently at KLSX's sister station in Detroit (WCSX) and at KMET  from 1974-80, will feature more music and less talk, Moore said, a familiar  rallying cry in Los Angeles radio these days.

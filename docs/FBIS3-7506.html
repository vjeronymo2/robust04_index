			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo TV Asahi Network in Japanese at  0100 GMT on 27 March, in its regularly-scheduled "Sunday  Project" program, carries a 20-minute interview with Yoshiro  Mori, secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP],  by political commentator Soichiro Tahara. In the interview,  Mori discusses the LDP policy to continue pressuring Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa over questionable loans totalling 100  million yen received from the scandal-tainted trucking company  Sagawa Kyubin.    Asked why the LDP is so eager to pursue Hosokawa's  responsibility, Mori stated: "We are just following a Diet  resolution. When we enacted the fiscal 1993 supplementary  budget, Lower House Budget Committee Chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi  of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] proposed a  resolution according to Article 104 of the Diet Administration  Law." He adds: "The resolution was adopted at the lower house  plenary session with no opposition. All parties--including  Hosokawa's Japan New Party [JNP], the Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], Komeito, and the SDPJ--said yes to the resolution."  "The Diet is formally demanding the government--the tax office,  the prosecutors, or the prime minister himself--make up for  deficient documents submitted by the prime minister, but the  government has not shown an appropriate response. This is why  Diet sessions are deadlocked." Mori adds that sooner or later  "Hosokawa will have to take responsibility" for the political  turmoil.    Regarding the LDP's future course of action, Mori stresses  his stance to continue boycotting Diet sessions as long as  Hosokawa remains silent about the issue, saying: "If Hosokawa  keeps refusing the Diet's request, the enactment of the 1994  budget will be further delayed." Asked if he intends to urge  Hosokawa's resignation, Mori replies: "To take responsibility  for his actions, Hosokawa will be forced to dissolve either his  administration or the lower house."    Mori continues: "When a person wants to borrow money, he or  she usually goes to a bank. If somebody borrows a large amount  of money from a trucking company, this person may have a special  relationship with the company, or the loan may be given under  favorable conditions. Hosokawa did that while a public  official, yet he is advocating visibility in politics and  elimination of corruption. If those are still regarded as the  basis of political reform, he must speak out. The LDP is not  responsible for the turmoil."</p>

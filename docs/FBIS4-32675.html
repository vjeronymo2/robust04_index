			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 28 June (TANJUG) -- Italian Foreign  Minister Antonio Martino, on a short working visit to the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, met with Serb Republic  Vice-President Biljana Plavsic and Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha  in Belgrade today.    After the meeting Biljana Plavsic told reporters that the  talks with the Italian foreign minister came at the right  moment, clearly having in mind the forthcoming meetings,  including the G7 summit, at which, as expected, the fate of  former Bosnia-Herzegovina could be finally decided.    Assessing today's talks with Martino and his aides, Buha  said  that his first impression was that they were "beginning to do  the job with a fresh approach and without bias."    The Italians wanted to hear at first hand where the Serb  Republic sees the solution of the Bosnian conflict, which was  interpreted in Serb Republic circles as an obvious intention by  Rome to get more actively involved in the Bosnian peace process.    According to Buha, the Italian minister and his aides were  today informed about the general position of the Serb Republic  on the Bosnian conflict. First of all, the Italians were told,  the international community has gotten itself entangled in a net  from which it ccan hardly get out unless it could come up with  some new ideas.    There are two main conditions for the resolution of the  conflict, as far as the Serb Republic is concerned, Buha said.  The first one is that the international community acknowledges  at long last that the former Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot exist as  an independent state any more, that this is a piece of fiction.    The other condition is that things in the former Bosnia-  Herzegovina are called by their real names. This means that  there are three sovereign nations in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina who can decide their own fate. The  international community should recognize two state entities -  the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb Republic, Buha said.</p>

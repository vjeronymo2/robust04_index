			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE KILL GUNMAN, 80, IN WHEELCHAIR  </P> <P> A wheelchair-bound, 80-year-old man was shot and killed by two SWAT team  officers Sunday when he pointed a pistol at the officers and pulled the  trigger, San Diego police said.  </P> <P> The man's gun did not fire, police said.  </P> <P> Warren H. (Jimmy) Harrington, who lived with his wife, Martha, in a condominium  in the 2200 block of Del Mar Scenic Parkway, was shot about 9:43 p.m. and died  of multiple gunshot wounds at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla about 15  minutes later.  </P> <P> Police officers arrived at the residence at 7:30 p.m. after it was reported  that the man had a gun and was threatening to commit suicide. The Special  Weapons and Tactics team arrived at the scene about 8:45 p.m.  </P> <P> During a more than two-hour standoff, Harrington's wife and the Rev. Mike  MacIntosh, a police chaplain, failed to talk him into giving up the gun. They  left the condominium after Harrington put the gun to his chest, police said.  </P> <P> Police then entered the apartment. Harrington, who was confined to a  wheelchair, pointed the .32-caliber revolver at them and pulled the trigger,  police said. Officers Melvin Lofftus and Wayne Spees then fired almost  simultaneously.  </P> <P> Investigators later determined that the bullets in Harrington's gun were duds,  a police spokesman said.  </P> <P> Harrington's wife told police that her husband had been distraught for two  weeks because he was confined to a wheelchair after suffering a stroke, the  spokesman said.  </P> <P> Harrington's daughter-in-law, Sue Harrington, said Monday that he had founded  Harrington's Appliances, once a chain with several outlets in San Diego County  but that only the store on Upas Street in North Park remains.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARE RAIDERS FINALLY GETTING FAIR SHARE?  </P> <P> On behalf of the 20,000 or so Raider fans left in Los Angeles, I would like to  thank Chris Baker and The Times for the daily coverage of the Raider training  camp in Oxnard.  </P> <P> Raider fans actually get an in-depth article every day, just like the Ram fans,  and it seems like the players and management are taking the time to speak with  Mr. Baker. This could not always be said when Mark Heisler, who spent half of  his space knocking the Raider organization, was covering the team.  </P> <P> MANUEL R. GUTIERREZ  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

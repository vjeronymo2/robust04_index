			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / How To Spend It: In the swim with a Tinsel Town look - Dip a toe in the tide of fashion history when you buy this summer's beachwear THERE ARE swim suits for serious swimming (Speedo, for example, plain, simple, classic and practical) and then there are swimsuits for posing round pools sipping something long and cool that tinkles nicely - in which case you need all the flattery that the designer can muster. Ideally the craft of the old-fashioned corsetiere should be married to the art of the designer and the technical know-how of the chemist. But, above all, the hallmark of this year's swimsuits is glamour, glamour and yet more glamour. Think Rita Hayworth, Esther Williams, Betty Grable and you will get the idea. Hollywood is the image to go for, forget quiet good taste. Most of the big designer names have caught the theme. Ruching, sweet-heart necklines, criss-crossed straps, lots of uplift, clever ways with darts, and, of course, such are the wonders of modern fibre technology, fabrics that seem soft and feminine but offer lots of confidence-boosting support. Sweet ginghams, chirpy polka dots, jaunty nautical stripes are the prints. Sugary almond pinks, turquoise, lipstick red and, of course, the perennial glamour colour, black, are the colours to go for. For those who like established names Amanda Verdan, director of fashion buying at Harvey Nichols of Knightsbridge, London SW1, has collected a clutch of the smartest labels in the business. Top of the scale for chic (and price - these all start at about Pounds 100 a time) are La Perla (but these arrive in November for the start of the cruise season and sell fast), Liza Bruce, Capucine Puerari (lots of under-wiring, back-interest and big on 40s-style glamour). As for Moschino, he is still the cheekiest designer around - this summer's hit is his white one-piece with 'Swim Where?' printed in big black letters on the front. Harvey Nichols is to open a brand new beachwear department in about a fortnight in which all the big designer names will be gathered together but, more usefully, so will everything else the beachbound shopper might require, from a pair of espadrilles and a bathing hat to a capacious beach-bag or a cover-up. The hottest new designer, is Samantha de Teran, all of 26 and a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, and St Martin's School of Art. Almost every chic shop in and out of London has snapped up her range. Her swimsuits are evocative of the old-fashioned bathers of the 1930s. They sport long-line bodies with tiny shorts or flared skirts - much, much more flattering, in my view, than those high-cut swimsuits which were alleged to make the legs look longer but in reality did nothing so much as make them look vulgar. There are no gimmicks, no florals, no frills or bows, just strikingly simple, almost sculptural, swimsuits in the classy classic colours of cream, navy, olive or black. They are beautifully made using, she wishes you to know, an all-British fabric, a combination of nylon and Lycra, her trade mark is the ladder-back cut-outs at the side, or back or round the neck. What she aims to do, above all, is flatter. Fenwick of Bond Street, London W1, has the full collection but they are going fast. Most of the designs range between Pounds 70 and Pounds 100. Other stockists include Way In, Harrods, London SW1; Lisa Stirling of Manchester; La Jolie Madame of Edinburgh and Brown Thomas of Dublin. More retro-styling comes from Slix which has homed in on the 1950s. Here we have Grace (named after guess who?), scoop-necked, off-the-shoulder, with a matching skirt. Essential accessories to complete the look are, of course, the sunglasses and the chiffon scarf. More nostalgia in the world of swimwear comes with the news that Jansen, that old staple of school swimming teams, is these days ultra-chic. This will not be news to readers of Hello] magazine. In January they were treated to endless photographs of the Princess of Wales diving into the Caribbean in one Jansen outfit after another. Being just 5 ft 2 ins myself I have trouble empathising with the problems of the willowy set. However it seems being tall is amazingly difficult - quite apart from lining-up with men-friends (eye contact, I gather, is tricky though as one who is very used to talking to armpits this seems a small price to pay for long limbs) finding shoes and swimwear to fit seems to present real difficulties. Long Tall Sally, which, as its name implies, has long addressed the particular needs of the tall set, has a selection of six swimsuits all of which are cut to fit those with long bodies - which is not always just the very tall, some shorter women have disproportion- ately long bodies. The range is well-priced ranging from Pounds 16.95 to Pounds 29.95. They fit sizes 12-20 and both the body and straps have been lengthened to suit the taller frame. The best of the collection, in my view, are the black ruched one-piece (Pounds 29.95) - very 1950s, with its sweetheart neckline and ruching down the body - and the black or turquoise bubble one-piece (Pounds 19.95). All the Long Tall Sally Shops sell them but they are also available by mail order - telephone 0604-494349 for a free mail order brochure.</p>

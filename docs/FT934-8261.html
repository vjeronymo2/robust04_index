			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (2): Axis for the twenty-first century - Hub of the future / The city is gearing itself up to become a gateway to southern Europe with a port to rival that of Rotterdam THE expansion of Barcelona's airport is a measure of the confidence with which the city faces its economic future. The airport tripled its total area in the run up to the 1992 Olympic games and its four terminals now have the capacity to handle 16m passengers a year - four times the population of greater Barcelona and double the annual number of visitors that fly into the city. But the airport's under-capacity does not appear to worry anyone in Barcelona. City hall officials, business leaders and academics share the view that Barcelona is destined to become a 'Mediterranean Rotterdam', the most important communications centre in southern Europe, the gateway to the southern swathe of the Economic Community. 'We are talking about the motorways we have, the port we are building up and the high-speed train we have been promised,' says Professor Joaquim Muns, a senior member of the economics faculty at Barcelona University. 'The sum is a practical and efficient intermodal nucleus, a sort of Rotterdam.' Barcelona's economy, once rooted in its textile industry and latterly in car and chemical manufacturing, is now increasingly viewed as being bound up in its role as a gateway and a crossroads. Those who think Barcelona through into the next century talk about the city's location and discuss the 'axis' and the 'arc'. The axis has to do with Spain and with its two high growth areas, the Ebro river valley that meanders across north Spain to the Mediterranean and the Mediterranean coast line itself. Barcelona stands at the motorway intersection of these two expanding belts, well linked to Zaragoza, the Ebro valley's focal point, and to the fast-growing Valencia nucleus that lies to its south on the Mediterranean. As, and when, Spain emerges from recession, wealth will again begin to flow down the Ebro valley and up the Mediterranean coast to pass through Barcelona on its way into northern Europe. It is no accident that the plants of two of Spain's sturdiest, export-driven manufacturers - General Motors and Ford - lie next to Zaragoza and Valencia respectively. The arc relates to the Mediterranean stretch from northern Italy, through southern France to north-eastern Spain which has some 50m inhabitants. This area, which is coming to be known as the 'southern banana', is viewed as a dynamic complement to the better known 'hot banana', the name given to the central European arc that extends south from the Paris-London-Amsterdam triangle along the Rhur valley to Milan and Lombardy. Barcelona takes its local banana arc seriously for this is where the Rotterdam analogy comes into play. During the 1980s, the number of containers passing through the port of Barcelona increased from 180,000 teu (twenty foot equivalent units) to 448,000. By 1991 the total was up to 488.917 teu, turning Barcelona into one of the world's biggest Mediterranean ports and putting it comfortably ahead of its closest competitors, Marseilles and Genoa. The city projects itself as an intermodal distribution centre that will quickly move maritime cargo arriving at its international container terminal on to motorway and railways networks. With a view to consolidating Barcelona's role as the centre of freight distribution for southern Europe, the city's port authorities have a blueprint for a new container terminal which will raise the harbour's handling capacity to 700,000 teu a year. The future, as the city planners see it, has maritime cargoes from the Pacific Rim saving four days in their journey to Europe by unloading at Barcelona instead of at Rotterdam. Time saving will be greatly improved once Barcelona is connected on a European-gauge track to Europe's high-speed train network. Freight traffic will make intensive use of the planned railway connection. According to a forecast by Barcelona's city hall, 2.8m annual tonnes of freight in the short term - the high speed network is scheduled to be operating by 2004 - will rise to 4m tonnes in 2010. As a major European entry point, Barcelona's vast airport might begin to fill up.</p>

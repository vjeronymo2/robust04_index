			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Peace talks reach crucial phase RENEWED fighting between Croats, Serbs and Moslems in the former Yugoslavia yesterday cast a shadow over the Bosnia peace talks in Geneva. The negotiations, to resume today, are about to deal with the most controversial element of the international mediators' peace plan - the detailed map of the ten provinces into which Bosnia will be divided. Anxious not to lose the momentum of the negotiations, the international mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen will urge an agreement on the map during the current session of the talks. They are prepared to draw out the talks as long as necessary. However, given the deep disagreements over territory which divide the three ethnic groups, a more realistic prospect is that the talks will run into the sand by Tuesday and be adjourned for a few days to allow further bilateral contacts. The mediators' plan provides for the creation of an independent, unified state of Bosnia, divided into 10 largely self-governing provinces. But though the Croats have already accepted the provincial map, both the Moslems and Serbs are deeply unhappy with some of the provincial borders. The Moslems, who accounted for more than 40 per cent of Bosnia's population before the conflict began last April, are demanding more land than the 26 per cent allocated to them. The mediators, however, have stressed that the Moslems were mainly city-dwellers and therefore occupied much less land in relation to the size of their population. The Serbs, who have been assigned about 43 per cent of Bosnia, do not want to give up the additional 27 per cent they now occupy as the result of military conquests and 'ethnic cleansing'. But they might do a deal to ensure their provinces are linked by land corridors across Croatian territory.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> ROADS TO ALL ASIAN CUISINES LEAD TO ORCHID'S  </P> <P> Not to be just any Asian restaurant but a hip, '80s California sort of Asian  restaurant -- that's Orchid's dream. It has food from all over East Asia,  chopsticks only on demand, no MSG in anything and a ceiling of exposed ducts  and beams.  </P> <P> I suspect I may already have wrung the last drop of ecstasy from seeing struts  and air ducts over my food, and by this point I'm almost ready for an  acoustic-tile revival, but at least it's done well here. The orchid-colored  ducts are actually entertaining; they end in concentric registers that make  them look like a sucker-footed extraterrestrial about to stomp us all into  hot-and-sour soup.  </P> <P> If there's a problem with Orchid, it's that one restaurant is not likely to do  equally well on all the cuisines it essays -- Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai,  Vietnamese, Malay and Indonesian -- and in any case, these cuisines all involve  different eating habits. At Orchid, though, everything is dished up the same:  with lettuce, shredded red cabbage and an orange slice.  </P> <P> So there you are with your order of Vietnamese lemon grass pork, topped with  sliced ginger and delicious crisp-fried onion. But where's the other stuff that  always comes with Vietnamese food -- the vinegar and the fish sauce and the hot  sauce? You can get vinegar with sliced ginger in it if you ask, but there  probably ought to be a pile of fresh herbs too.  </P> <P> The biggest victim of this standardized service is the Korean barbecued beef.  It's nice and charcoaly, but the essence of Korean food is the side dishes.  Without at least some radish salad and cabbage kim chi on hand, this could be  barbecued beef from anywhere.  </P> <P> The cuisine that comes off best, and in the most surprising ways, is Chinese.  What greater cliches could there be than shrimp toast and chicken chow mein?  But at Orchid, the shrimp toast is not that rather English appetizer of toast  spread with shrimp paste, but several large shrimp, each inside a big square of  wonderfully crunchy breading. And instead of being a heavy stomach filler, the  chicken chow mein is clean and refreshing with raw green onions and smoky bits  of grilled chicken.  </P> <P> Indonesian ba-tung beef and Thai shrimp curry are both pleasantly spicy dishes  with coconut flavoring (the Malaysian mango chicken, though, is not saved by  its coconut -- it's mawkishly sweet). And there's an appetizer of hot squid  that has its points, notably fried green onion rings and a sweet, garlicky  fish-flavored dipping sauce that would be welcome with a couple of other  dishes. This is not the place to come for mee krob, though. The fried noodles  aren't very puffy and are badly mixed with the tomato-heavy sauce.  </P> <P> Hip and '80s though it means to be, dessert is not Orchid's strong suit.  There's a nice dish of fresh fruit (kiwi, raspberry, mango) with coconut cream  and shaved ice (possibly not the best idea in the weather we've been having),  and sometimes there are French pastries that are made elsewhere. I'm kind of  glad the place has always been out of the egg pudding with mung beans. I might  not be hip enough for that one myself.  </P> <P> Orchid, 37 S. Fair Oaks Ave., Pasadena; (818) 796-8787. Open for lunch and  dinner daily. Beer and wine. Validated parking in the Schoolhouse parking  structure across Fair Oaks. MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food  only, $22 to $36.  </P> <P> </P></p>

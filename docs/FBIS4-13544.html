			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of speech by Ayatollah 'Ali Hoseyni Khamene'i, </F> leader of the Islamic revolution, at meeting with officials from  the Hajj and Religious Endowments Organization on 20 April;  place not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the  Merciful. You are very welcome, my dear brothers and sisters,  servants of the nation. May almighty God accept your services  for the hajj, which is one of the most important obligations for  Muslims. May God assist you and bless you for your efforts and  enable you to perform and revive your great and lofty  obligation. I deem it my duty to thank all those working for  the hajj affairs, particularly those who spend hours of their  time throughout the year to ensure that this religious  obligation is performed properly. [passage omitted]    The obligation to perform the hajj is truly a unique  obligation. There is no other obligation similar to the hajj  among all the Islamic instructions. It is particularly  important. Its spiritual aspects are highly significant.  [passage omitted]. The worldly aspects of the hajj are also  unique. That is, it is an obligation not confined to an  individual or a nation. It covers the entire Islamic world.  Almighty God has chosen a period and has invited everyone to  meet in one place during this period. These are the days of  [exchanging] knowledge. It would have been possible to invite  everyone to gather at this place [on various occasions]  throughout the year. But almighty God has a purpose in inviting  everyone to come to a particular place for a few days each year.  This is the basic and important point.    It is obvious that God's objective is to enable Muslim  individuals to meet each other and to feel united. That is, the  feeling of togetherness, the magnificent feeling of seeing a  gathering made up of various nations and races. If God had not  had such a feeling in mind, there would have been no need to  assign a few days every year for hajj rituals.    Well, what is the objective when every nation of the Islamic  world dispatches some of their people to a particular place on a  particular day to meet one another? The answer should be clear  to every Muslim who knows the meaning of Koranic and Islamic  concepts. Imam Sadeq [the sixth Shi'a imam], peace be upon him,  has said: What you want to know is in God's book. Almighty God  invites a congregation comprising all Muslim nations to gather  during this period. "Then pass on at a quick pace from the  place, whence it is usual for the multitude" [Koranic verse]  That is: Move together, come out together, and perform your  rituals together.    What is the objective of this gathering? Why should the  Muslim people of the world come together? Is the objective just  to come together, to stare silently at one another, and then to  return home? So why should they gather in one place? Is the  objective to gather round and resolve their disputes? What! In  such a gathering?    The close concentration of all Muslim nations in one place,  and a holy place too, pursues only one objective and can only  have a single meaning; and that is: They are asked to gather  round to take a positive step on the fate of the Islamic ummah.  That is, to do a job. The job will be different when the  Islamic nations develop. We hope such a day will come. On such  a day, the elected members of these nations will convene at a  big majles comprising several thousand people, in that place  [Mecca] to pass a resolution. The articles of such a resolution  will then be ratified by the pilgrims, representing various  states. The resolution will then be communicated to the  governments and the nations.    This would be the best alternative. Unfortunately, this is  not practical today, because the nations have not made  sufficient progress in this field yet and the governments are  not assisting them either.    What is the essential task there in Mecca as long as there  is  no possibility of taking practical decisions during the hajj  rituals? The essential task of the nations is to show their  concern regarding the problems of the Islamic world in whatever  way they can, to stress their unity, and to show their disavowal  of the enemies of the Islamic world. This is the least one can  expect and can perform in hajj rituals as determined by Islam.  We have not brought the disavowal [part of the rituals] from  outside to incorporate it into the hajj rituals. This is part  of the hajj rituals, this is the soul of the hajj rituals, and  it is the true meaning of this immense gathering.    Some individuals enjoy saying repeatedly, in their press, in  their comments, and when they wish to sting us, that we have  politicized the hajj rituals. What does it mean, politicizing  the hajj? If it means that we have incorporated a political  concept into the hajj rituals, the answer is that for those who  fail to see this political concept of hajj, we pray that God may  cure them so that they can see it. How is it possible that  someone familiar with Islam, familiar with the Koranic verses on  hajj matters, and familiar with the importance of unity can fail  to understand that this immense gathering pursues the objective  of realizing lofty political and divine political concepts  concerning all Muslims. It is for unity, it is to resolve the  difficulties of the Islamic world, and it is to unite and bring  hearts closer. However, if the objective is to make the hajj  rituals a means of preventing major powers from realizing their  tyrannic policies, then we accept this. Those who are somehow  involved in hajj matters should not compromise this beloved  obligation of the Muslims with international politics. We are in  favor of this. Anyone who politicizes the hajj with such  objectives would betray the hajj.    The problems of the Islamic world are important. Gentlemen,  where else can these problems be raised? Where else can the  Muslims join their united cry against so many dastardly acts  that the Muslims are subjected to in the world today? Where  else can they unite their cry to reach the world and reach the  ears of the treacherous policymakers? Where else, but during  the hajj rituals?    See for yourself what they are doing to Muslims in Europe.  The events in Bosnia and, especially, the recent week's  developments in Gorazde, really make you want to cry. Words  cannot express the gravity and immensity of this tragedy.  Whatever we say, it is not enough.    The leaders of the world's arrogant powers are watching the  victim that is being slaughtered before them and they are just  waiting to see when he will pass away. The victim is the  Muslims of former Yugoslavia. What is their crime? They are  Muslims. This is not a new idea -- I said it myself in my hajj  message three years ago -- but then they used to deny it. Now,  the big mouths of arrogance themselves are saying that they must  not be helped because they are Muslims. They have been forced  to admit it. Their crime is that they are Muslims.    It is because a Muslim nation, in the heart of Europe -- I  am  not saying a Muslim government -- it is not clear that if Bosnia  had had a government, it would have been a totally Islamic  government; they had, after all, lived under the weight of a  communist government for 50 years, more or less -- before that,  too, they lived under the rule of corrupt Ottomans and the like,  or under some corrupt European governments, European empires  such as the Austrian empire, and so on. They could not have  created an Islamic and a Koranic government overnight after all.  No one could have expected that. The thing which has so angered  the world, that is, that global arrogance which has sole mastery  over the world, with regard to the suffering and defenseless  Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina is the existence of a country that  has a Muslim nation. That is what they cannot bear to see.  This is the situation of Muslims in the world today.    In these circumstances, international organizations -- worst  of all and most despicable of all, the United Nations -- have  behaved in the most abominable way. I want to tell you this:  Let the secretary general who stands at the head of the United  Nations know that he has acquired such a terrible reputation  among Muslims that he will never be able to clear his name  again. Muslims can see....    The world's Muslims can see what is happening in Bosnia.  Muslims came forward and said: Let us go there and help these  people, since the other side is receiving help anyway. However,  they were told that such a thing was not possible. The Muslims  then said: Then let us send them arms. They were again told  that such a thing was not possible either. On the surface of  it, of course, the West wants to say that they were not giving  weapons to any side. Well, of course! One side has already  inherited all the weapons which used to belong to the former  state of Yugoslavia, that is, the same state which for many  years lent military support to the Iraqi regime by giving it  tanks and other equipment. The Serbs have all these weapons at  their disposal today. However, the other side, that is, the  unguarded people of a town and the women and children living  there, are empty-handed.    So what do they mean when they say that we have given no  arms  to any of the parties involved? They are deceiving world public  opinion when they say that they are not helping any party. An  armed party is standing against an unarmed one, and instead of  either taking the weapon away from the armed party or giving  weapons to the unarmed party, you just stand aside and say that  you are not helping any side.    This means in effect that they are just sitting and waiting  for the fall and demise of the unarmed party. They are in fact  waiting for the time when the Muslims fall.    They said that they would send UN forces. The Islamic  countries said: Let us go there as part of the UN forces in  order to act as a shield. They replied: No, not possible! They  did not allow any one -- not only from the Islamic Republic of  Iran but from any other Islamic country -- to be sent to the  area in order to act as a shield. What is the meaning of this?  This means that they wanted to instruct the soldiers whom they  sent to the area to go there and back the Serbs. Naturally,  they could not ask the same from a Muslim soldier, and this is  why they did not allow Muslims to take part.    A disgrace such as this reigns over the order which they  seek  to create in the world today. Look at the behavior of the  United States, the false promises they gave to the Muslims of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the absolute refusal to help, and finally  the behavior of international organizations and a number of  European countries and Britain. Muslims remain oppressed in  Bosnia, just waiting to be massacred. What can the world's  Muslims do about this? Is there a way better than hajj?    What makes the arrogant powers tremble with fear is the  masses of people, otherwise they do not care one bit when a few  governments gather in a conference in some corner of the world  and issue a resolution. They would not care if a hundred  resolutions are issued. How many resolutions have been issued  so far against the usurper Zionists? They have been so much hot  air and have achieved sweet nothing.    What really makes the arrogant powers tremble with fear is  the presence of the masses, and where can this presence  materialize better than in the hajj? Two million Muslims from  all Islamic countries will gather there, and if you ask any of  them about their feelings toward Gorazde, they will say they  want to go there and defend the oppressed Muslims of the world.  Would it not be a pity if we were to lose this valuable  congregation, which is capable of bringing so much blessing and  saving the lives of so many Muslims? Is this what politicizing  the hajj means? Is this why they object to the Islamic Republic  of Iran politicizing the hajj?    Disavowal means this: Disavowal means that the people gather  together there and chant against the executioners who wear  neckties and well-ironed suits and who sprinkle aftershave over  themselves, who massacre the people in the most savage way, and  against those who support them, who rule in their favor in the  international organizations. This is the meaning of disavowal.  Can the hajj be complete without this? Is a hajj without  disavowal a hajj? Let the people who are familiar with the  Koran and Islam answer this. Let them answer fairly. This is  what the imam [Khomeyni] meant when he said that a hajj without  disavowal is not a hajj. This is what he meant.    Disavowal is a part of hajj. It is essential to it. And the  presence of Muslims in the hajj must be a meaningful presence.  Otherwise, if it were just a question of spirituality and the  chanting of God's name, people could do it in their own homes.  "And proclaim the Pilgrimage among men: they will come to thee  on foot and mounted on every kind of camel, lean on account of  journeys through deep and distant mountain highways." [Koranic  verse spoken in Arabic] This would not be necessary. If  gathering together was not significant, it would not be  necessary to proclaim the Pilgrimage among men. It would be  enough to say: Whenever you have the chance during the year, at  any time, go to Mecca.    It is precisely for this reason that they have said that  everyone must come together. It is because even chanting God's  name must be done with others; even circling around the Kaaba of  God must be done with others. [passage omitted]    Of course, what others do during the hajj is not our  business. We simply do what duty requires us to do; we will do  what we have to do, with God's help. What others do with  regard to oppressed nations is not our business. Of course,  when I say what they do is not our business, I mean that the  inaction of others will not stop us. Of course, we will try,  just as, thanks to God's help, our government and officials have  tried to encourage other nations to help the suffering Bosnians.  If they help, so much the better; otherwise, we will do it  ourselves. And, God be praised, so far, the various  organizations of the Islamic Republic and every individual have  really spared no effort. They have done well. They must do  even more.    At this moment, too, the Red Crescent must do whatever it  can  in the hope that it may be able to provide some assistance to  those beseiged and suffering people in terms of food and basic  needs. Every faithful and devoted combatant youth, whether from  the army, the Islamic Revolution Guards' Corps, or the Basij  must declare their readiness so that, the minute they say we are  allowed to go there, the minute the way has been cleared, they  can be off. [Crowd chants] [passage omitted]    The nation of Iran severed the thread of fear from the major  powers, and now it can stand firm and steadfast. This has now  become a lesson for other nations, as you can see that today the  youth of the world are chanting in the name of Islam. Everyone  thought that 15 years since the victory of the Islamic  revolution and five years since the demise of his holiness the  imam [Khomeyni], the enthusiasm of Muslim nations toward Iran  and the Islamic revolution would fade away. This enthusisam,  however, has clearly increased as each day has gone by. Each  day the problem that global arrogance faces has become more  serious. It was not us who did this. It was, in fact, God and  his will. The Iranian nation, aided by God and divine  successes, paved the way for this divine triumph. Our nation  accomplished this by its compassion, its sacrifices, its  efforts, its blood, its faith, and its unity.    You must preserve unity. The enemy is highly intent on  creating discord among a nation which constantly champions the  cause of unity. All of you -- various groups, sects, cities,  and individuals -- must remember this. The enemies would really  love to be able to say: Here you are then! So this is the same  Islamic republic which used to talk so much about unity, but is  now suffering from disunity from within! They would really love  to see such a situation. However, thanks to God's special  attention, they have so far not succeeded; and with God's  assistance and through the vigilance and alertness of you, dear  nation, they will never succeed in this.

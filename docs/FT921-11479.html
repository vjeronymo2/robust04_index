			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: African oil producers meet AFRICAN OIL producers hope to expand production and so increase their influence on world markets, Mr Jibril Aminu, Nigeria's oil minister, said yesterday, reports Reuter from Abidjan. 'We hope to increase the amount of hydrocarbons under control of APPA (African Petroleum Producers Association),' he said at a meeting of the 11-member association in the Ivory Coast capital. Association officials said it did not envisage creating its own oil output quota system but tried to tailor output along the general lines of Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries policy. 'We support the efforts of Opec in stabilising the market,' said Mr Mohamed Souidi, the executive secretary. Mr Aminu, the current Opec president, said that in a buyers market it was that much more difficult for African oil producers to spend on exploration to boost market share above the 10 per cent they now control.</p>

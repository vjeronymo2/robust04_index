The representative  informed us of the Phnom Penh side's stance regarding his  majesty the king's five-point initiative and the organization of  a technical group.    After learning of the telephone call's substance, on 23  January 1994 H.E. Khieu Samphan instructed the PDK  representative in Phnom Penh to inform Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh -- through the latter's representative -- of his views  as follows:    1. On behalf of the PDK, H.E. Khieu Samphan expresses his  pleasure with Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, who has -- on  behalf of FUNCINPEC -- fully accepted His Majesty King Norodom  Sihanouk's five-point initiative and agreed that all points  should be implemented simultaneously. There is also agreement  on organizing a technical group, which does not need to have a  name to hold discussions on the king's five-point initiative.  This move represents a significant step. It will make the  king's five-point initiative a success in accordance with his  majesty's lofty desires and the deepest and most sacred  aspirations of our entire people.    2. The PDK sincerely (?hopes) that H.E. Hun Sen and the  Cambodian People's Party [CPP] will (?join) FUNCINPEC and the  PDK in supporting his majesty the king's five-point initiative  and will accept the initiative as the groundwork for the  technical group's talks, which will be held among Cambodians to  achieve national reconciliation and unify all national forces  without discarding any of the national forces. This will allow  all national forces to unite around the king and the throne to  resolve the serious national problems and the (?war) we are  facing.    It is worth emphasizing that the PDK neither demands nor  rejects any person or party. The PDK wants to see all national  forces -- FUNCINPEC, the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party  [BLDP], the CPP, the PDK, and other national fores -- join hands  to achieve genuine national reconciliation, unity, and peace.  This is in line with the concrete situation, the king's sublime  desire, and the deepest aspirations of our nation and people.  The PDK firmly believes that our nation and people demand  nothing more than this. They want the opportunity to resolve  the economic problems and living conditions of their families  and take part in rehabilitating and rebuilding the country  [words indistinct].    3. It is also worth noting that the CPP and H.E. Hun Sen  have repeated only three points. Since 7 January 1994, H.E. Hun  Sen's CPP has demanded that the PDK accept and implement these  three points before discussing other issues. This constitutes  an encroachment upon the PDK [words indistinct] the spirit of  national reconciliation and national unification. (?It is  hoped) that H.E. Hun Sen and the CPP will review this issue,  accept the five-point political initiative, and send their  representatives to participate in the technical group in keeping  with the spirit jointly agreed upon by Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh and H.E. Khieu Samphan. This will enhance the  achievement of the king's five-point initiative.    4. Along with this, H.E. Khieu Samphan proposes that the  technical group proceed immediately, composed only of FUNCINPEC  and PDK representatives. When H.E. Hun Sen and the CPP clearly  state that they accept the five-point initiative, then CPP  representatives can be included.    It is worth mentioning that the BLDP has also declared its  support for the king's five-point initiative.</p>

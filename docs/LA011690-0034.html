			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VANDALS MARK HOLIDAY BY DEFACING SIGNS BEARING DR. KING'S NAME ON 94 FREEWAY  </P> <P> On the day honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., vandals spray-painted a  swastika and racial graffiti Monday on California 94 freeway signs carrying the  slain civil rights leader's name.  </P> <P> This is the second time the signs have been defaced since they were unveiled  two months ago.  </P> <P> Within two weeks after the 10-mile stretch of California 94 was christened in  King's honor Nov. 20, the letters KKK were painted across one of the signs on  the westbound side of the freeway near the Lemon Grove exit in La Mesa.  </P> <P> On Monday, two signs were painted with the letters SWP, which police believe  stand for Supreme White Power, and with swastikas.  </P> <P> San Diego police said one of the defaced signs was discovered at about 9 a.m.  on the east side of the freeway near Interstate 805.  </P> <P> "We are treating this as a hate crime," Sgt. Fred England said.  </P> <P> The second vandalized sign was on the west side of the highway, near the Spring  Street exit in La Mesa.  </P> <P> The Rev. George Walker Smith, pastor of the Christ United Presbyterian Church  and a black community leader, said he was not surprised by the defacing. "You  can expect this from a racist community," he said. A memorial to King has been  a sore point for San Diego's black community.  </P> <P> Last July, the Board of Port Commissioners, in a 4-3 vote, rejected the City  Council's request to name the convention center after King. The San Diego  Convention Center opened to the public four days after the unveiling of four  new signs on California 94.  </P> <P> The Rev. George Stevens, who led the convention center fight, denounced the  latest incident.  </P> <P> "It's unfortunate that this happened," he said. "But it's disgraceful that the  elected leadership in San Diego has not taken a position on this. The  leadership is perpetuating (racism) by not speaking out against it," he said.  </P> <P> "The good people who are white should be embarrassed by this. . . . They should  come out and condemn this," he said.  </P> <P> Bishop George McKinney, pastor of St. Stephen's Church of God on Imperial  Avenue, was chairman of the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway Committee, which was  formed to raise funds for the signs. He could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> The naming of the freeway after King is the last of several official attempts  to find a place to honor him.  </P> <P> In April, 1986, the City Council voted against naming California 94 for King  and voted instead to rename Market Street for him. But, in a referendum a year  later, voters rejected Martin Luther King Way and restored Market Street.  </P> <P> In the aftermath of that battle, members of the Chamber of Commerce worked with  black leaders to establish a scholarship fund and a statue of King in Balboa  Park, which hasn't been erected.  </P> <P> Last September, following the Port District's decision on the convention  center, the Legislature approved renaming California 94 at the urging of  Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) and state Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Chula  Vista). But the Legislature stipulated that private donations be used to pay  for the new signs.  </P></p>

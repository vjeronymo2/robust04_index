			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / EC to pressure UK on HDTV Britain will face pressure from its EC partners today to approve funding for a Brussels-backed strategy to market high definitition television to the European public, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. EC telecommunications ministers will reconsider a European Commission plan to pump Ecu850m (Dollars 1bn) into the promotion of HDTV over five years. France and the Netherlands strongly support the spending, mainly because Thomson and Philips, their national electronics giants, have invested millions in developing the D2-Mac and HD-Mac Technology. Britain's opposition to the HDTV strategy caused an uproar at an EC telecoms council last month. Last night, UK officials continued to express reservations: 'We don't think the idea is attractive, and we don't think it is coherent.' Under revised plans, the Commission wants to channel money to consortia for satellite broadcasting, as well as conversion and production of programmes using HDTV technology. Money may also go to other widescreen TV services such as Pal Plus.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The subject of Romania's stand toward  the latest developments in Bosnia was brought up at a news  conference held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today. Here  is a report from our correspondent Doina Saiciuc.    [Begin Saiciuc recording] The issue of the Bosnian conflict  was brought up at this news conference, in the wake of the  latest reactions of the North Atlantic Alliance. Journalists  asked Spokesman Mircea Geoana to present Romania's comments on  the latest developments. Before relaying his statement, I would  like to emphasize that another indication of the Romanian  diplomacy's initiative in the region is that an agreement has  been reached in principle for Bosnia's President Alija  Izetbegovic to pay an imminent visit to Bucharest, a visit that  the Romanian side is looking forward to with great interest.    As I said before, Mircea Geoana, spokesman of the Romanian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commented on the situation in  Bosnia, which reiterated Romania's position.    [Geoana] Everybody knows of the actions undertaken by NATO  in Gorazde, following a decision made by the UN secretary  general in this respect and in accordance with certain known UN  Security Council resolutions. You are familiar with the  position promoted by Romania, that the main goal and the only  way to solve the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina is through the  determination of all sides to engage in political dialogue and  reach a lasting and substantial negotiated solution to the  conflict in that region. It is obvious that the main thing now  is to bring all the sides back to the negotiating table and to  ensure their cooperation. We are firmly convinced that this is  the only possible solution. At the same time, we believe that  the existence of certain UN Security Council resolutions and the  prevalence of certain realities in the field should not be  neglected when analyses are made and decisions are taken by all  the sides involved in the conflict. I particularly refer to the  Gorazde town area and the latest developments of yesterday and  today.    Therefore, we continue firmly to advocate a political and  negotiated solution there and we are striving, to the best of  our rather modest possibilities, to contribute to such a  solution. We are keenly waiting to see and seriously examine  the impact of these actions and of the official positions of  various important capitals on the progress of the negotiations.  [end recording]</p>

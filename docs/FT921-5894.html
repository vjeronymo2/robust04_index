			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Welsh roads to get Pounds 200m boost ABOUT Pounds 200m is to be spent on roads in Wales next year, Sir Wyn Roberts, minister of state at the Welsh Office, has announced in a Commons written answer. He said 'more than Pounds 1.5bn has been spent on motorway and trunk-road improvements in Wales since 1979'. There are now 20 schemes in the short-term programme, with a start expected before April 1995. These include a by-pass for Bethesda on the A5 in north Wales, a relief road for Holyhead, also on the A5, and a bypass for Whitland on the A40 in west Wales. The plans are likely to be criticised by councils in south Wales because work on widening the A465 Heads of the Valleys road will not begin before 1998 at the earliest. This road is a vital link to the Midlands for many industrial communities in south Wales. Priority is being given to further improvements to the M4, completion of the A55 expressway in north Wales and bypasses on the A470 and A483, the main links between north and south Wales.</p>

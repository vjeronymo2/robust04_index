			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Hisao Tonedachi] </F>   [Text] Geneva, 7 Apr -- On 7 April, Minoru Endo, Japanese  ambassador at the Japan's permanent mission to international  organizations in Geneva, unofficially proposed that the World  Trade Organization (WTO), which will replace GATT next year,  take up the following topics on its agenda: 1) legal measures  which have a protectionist effect; 2) regionalism; and 3) the  relationship between national security and trade. Endo made the  proposal at a meeting of envoys from GATT member nations that  was held the same day. By clarifying the principles of free  trade regarding these areas, Japan hopes to lessen the negative  impact of U.S. investigations into antidumping cases, the  formation of trade blocs, and other factors.    According to a Japanese Government official, the government  is still in the process of making internal adjustments regarding  its final proposal. It plans to make an official announcement  at a ministerial meeting to be held next week in Morocco for the  signing of a global trade accord. The government plans to push  for the inclusion of this proposal in the presidential statement  that will close the meeting, so that the three topics may  possibly be taken up on the WTO's agenda along with such issues  as U.S. demands on unifying labor standards.    In connection with protectionist measures, the government  official stated on the same day , "The problem is that U.S.  antidumping laws and Article 337 of its Tariff Act have the  effect of restricting trade as soon as investigations are  begun." Because no discussions were held on this issue at the  Uruguay Round talks, Japan feels it should be taken up at the  WTO.    Moreover, concerning the U.S. Buy American Act, which  requires that purchases of products related to U.S. national  security be produced domestically, Japan feels it is necessary  to make adjustments to this law so that it will be in line with  multilateral trade rules.    Japan has brought up such issues in hoping to balance things  out so that U.S. demands on unifying labor standards will not  become too prominent.</p>

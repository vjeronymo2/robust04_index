			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / CBS offers comedian last laugh over NBC THE battle for the hearts and minds of insomniac American television viewers yesterday escalated to unprecedented heights when CBS, the network controlled by Mr Larry Tisch, tried to woo Mr David Letterman away from NBC with a reputed annual salary offer of nearly Dollars 16m (Pounds 10.5m). The 45-year-old Mr Letterman - an up-market comedian whose popular late-night NBC chat show comes on one hour after NBC's legendary Tonight Show - is known to have been unhappy at NBC ever since he lost the chance last spring to take the Tonight Show over. The brouhaha began when Mr Johnny Carson, who had been host of the Tonight Show for decades, retired. NBC appointed Mr Jay Leno, a square-jawed comedian who has been panned by many critics, in his place. It appeared yesterday that CBS had offered Mr Letterman the chance to design and own his late-night show at 11.30, placing him in direct competition with Mr Leno.</p>

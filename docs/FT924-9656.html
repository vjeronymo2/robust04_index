			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (4): Farther to go, more to pay - War in the former Yugoslavia has made exporting complicated THE ROAD from Greece to western Europe has grown longer and more hazardous since war broke out in the former Yugoslavia. In recent months, political roadblocks raised by the UN embargo on trade with Serbia have added to exporters' problems of rising costs and uncertain delivery dates. The difficulties are most acute for companies in northern Greece, which account for just over 50 per cent of total Greek exports valued at Dollars 6.8bn last year. The region's highest-earning exports are fresh fruit - citrus in winter and cherries, peaches and grapes in summer - together with yarn and textiles. Exporters in Thessaloniki note that for both categories, timely delivery, with no loss of quality on the road, is crucial to remaining competitive. During 12 years of European Community membership, Greek exports to the Community have risen from 38 per cent to 65 per cent of total exports. Yet Greece is at a considerable disadvantage, compared with the other Mediterranean EC members, because of the extra distance its goods must travel. It takes almost 24 hours by ferry to cross the Adriatic to southern Italy, the nearest EC market, and just as long to reach Germany, the biggest market for Greek exports. 'Now the choice is between an expensive route by ship to Italy or a time-consuming route through Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary,' says Mr Jordan Adamidis, director of the Exporters' Association of Northern Greece. A recent study by the association forecasts that exporters in Macedonia and Thrace will face losses of up to Dollars 500m this year, as a result of higher transport costs and lost trade with Serbia and Montenegro. Textile exporters have fared worst, with average transport costs soaring by 43 per cent. Some manufacturers are resorting to air freight to ship their goods, while others use the overland route through Bulgaria. Many food exporters have switched to the Italian route, with costs rising on average by 29 per cent, according to the study. However, fruit exporters complain that at peak periods there is not enough capacity for refrigerated trucks on the ferries serving western Greek ports. The pressure of increased truck traffic this year during the tourist season underlined the need for extra quay space and better customs facilities at ports like Patras, the main crossing point for Italy, and Igoumenitsa to the north. The government has announced plans for upgrading both ports with the help of the EC regional fund, but work will not start before 1993. According to Greek truck drivers and freight forwarders, the alternative route through eastern Europe is fraught with danger. Roads in Bulgaria and Romania are narrow and badly maintained, while unwary drivers who pull over for a nap may wake up to find their load has been stolen. Further along the route, transit fees through Hungary for TIR trucks have risen sharply, while Hungarian regulations restrict loads to 20 tonnes rather than the usual 25 tonnes. 'It's a nuisance, because it adds another 20 per cent to your costs, but there isn't an alternative route,' says Mr Michael Mistakidis, who exports rice to central Europe. The exporters' problems grew worse in July, with the UN embargo on trade with Serbia and Montenegro. Although overall trade with Greece declined as the Yugoslav federation started to disintegrate, the southern republics continued to import Greek fruit and vegetables, textiles and consumer goods after Slovenia and Croatia broke away last year. Greek exports to Yugoslavia in 1991, with Serbia much the largest customer, were valued at Dollars 160m, down from Dollars 180m the previous year. 'Food processors say they've lost 90 per cent of their trade with former Yugoslavia. The trade in fresh produce has been almost wiped out, because of the embargo,' Mr Adamidis says. Even before the embargo was imposed, a well-established trading relationship with the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, adjoining northern Greece, had been upset by the dispute over what the newly independent should call itself. Greek objections to having a country named Macedonia on the doorstep of its own province of the same name have affected bilateral trade almost as much as the new state's worsening economic problems. But the situation was exacerbated by complaints from Greece's EC partners over the summer that oil sold by Greek companies to ex-Yugoslav Macedonia was being passed on to Serbia. Greece is the main supplier of both crude oil and refined products to the neighbouring republic, in normal circumstances shipping about 120,000 tonnes monthly by road and rail to a refinery near Skopje. The Greek government banned local companies from selling oil to its neighbour, pending the introduction of a new system of import licensing designed to make sanction-breaking more difficult. However, another dispute erupted over what ex-Yugoslav Macedonia should be called on the new import documents. After weeks of acrimonious discussion in the EC, a compromise solution permits the new state to use the name Macedonia on its own documents. The decision will allow more goods to start moving into Skopje, but the noisy protests from the Greek government suggest that politics will continue to obstruct exports for some time to come.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Pakistan's PM for IMF talks MR Moeen Qureshi, Pakistan's interim prime minister, is to leave for Washington tomorrow where he is expected to meet officials of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to discuss his country's needs for external financing, government officials said in Islamabad yesterday. Mr Qureshi, a former vice president of the World Bank, was appointed last Sunday until the October elections. His appointment has raised speculation about his role in negotiating a Dollars 1bn loan from the IMF which Pakistan is seeking under the Extended Structural Adjustment Facility. Islamabad is pressed for time because the ESAF window would close in November, senior western economists say. An IMF mission is due here next week for further neogtiations. Pakistan is also due to present its case at the annual 'aid to Pakistan' consortium at Paris, in September, to seek Dollars 2.5bn in fresh loans. The consortium meeting was originally due to be held in April, but was postponed when Mr Nawaz Sharif's government was sacked. Officials say that Mr Qureshi's contacts with the international financial community should overcome any concerns about possible reverses in economic policy. Both Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader, and Mr Nawaz Sharif, , the main contenders in the elections, have made it clear that they would continue with free market policies. Acting President Wasim Sajjad swore in a six-member caretaker cabinet yesterday to run Pakistan until national elections set for October 6, Reuter adds from Islamabad. The ministers were named as Syed Baber Ali, Mohammad Shafique, Ahmed Farooq, Fateh Khan Bandial, Nisar Memon and Abdus Sattar, a retired senior diplomat who was expected to take charge of foreign affairs. All the ministers are reported to be retired bureaucrats or army officers, chosen as political neutrals who would not try to influence the election results. They will serve with Mr Qureshi.</p>

Several commenters contend that the statutory fee schedule is unfair to certain categories of licensees in the Mass Media services and complain that the schedule fails to impose a fee on other categories of regulatees. De La Hunt Broadcasting Corporation and the Broadcasting Associations believe that radio broadcaster licensees should be assessed regulatory fees on a market-size basis, in a manner similar to the fees mandated for television stations. The NAB urges that we adjust the schedule for radio broadcast licensees when we consider appropriate fees for future years. Further, the Broadcasting Associations contends that we should not include a television station as being in a major market unless that station serves the metropolitan area of that particular market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 79. We decline to consider any adjustments to the schedule for FY 1994 for radio and television stations. As we explained above, we believe that Congress did not intend that we adjust any aspect of the fee schedule it established for FY 1994. Interested parties may submit comments, however, addressed to modifying the method for assessment of radio and television broadcasting fees at the time we issue our proposed schedule of fees for FY 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Television Stations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 80. Section (9)(g) provides that the regulatory fee charged a television licensee will be determined by the size of its market. We recognized in our  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NPRM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that Arbitron no longer provides television rating information. However, no party has proposed that we rely on another mechanism for determining market size. Therefore, we will utilize Arbitron's ADI rankings for 1993&hyph;1994 for the determination of television markets for assessing our FY 1994 regulatory fees since it appears, at this time, that these are the most familiar and readily available tools for determining the relative ranking of television markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 81. KBS License L.P. (KBS) and the NAB argue that satellite television stations should not be subject to the same regulatory fee payment as fully powered television stations. The NAB contends that satellite television stations should be assessed as if they were television translator stations. KBS argues that our proposal to assess fees for satellite stations at the same level as full powered stations is inconsistent with section 9. First, in KBS's view, Congress established regulatory fees for commercial television stations, and did not set any fee requirement for satellite television stations. Second, according to KBS, Congress intended the Commission to charge licensees fees based on the regulatory burden they impose, yet satellite stations require much less regulatory oversight than full powered stations. Also, KBS contends that the fee would place an unfair and illogical burden on small market licensees who use satellite television stations to reach remote areas in their markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 82. Section 9(g)'s fee schedule establishes specific fees for commercial television stations. These fees are to be assessed against a licensee solely on the basis of the market in which the station operates. The text of the schedule makes no distinction between commercial stations that are fully operational and those that are satellite stations. It is also clear that these satellite stations are not ``translator stations,'' which are also listed in the schedule. TV translator stations are low-powered facilities that rebroadcast the signals of a full service television broadcast station, including a satellite station, and are afforded secondary status vis-a-vis full service television stations. Also, unlike satellite stations, they are not subject to the technical, operational and program service obligations that are imposed on all full service broadcast stations, including satellite stations. <FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>  Consequently, we find that in establishing fees for commercial stations, Congress assessed the same fee for both commercial fully operational and commercial satellite television stations. We therefore reject KBS's argument that Congress failed to establish a fee for television satellite stations. However, there are anomalies concerning the treatment of satellite stations that are a matter of concern to us and that we believe would be appropriate for consideration on a case-by-case basis. First, where a licensee would be required under the fee schedule to pay a higher fee for its satellite station than for the parent station, we will entertain petitions to reduce the satellite station's fee to the same amount as the fee due for the parent station. In such a case, the licensee would be required to submit with its request an amount no greater than the fee due from the parent station. Second, in any situation in which payment of the fee would cause a diminishment of a licensees ability to continue to serve the public, we will entertain requests for waiver or reduction of the fee upon an appropriate showing. In this instance, the licensee would not be obligated to pay the fee until resolution of its waiver request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Unlike other full service television broadcast stations, satellite stations have not been subject to the Commission's multiple ownership restrictions.

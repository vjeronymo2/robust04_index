			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Carbon adsorption was and still is an unproven technology for control of VOC emissions from can end sealing lines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CMI asserts that a theoretical system which did not prove practical, safe or efficacious should not be used as a basis for USEPA to deny a reasonable regulatory action by Ohio's environmental authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Water-Based End Seal Compound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The use of the Van Camp Study on water-based end seal compound to deny relaxation of the Ohio VOC limits wrongly assumes these test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions are acceptable to qualify end seal compound for other types of packs and containers. The process required to safely qualify a new end seal compound is linked to different packing and food conditions. As a general rule, more testing is required for materials which are used on a broad basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The successful use of a water-based end seal compound by Van Camp, a division of the Ralston Purina Company, is limited to a very specific, narrow category of food products_tuna and pet food. The Ohio can manufacturers who would be subject to this rule produce containers for a wide variety of products, including baby food, soups and vegetables.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For USEPA to assume that uniformity exists between the processes which Van Camp and Ohio can makers use to qualify end seal compounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is to short change the factors which are necessary to ensure food safety and shows a considerable lack of understanding of the delicate nature under which food is processed and packaged. CMI is concerned that USEPA is willing to risk the safety of the American food supply in order to obtain minimal gains toward attainment of the NAAQS in Ohio.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1984 and 1985, CMI and its Ohio-based members asked OEPA to relax the VOC end seal limits because they could not use lower solvent end seal compound with the complete certainty that food safety would be assured. If a catastrophic failure were to occur in a single canned product which resulted in the illness or death of a consumer, the integrity of all canned foods would be suspect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USEPA Response <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : USEPA's position on these issues has been previously stated in the response to Heekin's and Central States Can's comments. In summary, it is agreed that add-on control has not been demonstrated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasible for end seal compound application operations. However, it has not been documented that 4.4 lbs/gallon is the most stringent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit that is feasible for food can end seal compounds in general. Furthermore, the CMI has not documented the effect that food safety concerns have on using 3.7 lbs/gallon end seal compounds. For example, if CMI's position is that 3.7 lbs/gallon end seal compound cannot be used with canned vegetables (for example) due to safety reasons, it has not supported its position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. OEPA Submitted Comments on July 31, 1989  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Michael Lake report (paper) was not provided to OEPA during OEPA's public hearing on the eventual 1986 rulemaking. Therefore, OEPA could not consider such information. Since USEPA has added that report to the docket, USEPA must show that the report, which pertains to a specific plant in a specific food industry, is applicable to all food industries or at least the food industries in Ohio.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If complying end sealing compounds (at the ``3.7'' level) are or will be available, OEPA asks that USEPA provide some guidance on the proper date for compliance. The original RACT regulations, as envisioned by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA, were to require compliance by the end of 1982 with a time extension up through the end of 1985 for some can plants where adequately justified. The Michael Lake paper shows that ``it may be feasible and cost effective to control VOC emissions at the line with carbon adsorption or incineration'' according to USEPA. At what level of cost-effectiveness? Does that transfer to plants in Ohio?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USEPA Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is OEPA's responsibility to demonstrate that 4.4 lbs/gallon is the most stringent limit that is feasible for food can end seal compounds. OEPA provides no basis for its statement that ``U.S. EPA must show that the report, which pertains to a specific plant in a specific food industry, is applicable to all food industries or at least the food industries in Ohio.'' It would be appropriate for Ohio to provide adequate support for a relaxation that would make its limit the least stringent in the country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, additional time to achieve compliance with Ohio's end seal limit will only be considered by USEPA if it is proposed and submitted by OEPA. As stated previously, USEPA agrees that add-on control is not feasible for this operation. Therefore, the cost-effectiveness issue is moot.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

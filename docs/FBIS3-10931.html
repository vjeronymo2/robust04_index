The diplomat repeatedly said that reports on the alleged  office are "pure fantasy, speculation." He confirmed that the  summit mentioned by EL TIEMPO was the Fourth Latin American and  Caribbean Meeting of Solidarity, Sovereignty,  Self-Determination, and the Life of Our Peoples, which was  convened by the government and which was held in Havana between  2 and 28 January 1994.    He said 25 Colombian delegates attended the event, of which  previous editions were held in Quito (Ecuador), Santa Fe de  Bogota, and Sao Paulo (Brazil). Some of them were: Guillermo  Munoz from the AD/M-19 [19 April Movement Democratic Alliance];  Beatriz Zuloaga from Patriotic Union; Jaime Cedano and Miguel  Gonzalez from the Communist Party of Colombia; and Manuel  Rodriguez Garcia, labor union leaders from Telecom [Colombian  Telecommunications Enterprise].    According to the list released by Ambassador Martinez  Beaton,  others who attended the event were: Alberto Rivera, Alejandro  Motato, Ana Maria de Villate, Antonio Jose Villate, Antonio  Morro, Fidel Castro, Francisco Carbajal, Isabel de Guevara,  Jairo Guerrero, Jorge Ortega, Luis A. Garcia, Luis Eduardo  Vargas, Luz Ramirez, Nohora Espinal, Oscar Garcia, Rafael  Espinosa, Rafael Ivan Forero, Fierbo (sic) Tulio Casas, Teddy  Reyes, and Victor Manuel Bautista. The diplomat said all of them  are persons linked to labor unions as well as social and peasant  organizations that operate in Colombia.    "It is totally false that it was a meeting of guerrilla  representatives; this is an event that is not secret and that is  why our embassy processed the visas normally," he said. He said  Cuba is not currently involved with Colombian guerrilla groups  because "we have honest and sincere plans to achieve maximum  relations with Colombia, and it is not our policy to interfere  in the domestic affairs of other countries."    Ambassador Martinez said these persons arranged their trip  through travel agencies, but admitted not knowing if there is a  Colombian bishop among those mentioned on the list because "we  do not investigate each person." He said he does not believe  persons other than the ones mentioned on the list traveled to  Cuba without the Cuban Embassy's knowledge because his  government has very strict security and control measures to  determine who participated in the event. The diplomat insisted  that "no meeting by Colombian guerrilla representatives was held  in Havana; there was no church participation nor any attempt to  discuss the internal situation of Colombia in the framework of  the event or outside the event."    Finally he pointed out that his immediate reaction to the  report was due to the fact that "we have excellent relations  with the Colombian Government and what appears to us is that  there may be attempts to spoil this harmonious relation."</p>

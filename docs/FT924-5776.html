			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: Surviving under fire - The chlorine industry is taking a beating, but it's not giving up without a fight Chlorine, one of the chemical industry's main building blocks - it is used in plastics, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals - would be banned if many environmental campaigners had their way. Greenpeace has mounted a strong campaign against its use, as has a smaller UK organisation, the Women's Environmental Network, which has concentrated on chlorine. But now, after much dithering, the chlorine industry and manufacturers of products which use the chemical are fighting back. It is not that their survival is at stake. Chlorine is too important an ingredient in many modern products - packaging, paint, and insulating products also contain it - for this to be severely threatened. But pressure from public opinion against the use of chlorinated substances, especially where alternatives exist, is taking its toll. Bob Hunt, managing director of ICI Chlor Chemicals and chairman of Euro Chlor, the European industry federation, says the industry's growth prospects are small. Besides the recession, the environmental threat is one of the main factors constricting the business. 'We certainly won't see the growth we have enjoyed over the past years,' he said. John Elkington, an environmental consultant, also foresees tougher times ahead for the industry. 'I don't see chlorine being flushed out of the industrial system. But the campaigners have got a strong grip on some parts of the chemical industry and they will continue squeezing for some time.' Chlorine is a gas formed by passing electricity through salt. For every tonne of chlorine made - output in Europe is about 9m tonnes a year - more than a tonne of caustic soda is produced. Other big producers include Solvay, Bayer and Akzo. Throughout the world, chlorine and its derivatives are used to disinfect drinking water. But its main importance is in the production of other products, including industrial chemicals. Some retain chlorine at the end of the process. Chlorinated products like DDT, PCB and CFCs have been implicated in global environmental problems. And dioxins - considered to be one of the world's most dangerous group of poisons - are created when chlorinated substances, such as PVC and PCB, are burnt at low temperatures. Furthermore, the traditional method of making chlorine involves mercury. Small but sometimes dangerous quantities of the metal are emitted as waste into rivers and the sea. But - as the chemical industry is keen to point out  -chlorine is an integral part of daily life. Only small amounts of chlorine are sold on the open market. Most production goes straight to associated plants which make other products. About half of the European production is used to make plastics. Chief among these is PVC which is made by reacting ethylene - derived from oil - with chlorine. PVC is used, among other things, as packaging to insulate electrical equipment, and to make window frames. Other plastics using chlorine include polyurethanes, polycarbonates and epoxy resins. Chlorine is also an intermediate in the production of titanium dioxide (the white pigment in paint and toothpaste) and silicones. Chlorinated solvents, such as perchloroethylene and methlyl chloroform, are widely used as cleaning agents in industry. Only a small amount (not more than 6 per cent) of the world's total chlorine production is used to purify water. The chlorine industry and businesses using products made with it are under pressure from two related fronts: environmental campaigners want to force the industry's closure and politicians are trying to control the build-up of chlorinated waste. Campaigners have successfully highlighted possible health risks from the use and disposal of some chlorinated products. Among these are the creation of dioxins when PVC is burned in municipal incinerators and the production of potentially harmful by-products when chlorine reacts with other substances. The industry has answers for most accusations, but the campaigners' position is strengthened by chlorine's involvement in pollution incidents where there is no disagreement about the environmental damage caused. These include CFCs' role in the depletion of the ozone layer and the harmful effect of DDT and PCBs. The industry has also had a poor record of voluntarily withdrawing potentially harmful products. It is, for example, still making and selling CFCs while it develops alternatives. And it is likely that this will continue until it becomes illegal to make the product. Hunt says this attitude is changing. 'We have always withdrawn products which were demonstrably harmful to people and the environment. If there are other products like this, then the industry will phase them out as fast as possible. 'But we also need to be careful that the substitutes are safe. We are not doing this purely to protect our income. We do have a number of customers who simply don't know what to do when there are no ready alternatives.' This view is backed by Robert Smerko of the Chlorine Institute, the US trade body. But campaigners remain sceptical and point to the industry's continued manufacture of CFCs as evidence of its recalcitrance. 'Given that companies are still producing CFCs, we do not hold out much hope that they will withdraw other products in the future. The industry is playing Russian roulette with the environment,' says Madeleine Cobbing of Greenpeace. Yet while the mass of scientific evidence collected by Greenpeace and other campaigners is startling, its validity is not overwhelming because much of it is questioned by other scientists. For example, dioxins are probably the most studied group of poisons in the world, but it is impossible to get an unequivocal answer from the scientific community about the threat to humans. However, the campaigners have been winning the public relations battle and this is reflected in the market. Some large retail chains like Migros in Switzerland, Tengelmann in Germany, and Ikea of Sweden, have started to phase out their use of PVC. Some German and Danish local authorities no longer use PVC in public buildings and hospitals. The paper and pulp business is also moving away from chlorine bleaching. These pressures worry the chlorine industry. 'The threat is of sufficient concern that it is regularly debated at board level. But we are beginning to get together a balanced set of views to respond to some of the more extreme accusations made against us,' says Hunt. Stephen Harriman of Harriman Chemsult, a chemical consultancy, feels the industry has to defend a diminishing base. 'The industry is having to retreat in some areas, notably CFCs and pulp bleaching. It might offer the best product for the job but it is faced with a negative emotional response from the consumers. Over the next 15 to 20 years, chlorine will probably retreat into the areas where it has no parallel on quality, such as PVC, water treatment and chemical synthesis.'</p>

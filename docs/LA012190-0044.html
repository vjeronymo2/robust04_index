			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORRISON'S LEGACY  </P> <P> My respect for the veracity of The Times compels me to reveal an item from my  own hippie past -- namely having been a journalist who discussed Jim Morrison  on the record with his father, Rear Adm.  </P> <P> George W. Morrisson. The interview occurred in the Pentagon in May, 1968, and a  portion of it was published in the April, 1969, issue of Crawdaddy magazine in  my article "The Morrison Mirage."  </P> <P> This would appear to contradict Broeske's comment, in what was otherwise an  informative article, that Morrison's parents "have never spoken publicly about  their son."  </P> <P> MICHAEL HOROWITZ  </P> <P> Berkeley  </P></p>

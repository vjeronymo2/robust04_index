			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: New IBM chief to be paid Dollars 2m plus incentives MR LOUIS Gerstner, who was officially elected chairman of International Business Machines by the computer company's board of directors yesterday, will receive a salary of Dollars 2m for 1993, plus an annual incentive payment of Dollars 1.5m tied to IBM's business performance, the company said. Mr Gerstner, who takes up his post as IBM chairman and chief executive tomorrow, may also earn an additional bonus of Dollars 500,000, linked to IBM's performance over the next three years. The compensation package was fattened by a Dollars 5m one-off payment to offset the value of stock options and other benefits that Mr Gerstner has forfeited by leaving RJR Nabisco. At IBM, he will be given options to purchase up to 500,000 shares at the current average market rate. Mr Gerstner's pay is substantially higher than that of his predecessor, Mr John Akers, who earned Dollars 1.3m last year in salary and bonuses, down from Dollars 1.58m in 1991 and roughly half of what he received in 1990, according to the company proxy statement sent to shareholders earlier this month. Mr Akers' salary was also linked to the financial performance of IBM, which reported net losses of Dollars 4.97bn for 1992. When he joined RJR Nabisco in 1989, Mr Gerstner received a one-off payment of Dollars 14.5m. His basic salary of Dollars 975,000 a year was guaranteed to rise by at least 6 per cent a year. He also earned a guaranteed minimum bonus, which brought his total annual income to Dollars 2.3m in 1989, rising to Dollars 3m in 1992. Mr Gerstner's stock options covered the right to purchase about Dollars 5m worth of RJR shares, some for as little as 1 cent a share. IBM has launched a new version of its top-selling software program that signals the company's continuing shift toward supporting networked computer systems and away from centralised mainframe-based systems. The Customer Information Control System OS/2 version 2 enables transaction-processing applications to be run on networks of PCs, workstations, minicomputers and mainframes.</p>

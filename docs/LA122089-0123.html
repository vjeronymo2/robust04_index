			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NORTH COUNTY;  </P> <P> MORE NORTH COUNTY MEDFLY DOUSING DUE  </P> <P> State officials on Tuesday scheduled two more aerial pesticide sprayings in  January for the North County neighborhoods that surround a guava tree in Brea  where a Mediterranean fruit fly was trapped last month.  </P> <P> Parts of La Habra, Fullerton and Brea, covering about nine square miles in  Orange County, will be doused by helicopter with a mixture of malathion and  insect bait on the nights of Jan. 2 and Jan. 22, officials said.  </P> <P> It will be the third and fourth sprayings for most of the the Orange County  region since late November. The area could be hit as many as a dozen times  through the summer as part of the state's new multiple-spraying policy, aimed  at containing a problem that scientists say could be out of control.  </P> <P> The announcement of a schedule for sprayings through January held no surprises,  but it could help to reduce some complaints from residents who said they were  confused about the time and place for past treatments.  </P> <P> In a further effort to reduce confusion, state officials now plan to send out  mailers to 699,000 residents around the Southland who live in spray areas,  notifying them of the January schedule. That includes more than 30,000 homes  and businesses in Orange County.  </P> <P> The Southland spray region includes 277 square miles in nine separate areas,  most of which are residential. In Los Angeles County, the spraying will take  place in North Hollywood, Glendora and the Downey-Norwalk area.  </P> <P> The schedule for spraying beyond January will depend on the weather. State and  local agricultural officials said Tuesday that they expect to spray in the  infested areas every 21 days during cold weather, stepping up the frequency as  the temperatures rise and the Medfly life expectancy shortens. By spring,  helicopters may be spraying malathion once every seven to 10 days.  </P> <P> Agricultural officials, acknowledging they may have underestimated the severity  of the current problem, say the multiple sprayings are needed to avoid a repeat  of the 1981 epidemic. The Medfly, which lays its eggs in more than 250  different types of produce, cost the state agriculture industry millions of  dollars in lost goods that year. By some estimates, the infestation also cost  then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. his political standing because of his failure to  respond quickly.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, meanwhile, an umbrella group called the Coalition Against Urban  Spraying began organizing this week to try and persuade local politicians to  abandon the spraying policy. They assert that the malathion treatments pose  both safety and environmental threats.  </P> <P> Despite repeated expressions of concern from the public, state officials insist  the malathion pesticide mixture, in the low doses used in the aerial  applications, poses no health threat.

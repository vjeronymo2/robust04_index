			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Kirillov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 May -- Russia intends to develop trade  and economic relations with China with all the means at its  disposal, adhering to the "generally accepted rules of the game"  in political issues, Mikhail Belyy, director of the First Asia  Department at the Russian Federation Internal Affairs Ministry,  said to the ITAR-TASS correspondent in an exclusive interview.    Belyy mentions this year's visits to China by Kozyrev and  Chernomyrdin, and to Russia by Jiang Zemin that promise to boost  contacts.    "The Russian side is satisfied with the current level of  cooperation. Last year bilateral trade reached a record  level--7.68 billion U.S. dollars, while direct ties between  enterprises and firms prevail. A considerable volume--more than  2 billion dollars--falls to the share of cross-border trade."    Belyy stresses the need to assess the present state of the  economy and for the Russian Government to achieve a constructive  partnership with China, both bilaterally and internationally.    Replying to a question as to whether the Chinese side is  concerned about Russia's intention to take part in the  "Partnership for Peace" with NATO, M. Belyy said: "We are  explaining to the Chinese side that this program does not  represent any kind of threat to China. It would seem that China  has an understanding attitude to this issue and there will be no  serious problems."    Belyy continues that major international problems will be  discussed and stated that "we are interested in strengthening  multilateral cooperation with China in regional and world  affairs." He adds that documents are to be signed on the  Russian-Chinese frontier, cooperation in environmental  protection, on the regulation of material and water resources in  the Amur and Ussuri River basins, and on agriculture.    Replying to a question as to whether military agreements are  being examined, the Russian diplomat asserted that no military  deals will be signed. Normal business ties exist between the  military departments, he added. A short time ago a batch of  SU-27 aircraft was sold to China, there will possibly be  additional deliveries. China is interested in acquiring a  licence for the production of the SU-27, the conditions of this  deal are being discussed. Russia is not however, preparing to  sell China an aircraft carrier. In arms trading, Moscow, he  noted, is guided by the principle of not harming its own  security. We are also refrain from selling weapons that will  destabilize the situation in the region. He also rejected as  false the newspaper reports on possible "exercises" with the  Chinese Armed Forces or "joint maneuvers" on Russian territory.    Replying in conclusion to a question about the "Taiwan" or  "Tibet" aspect of Russian-Chinese relations, M. Belyy stressed  that with regard to Taiwan the development of ties is  progressing along purely unofficial lines. The Russian diplomat  expressed the opinion that "they have an understanding attitude  in China toward the recent stay in Russia of the Buddhist  spiritual leader the Dalai Lama as well. Therefore, one should  not dramatize this question."</p>

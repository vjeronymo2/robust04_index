			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- Specialists of the Russian  natural gas supplier Gasprom are cautiously optimistic about the  forthcoming negotiations with Ukraine on April 11 and 12 on the  repayment of Ukraine's debt for the delivery of Russian natural  gas. Their caution is due to the slow fulfillment of the terms  stated in the protocol Gasprom signed with its Ukrainian  counterparts on March 10.    In March, the Ukrainian negotiators pledged to solve the  main  problems relating to the debt within one month. The Ukrgasprom  representatives who visited Moscow in early April confirmed  their determination to comply with the terms of the document  signed in March.    Nonetheless, out of the promised amount of 100 million  dollars, Ukraine has remitted to the Gasprom account 96.5  million dollars, and has not identified terms for the Russian  participation in joint ownership of the underground storage  facilities on Ukrainian territory. These include two  underground reservoirs near the western border. Russia has  already handed over to the Ukrainian colleagues a draft  agreement between the two countries on this matter.    Since the debt owed to the Russian supplier by Ukrainian  consumers has reached 1.5 trillion roubles and its is doubtful  that they will be able to mobilize sufficient resources soon,  Gasprom experts believe that the problems should better be  resolved at the inter-state level.</p>

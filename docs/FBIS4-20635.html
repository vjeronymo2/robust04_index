			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Y. Muranaka, H. Yamashsita, and H. Miyadera of </F> Hitachi Research Laboratory, Hitachi Ltd., 7-1-1 Oomika-cho,  Hitachi-shi, Ibaraki-ken, 319-12, Japan]    [Text]  <H5>  Abstract </H5>   Recent trends in low temperature growth of diamond films  (LTGD) were reviewed.    LTGD can be classified into non substrate-heating processes  and substrate heating processes. In non substrate-heating  processes, room temperature growth of diamond has been  demonstrated by sputtering, rf plasma, and laser excitation  methods. However, film quality has still not been quantitatively  analyzed. In substrate-heating processes, polycrystalline  diamond growth has been confirmed at substrate temperature  between 80 and 135C by microwave plasma of both  CO-H[.sub]2[/] and CO-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/] systems,  electron cyclotron resonance plasma of  C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH-[H[.sub]2[/], Ar, He] systems,  and tantalum filament decomposition of the  CH[.sub]4[/]-H[.sub]2[/] system. Source gases providing  oxygen and excess atomic hydrogen in the gas phase were found to  be suitable for LTGD because these species suppress the  inclusion of amorphous components and the degradation of  crystallinity which are likely to occur at low substrate  temperature. The lowest substrate temperature for synthesis of  diamond films with the same crystallinity as natural diamond is  about 400C. Film quality deteriorated below 400C,  which may be due to the incorporations of H, O, and OH from the  gas phase into the diamond films.    Growth rates are between 0.01 and 0.1 m/h near  400C,  and 0.035 and 0.3 m/h at 130C. Growth rates can be  accelerated by Ar or He additions to source gas, whereas inert  gases have a possibility of deteriorating film quality.  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   Low temperature growth of diamond films (LTGD) is a critical  point if diamond applications are to be extended to  semiconductors, optical emitting materials, optical and  mechanical coating materials, and heat sinks. Diamond chemical  vapor deposition (CVD) has been conventionally realized at  substrate temperatures (Ts) between 800 and 1,000C. Diamond  growth at Ts lower than 800C has recently been realized by  a variety of processes and gas systems.[.sup]1-46[/]  Microwave plasma,[.sup]1-2,7,12,15,21-24,28,30,38-41,43[/]  ECR plasma,[.sup]3-4,11,18,20,26-27,42,44-45[/] direct  current (DC) plasma,[.sup]6,14,34[/] radio frequency (RF)  plasma,[.sup]13,16,19,36[/] hot  filament,[.sup]5,8,17,25,29,31-32,35,37-38[/] laser  decomposition,[.sup]9,46[/] and graphite  sputtering[.sup]10[/] methods have been applied to synthesis  of polycrystalline diamond films. In this paper, development  trends in LTGD are discussed from the viewpoints of both  processes and source gas systems with specific reference to the  roles of atomic hydrogen and oxygen for high quality diamond  synthesis. Conditions for a suitable environment for LTGD are  clarified. Additionally, limitations to high quality diamond  film synthesis are investigated by comparing both the full width  at half maximum (FWHM) of diamond Raman lines and growth rates  of previously reported samples.  <H5>  Difficulties in LTGD </H5>   Figure 1 [not reproduced] shows macro Raman spectra and SEM  images of samples (1)-(3) prepared on a silicon substrate using  the microwave plasma of the conventional CO[7%]-H[.sub]2[/]  system at Ts between 130 and 750C. FWHM of these samples  were obtained from high resolution macro Raman analyses. Details  of the experimental procedure are shown in reference 40.    Surface morphology with a columnar polycrystalline structure  was seen for sample (1). Crystallite size dropped on lowering  Ts; it dropped from 0.54-1.5 m [sample (1)] to 0.15-0.46  m  [sample (2)]. By contrast, sample (3) had a totally different  crystalline phase, consisting of amorphous-like particles with  diameters of 0.1-0.26 m. These white-looking particles did  not adhere to the silicon substrate; they were easily scratched  off, even by a thin paper.    A sharp diamond Raman line was seen for sample (1) (grown at  750C) with a broad peak near 1450 cm[.sup]-1[/]  originating from amorphous hydrogenated carbon in a  polyacetylene structure.[.sup]47[/] The diamond Raman line  decreased in intensity on lowering Ts, and it was hidden in the  polyacetylene peak at 130C [sample (3)]. This indicated  that diamond growth was suppressed at low Ts, while amorphous  component deposition was enhanced, which is in agreement with  findings from SEM observations.    FWHM broadened on reducing Ts (6.4 cm[.sup]-1[/] at  750C, 8.3 cm[.sup]-1[/] at 403C, 19.5  cm[.sup]-1[/] at 130C) suggesting that low temperature  growth caused a deterioration of crystallinity, specifically at  130C.    Difficulties with low temperature growth have been clarified  as enhancement of amorphous component production and degradation  of crystallinity. These points must be overcome to realize  synthesis of high quality diamond films at low Ts. In spite of  these difficulties, high quality films have been recently  obtained at Ts below 800C.  <H5>  Trends of LTGD </H5>   Figures 2 and 3 [figures not reproduced] show thermocouple  measurements of Ts against reported years in terms of processes  and gas systems employed for LTGD, respectively. Ts is defined  as the temperature required for the synthesis of  polycrystallites or polycrystalline films in a cubic diamond  structure, and the plotted Ts is the lowest temperature  attempted in each reference. According to Figures 2 and 3, LTGD  methods can be classified into [A] non substrate-heating  processes and [B] substrate-heating processes (RTG: Room  Temperature Growth).    The first RTG was demonstrated by graphite sputtering using  either an ion beam of Ar or hydrogen in 1985.[.sup]10[/]  Subsequently, RTG was confirmed using ArF excimer laser  decomposition of C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]2[/] diluted with  H[.sub]2[/],[.sup]9[/] and rf plasma of a  CH[.sub]4[/]-Ar system.[.sup]13[/] Rebello and Subramaniam  have reported RTG at high growth rates [5-10 m/h] using ArF  excimer laser reactions in a CO-H[.sub]2[/]  system;[.sup]46[/] they confirmed the growth of well-defined  diamond crystallites by SEM and Raman spectra.    LTGD by the substrate-heating processes has been attempted  since 1982 when high quality films were prepared by the filament  assisted decomposition of a CH[.sub]4[/]-H[.sub]2[/]  system at 610C.[.sup]5[/] LTGD at 430C was reported  by the microwave plasma (MP) of the same  CH[.sub]4[/]-H[.sub]2[/] system[.sup]24[/] in 1989.  Recently, high quality films were synthesized at 130C using  MP of a CO-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/] system[.sup]40[/]  and at 140C by dc plasma of the  CH[.sub]4[/](1%)-H[.sub]2[/] system.[.sup]6[/] The  tungsten filament decomposition of the  CH[.sub]4[/](1%)-H[.sub]2[/] system[.sup]17[/] has  also been verified as a primary method for LTGD (Ts =  130C). And 80-100C growth of diamond has been  presented by ECR plasma, suggesting the possibility of  RTG.[.sup]45[/]    According to Figure 3, the above LTGD, for [B]  substrate-heating processes, was achieved using a number of  oxygen-containing gas systems and the  CH[.sub]4[/](&lt;5%)-H[.sub]2[/] system. These particular  gas systems have a little oxygen or a large amount of atomic  hydrogen present in their gas phases; both of which contribute  to suppression of the decay of film quality occurring at low Ts  mentioned before.  <H5>  The Roles of Atomic Hydrogen and Oxygen in LTGD </H5>   Reported Ts is plotted against CH[.sub]4[/] concentration  ([CH[.sub]4[/]]) in Figure 4 [not reproduced] using data from  a number of  references.[.sup]2,4,5-8,10-11,14-17,20,23,34,37,38[/] Only  600C growth was reported when [CH[.sub]4[/]] was 10  percent. At low [CH[.sub]4[/]], diamond synthesis is possible  in a much more extensive Ts region; 300-980C  ([CH[.sub]4[/]] = 5 percent), and 135-1040C  ([CH[.sub]4[/]] = 1 percent). This implies that an atmosphere  with low CH[.sub]4[/] concentration is suitable for LTGD.    The necessity of low [CH[.sub]4[/]] for LTGD has also been  pointed out by Ihara et al.[.sup]17[/] They carried out  135C growth with tantalum filament CVD using  CH[.sub]4[/][0.4-5%]-H[.sub]2[/] systems. The diamond  grew at Ts between 300 and 700C when [CH[.sub]4[/]] was  3 percent, and well-defined polycrystallites could be  synthesized at Ts between 135 and 700C at [CH[.sub]4[/]]  ranging from 0.4 to 1 percent. One reason for this success of  LTGD was suggested to be due to high filament temperature  (2300C) providing excess atomic hydrogen in the gas phase.    Through two-photon excited LIF studies, atomic hydrogen  concentration [H] was found to decrease by a factor of 0.5 when  [CH[.sub]4[/]] increased from 0 to 5 percent in a  filament-assisted CVD system.[.sup]48[/] This was also  confirmed by others.[.sup]49[/]    On the other hand, to know the effect of [CH[.sub]4[/]] on  [H] in the plasma-assisted CVD system, we adopted plasma  emission actinometry[.sup]50-51[/] using Ar as an  actinometer. Figure 5 [not reproduced] shows IH/IAr against  [CH[.sub]4[/]] in a low output microwave plasma CVD  system,[.sup]39-41[/] where IH and IAr are optical emission  intensities of H_a_ (6563 Angstroms) and Ar (7504 Angstroms),  respectively. IH/IAr was suggested to be in proportion to  [H].[.sup]51[/] Figure 5 clearly shows a steep increase of  IH/IAr with lowering [CH[.sub]4[/]], implying that low  [CH[.sub]4[/]] provides an excess atomic hydrogen environment.    The above convincing results showing the increase of [H]  with  [CH[.sub]4[/]] reduction in both filament-assisted and  plasma-assisted CVD systems have led to the conclusion that  recent success with LTGD at low [CH[.sub]4[/]] in Figure 4  may relate to a large amount of atomic hydrogen in the gas phase.    According to Figure 3, oxygen-containing gas systems have  been frequently employed for LTGD. Focusing on the roles of  oxygen, Ts was plotted as a function of O/C in Figure 6 [not  reproduced] using data in previous  references[.sup]1-4,7,11,16,18-22,24-27,38-45[/] where  various plasmas of oxygen-containing gas systems were adopted.  It can be said that lower temperature growth is possible in such  gas systems with higher values of O/C. Specifically, LTGD at Ts  lower than 400C was confirmed in CO-H[.sub]2[/],  CO-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/],  CH[.sub]4[/]-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/],  CH[.sub]3[/]OH-H[.sub]2[/], and  C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH-H[.sub]2[/] systems. Among  these, LTGD at Ts between 100 and 130C (presently the  lowest level) was demonstrated in  CO-H[.sub]2[/],[.sup]40[/]  CO-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/],[.sup]40[/] and  CH[.sub]3[/]OH-H[.sub]2[/][.sup]45[/] systems.    Figure 7 [not reproduced] indicates IH/IAr as a function of  O/C atomic ratio in a low output microwave plasma CVD  system[.sup]39-41[/] for a number of conventionally employed  gas combinations. An increase of IH/IAr occurred on multiplying  the O/C atomic ratio, which was also observed by  others.[.sup]52[/] This may be because oxygen inhibits  surface recombinations of atomic hydrogen occurring on the cold  quartz wall.[.sup]51[/] These facts in Figures 6-7 indicate  that oxygen-containing gas systems providing an excess atomic  hydrogen atmosphere are also suitable for LTGD.    As mentioned in the previous section, LTG caused an  enhancement of amorphous component deposition, resulting in both  the suppression of diamond growth and degradation of  crystallinity. The key roles of atomic hydrogen in diamond  growth have been frequently discussed, including etching of  amorphous carbon and graphitic carbon,[.sup]15[/] suppression  of amorphous hydrogenated carbon formation in a polyacetylene  structure,[.sup]47[/] etc. All these functions may contribute  to prevention of non-crystalline phase deposition which is  likely to occur at low Ts, resulting in selective growth of  diamond.    Other than the currently observed increase of C[H], the  roles  of oxygen have also been suggested as follows: etching of  amorphous components,[.sup]40[/] inhibition of carbon   bonding at the surface,[.sup]53[/] improvement of  crystallinity,[.sup]40,43[/] suppression of impurity  incorporation.[.sup]54-55[/] These functions are considered  to be effective for the prevention of both amorphous component  production in diamond films and the deterioration of  crystallinity, resulting in synthesis of high quality films even  at low Ts.    From the above discussion on the roles of atomic hydrogen  and  oxygen, we can draw the conclusion that an atmosphere containing  excess atomic hydrogen and a small amount of oxygen is suitable  for LTGD.  <H5>  Limitation of Substrate Temperature for High Quality Diamond </H5> Films    FWHM values of diamond Raman lines for previously reported  samples[.sup]5,18,20,27-38,40-42[/] are plotted against Ts in  Figure 8 [not reproduced]. Since only a few data are presented  at low Ts (&lt;500C),[.sup]40[/], it is difficult to  determine a limit of Ts. For the time being, it can be said that  the limit of Ts for synthesis of diamond films with almost the  same crystallinity as natural diamond (FWHM = 3.0  cm[.sup]-1[/]) is near 400C.[.sup]40[/] We employed a  low output microwave (80W) plasma of the  CO[8%]-O[.sub]2[/](2.2%)-H[.sub]2[/] system. FWHM of  synthesized films at 411C was 4.0  cm[.sup]-1[/].[.sup]40[/] FWHM of the films synthesized  below 400C broadened to 10-20  cm[.sup]-1[/],[.sup]40[/] indicating that 400C is a  critical temperature to determine the quality of diamond films.  The reason for the degradation of crystallinity at  130C[.sup]40[/] (Figure 8) may relate to the gas systems  employed (we employed both  CO[8%]-O[.sub]2[/](2.2%)-H[.sub]2[/] and  CO(7%)-H[.sub]2[/] systems in reference 40). It has been  recently clarified by XPS studies that oxygen inclusion in  diamond films occurred at low Ts.[.sup]45[/] Atomic hydrogen,  atomic oxygen, and OH radicals produced in the gas phase of  oxygen-based gas systems (alcohol, acetone, alcohol and water)  are incorporated in diamond films.[.sup]56[/] Additionally,  cathodoluminescence (noted as CL) studies have indicated the  possibility of oxygen incorporation in diamond films synthesized  in the microwave plasma of the  CH[.sub]4[/](0.5%)-O[.sub]2[/](0.1%)-H[.sub]2[/]  system.[.sup]57[/] All these findings suggest that one reason  for crystallinity deterioration seen at low Ts (&lt;400C) in  Figure 8 may be oxygen incorporation in diamond films.  <H5>  Growth Rates </H5>   Growth rates (Vg) are plotted against Ts in Figure 9 [not  reproduced]. Vg necessarily depends on processes, gas systems,  carbon source gas concentration, etc. Roughly speaking, Vg  ranges from 0.01 to 0.2 m/h near 400C, and 0.035 to 0.3  m/h near 130C. The enhancement of diamond growth at low  Ts is an attractive topic. We have reported that Vg was  accelerated by a factor of 2-5 with the addition of 4 percent Ar  to a CO-H[.sub]2[/] system.[.sup]39[/] The metastable Ar  atoms were suggested to collide with gas phase species and  promote their excitation and decomposition, resulting in the  enhancement of diamond growth.[.sup]39[/] The increase of  growth rate by argon has also been recently reported by  comparison of Vg for  C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH(25%)-H[.sub]2[/],  C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH(25%)-Ar, and  C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH(25%)-He systems.[.sup]45[/]  However, we have found that a large amount of Ar addition causes  silicon incorporation or vacancy formation in diamond films due  to collisions of high energy Ar atoms with the quartz wall,  silicon substrate, and growth surface, consequently  deteriorating film quality. According to our recent studies,  cauliflower-like microcrystallites were seen by SEM, and the  intensity of the GR1 band (CL) increased for the film grown in a  CO(4%)-Ar(9.7%)-H[.sub]2[/] system.[.sup]58[/]    Remarkably, much higher growth rates have been obtained by  multiphoton excitation of CO (X[.sup]1[/] _s_[.sup]+[/]  a[.sup]3[/] ) diluted with H[.sub]2[/] by ArF (193  nm) laser.[.sup]46[/] Well-defined diamond crystallites with  diameters of 5-10 m were synthesized per hour at room  temperature, which means a significantly high growth rate of  5-10 m/h. This is an exceptional and promising result  deviating from conventional data shown in the hatched region of  Figure 9.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   Recent trends in LTGD were reviewed and the following  results  were obtained.    (1) LTGD could be classified into non substrate-heating  (room  temperature growth) and substrate-heating processes.    (2) In non substrate-heating processes, room temperature  growth was confirmed by graphite sputtering with a hydrogen ion  beam, radio frequency plasma of the CH[.sub]4[/]/Ar system,  and ArF excimer laser excitation of the CO-H[.sub]2[/] system.    (3) In non substrate-heating processes, diamond film quality  has not been quantitatively estimated yet, as by FWHM analyses  of diamond Raman lines. However, well-defined crystallites with  a sharp diamond Raman line were found to be synthesized at room  temperature by ArF excimer laser CVD using the CO-H[.sub]2[/]  system.    (4) In substrate-heating processes, polycrystalline diamond  film growth was confirmed at 130C by microwave plasma of  both CO-H[.sub]2[/] and CO-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/]  systems, 80-100C by ECR plasmas of  C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH-[H[.sub]2[/], He, Ar] systems,  and 135C by filament decomposition of the  CH[.sub]4[/]-H[.sub]2[/] system.    (5) Gas systems providing oxygen and excess atomic hydrogen  in the gas phase are suitable for LTGD in substrate-heating  processes.    (6) In substrate-heating processes, the lowest Ts for the  growth of films with almost the same crystallinity as natural  diamond is about 400C. The crystallinity deteriorates below  400C, which may be due to defect production caused by  incorporations of gaseous species such as H, O, and OH into  diamond films.    (7) Growth rates are between 0.01 and 0.2 m/h near  400C, and 0.035 and 0.3 m/h at 130C. Growth rates  can be accelerated by Ar or He additions to source gas, whereas  inert gases have the possibility of deteriorating film quality.    Finally, there are few data regarding physical, chemical,  and  semiconducting properties of low temperature growth films.  Analyses of these properties are necessary to extend  applications to practical use.  References    1. C. P. Chang, D. L. Flamm, D. E. Ibbotson, and J. A.  Mucha,  J. Appl.

A  number of villages in the district have either been burned down  or deserted. Scores of women and children were seen fleeing to  Yendi, while men armed themselves and took cover in the bush.  Students and staff of the EP [Evangelic Presbyterian] Training  College, as well as workers of the Centralized Government  Department in the town, have taken refuge at the police station,  where there are Army and police detachments.    The Bimbila District secretary, Mr. Ismael A.D. Adams, has  briefed the Northern Regional minister, Lieutenant Colonel  Abdulai Ibrahim, and members of the Regional Security Committee  who had gone to the area. Mr. Adams told them that reports  indicate the fighting followed a misunderstanding between a  Komkomba man and a Nanumba man over the sale of a guinea fowl at  Napayili market. According to him, the owner of the guinea fowl  was alleged to have refused the price offered him by the  Komkomba man and sold it to the Nanumba, and this infuriated the  Komkomba man who went to the Nanumba man's farm the next day and  shot two persons. Mr. Adams disclosed that one policeman was  killed and three others were seriously injured when they  attempted to evacuate their colleagues from Wulinsi police  station. He said the situation is purely a Nanumba-Komkomba  conflict and has nothing to do with the recent attack on Bimbila  police station.    Addressing students of the EP Training College and displaced  people at Bimbila police station, the regional minister said the  necessary steps would be taken to solve their problems. He gave  the assurance that transport would be made available to evacuate  them from the town as early as possible. The first deputy  speaker of parliament and MP for Bimbila, Dr. Mohamed Ibn  Chambas, said the government's attention would be drawn to the  situation to deal with it promptly.</p>

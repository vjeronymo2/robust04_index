			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitive Alumasc rises 32% ALUMASC, the UK's biggest producer of beer kegs, and a maker of precision components and building products, is raising its interim dividend on the back of a 32 per cent increase in pre-tax profits. For the six months ended December 31 1991 profits were Pounds 3.65m, compared with Pounds 2.77m, from turnover of Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 22.3m). Earnings per share rose 13 per cent to 15.8p (14p), and the interim distribution is lifted 11 per cent to 3.55p (3.2p). The rise in profits came principally because the group had widened its business through acquisition, it continued to draw interest from its net cash balances, and it had sought to fend off pressure on margins by stringent management controls. Although, subject to any further expansion, the group expected to remain cash positive for the second half, market conditions for its products were depressed 'with particular weakness in demand for products linked to consumer demand,' Mr John McCall, chairman, reported. Operating profit rose to Pounds 3.54m (Pounds 2.7m), while interest contributions climbed to Pounds 109,000 (Pounds 66,000).</p>

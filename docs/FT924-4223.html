			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Granada plans to cut 800 jobs GRANADA, the leisure, television and computer services group, plans to cut 800 more jobs in the next year including around 200 at Granada Television. The cuts come as the group yesterday announced a 129 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 130m for the year to the end of September. The job cuts at Granada Television are expected to be announced next week. Yesterday Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive, said Granada Television had been 'undermanaged' in the past. A further 600 jobs are to go at Granada Rental. The new job losses come on top of an 8 per cent, or 1,800, drop in the number of employees since last year. Granada reported higher than expected profits and its shares closed up 25p on the day at 334p. In the first full year under the management of Mr Robinson every Granada division improved its position. Rental increased operating profit by 9 per cent to Pounds 98m. Television had a 50 per cent increase to Pounds 33m although there was a one-off Pounds 6m saving in exchequer levy. Leisure, mainly motorway services, had a 16 per cent increase in operating profit to Pounds 27m. Computer services - Granada is now the largest independent computer maintenance company in Europe - moved from a Pounds 12m loss to a Pounds 9m profit. Mr Bruce Jones of stockbrokers Smith New Court said: 'What Gerry Robinson said he would do he has done.' Smith New Court is upgrading its forecast for next year from Pounds 140m to Pounds 162m. Mr Alex Bernstein, chairman, said the performance of British Sky Broadcasting, in which Granada has a significant stake, was 'the icing on the cake'. BSkyB would make an operating profit of Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m this year and would make its first pre-tax profit in the year beginning June 1993. Granada's fully diluted earnings per share was 19p, a rise of 92 per cent, and the net dividend rose 10 per cent to 7.7p. On September 18, Mr Robinson bought 299,172 Granada shares at 247p each shortly before the company's year-end and shortly before it went into its close period. Yesterday's close price represents Pounds 259,280 profit or a 35 per cent gain since the shares were bought. Lex, Page 22</p>

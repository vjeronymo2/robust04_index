			<p>BFN     [Text] The European Commission says it will propose  extending the system of generalized preferences to South Africa  lifting the last sanctions still affecting the country, namely,  a ban on arms trade, and on cooperation in the military domain.    A European Commission spokesman said in Brussels that the  commission would submit to the EU Council of Ministers a set of  proposals aimed at developing relations with the new South  African Government. The measures include provisions for  granting financial assistance and loans to small and  medium-sized companies, as well as to government agencies  wanting to invest in South Africa. The commission also suggests  that the European Investment Bank be allowed to extend its  activities to South Africa.</p>

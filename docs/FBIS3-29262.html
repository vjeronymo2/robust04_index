One  Defense Ministry source said Wednesday that the government had  decided earlier to hold Team Spirit if the North Korean nuclear  issue was not resolved. Since Pyongyang has said it will allow  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to conduct  inspections, however, the government can consider suspending the  exercise, he said.    Team Spirit could be suspended if it contributed to  resolution of the nuclear issue and stability on the Korean  peninsula, the official said, requesting anonymity. But there  is still a possibility that North Korea is employing delaying  tactics in its negotiations with the IAEA to force postponement  of Team Spirit beyond March, when the exercise was originally  scheduled, he said. The government, therefore, will make a  final decision on Team Spirit after watching developments in the  North Korean-IAEA negotiations, the official said.    In other words, the government will wait until the IAEA  concludes that it can maintain continuity in nuclear safeguards  in North Korea before making a final decision on the exercise,  he said. South Korea and the United States are expected to make  a joint announcement on Team Spirit at the end of this month or  in early March, the official added.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / International Company News: Further job cuts likely at Digital Digital Equipment, the loss-making US computer manufacturer, is likely to cut at least a further 20,000 jobs, about half of them in Europe, as it struggles to return to profit. It is also looking at a range of other cost-cutting moves, including joint ventures and the sale of some of its operating units. The company said no firm decisions had been made about the closure of European manufacturing centres. Digital manufactures the world's fastest microprocessor, Alpha, at South Queensferry in Scotland. Mr Robert Palmer, Digital chief executive, warned top managers this week that the future of the company was at stake if the measures were not successful. He said: 'We must achieve a competitive cost structure as rapidly as possible. And even if we are fortunate to achieve a reasonable growth in revenues, we cannot escape the fact that significant additional downsizing is unavoidable.' 'Failure to act promptly will result in a greater loss of employment. In fact, the entire enterprise could be at risk,' he said. Mr Palmer's anxieties came as no surprise to industry analysts, who have been concerned that Digital's restructuring measures have so far failed to improve performance. Once the world's second-largest computer manufacturer, it has lost some Dollars 3bn over the past few years. Its loss for the three months ended March - its third quarter - was Dollars 183m, some three times greater than the most pessimistic analysts had anticipated. The loss seemed to surprise the company's top management, raising fresh concerns about Mr Palmer's ability to manage a turnround at the company. Analysts point out that at least 25,000 jobs will have to go simply to bring Digital on a par, in terms of revenue generated per employee, with, say, IBM or Hewlett-Packard. Mr Palmer said: 'If you look at the implications of achieving a competitive position at our current revenue levels, the metric of revenue per employee suggests a company of 65,000, or fewer.' Digital currently employs about 85,000. In Europe, some 6,000 of its 29,000 staff are already due to be made redundant this year under a scheme set in place by new European president, Mr Vincenzo Damiani. Mr Palmer said the quality of Digital's products was not at issue. The problems were account management, manufacturing and delivery. He said the company's operations should be profitable by the end of calendar 1994.</p>

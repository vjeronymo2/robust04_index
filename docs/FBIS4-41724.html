			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature; compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Turkey occupies a special place among all countries  with which Uzbekistan has good relations. This was stated by  President Islam Karimov after his visit to Ankara.    He said that lately certain political forces have been  dissatisfied with such a state of affairs. He added that  everything promoting the country's growth and its international  influence provokes their negative reaction. Karimov said these  forces shadow relations with Turkey.    He said one of the main purposes of his visit to Turkey last  week was to prove that Uzbekistan and Turkey are interested in  each other. "I see Turkey as the closest, most reliable  partner," the president stressed.    During the visit Karimov held talks with his counterpart  Suleyman Demirel. The two sides signed a treaty on legal  assistance in criminal, trade and civil cases and a protocol  between the two foreign ministries on cooperation and mutual  consultations.    Karimov urged Turkish businessmen to expand cooperation with  partners in Uzbekistan and continue setting up joint ventures.  (There are over 100 such mixed companies in Uzbekistan at the  moment -- INTERFAX.)</p>

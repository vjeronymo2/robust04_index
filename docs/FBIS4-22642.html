			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by B. Bronshteyn, IZVESTIYA correspondent: "KamAZ: </F> A Year After the Fire"]    [Text] Naberezhnye Chelny--Exactly one year ago, on  14 April, the largest enterprise of the KamAZ joint-stock  company--an engine plant--burned nearly to the ground.    Since the tragedy, KamAZ has received the Golden Globe, an  award from the American Fund for Eastern Development, for its  high level of production, and the Diamond Star, a prize for  quality from Mexican industrialists. The auto giant was included  in the catalog "The Elite of Russian Business"--"Darin-94," and  its general director, Nikolay Bekh, is listed in Who's Who, a  world encyclopedia representing 5000 outstanding individuals in  the world. Not bad for someone whose lost everything in a fire,  is it?  <H5>  The Iron Phoenix </H5>   Naturally, things are not going all that brilliantly at  KamAZ, despite all the awards and honors. Moreover, according to  some indicators (for example, for solvency), things are simply  bad. The main thing that they have managed to prove in the past  difficult year, however, is KamAZ's capacity for self-renewal  and self-development, and in conditions of general economic  chaos, moreover, which is scarcely better than a fire.    IZVESTIYA has spoken to its readers about the progress of  the  restoration of the engine plant, but it would not be out of  place to repeat that this work, impressive for both scale and  tempo, was accomplished with minimal assistance from the state.  KamAZ had been promised 50 billion rubles (R) of gratuitous  assistance; R18 billion were allocated. Matters also went badly  with credits: KamAZ again received R18 billion per year at a 170  percent rate of interest. Even so, last autumn engine assembly  started up at the restored (and fantastically re-equipped)  plant. The restoration of this production took, apart from  enthusiasm, R150 billion and $150 million. Understandably, KamAZ  is up to its ears in debt. Suffice it to say that it owes  upwards of R70 billion to the builders responsible for the  restoration work, who are counting on the authority and  stability of KamAZ, which will not let them down and will pay  them when things ease up.    KamAZ's salvation throughout this very difficult period has  been that it never ceased operation. By assembling vehicles and  selling them, the joint-stock company took in about R50 billion  every month. For many, the idea of putting out trucks without  power units was surprising, but, strange though it seems, there  was a steady demand for them for several months. After all, many  buyers had engines in reserve, and others were able to obtain  them from service operations. Moreover, as has already been  reported, KamAZ had efficiently arranged for the assembly of  engines at others of its enterprises, if only on a small scale.    There were times when the assembly line would come to a halt  for short periods of time, but the hardest times already seem to  be behind them. Today at KamAZ they are assembling 150 vehicles  a day (they need to make 400 to do well), they have finally paid  salaries for January and February, and they are starting to talk  about paying the March salary. True, as before, many workers in  the forging and casting plants are on mandatory leave. However,  even here there has been an improvement in the situation: KamAZ  now has the funds to acquire pig iron and aluminum, and by May  the plants may be supplied with the resources to meet at least  half their needs.    Here it is appropriate to speak about another large debt of  KamAZ--to the supplier plants. Since the auto plant has nothing  to pay them with, they are not supplying parts. At KamAZ, there  are now hundreds of incomplete trucks stowed away (in March  there were 3500). Therefore the April program might seem  somewhat strange: assemble 2000 vehicles and sell 3000. That is,  the plan is to pull out an extra 1000 and finish them. And in  general, to pay off their partners and restore the supply  system, now the chief task, which is no easier to carry out than  rebuilding a burned out plant.  <H5>  The View Through the Windshield </H5>   So, now the ashes and the gigantic building site can only be  seen with the help of a rear-view mirror. But what kind of  prospects open up with the view through the windshield?    There is no bad without good, and the problem that arose  with  the engines forced the KamAZ directors to take absolutely  revolutionary decisions, in particular, the agreement with the  American firm Cummings. This partnership was conceived of back  in 1991, after the privatization of KamAZ. Energetic and  purposeful actions afterthe fire by the people at Naberezhnye  Chelny proved yet again to their foreign partners that they  could do business with KamAZ. As the American press noted, the  Cummings Company decided to stand back from the principle of  slow rapprochement, speed up the deal, and expand the scale of  the collaboration. As a result, it was decided to build an  engine plant jointly at Naberezhnye Chelny that will produce up  to 50,000 motors a year. Construction is slated for 1996, and in  the meantime American engines are being installed into  Naberezhnye Chelny trucks designated primarily for export. For  our consumer they are rather expensive.    We know that KamAZ today is not only trucks. More and more  on  our roads one comes across the Naberezhnye Chelny-produced,  limited-run Oka, which at one time was nearly called the Kama.  Last year, which was so unsuccessful for the Naberezhnye Chelny  people, KamAZ put out 6000 passenger cars, increasing their  production over 1992 by 40 percent. As the plant's director for  passenger vehicles, Oleg Belonenko, told the IZVESTIYA  correspondent, the assembly line is just about to move to the  new building, where capacities for 50,000 motor vehicles a year  are being created.    "We financed the construction of this building out of our  own  funds," he said. "In this sense the fire did not affect  expansion of production. You know, it's nice to hear that  someone is encouraging production when everyone around him is  undermining it."    Not everyone knows, probably, that a program to put out city  buses, the KamAZ-5262, is beginning to be implemented at  Naberezhnye Chelny. An experimental model has already been  tested in Kazan, and Mintimer Shaymiyev, the president of  Tatariya, has already ridden in it. The bus is roomy, designed  for 120 passengers (it is not hard to guess that when the  president is not on board, a good 240 will squeeze in). The  first industrial lot of 100 buses is expected to be put out this  year, and in general the program is calculated for 10,000  vehicles a year.    In short, as Nikolay Bekh, general director of the  Naberezhnye Chelny auto giant, says, KamAZ is eternal and will  live forever. True, some of Nikolay Ivanovich's subordinates  feel that he frequently manifests excessive optimism, but it is  better to have an optimist-director then a pessimist--you get  nothing but melancholy from those pessimists.    In conclusion, a couple of words on the fire. Evidently, the  accident taught the KamAZ people something. Reports on the  laying of the roof on the restored plant indicate that anti-fire  zones are being put in (previously there had not been a trace of  them). In addition, there is information to the effect that  KamAZ for the first time intends to insure its  multi-billion-ruble property according to Western  standards--something which, apart from everything else, its  foreign partners are insisting upon. This is probably right: you  cannot trust to chance or to lightning not striking in the same  place twice.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: GRE The retrenchment at Guardian Royal Exchange is finally paying off. A small pre-tax profit and a dividend unchanged from the reduced level set last year is meagre reward after the best part of a decade of underperformance. But GRE deserves credit for playing itself back into the game. Like others in the sector, it can thank favourable exchange rates for supporting its balance sheet. But the year-end solvency ratio of 51 per cent is also the result of hard graft, shedding business and conserving capital. Whether it can make the best of this restored position is another matter. Expanding in the UK makes sense while premiums are rising, but the strategy is by no means unique. The commitment of new capital to the market will doubtless lead to softer rates. GRE may arrive too late to pick up the best of the business. Having expanded at the wrong time in the late 1980s, it will have to demonstrate sharper underwriting skills this time around the cycle. By doing nothing, though, GRE would risk losing touch with its competitors. Since its exposure to mortgage indemnity insurance is limited, there is an opportunity to make up lost ground. Trading at a small premium to net asset value - once the embedded value of the life operation is included - the shares arguably look cheap. But GRE can only add value to these assets if it picks the right risks.</p>

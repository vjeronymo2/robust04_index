			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil rises 2 per cent Sao Paulo closed up 2.02 per cent in moderate trade boosted by a speculative late rally in oil and mining shares. The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended up 1,074 at 54,369 points. Volume was RDollars 366m (Dollars 414m). Brokers said major players bought heavily in the cash market in the afternoon to carry out speculative day-trade operations in the Bovespa futures index market. Prices were also bolstered by two new opinion polls showing Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former economy minister, has improved his chances of winning the presidential election outright in the first round of voting on October 3. Mexico Equities closed down for the sixth successive session on the back of widespread profit-taking with the market even falling below a key support level. The key IPC index closed off 9.12 points at 2,693.61 - a loss of 0.34 per cent. At the end of 1993, the IPC stood at 2,602.63. Volume totalled 801.9m new pesos, on 58.1m shares traded.

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Disease slashes cotton crops Two years of disease and pest damage have slashed cotton output in Pakistan and China by a third and thrown into question forecasts of world production over the next decade. According to the International Cotton Advisory Committee, an association of exporting and importing countries, there is danger that the leaf curl virus, now infecting Pakistan, will spread to North India and Central Asia during the next few years. Pakistani production has already fallen by 40 per cent over the past two seasons, generally the result off the virus and other pests for which no effective deterrent has been discovered. With the decline in cotton and its impact on the textile industry, Pakistan's GDP could fall by more than 2 per cent this year, the ICAC said in its March-April Cotton Review. Declining yields and rising output costs could reduce planted acreage in 1994-95. 'The use of resistant varieties and a third year of experience with the leaf curl virus could lead to marginally higher yields,' the ICAC said. Pests and disease are reducing the harvest in China. Production in 1993-94 is 600,000 tonnes less than consumption. According to the ICAC, the problem appears to be 'of a long term nature and will necessitate shifts in the location of cotton production and changes in agronomic practices in the affected areas'. Double cropping cotton with wheat, which provides a year-round habitat for bollworm and aphids, may have to stop. Prices are also being pushed up by prices for competing crops. World cotton production in 1993-94 will be 1.3m tonnes less than the previous year and nearly 2m tonnes less than consumption projections for 1994-95. 'It is possible that average prices in the 1990s will be higher than the 1980s, and that the 76 per pound average of the 1970s might be the norm of the current decade as well,' the report said.</p>

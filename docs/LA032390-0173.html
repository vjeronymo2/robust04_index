			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FIRST CALIFORNIA CONDOR CHICK HATCHES AT LOS ANGELES ZOO  </P> <P> A California condor chick hatched early today at the Los Angeles Zoo, nudging  the total population of the species up to 35 a day after another condor chick  hatched in San Diego, a zoo official said.  </P> <P> The latest chick arrived at 4:30 a.m. today and was the first to hatch at the  Los Angeles Zoo, spokeswoman Cindy Richardson said.  </P> <P> The chick, whose gender won't be known for about three months, is named Kareya,  from the Karok Indian word for "creator of all things."  </P> <P> "Kareya ate its first meal of minced mouse already, and is resting  comfortably," said zoo spokeswoman Deborah Pollack.  </P> <P> The 5.8-ounce "sparsely feathered, wrinkled and bald" bird emerged after a  57-day incubation and 72-hour hatching period, she said.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles hatching came 28 hours after a surprisingly strong chick  hatched without help from keepers at the San Diego Wild Animal Park.  </P> <P> There were only 27 California condors known to exist when all were taken into  captivity for a breeding program in 1987. Half a dozen more eggs are incubating  in the captive-breeding programs in Los Angeles and San Diego.  </P></p>

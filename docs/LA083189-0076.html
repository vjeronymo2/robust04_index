			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FOOTBALL '89;  </P> <P> TRI-VALLEY LEAGUE  </P> <P> Moorpark  </P> <P> COACH: Rob Dearborn, 2nd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 1-9; 6th in league, 0-5  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior quarterback-free safety Robert Hernandez (6-2, 170)  already has caught the attention of local college scouts. Now he needs to find  a receiver to catch his passes. Last season, Hernandez threw for 615 yards and  two touchdowns but had a completion rate of 37% (56 of 151). "Our biggest  weakness is our receivers," Dearborn said. "Hernandez throws really well, but  we have no one that can catch." Senior fullback-strong safety Jeff Cox (6-0,  200), a two-time varsity letterman, was second on the team with 10 receptions  for 109 yards. Senior tailback-cornerback Tony Upshaw (5-10, 180) has above  average speed and is the Musketeers' biggest running threat. Senior tackle  Pedro Lozano (5-11, 230) and senior guard Victor Magdaleno (6-1, 210) are  Moorpark's strongest and best blockers and should provide better protection for  Hernandez. Dearborn plans to use them on the strong side and run most of the  plays in their direction. Defensively, Moorpark has two good inside  linebackers. Senior Tom Uphoff (5-11, 190) led the team in tackles and was a  second-team all-league selection. Senior Rick Ray (5-11, 190) is also a  returning starter.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Eventually, Moorpark, which has not won a league championship since  1941, will compare its roster to those of neighbors Agoura and Thousand Oaks.  Until then, the Musketeers will continue to experience growing pains. "We  worked hard in the weight room this summer and played well in passing leagues,"  Dearborn said. "But the biggest thing I was banking on last season was the  offensive and defensive lines and they didn't do the job. Hopefully, one year  of experience will make a difference."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Oak Park  </P> <P> COACH: Ron Veres, 3rd year  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 10-2; 2nd in league, 4-1  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The super class of '89 (Jason Stein, Jess Garner, Gary  Silverman, etc.) has graduated, leaving Oak Park little behind from last year's  offense that was seventh best among Southern Section Valley-area schools. Worse  still, the Eagles have but 12 players on the team. Senior Kent Richter (5-9,  145), who sat out last season, will be the tailback and has as much speed as  his predecessor, Stein. Both were members of the school's 400-meter relay team  that was second in the Southern Section 1-A Division. Senior Carlos Pena (5-10,  185) earned all-league honors as a two-way lineman and will start at fullback  and middle linebacker. Junior Mike Stern (6-1, 185) will shift from receiver to  quarterback. "He saw limited action as our backup QB, but he's an athlete,"  Veres said. He'll have senior Erikk Cass (6-1, 175), senior Mike Devine (5-11,  165), junior Chris Ruhle (5-11, 165), and sophomore Jeff Gibbons (5-10, 165)  for targets. None has caught a pass on the varsity level. Strong  tackle-defensive end Aaron Majors (6-2, 195) and guard-defensive tackle Adam  Jones (5-10, 150) are the returning starters on the front line. Juniors Zach  Siciliano (6-2, 190) and Chris Kelly (6-1, 175) and sophomore Mike Banks (6-1,  185) are the other linemen.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: This will be the third consecutive season in which the Eagles have had  fewer than 25 players on their roster, but that hasn't separated them from  success. Since Veres has taken over, he has compiled a 17-6 record, and twice  guided Oak Park to the playoffs. Before his arrival, the Eagles had trouble  winning one game. Team speed will again be the key to their success. "The 12  kids we have are pretty good players," Veres said. "With a little bit of luck  and no injuries, we could do all right."  </P></p>

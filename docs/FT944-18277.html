			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): NAPM data leave Dow subdued Wall Street US stocks were mixed yesterday as investors reacted to further evidence of a resilient economy, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 3.70 up at 3,846.89 after crossing into positive territory in the final half-hour of the session. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 closed 0.95 off at 461.74 and the Nasdaq composite lost 3.41 at 760.88. NYSE turnover was 278.4m shares. A negative tone was established soon after the first session of the new quarter got under way, with the release of more data suggesting unmanageable economic acceleration. The National Association of Purchasing Management said its September index of activity in the manufacturing sector rose to 58.2 per cent from the previous month's 56.2 per cent. Even more worrying for the inflation-sensitive bond market was that the prices component of the survey climbed to a six-year high. As a consequence, the Treasury market backtracked after picking up some ground in the early going. Those gains were a response to the partial accord reached by US and Japanese trade negotiators at the weekend. However, the relief on trade could not offset the anxieties over monetary policy. For most of the morning, equities closely followed the declines in bonds, as the day's economic news reinforced suspicions that the Federal Reserve was about to lift interest rates for the sixth time this year. During the afternoon the Dow demonstrated a measure of independence and staged a minor comeback on the strength of two cyclical issues. Alcoa added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 85 7/8 , extending a steady climb which has paralleled with the recent rise in raw material prices. Goodyear Tire put on Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 34 1/2 following favourable comments by analysts last week. Advanced Micro Devices dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 even though it announced a 41 per cent improvement in third-quarter net income. Investors sold the stock because the company said its future earnings would suffer because of pricing pressures. On the Nasdaq, CareNetwork surged Dollars 13 1/8 to Dollars 24 after Humana agreed to acquire the Milwaukee-based health maintenance organisation in a deal valued at Dollars 123m. Information America jumped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 5 3/4 on news of an agreement to merge with privately held West Publishing. Canada Toronto ended slightly lower after another cautious day of light trading, as the market begins to absorb a heavy diet of economic news out of the US this month, including yesterday's strong US NAPM report which put the spotlight on inflation once again. The TSE 300 index was finally off 9.47 at 4,344.71 and falls led rises by 418 to 298 after volume of 43.5m shares. Mexico A fresh fall of 2.2 per cent on the bolsa yesterday was attributed almost entirely to investor revaluations of the political situation in Mexico following weekend revelations that a congressman allegedly ordered last week's killing of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, secretary-general of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party. There is also widespread belief that Mexican drug cartels are involved in the assassination. The IPC index closed 60.10 points down at 2,686.01.</p>

			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Asset-Backed Securities/ECU Bonds: Economic recovery may prompt rise in activity A FLURRY of asset-backed deals came to the international capital market last week. While this area of the market has been relatively quiet so far this year, asset-backed specialists expect activity to pick up gradually in the second half of 1993, especially as the economic recovery gets under way in the UK and mortgage business improves. Last week saw the launch of a Pounds 116m deal for European Bank Investment Trust, which holds 20 per cent risk-weighted assets with Credit Suisse Financial Products providing the cash-flow from swaps. Goldman Sachs, which arranged the deal, said investors had two lines of security - a guarantee from Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), and a pool of assets. These consist of senior, fixed-rate sterling obligations such as bonds, letters of credit or loans from European banks with a credit rating of AA-/AA3 or above. The coupon, backed by swap payments from CSFP, is three-month Libor plus 20 basis points. According to figures provided by Euromoney Database, there have been only 14 asset-backed deals so far this year, although in a couple of cases these represent different classes of issues for the same borrowing vehicle. In the UK, activity in the mortgage-backed sector has been subdued. 'The lack of activity reflects the lack of origination of new residential mortgages in the UK,' points out Mr Patrick O'Sullivan, general manager for Europe for FGIC. 'Currently there is no loan growth  - when the economy is well into the upturn we would expect activity to pick up,' he adds. Other asset-backed specialists point to European countries such as Sweden, Finland and Spain as the likely source of asset-backed deals in the next few months. S-E Banken of Sweden has done several asset-backed deals - known as the Osprey series - which were collateralised by residential mortgages, and other banks in Sweden and Finland are expected to follow suit. Using the asset-backed route has several attractions for many of these Nordic banks, given that Scandinavia has suffered a deep recession leading to an increase in state borrowing in the international capital markets as well as deteriorating credit ratings for both state and bank borrowers. Naturally the issue of asset-backed deals provides the usual capital savings for the banks concerned. But in the case of Swedish and Finnish banks it also has the advantage of providing access to a completely different investor base (in other words, the insurance companies and US banks which are big players in the sector) at a time when both the Kingdom of Sweden and Republic of Finland are proving to be frequent borrowers in the international bond market.</p>

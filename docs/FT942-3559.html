			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester faces legal action from former partner Cannon Assurance, an offshoot of Lincoln National, the US life assurance group, is taking legal action against the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society claiming it has not been paid fees for introducing mortgage customers. The dispute follows the termination of a joint-venture between the two companies in October 1992. For a period of about 18 months Cannon sold mortgage packages, produced by C&amp;G Guardian, a centralised mortgage lender taken over by C&amp;G in 1990. Cannon claims no fees have been paid since January 1993. A writ was issued last week.</p>

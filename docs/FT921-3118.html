			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Cadbury panel may invoke SE listing rules COMPANIES wishing to be listed on the London Stock Exchange should disclose the extent to which they comply with best practice in corporate governance, according to recommendations under consideration by a government-backed committee. The committee on financial aspects of corporate governance, chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury, recommends tying corporate-governance measures to listing requirements in the second draft of its report to be circulated later this week. The committee is due to meet at the end of the month to discuss the draft and prepare a final version for public comment in May. Although Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange, sits on the committee, some exchange members are concerned about using listing requirements to force greater disclosure by companies or changes in board structures. They believe that too many requirements could deter foreign companies from seeking a secondary UK listing, so undermining London's future as a financial centre. The Cadbury committee, which includes representatives of the Bank of England and various accountancy, industry and investor bodies, was set up to establish a code of practice for public companies. Publication of its final report, planned for December last year, is now expected in May. Investor groups have issued several papers on best practice for companies and shareholders and the Cadbury committee recommendation would be the first effort to put teeth to those suggestions. The report will include a long section on the responsibilities of directors, particularly their obligations for the veracity of numbers in the audit report. The recommendations, however, fall short of what some institutional shareholders had hoped for. Sir Adrian has warned that there may be disappointment over the scope of the report's final recommendations.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (8): Greener glow in politics - The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro marked the beginning of an attempt to set global standards / Environment RECESSIONS are not auspicious for the environment: greenery becomes a luxury when times are hard. Nonetheless, the environment has clearly moved up the political agenda this year in spite of the economic stresses facing the world. The main reason is obviously the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June at which more than 100 heads of state solemnly committed themselves to a wide range of environmental objectives. President Mitterrand of France, for example, spoke of the need for a 'new international order' which would combine disarmament, security, development and respect for the environment. Although it is still too early to gauge the full importance of Rio, the fact that it was held at all and attracted such an impressive attendance ensured it will have some impact. The question is: how much, and in what form? And how will environmental considerations be balanced against other factors, like the need to foster growth? From the world economic viewpoint, Rio offered three broad themes. One was the growing north-south divide, and the environmental degradation in the third world that can be directly attributed to poverty. This, however, is unlikely to have much immediate impact on policy-making. It was clear in Rio that the rich industrial nations are heavily preoccupied with their own problems, and are unwilling to make big financial commitments or trade concessions to narrow the gap. The second was growing acceptance of the need to get the world economy on to a sustainable path, and stop consuming resources at the expense of future generations. To be effective, countries would have to start accounting for resources which they regard as 'free', like air and water, or jacking up the price of non-renewable resources to levels that make people realise they are being depleted. The third was in the area of practical measures to deal with threats to the environment, in particular plant and animal life, and the climate. Two treaties were agreed. One is aimed at encouraging reductions in emissions of harmful gases believed to be causing global warming. But this had to be watered down, because it was feared tough measures like curbs on oil consumption or emission controls would smother economic growth. The other is intended to control commercial exploitation of plant and animal life. President Bush refused to sign this treaty, because he fears it will undermine patent rights to medicines and other substances using natural ingredients. The third world came away from Rio disappointed. They were looking for more financial or technological aid to help overcome their environmental problems, but they left virtually empty-handed and, in many cases, angered by demands that they stop chopping down their rain forests. The industrial nations, on the other hand, made clear they had mixed feelings about Rio. Their leaders were keen to stress concern for the environment, but within strict limits dictated by the need not to damage prospects for economic growth. Therefore, virtually no decisions were taken that will have an immediate impact on the world economy. Shortly after the event, Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, sent a Rio checklist to his counterparts at the head of EC and OECD countries, urging follow-through action. Among his proposals were deadlines to ratify Rio treaties and come up with implementation plans, support for follow-up machinery, and a timetable to set up the Commission on Sustainable Development, which is to be the UN body charged with ensuring that Rio decisions are respected. Rio has not changed anything overnight, but it has shown that environmental factors will have to be built more fully into economic decision-making. It drove home the message that resources are finite, and that many environmental issues, such as those affecting the atmosphere and water, have become matters of global rather than just national concern. For many countries, particularly the more developed, this was only a matter of reinforcing a message that had already been taken on board. But it is probably true to say that Rio marked the beginning of an attempt to set global environmental standards, and that these will evolve during the 1990s.</p>

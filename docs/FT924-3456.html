			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Technology: Redefining the boundaries - How digital mapping systems can help companies win new business With the decline of coal as a fuel for heating Britain's homes, Northern Electric, one of Britain's privatised regional electricity companies, has a once in a lifetime opportunity. 'We have to convert these homes to electric central heating,' says Ian Homer. 'If we don't, gas will.' Such commercial urgency has given a fillip to Homer's business area. At Northern Electric, he is the engineer responsible for geographical information systems. Otherwise known as digital mapping systems, these bring maps to life on a computer screen. His department is now considering how to overlay marketing information on those maps, which cover 14,500 square kilometres of north-east England from Northumberland to North Yorkshire. The result would be to convert a system designed for maintenance and emergency use into a marketing tool for winning new business. The marketing data, garnered from a survey of the local electricity users, has meant Northern Electric can identify homes which need central heating, a new washing machine or a dishwasher. But the marketing department cannot identify which areas have the electricity infrastructure to supply the extra power needed to run them. This information is stored on the GIS, appropriately named Iliad. The Iliad may have been a saga of gloom and doom but, says Homer, 'we hope to re-write the history book'. Such optimism about the power of digital mapping systems has fired Britain's utilities, with gas, water and electricity companies switched on to their uses. But compared with the US, take-up in industry and commerce has been patchy. Although the cost of hardware has dropped in recent years - the minimum requirement for a GIS department is a large screen and colour graphics, says Richard Green, director of sales and marketing at equipment supplier Smallworld - digital maps are expensive. 'A company our size has to put Pounds 1m into maps before we even start,' Homer points out. 'And that is for data we've already got in paper map form.' On top of that is the question of copyright. In addition to the purchase costs, Northern Electric has to pay royalty fees for using the data. That comes to a further Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 300,000 a year - the equivalent of 25p for each of its 1.4m customers, and up to three times what it costs for paper maps. This royalty figure is agreed between the utility and the Ordnance Survey, the prime source of mapping information in the UK, on the basis of the number of times the customer is likely to use the maps. Although the bulk of users - not unpredictably - believe that the up-front purchase cost of these maps is too high, they acknowledge that the OS has to answer to government in fixing these prices. The government requires that the OS recoup 70 per cent of the costs of maintaining and digitising the maps from sales. And by 1997 all the OS's costs will have to be met from commercial ventures. But on the question of paying for the copyright, there is much debate. Gurmukh Singh, chairman of the Association for Geographical Information, believes royalty payments should be removed completely. He likens the situation to books or records: users pay once for buying them but are not charged for every time they listen to the record or read the book. Others, such as Alistair Keddie, GIS mapping services manager for Imass, part of Northumbrian Water, believe it is the mechanism for charging which is 'extremely subjective' and therefore at fault because companies cannot predict costs. 'Many people can see clear benefits in digital mapping, but when they put up a feasibility study they have to show the capital costs and the operating costs,' he points out. 'In the present scenario we are very much in a haze as to what operating costs will be.' Dissatisfaction is compounded because for many existing users the OS map is just a background on which assets are placed. 'We use the map as a reference point for placing our assets and to get the spatial links,' says Keddie. 'In essence, we could then switch off the map. It's irrelevant.' The question of copyright becomes even more confused as this happens. If a utility annotates a map with its own data, who owns the resulting product? 'It's a question which will keep the lawyers alive for many years,' jokes Homer. Keddie believes that the existing approach will force companies to go to other sources for their data - aerial photos, say - which could in turn prove to be to the detriment of the archive material and eventually jeopardise the future of the OS. The OS acknowledges it has an image problem among its biggest customers and has frozen prices for digital maps. But copyright, says Peter Wesley, head of marketing, is a particularly vexing question. To do away with the rolling copyright charges, as Singh suggests, would result in what Wesley calls 'boom and bust' economics. 'The issue is money today as against money in the future,' he says. In addition, Wesley points out, a single digital map could be used by a large utility with 30,000 computer terminals or a small surveyor's office with a single PC, and to charge them the same would be unfair. As a result, he believes that the OS formula of a standard fee enhanced by the number of terminals on site is as equitable as possible. The OS is looking for other ways to increase its revenues, notably through growth in the market. To that end, the OS is planning to get together with other companies to market products based on its digital maps. One particular scheme under consideration is to build a PC-based product using a less detailed version of the OS digital maps. Such systems, from companies such as Logica Industry or Pinpoint Analysis, are already proving popular where highly detailed OS maps are not required - with retail outlets or banks which want to know where to site their latest megastore or cashpoint machine, for example. The sources of their geographical data are companies such as the street map producers or the Automobile Association. Axa Equity &amp; Law, for example, is using a PC-based mapping system to help bring together customers and financial advisers. By plotting the postcode of the customer on to a map already annotated with the whereabouts of the agents, the nearest agent can be found. 'I doubt whether we could have undertaken this exercise without the use of GIS,' says Graham Taylor, database marketing manager at the financial services company. Because Axa Equity &amp; Law only needs to match customers and agents across a relatively wide area - within a town, say - the level of detail provided by a PC system is adequate. Suppliers overcome the copyright problem by licensing their digital maps in the same way as traditional software. A single PC licence would be issued for a single user or a site or multi-site licence for more general use, says Berry Winter, associate director at Pinpoint. Only with these PC-based systems will there be an explosion in digital mapping, believes Bob Walters, GIS group manager at Logica Industry. 'The explosion will come when the casual guy can get access to market research information on a wide area network to his PC. And that is seriously starting to happen now.'</p>

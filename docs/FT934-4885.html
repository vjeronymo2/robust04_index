			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Anti-EU sentiment grows in Finland For the first time more Finns oppose membership of the European Union than support it, according to a Gallup poll published by the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper. Finland applied for membership in March, 1992. In Norway a Gallup poll this week put EU support at 21.8 per cent, with 51.6 per cent opposing. The latest Sifo poll in Sweden puts the No vote at 48 per cent, compared with 30 per cent in favour. According to the new poll in Finland, 41 per cent of Finns would vote No to EU membership if a referendum were held now. This compares with 36 per cent in favour and 23 per cent who are undecided. There is no doubt that the latest vote has been influenced by widespread disappointment over the EU's response to Finland's demands on agriculture, the key issue in the country's membership discussions.</p>

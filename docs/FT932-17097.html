			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Statement over Bank aid rejected THE GOVERNMENT yesterday turned down Labour demands for a Commons statement on last month's disclosure that a number of banks had received financial support from the Bank of England in the second half of 1991, and that some were still in receipt of Bank funds. Mr Anthony Nelson, a junior Treasury minister, replied to a string of written questions on the subject from Labour's Mr Alistair Darling by saying it was for the Bank to determine its policy on answering questions concerning such matters.</p>

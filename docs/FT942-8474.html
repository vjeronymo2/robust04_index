			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Ministers to debate on disabled Ministers remain determined to block proposals outlawing discrimination against the disabled amid signs that they could be debated in the Commons today, James Blitz writes. Mr John Major, the prime minister, told MPs yesterday that the private member's bill that became the subject of a row recently over government wrecking tactics was 'unworkable in a number of areas'. Mr Major told MPs that the government would instead proceed with its own plans on rights for the disabled, offering proposals 'that genuinely will work and will help disabled people'. At question time in the Commons, Mr Major said that the bill, backed by a Labour MP, 'would impose immense costs and it would open up enormous scope for litigation'. Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security minister, may face renewed difficulties over the bill today as Labour MPs attempt to bring it back to the Commons. Mr Scott has admitted that he inadvertently misled the House when he claimed that his department had not helped backbenchers draw up wrecking amendments. Friends of Mr Scott said yesterday that the minister would not bow to pressure to resign. He insists that, although officials in his department helped parliamentary counsel to draw up amendments, they did not directly advise backbench Tory MPs.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELLTALE WHITE MALE PAW PRINTS;  </P> <P> RESEARCH: MEDICAL STUDIES THAT ARE VALID FOR ONLY HALF OF THE POPULATION ARE NO  BARGAIN.  </P> <P> This is a story that begins with white male rats. No, it is not a political  fantasy created by those who regard "white male rats" as redundant. The subject  here is science and sex.  </P> <P> It turns out that most of the basic research that teaches us what is good and  bad for human beings begins with rodents of the male persuasion. Their female  counterparts are usually excluded because of what might be called "raging  hormonal imbalance." Their female physiology is more complex. In research,  female humans are also excluded from most studies.  </P> <P> I didn't come across this information through personal experience. I have never  seen a rodent with PMS. The tale of the white male rat was told at hearings of  the House subcommittee on health and the environment. It turns out that the  exclusion of women as subjects for research is only one piece of a profoundly  skewed research program. Not only are men studied more, so are their health  problems.  </P> <P> About 13% of the National Institute of Health's $5.7-billion budget goes to  study the health risks of the half of the population that is female. While  every woman in America will go through menopause, hormone treatment has little  priority in terms of federal dollars. While every woman ages, the latest study,  "Normal Human Aging," has no data about women at all.  </P> <P> "I've had a theory that you fund what you fear," says Rep. Patricia Schroeder,  who along with Reps. Olympia Snowe of Maine and Henry Waxman of California has  kept a spotlight on this issue. "When you have a male-dominated group of  researchers, they are more worried about prostate cancer than breast cancer."  </P> <P> But the rise of women in medical and policy-making positions in the rest of the  world has put such issues in the public eye.  </P> <P> In fairness, medical science is not all that different from any other business  in America that is just beginning to adjust to women. There is the dual notion  that you can either treat women just like men or exclude them altogether.  </P> <P> In line with the rat theory, many researchers lament that including women, with  all their peculiar plumbing, is too complicated and too expensive. But in the  long run, research that is valid for only half of the human species is no  bargain. So the next time you pop a pill or follow the doctor's orders, check  carefully for the telltale paw prints of white male rats.  </P></p>

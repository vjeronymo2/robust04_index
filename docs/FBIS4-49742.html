			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, may 10 (XINHUA) -- New design 10-cent  coins will be put into circulation in Hong Kong starting from  next Monday [16 May] to replace the existing coins, local  government information services announced here today. "This is  part of the phased program to replace and withdraw from  circulation existing coins bearing references which will become  inappropriate to the status of Hong Kong as a special  administrative region of the People's Republic of China," a  government spokesman said today. The design of the new 10-cent  coin features a bauhinia flower and "Hong Kong" in Chinese  characters and English on the obverse. The reverse features  the denomination in Chinese characters and English with a large  Arabic numeral in the center and the year of issue immediately  below it.</p>

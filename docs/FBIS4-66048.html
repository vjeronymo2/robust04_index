			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mariano Guindal: "Solbes Says Foreign Investment </F> Grew by 10 Percent in First Quarter"]    [Text] Madrid -- Economy Minister Pedro Solbes stated  yesterday that direct foreign investment in Spain grew by over  10 percent in the first quarter of the year, as compared with  the same period during the previous year. "This means that  people still have confidence in Spain," and that the myth of  disinvestment caused by the departure of some multinational  enterprises "is neither correct nor corresponds to reality," the  minister said.    In statements made to Spanish National Radio, Solbes harshly  criticized the People's Party and United Left for denying the  figures showing a clear start of economic recovery, "simply  because of not acknowledging that the policy that the government  is implementing is the correct one." According to Solbes,  growth and job creation will be gradually consolidated until  1,000 jobs per day are being created, which is the government's  aim.    The Economics Ministry is finalizing the Plan for European  Integration, which will be presented in Brussels in July. The  plan contains budget projections for the next three years.  According to these forecasts, the economy will grow by 1.3  percent this year, 2.6 percent in 1995, and 3.5 percent in 1996.  That is, the aim is to triple growth in three years, and this  will make it possible to move from a zero increase in jobs to  around 400,000 at the end of the period.    At the same time, the program envisions a drastic reduction  in the public deficit, which will fall from the 6.4 percent  forecast for the public administrations as a whole in 1994 to  3.2 percent of GDP for the 1996-97 fiscal year. The intent is  to achieve this reduction without increasing the individual tax  burden. Hence, government activity will center on cutting  public spending: Civil Service staffing will be frozen,  transfers to state-run businesses will be reduced, transfers to  the autonomous communities will be stabilized, and spending on  health and unemployment will be rationalized.    As far as revenue is concerned, an additional increase in  revenue is envisioned as a result of the struggle against fraud  and the increase in consumption, profits, and employment.    The plan also foresees a considerable decline in inflation  from 3.5 percent in 1994 to 2.5 percent at the end of 1997. The  minister acknowledges that this is a very difficult aim, since  "lowering prices from 5 percent is almost quite ambitious."  However, he believes that it will be reduced significantly in  the second half of the year, when food prices fall.    Solbes believes that the structural reforms of the labor  market that have been begun must be completed in order to defeat  inflation. In fact, the second part of the integration plan  centers mainly on these reforms in order to "be on the same  level as the soundest economies in Europe and be able to join in  the third stage of [monetary and economic] union."    In the minister's opinion, it would be a very grave mistake  for us to join in this third stage "solely for political  reasons, and it is essential that we achieve the economic  conditions enabling us to take that step." He told a select  group of diplomats at the Ortega y Gasset Foundation that  "European unity is not being built in the way that the  government would have liked."  <H5>  Enlargement of EU </H5>   Solbes has publicly acknowledged that the aforementioned  change is due to the disappearance of the East bloc countries,  which has caused a fundamental change in the role played by  Germany.    The minister publicly acknowledged that with the Community's  enlargement, Spain's political influence in Europe has  diminished, and the center of gravity has shifted from south to  north. "The complexities that have developed are leading us  toward a confederal Europe, although we would have preferred the  federal formula." He explained that the government would have  liked the creation of a common political area, yet it is  increasingly clear that we are heading for a "Thatcher-style"  economic option.    Pedro Solbes also acknowledged that "liberalism has  triumphed  over the more interventionist social democratic visions of  Europe." The minister asked whether a process of integrating  markets can be gotten under way without compensatory  arrangements. In any event, he emphasized that Spain must be  involved in the first stage, "and we are going to do everything  possible to achieve this."</p>

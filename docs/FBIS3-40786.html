			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Madras, Dec. 21--The alleged "acts of omission and  commission" on the part of the former Governor of the Reserve  Bank of India [RBI], Mr. S. Venkitaramanan, considered by the  Joint Parliamentary Committee [JPC] on the securities scam,  included "reactivation," in April 1992, of the current account  of Harshad Mehta in the State Bank of India (Main Branch) in  Bombay.    This allegation, according to the deposition of Mr.  Venkitaramanan and his clarifications to the committee, was  misconceived because there was in the first instance no freezing  or deactivation of the account by the RBI but only an order to  monitor the flow of funds. (The RBI has no power to freeze a  current account except under legal procedures like  implementation of a "garnishee order" from a court or on issuing  a show-cause notice to the account holder.)    What had happened in the case of the Harshad Mehta account,  according to the defence put up by the former RBI Governor, was  that on March 16, 1992, extracts from the current account of  Harshad Mehta with the SBI were brought to the attention of Ms.  Viswanathan, Executive Director of the RBI, by Mr. M.N.Goiporia,  Chairman of the SBI. This itself was the result of a query made  by the RBI Governor at a meeting held in the RBI on March 10,  1992, as to the source of funds of Harshad Mehta.    The information from the SBI Chairman on the Mehta account  was shown by Ms. Viswanathan to Mr. Venkitaramanan on the same  day (March 16, 1992), whereupon the latter reiterated over the  telephone his instructions to Mr. Goiporia to monitor the  account. Ms. Viswanathan, on her part, instructed RBI officials  to scrutinise voucher entries on the Mehta account on a top  priority basis.    Harshad Mehta did not operate the account between March 16  and April 1, 1992, but again operated it from April 2 to 8,  1992. Whatever the reasons which impelled Harshad Mehta to  operate or not operate his current account, the fact was that  there were no orders from the RBI to the SBI for freezing or  defreezing the account or to withdraw the monitoring of the  same, Mr. Venkitaramanan is understood to have told the JPC.    Foreign banks: Another issue that has exercised  members of the JPC is the alleged instruction, given by Mr.  Venkitaramanan in his note of March 20, 1991, to the Deputy  Governor, Mr. Amitabh Ghosh, for "different treatment" for  foreign banks suspected to be involved in irregular transactions  in PSU [oublic sector undertakings] bonds and Government  securities.    Mr. Venkitaramanan clarified to the JPC that all that his  role of March 20, 1991 (which, incidentally, was issued within  three months of taking over his job) said in respect of foreign  banks was that "while foreign banks are involved, we have to  take care." The note had also mentioned that several banks who  were suspected to be carrying on "fictitious" transactions in  violation of norms and instructed the Deputy Governor to ensure  that such transactions did not take place. (The full magnitude  and modus operandi of the transactions came to light only in  subsequent investigations, especially by the Janakiraman  committee.)    Mr. Venkitaramanan told the JPC that orders to "take care"  (while dealing with foreign banks) did not mean either closing  one's eyes to the wrongdoings of foreign banks or going soft on  them. The instruction, calling essentially for proper alertness  and caution in dealing with them, was issued in the context of  the massive foreign exchange crisis that had overtaken the  country at that time and the frantic efforts then being made by  the Government and the RBI to shore up the reserves. The  situation was such that the RBI, while following up the  securities issue, would at the same time be soliciting foreign  currency deposits from foreign banks under a scheme launched  under instructions from the Government in 1990.    Subsequent investigations conducted by the RBI on securities  trading in fact, covered foreign banks and revealed several  irregular practices on their part.    A third issue on which the then RBI Governor was questioned  by the JPC was his role in the appointment of Mr. M.J. Pherwani  as Chairman of the National Housing Bank (which, as revealed  later, was a leading player in the scam) and of Mr. K.  Margabandhu as Chairman and Managing Director [MD] of the UCO  [Unitrd Commercial] Bank. Mr. Venkitaramanan pointed out to the  committee that the Appointments Board, headed by him and  including representatives of the Finance Ministry, at its  meeting on February 9, 1991, recommended the name of Mr.  Margabandhu in view of his record of handling industrial  relations problems successfully in the State Bank of Saurashtra  as its then MD.    The RBI Governor told the Board that mainly because of the  better selection and training procedures at the SBI compared to  other banks, the quality and standard of its officers was of a  high order. Considering the weak financial position and working  environment at UCO Bank and the fact that no other officer of  the rank of Deputy MD of the SBI was then willing to assume  responsibility of chairmanship of the UCO Bank, the Board  finally recommended his name. Mr. Margabandhu, it noted, had  also worked in Calcutta in the SBI.    As for Mr. Pherwani, the RBI had recommended his name for  the  [National Housing Bank] NHB chairmanship in view of his  experience, expertise and innovative approach (Mr. Pherwani, who  was earlier Chairman of the Unit Trust of India, was at that  time heading the infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services  Ltd. besides being a Director of the Maharashtra State Financial  Corporation). The Appointments Board, while considering the RBI  recommendation, decided to leave the matter to the Government to  finalise but expressed the view that if Mr. Pherwani was  selected, he could be allowed to continue as IFL Chairman.    Mr. Venkitaramanan sought to impress on the JPC that the RBI  could only recommend names based on facts available to it and if  there was anything that went against the individuals concerned,  it was to be taken care of by vigilance inquiries before issuing  orders.    In respect of charges of delay or laxity in following up his  initial note and in issue of circulars to all banks (which was  done by the RBI in July, 1991), the JPC is understood to have  been told by Mr. Venkitaramanan that the intervening period was  taken up by investigations by the bank. What was more, he said,  it was he (Mr. Venkitaramanan), who insisted on issuing the  circular in July 1991, ruling out suggestions from the Deputy  Governor concerned for appointing an auditing firm to examine  the issue further. The Governor had taken the view that since  evidence of irregularities in securities trading had existed  within the RBI as early as 1986-87 following a report submitted  at that time by an official, the matter brooked no further delay.</p>

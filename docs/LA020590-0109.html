			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH CAUTIONS AGAINST GLOBAL WARMING STEPS THAT BURDEN INDUSTRY  </P> <P> President Bush cautioned an international gathering of scientists today against  seeking solutions to global warming that would burden major industries.  </P> <P> Bush promised U.S. support for "aggressive and thoughtful action" to solve the  problems posed by global warming and announced that he is calling a meeting at  the White House this spring bringing together top environmentalists, economists  and ecologists to grapple with the issue.  </P> <P> But he sounded a note of caution against scientists and environmentalists who  believe that the warming of the Earth's atmosphere is already serious enough to  warrant severe antipollution controls.  </P> <P> "Wherever possible we believe that market mechanism should be applied and that  our policies must be consistent with economic growth and free market principles  in all countries," Bush said in his address before the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change, a U.N.-sponsored group opening a three-day meeting at  Georgetown University.  </P> <P> Environmentalists from the United States and Europe were quick to criticize  Bush for not making a clear commitment to immediate action aimed at dealing  with global warming.  </P> <P> "It was a gross disappointment. There was more talk in the speech about  economics than about the environment," said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club.  </P> <P> Stewart Boyle of the Assn. for the Conservation of Energy in Great Britain said  Bush's remarks demonstrated "a leadership crisis" on the global warming issue  at the White House. "About the only thing we can say about it is he turned up"  at the conference, Boyle said.  </P> <P> The cross section of environmentalists are attending the conference as  observers. They said they would have liked to have seen Bush present specific  U.S. commitments toward energy conservation and specific goals on reductions in  carbon dioxide pollution, which is the major contributor to global warming.  </P> <P> In his speech, Bush said, "We all know that human activities are changing the  atmosphere in unexpected and in unprecedented ways."  </P> <P> He said that "some may be tempted to exploit legitimate concerns for political  positioning."  </P> <P> "Where politics and opinion have outpaced the science, we are accelerating our  support of the technology to bridge that gap," Bush said.  </P> <P> White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu reportedly ordered changes in the  text to mute U.S. concerns about global warming. Sununu acknowledged Sunday  that he had made some changes, but said they were simply to make the speech  "reflective" of Administration policy.  </P> <P> Sununu also criticized "faceless" environmental bureaucrats he said want to  force Americans to give up their cars.  </P></p>

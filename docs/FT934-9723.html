			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Muted activity A DOWNWARD revision in the rate of growth in Germany's M3 measure of the money supply boosted hopes of further monetary easing by the Bundesbank by the end of the year, writes Peter Marsh. The revision to the annualised growth rate in September to 6.8 per cent from 7 per cent was another signal that inflationary pressures in Germany may be abating. That should give the green light to the central bank for a further cut in its key interest rates either this month or next. In Britain, economists largely shrugged off figures from the Central Statistical Office showing a pick-up in new consumer loans and lower than expected inflation at the level of factory goods. The belief in markets continues to be that political pressures will push Mr Ken-neth Clarke, the chancellor, into cutting bank base rates around the time of the Budget on November 30, to offset a likely fiscal tightening. Partly in reaction to the revised M3 figures, the December Euromark futures contract was quoted last night at 93.85 after opening at 93.83. This signified increased expectations in financial markets that the Bundesbank will cut its internationally important Lombard and discount rates, currently at 6.75 per cent and 5.75 per cent respectively. Many investors think the central bank could act at one of its council meetings in December. In Bonn, Mr Eberhard Martini, president of the Federal Association of German Banks, added his weight to the conjecture over monetary easing by saying that the Bundesbank had further scope for rate cuts. He said inflation would be at an average annualised rate of about 3 per cent next year, below this year's level. In the UK, money market activity was subdued, with few analysts becoming wildly excited by the announcement that in the first nine months of this year new consumer loans totalled Pounds 1.84bn, compared with Pounds 362m in the whole of last year and Pounds 1.06bn in 1991. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, took the figures as a further indication that the British economic recovery is on track. In the Bank of England's money market operations the Bank met a shortage of Pounds 1bn through routine bill purchases and by lending to the discount houses Pounds 440m in so-called 'late assistance'.</p>

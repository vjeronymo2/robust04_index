C&hyph;7 and C&hyph;8 to 4,700 hp at the Cromwell Compressor Station in Cromwell, Massachusetts; and (3) make various modifications to metering and regulating facilities in Waterford and Pomfret, Connecticut and in Ashland, Brockton and Norwood, Massachusetts. The cost of Algonquin's proposed facilities is estimated to be $13,139,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Algonquin would provide the firm transportation service for Bay State under proposed Rate Schedule AFT&hyph;5, and would charge a 100% demand rate of $19.3606 per MMbtu for the incremental service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Algonquin seeks a shortened notice period and expeditious Commission action in order to construct the necessary facilities and commence the proposed service by November 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition should, on or before February 23, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission), 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, a petition to intervene or protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 or 385.214) and the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a petition to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Any person who has heretofore filed need not file again. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

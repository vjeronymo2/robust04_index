			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Arts: Comrades at arms - William Packer reviews of the work of Rex Whistler, the Welsh Guard and artist hero who died in Normandy, 1944 Rex Whistler was never a war artist in the now conventional sense: he was, rather, an artist who chose to be a soldier and went to war. He had tried for a commission in the Territorials after Munich, and volunteered again when war was declared in September 1939 although, at 35, well over-age for call-up in the normal way. 'I have a strong feeling,' he told a friend, Kenneth Rae, 'that if anyone has to go and fight . . . it is precisely people of my age, and not the young boys.' By then no new commissions were being given except through the ranks, with the Brigade of Guards the sole exception. Colonel Leatham of the Welsh Guards put him on the waiting list, his commission finally came through in May 1940 and he joined his unit for training in June. Thus as a troop commander, 3 Squadron, 2nd (Armoured Reconnaissance) Battalion The Welsh Guards, Lieutenant RJ Whistler at last went to the war, landing with his troop on Gold Beach on June 30, 1944, D-Day + 24. On July 18 the battalion went into action for the first time, moving across Pegasus Bridge and so south to take part in Operation Goodwood, the planned breaking of the deadlock of the battle for Caen. That afternoon his tank came under fire while temporarily disabled by loose wire. Caught in the open as he organised his troop's response, Whistler was killed outright by a mortar blast, the battalion's first casualty of the campaign. He was 39. There is little doubt that had he been offered a commission as a war artist at the outset, he would have accepted it, but his name was the 750th to be considered by Kenneth Clark, whose committee's decision it was, and by then it was far too late. In the four years of training and waiting between Dunkirk and D-Day, Whistler had become a true soldier, imbued not just with his personal sense of duty as an army officer, but with the ethos of his regiment, and a guards regiment at that. He had turned down camouflage work, and had been given every opportunity to apply for a job on the staff. He had friends quite literally at court, on one notable occasion being summoned, a mere subaltern still, 'to dine with the King &amp; Queen at Sandringham last Tuesday] And went there with my Col. &amp; General &amp; an officer or two from the Grenrs &amp; Bde HQ . . . very informal and everyone in such good spirits.' He could so easily and honourably have excused himself from active service but was adamant. 'If you try to stop me,' he told his squadron commander, 'I shall kill myself.' It is easy to make a hero of a hero, especially so naturally modest and likeable a hero as Rex Whistler - 'one of the most delightful men the Welsh Guards has ever carried on its roll . . .' said his commanding officer - and a reputation as an artist can so easily be elevated in proportion. The usefulness of this delightful and, in the end, poignant exhibition of Whistler's war-time work is that it allows us to see it for what it is, through all the fuss of personality and circumstance. As a painter he is not all that remarkable, uneven yet capable on occasion of great charm and even power in a particular image - the portrait of the battalion's master cook, for example; a tiny Essex landscape painted the weekend he joined up; the officers' mess under canvas on Salisbury Plain; a self-portrait in his new uniform. He painted constantly, portrait studies of friends and fellow officers, genre scenes of military and domestic life, the gardens and interiors of the houses he visited on leave. There is a sense that in this time he was beginning to come to himself as a painter, and this body of work does stand as a particular record of the war on the home front. But it is as a draughtsman and designer that Whistler shows himself as being truly remarkable. His pre-war reputation rested largely on his mural decorations for the restaurant at the Tate, executed in the 1920s, and on his work as an illustrator. Through the war such freelance work continued as military duty allowed, including a number of major commissions for stage and film design. But what is more interesting is the degree to which such activity was not independent of his life as a soldier at all, but part of its very fabric. He was draughtsman and designer in his very nature, reacting spontaneously to every turn of the military life in terms of line and image. A diagram of the lay-out for kit inspection became an elegant and wryly instructive work of art. A suggestion to the colonel of easy improvements to the comforts of the mess became a lively before-and-after cartoon, after the manner of a Rowlandson. Who but Whistler would think to decorate the visitors' book of the travelling cinema, come to entertain the troops? Pastiche Old Masters for the now-refurbished mess? A battalion badge? A battalion Christmas card? Whistler was the man. Much of the material for this show remains in private hands. A great deal more is in the collection of the Welsh Guards, which evidently treasures his memory. We can see why.

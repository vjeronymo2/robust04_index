			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Hard-hit bank sector leads Zurich lower  -US rate rises have hit confidence The correction is over in the Swiss stock market - at least for now. That is the consensus among analysts who watched the market lose 10 per cent of its value last month before rebounding slightly early in March. But there is not much confidence in an early or strong rally, which is hardly surprising considering the scale of the recent damage to some the leading shares. The three big banks have been particularly hard hit. Following the old maxim that wise investors buy on speculation and sell on the news, shares of all three responded to the publication in the past few weeks of spectacular 1993 profit rises by heading decisively downwards. Union Bank of Switzerland bearers were stuck at SFr1,204 yesterday, some 20 per cent below their 1994 high. CS Holding bearers at SFr647, have shed 15 per cent since their January peak. This week, the main indices have been making only tentative moves in both directions. Yesterday, the SMI index of 18 leading shares ended at 2,831.8, little changed from the 2,843.5 point at the previous week's close. The all-share SPI at 1,823.1 was likewise not far from last week's 1,831.5 close. Analysts take some comfort from the observation that both the correction and the current nervous mood derive largely from the recent US interest rate hikes, whereas the interest rate trend in Europe remains downward. Inflation in Switzerland, for example, is widely expected to sink under 1 per cent later this year. For some, the correction brings a welcome change from the frenzied mood of two months ago. 'We are back to the long term trend,' says Mr Beat Philipp, head of equity research at Bank J. Vontobel in Zurich, although he and others do not rule out the possibility of further tests of the resilience of the market in the next couple of months. Then they see the market advancing well in the second half, especially if US interest rate rises do not encourage US investors to repatriate funds. The problem for the Swiss market at the moment is that it is primarily composed of financial and defensive stocks, such as pharmaceuticals and food issues. During the past two years, when interest rates and economic performance were declining in most industrialised countries, this composition served very well. But with both the interest rate and economic cycles at or near their turning points, investors' attention has turned decisively to cyclical shares, and there the Swiss market is rather thinly represented. Most international portfolio managers have already reduced their Swiss weighting and others have helped bid up the few truly liquid Swiss cyclical shares to impressive levels. Bearer shares of Brown Boveri, the Swiss share representing the ABB Asea Brown Boveri power engineering group, are up 10 per cent since the beginning of the year and trading at around 20 times estimated 1994 earnings. Bearers of Sulzer, the engineering and medical equipment group, are up 20 per cent this year and trading at about 16 times estimated 1994 earnings. Alusuisse-Lonza, the aluminium and packaging group,is a current favourite with many analysts. Its shares are up fractionally this year after a good run late last year, and are trading at perhaps 22 times current year earnings. Still, these are the shares that many Swiss analysts have on their recommendation lists. 'Every correction is a splendid opportunity to buy,' says Mr Bernhard Tschanz of Credit Suisse in Zurich. He believes that overall corporate earnings will be up a sparkling 19 per cent this year after 24 per cent last year, with another 16.5 per cent gain expected next year. So far, 1993 profit reports have tended to bolster the cyclical recovery story. This week, Holderbank, the cement group, reported 1993 net income up 12.3 per cent to SFr438m, well ahead of its 4.9 per cent forecast in November. Even the report on Tuesday from Georg Fischer, the troubled foundries and engineering group, of a SFr34m loss on restructuring costs could not undermine the sentiment. Investors bid up Fischer bearers SFr60 to SFr1,260 following the chief executive's forecast of returning to profit this year. Interest in secondary stocks is also rising, with issues such as vehicle maker Bucher, computer mouse maker Logitech and travel agents Kuoni being mentioned frequently. But if the market is to resume its growth pattern again - and most analysts believe it will advance 10 per cent to 15 per cent this year - the focus will have to shift back to the banks and possibly the pharmaceuticals. Analysts agree that the big bank shares have been oversold on directors' warnings of flat profits this year. Mr Philipp acknowledges that profits from securities and currency trading are most unlikely to match last year's extraordinary levels. But he argues that the banks' overall earning power has been transformed in recent years through tighter management. Still, many investors are inclined to focus their attention elsewhere. 'It is not that we think the Swiss market will do badly this year. But we think other European markets, that have more cyclical potential, will do a lot better,' says an analyst at brokers James Capel in London.</p>

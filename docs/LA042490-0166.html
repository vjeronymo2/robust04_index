			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NO 2ND TRIAL IN N. AMERICA S&amp;L CASE  </P> <P> A federal judge here has granted a motion by federal prosecutors to forgo a  second trial to see if convicted thrift consultant Janet Faye McKinzie must  relinquish millions of dollars in assets.  </P> <P> McKinzie was convicted last month of looting the now-defunct North America  Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> She was the beneficiary of a $10-million life insurance policy held by the  thrift's chairman, Duayne D. Christensen, who died in a mysterious car crash  just nine hours before regulators seized the thrift in 1987.  </P> <P> Despite its decision to drop the forfeiture hearing, the federal government is  expected to go after McKinzie assets when she is sentenced in July by asking  for heavy fines and restitution.  </P> <P> McKinzie, 40, and her assets are also the target of a civil lawsuit filed by  the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.  </P></p>

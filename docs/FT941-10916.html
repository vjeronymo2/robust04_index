			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (12): Learning from misfortune - Indonesia Indonesia's stock market has steadily gained equilibrium, after problems arising from overheated share prices caused foreign investors to flee, in many cases with heavy losses, in 1991. Though it rose steadily throughout 1993 - ending the year 115 per cent up in local currency terms - memories of that shake-out, coupled with low liquidity, protected the stock market from some of the excesses of the flood of foreign money into south-east Asia in the later months of the year. Many brokers and fund managers believe this means that Indonesian shares remain attractive. Mr Mike Balfour, overseas investment director of Edinburgh Fund Managers, which runs the EFM Java Trust, says: 'Of all the stock markets in Asia, Indonesia's is the most attractive, because it has not had such a speculative run-up as other markets have.' Liquidity is low, because many companies remain closely-held by family owners, with only a small portion of their equity really available to be traded. According to Baring Securities, average daily trading volume is only Dollars 33m, compared with market capitalisation of Dollars 39bn. However, both figures are well up on 1992, when they were Dollars 13m and Dollars 19bn respectively. The number of new listings picked up last year, after a lull. Barito Pacific Timber immediately became the largest company on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, and saw its shares move to a large premium as soon as they were issued in October. Foreigners are limited to holding 49 per cent of a company's listed stocks. This means that investors must monitor foreign holdings closely. It also means that, as in some other Asian markets, the price for foreigners can differ from the local price quoted on the Jakarta exchange. Shares in demand among foreigners may be at a substantial premium. In other respects, however, there are few restraints on foreign investors, and regulation has become far more effective since the debacle of 1991. Analysts believe that the economic outlook underpins a healthy outlook for the stock market. The economy is expected to grow at around 7 per cent in 1994, slightly up on 1993, with inflation declining to around 7 per cent from 10 per cent in 1993. Interest rates are expected to fall. Growth in exports and in corporate earnings are forecast to be strong, and aid flows to remain high. The rupiah is expected to continue to depreciate by about 5 per cent a year. Though there is uncertainty about the longer-term political future, President Suharto, who has managed the country's economic development for 26 years, remains firmly in control at the age of 72.</p>

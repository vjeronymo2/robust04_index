			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, political scientist and </F> State Duma deputy, under the "Three Authors" rubric: "Echo of  Bosnian Bombings"]    [Text] The NATO rocket strikes at Serb positions in Bosnia  provoke a number of perplexing questions. Who made the decision  on the air strike, by whom and how was it sanctioned? If this  had been demanded by British General Rose, commander of the UN  forces, why was it approved over the phone (!) by UN secretary  general envoy Yasushi Akashi, a Japanese, who was in... Paris?  Was the sanction not received from Butrus-Ghali himself? Why  such a hurry at all in making so responsible a decision with  such dangerous possible consequences?    Just a few days ago, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry;  General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chief of  Staff; and indeed, Secretary of State Warren Christopher  admitted: Air strikes serve no purpose because they may disrupt  talks on a general peaceful settlement in Bosnia. Could that  have been precisely someone's purpose?    True, by this "retribution strike" President Clinton seems  to  have refuted the accusations of being indecisive and  inefficient, which he has been increasingly subjected to from  his critics in the United States. Clinton thereby has avenged,  as it were, the failure of the American operation in Somalia.  Now he states: "We have risen to the occasion." A rather  doubtful statement.    Amazingly, Moscow had not been even informed in advance  about  the planned bombing. What can account for such an attitude of  Clinton to President Yeltsin, who once already opened to the  Americans the way out of the impasse by his well-known peace  initiative on Sarajevo, precluding their involvement in the  Balkan war? Or is it that all means of demonstrating American  leadership are good, and why think of the consequences?    And these consequences are rather serious. The American  bombing hit at Yeltsin's trump card -- cooperation with the  West, the United States. How would the U.S. President's failure  to honor the Russian-American understanding on mutual  consultations in similar situations be interpreted? It is  obvious that President Clinton is rather unceremoniously edging  Russia out of solving the Balkan problems that are so painful  for us. To a Russian, all this recalls Nozdrev [Gogol's  character in "Dead Souls"] who, pointing at his own and his  neighbor's field, said: "This is mine" and added: "Everything  behind the woods (read: across the ocean) is also all mine."    Washington's moves undoubtedly compromise Russia's  cooperation with the West and add grist for the  national-radicals opposed to Yeltsin. One can imagine the zeal  with which Mr. Zhirinovskiy will now descend upon American and,  for that matter, Russian foreign policy: American rockets for  him are a godsend! And what will Russian representatives feel  when they sign the "Partnership for Peace" with NATO to the echo  of the bombings? Or maybe the events are interlinked so as to  derail the signing, to push Russia aside?    The disregard for the agreed on consultations with Security  Council permanent members in advance of UN military operations  arouses a sense of protest. As indeed does the statement on the  NATO bombings coming "automatically" on instructions from UN  commanders in Bosnia, hence once again bypassing the Security  Council. Can one actually identify the United Nations with the  North Atlantic Treaty Alliance?    The bombings may be expected to weaken sharply the positions  of such relatively moderate Serb politicians as Milosevic and  Karadzic. Until recently, they managed somehow to contain the  "implacable" in their ranks, for instance General Mladic, the  Bosnian Serbs commander. Now they will have to radicalize their  stance.    Apropos Mladic. A year or so ago, meeting him in Pale, I  tried to persuade him to stop shelling the beleaguered towns.  "Is there any military reason for such shellings?" "No," he  replied without batting an eye. "Why then you do it? Can't you  see you are sapping your own prestige in the world?" "We'll  think." High time for the Serb radicals also to reach the  conclusion that continued bloodshed in Bosnia is against the  genuine interests of the Serbs themselves.    Now it is extremely sad that civilians once again suffer  from  the bombings. Such is the result of American military  operations be it in Bosnia, Panama, or Somalia: They are  ostensibly undertaken to protect people but as a result it is  innocent civilians who die, and often on a greater scale than  before the interference.    One may hope that in the critical situation that has taken  shape, the Russian state will demonstrate its dignity and  intention to protect its interests, and Russian diplomacy will  demonstrate its skill in gluing together the broken pots. To  all appearances, gluing them together now would be much harder.</p>

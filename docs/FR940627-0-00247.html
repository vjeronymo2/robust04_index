			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) The duration of exposure shall be at least six hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> daily, allowing appropriate additional time for chamber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equilibrium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (ii) Where an exposure chamber is used, its design shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize crowding of the test animals. This is best accomplished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by individual caging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (iii) Pregnant animals shall not be subjected to beyond the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum amount of stress. Since whole-body exposure appears to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the least stressful mode of exposure, it is the preferred method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general oronasal or head-only exposure, which is sometimes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to avoid concurrent exposure by the dermal or oral routes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not recommended because of the associated stress accompanying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the restraining of the animals. However, there may be specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances where it may be more appropriate than whole-body  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure. The tester shall provide justification/reasoning for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its selection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (iv) Measurements shall be made at least every other day of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food consumption for all animals in the study. Males and females  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be weighed on the first day of exposure and 2&hyph;3 times per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> week thereafter, except for pregnant dams.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (v) The test animal housing, mating, and exposure chambers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be operated on a twenty-four hour lighting schedule, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> twelve hours of light and twelve hours of darkness. Test animal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure shall only occur during the light portion of the cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (vi) Signs of toxicity shall be recorded as they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observed including the time of onset, degree, and duration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (vii) Females showing signs of abortion or premature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivery shall be sacrificed and subjected to a thorough  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> macroscopic examination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (viii) Animals that die or are euthanized because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> morbidity will be necropsied promptly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vaginal cytology. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) For a two week period before the mating period starts, each female in the to-be-bred population shall undergo a daily saline vaginal lavage. Two wet cell smears from this lavage shall be examined daily for each subject to determine a baseline pattern of estrus. Testers shall avoid excessive handling and roughness in obtaining the vaginal cell samples, as this may induce a condition of pseudo-pregnancy in the test animals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (ii) This will continue for four weeks or until day 0 of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rat's pregnancy is confirmed by the presence of sperm in the cell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smear.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mating and fertility assessment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) Beginning nine weeks after the start of exposure, each exposed and control group female (exclusive of the histology group females) shall be paired during non-exposure hours with a male from the same exposure concentration group. Matings shall continue for a period of two weeks, or until all mated females are determined to be pregnant. Mating pairs shall be clearly identified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (ii) Each morning, including weekends, cages shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examined for the presence of a sperm plug. When found, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall mark gestation day 0 and pregnancy shall be confirmed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the presence of sperm in the day's wet vaginal cell smears.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (iii) Two weeks after mating is begun, or as females are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined to be pregnant, bred animals are returned to pre-mating housing. Daily exposures continues through gestation day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15 for all pregnant females or through the balance of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure period for non-pregnant females and all males.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (iv) Those pairs which fail to mate shall be evaluated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the course of the study to determine the cause of the apparent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infertility. This may involve such procedures as additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunities to mate with a proven fertile partner, histological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination of the reproductive organs, and, in males,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination of the spermatogenic cycles. The stage of estrus for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each non-pregnant female in the breeding group will be determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the end of the exposure period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (4) All animals in the histology group shall be subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> histopathologic examination at the end of the study's exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Treatment of results. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) All observed results, quantitative and incidental, shall be evaluated by an appropriate statistical method. The specific methods, including consideration of statistical power, shall be selected during the design of the study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (2) Data and reporting. In addition to the reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements specified under &sect;&sect;79.60 and 79.61, the final test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report must include the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gross necropsy. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (A) All animals shall be subjected to a full necropsy which includes examination of the external surface of the body, all orifices, and the cranial, thoracic, and abdominal cavities and their contents. Special attention shall be directed to the organs of the reproductive system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (B) The liver, kidneys, adrenals, pituitary, uterus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vagina, ovaries, testes, epididymides and seminal vesicles (with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coagulating glands), and prostate shall be weighed wet, as soon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as possible after dissection, to avoid drying.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

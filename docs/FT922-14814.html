			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Scottish TV declines to Pounds 8.6m SCOTTISH TELEVISION, which won back its franchise with a bid of Pounds 2,000 a year yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.6m for 1991, a fall of 23 per cent. Mr Bill Brown, chairman, said that in a year of recession the company had demonstrated 'its ability to weather difficult times and to produce results which are among the best in our industry'. The shares closed up 40p at 750p. He added that although there had been fall of Pounds 2.6m in pre-tax profits the company's share of total advertising had increased with sales of Pounds 88.2m (Pounds 89m) and programmes sales to the ITV network had held up at Pounds 17.5m, compared with Pounds 18.2m. Total turnover was up slightly at Pounds 114.2m, against Pounds 114.1m. Scottish has decided to increase the proposed final dividend to 13.125p (11.5p) for a total of 16p (14.375p). This is because it anticipates recovery this year and also because of the 'favourable prospects' for the new licence period, which will start next year. The company is also proposing a 1-for-1 share split to make the shares more marketable. Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at stockbrokers James Capel yesterday forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 14m this year and a provisional Pounds 20m for 1993. Mr Brown said advertising revenue was showing some signs of growth for the first time in two years. 'Having held steady in recession, Scottish Television is now ready for real growth.'</p>

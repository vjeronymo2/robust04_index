			<p>BFN     [Text] Leaders of the provincial party committee and its  office working personnel have bought state treasury bonds with  enthusiasm over the last few days. According to statistics, the  office working personnel of the provincial party committee  already have subscribed for the bonds worth 354,700 yuan or so,  or an average per capita subscription of 300 yuan or more.    To promote state treasury bond subscription work, on 14  April  the general office of the provincial party committee held a  special meeting of persons in charge of units directly under the  provincial party committee and appointed selected persons to be  responsible for the work and to contact banks, asking them to  set up a distribution center in the office of the provincial  party committee on 23 April.    Principal leaders of the provincial party committee not only  took the lead in subscribing for state treasury bonds, but also  attached great importance to the work of subscribing for state  treasury bonds. They have repeatedly instructed that it is  necessary to mobilize the masses of people to subscribe for  state treasury bonds. Xie Fei, secretary of the provincial party  committee, pointed out at a recent provincial study class for  city party committee secretaries that it is necessary to  mobilize cadres and the masses of people to buy state treasury  bonds energetically. This is a glorious task of making  contributions to the state. Standing committee members of the  provincial party committee and members of the leading bodies of  units directly under the committee should take the lead in  buying state treasury bonds so as to help bring the bond  subscription work to a climax. It is necessary to organize  forces to give wide publicity to the work, set up more  distribution centers, do the work at subscribers' doorsteps, and  make the work convenient for the masses of people. One should  enhance the sense of urgency toward this work.    At present, the cities of Zhongshan and Yangjiang have  filled  their state-assigned quotas for sales of 2-year state treasury  bonds.</p>

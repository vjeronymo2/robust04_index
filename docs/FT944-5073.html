			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Chile expected to start Nafta talks next year The leaders of US, Canada and Mexico are expected to announce on Sunday their intention to begin negotiations next year over Chile's accession to the North American Free Trade Agreement. The announcement is being planned for the last day of the Summit of the Americas in Miami, where President Bill Clinton is hosting a meeting of 34 heads of state and government from the western hemisphere. Officials involved in the pre-summit deliberations say the announcement would help to provide a symbolic climax to the meeting, which most Latin American governments believed until recently would yield little of substance. They say further talks are necessary before an announcement is certain. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, yesterday said: 'Our goal is to have an interesting announcement on Sunday led by the President of the United States and involving Chile.' Officials close to the talks said the aim was to announce plans to begin talks soon on Chile's accession to Nafta. Nafta, which groups the US, Canada and Mexico in a free-trade zone, came into effect at the start of this year. The Clinton administration has often stated its intention to negotiate free trade agreements with other Latin American countries, with Chile the first in line - either bilaterally or through Nafta, but has never specified a schedule. The US had been unwilling to commit itself to extending Nafta before the ratification of the Uruguay Round world trade agreement by the US Congress last week. Trade officials from the three countries believe that unless agreement is concluded over Chile's accession next year, the process will become embroiled in the 1996 US presidential election campaign. They admit that since the disposition of the new members of the US Congress is still uncertain, Mr Clinton's ability to push through trade legislation cannot be taken for granted. However, officials see a chance for passage of a fast track authority, limited to Chile. This would avoid a line-by-line scrutiny by the US Congress of the accession agreement, which would make passage all but impossible. Chile is a small economy compared to the other three - it is a sixth the size of of Mexico's, itself a 20th of the US - and most of its exports already enter the US at zero or low tariffs. However, an agreement is seen as giving further comfort to investors in Chile and reduce the vulnerability of Chilean exporters to trade disputes with the US. Most importantly, it is viewed as providing momentum for the Nafta process. 'It's like a bicycle; if we stop pedalling, everyone will fall off,' said one official. Officials expect Mr Clinton, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the new Mexican president, and the Canadian prime minister, Mr Jean Chretien, to invite Chile's President Eduardo Frei to join them on the podium to make the announcement.

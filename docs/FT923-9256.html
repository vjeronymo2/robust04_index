			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Putting consumer spending patterns on the map - A look at a computer system that provides market information to help decision-making The inclination of leading international companies to spend vast sums on national network television advertising campaigns is fast disappearing. With more commercial channels - satellite and terrestrial - on the horizon, the explosion in home video ownership, and shrunken consumer spending, throwing money at an audience which is different from, and more cost-conscious than, five years ago makes little sense. Marketing managers are waking up to the need to refine carefully the targeting of their advertising budgets. GMAP, a company whose majority shareholder (60 per cent) is the University of Leeds, aims to help. GMAP developed out of research in the university's school of geography, led by professor Alan Wilson and senior lecturer Martin Clarke, who together hold the other 40 per cent of the company. GMAP collects and processes a vast array of technical data concerning retailing, financial services, the motor industry, healthcare and other aspects of consumer spending. It feeds the data into a mainframe computer and superimposes it on to maps of the UK. Ford uses the system to locate how many dealers it has in an area, and can judge how well each is performing against a national sales average and competitors. Accurate market information and intelligent deployment of that information may never displace the creative whizz-bangs of glossy advertising images, but its increasing importance to marketing executives is demonstrated both by the recent growth of GMAP - its turnover last year was Pounds 2m - and the quality of its 17-strong client list; besides Ford of Europe, it has Whitbread, Shell, WH Smith, Leeds Permanent Building Society and three of Britain's clearing banks. All these companies supply products and services to a highly heterogeneous market through outlets which, hopefully, are in the correct location. The picture is further complicated by competitors who are trying to achieve the same goals. Where they have outlets has a critical bearing on success. GMAP's typical clients have between 200 and 3,000 outlets. In the case of Ford, a top dealership might sell 10,000 units annually; others perhaps struggle to sell 100. The question facing Ford is: is that 100 a good or poor performance? What GMAP offers is a means of measuring performance against a company's own historical averages and that of the competition. GMAP's data is also used by clients who wish to expand or contract their chain of outlets to maximise profitability. 'What we describe ourselves as doing,' says Clarke, 'is developing decision support tools - computer systems with information and modelling that provide intelligence that allows clients better to understand their markets and their performance in that market; better to understand their competition; and better to plan what they do in the future.' That information is crucial but, in Clarke's experience, has rarely been given much attention in even the largest companies, whose marketing strategies have been much more advertising than research-driven. 'What we can do is to predict for Ford, if it proposes to open a new dealership anywhere in the country, how much business it will take, where the customers will come from, what the impact on existing Ford dealers will be, and what the impact on the competition will be.' Moreover, taking into consideration demographic trends, GMAP says it can assist companies to hold back from opening a new outlet today, but predict that it will become worthwhile doing so in, say, five years. According to Clarke, people think that advertising is effective because everybody else thinks it is. But he says research shows that people tend to make purchases from outlets which are close to them, given a general similarity in the competing product or service on offer. The implications of this for the planning of marketing decisions are considerable. For one thing, it is a counter-argument against seeing mass advertising as achieving much more than brand awareness. As Clarke says: 'People have got mega-bucks to spend on advertising; what they are far less keen to do is the hard task, looking at an individual dealer's performance, area by area. It's not glamorous. It can be quite threatening.'</p>

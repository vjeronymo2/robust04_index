			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / World News in Brief: Iraq taunts allies over missiles and border-crossings President Saddam Hussein continued to taunt the United Nations and western allies, putting surface-to-air missiles on operational status in the northern 'no-fly' zone and for the third day sending men across the Kuwaiti border. General John Shalikashvili, the US supreme allied commander of Nato forces in Europe, said in Washington that Iraq was continuing its policy of 'going to the brink'. He warned that Iraq could provoke a 'dangerous accident' by changing the status of SA-2 and SA-3 missiles in the zone north of the 36th parallel.</p>

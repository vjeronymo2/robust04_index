			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BANNING GAY SPEAKERS AT CORONA DEL MAR HIGH SCHOOL  </P> <P> Corona del Mar senior Doug Shulein's petition to overturn Supt. John Nicoll's  prohibition of homosexual speakers in a supervised high school classroom  psychology class comes as a breath of fresh air to a stagnant atmosphere that  has developed over the past few weeks.  </P> <P> Shulein (and other responsible, well-informed students and parents alike) have  learned more about the workings of a free democratic society than some of our  less-enlightened colleagues. This latter well-intentioned group would continue  to protect us all from social and political evils -- the  "we-know-what's-best-for-you" approach that is all too common amongst fearful  persons.  </P> <P> Obviously, I agree with Doug Shulein. The best method of dealing with a complex  issue -- be it homosexuality, drugs, firearms or other social dilemmas that  permeate our society -- is through trying to understand all component parts.  Our generation has not done well. Our children should be allowed the  opportunity to do better.  </P> <P> ELLIOTT C. MERCER  </P> <P> Corona del Mar  </P></p>

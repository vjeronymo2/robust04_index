In the next few years most of the firms set up by CAS will  be  restructured into share-holding limited companies.    Zhou told the academy's annual conference that it was time  to  fully abandon the old model of the central planned economy.    "We should change our structure into a more open and active  one that is closely related with the country's economy," he said.    Zhou said the "strategic structural adjustment" proposed for  the academy would make the most of its tight budget.    But it would mean some casualties.    The president said researchers who used to rely on  government  funding would face the unknown--unemployment or the marketplace.    "Even though the reform might hurt some, it is an inevitable  historical trend and will not follow some people's intention.  Only if we keep up with the trend can we greatly reduce the  temporary pain."    CAS will concentrate funding and personnel on training and  commercially oriented research--including a project to train and  select people who will lead research into the 21st century as  part of its scientific training programme.    And in a move away from the large scale scientific building  projects of the past, Zhou focussed on the economic development  campaigns planned by CAS--efficient use of coal, treatment of  South China's red soil, development of the rare-earth industry  and information technology.    The academy will also establish two modern comprehensive  science research centres this year: the Shanghai Life Science  Research Centre and the Modern Earth Science Research Centre.    "CAS will also select some major topics in mathematics and  in  nonlinear, environmental, material and information science," the  president said.    Zhou stated the three strategic missions of  CAS--establishing  a world class base for scientific research, nurturing a group of  talented Chinese scientists and supporting the country's  economic development and hi-tech industry.    "The goal is to build CAS into a lively institution with an  academic department made up of the country's top scientists,"  Zhou said.</p>

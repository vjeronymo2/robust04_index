			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Franc under pressure - At a glance The French franc was under pressure on the foreign exchange markets this week, prompted by depressing economic figures and high real interest rates, together with the Bundesbank's decision not to cut official German interest rates. The franc has come under periodic pressure over the past year, before the Maastrich referendum and the general election, and also because of market worries about economic problems, but it has resisted realignment within the ERM. Sterling's position outside the ERM, combined with favourable economic data, has enabled it to strengthen against other European currencies, but summer holidaymakers will still find exchange rates in Europe far less attractive than last summer, before sterling's exit from the ERM.</p>

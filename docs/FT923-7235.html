			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: T Cowie clarifies offer for Henlys T COWIE, the motor trader locked in a fiercely-contested Pounds 32.3m takeover battle with rival Henlys Group, has written a four page letter to its target's shareholders following a request from the Takeover Panel to clarify five points in its latest offer document. The clarification comes after three earlier statements from Cowie withdrawing or clarifying remarks made by it or its advisers. The Panel asked Cowie to redraw a chart in its final offer document to ensure it was not misleading. It asked for clarification of a sentence about Henlys' 'falling dividend' to show that Henlys has forecast a maintained dividend. Cowie was also asked to explain another chart which showed the share price performance of Henlys' shares relative to the motors sector. Cowie withdrew the word 'consistently' used in a press release to describe Henlys' performance against the sector. The chart showed Henlys' shares had outperformed between 1987 and 1989. The last point concerned a series of statements made in the Cowie offer document which, if put together, could amount to a profit forecast for the current year of not less than Pounds 13.7m. At the panel's request Cowie has now backed up this forecast with the assumptions it is based on and with letters from its auditor and merchant bank. Cowie has already reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 12.1m for the first half of 1992. The forecast is well below the Pounds 25m pre-tax estimate analysts have for the company, which Cowie had to distance itself from.</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FREEWAY FUROR  </P> <P> I am furious. We vote for a large increase in our gasoline taxes and then find  that we in Ventura County are at the bottom of the list.  </P> <P> The Santa Paula Freeway is one of the most dangerous roads in the state, yet we  are told that "action can not be taken overnight on something like this." Where  have these state transportation commissioners been for the last 10 to 15 years  when people have been killed on this road?  </P> <P> The freeway could be widened for a fraction of the cost of some of these  freeway projects, but I have a feeling the commissioners have tunnel vision.  They only see what they want to see.  </P> <P> WILLIAM LANGLEY  </P> <P> Oxnard  </P></p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Letter: Consultant not high quality cost Sir, I read with interest Charles Batchelor's article, 'Badge of quality' (September 1) and the views expressed by Mr Bernard Juby on BS 5750 and the role of a consultant in the process. In Mr Juby's opinion a consultant is someone who 'charges an arm and a leg'. The cost of 15 days' consultancy under the Department of Trade and Industry scheme should be a maximum of Pounds 3,000 with another Pounds 3,000 approximately for management time. Certification should be achieved, on average, within nine months. In the case of Mr Smith, who achieved certification without using a consultant, he spent one day a week over two years (half a man year) which would cost an average company approximately Pounds 20,000. Based on these figures, it can be seen that the consultancy route can save a company both time and money. Additional benefits can be achieved from using consultants, such as obtaining an objective/independent view on the company's existing activities and 'tapping' on the consultant's broad range of acquired industrial experience.

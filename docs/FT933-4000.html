			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Laing declines to Pounds 5.1m mid-term - Constructor blames downturn on delays in government spending DELAYS in government spend-ing and costs previously held off the balance sheet contributed to a fall in pre-tax profits at John Laing from Pounds 5.6m to Pounds 5.1m in the six months to June 30. Turnover at the construction company fell to Pounds 590.2m (Pounds 596.6m) as public sector work declined. Mr Martin Laing, chairman, said: 'Are ministers going to take the easy option and chop major capital expenditure projects, or are they going to grasp the nettle and go for the revenue side?' A Pounds 4m interest charge on Pounds 40m borrowings on a Belfast development, previously held off-balance sheet, turned net interest receipts of Pounds 900,000 last time into a charge of Pounds 1.2m. The development contributed Pounds 2.4m to group operating profits of Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 4.7m). Laing has a further Pounds 15.2m of off-balance sheet borrowings, held in three joint ventures and paying their own interest charges. It has net cash of Pounds 53.7m (Pounds 10m) following its Pounds 39m share placing in June. Laing's US housing business made deeper operating losses of Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 1.5m), reflecting a Pounds 2.7m land write-down, while UK housing made a Pounds 500,000 operating profit (losses Pounds 1.6m). Laing sold a total of 1,224 (792) housing units and expects to meet its full-year target of 2,410 (2,175). UK land prices are rising about 5 per cent over the full year as competition for smaller sites increased. Mr Laing is not anticipating 'major price rises' on housing units but said the cost of consumer incentives fell about 1 per cent over the half year. Operating profits from construction struck mainly in the 'deteriorating' UK market fell to Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 8.4m). Laing will resist tendering at 'unrealistic prices'. Higher margin construction contracts won in the 1980s are almost complete and Laing is aiming to increase its proportion of overseas orders, now about 20 per cent of turnover, where operating margins average 10 per cent compared with a 2.5 per cent peak in the UK. Property and investments returned Pounds 4.6m profits (losses Pounds 600,000). The interim dividend is being maintained at 3p covered by earnings of 4.1p (4.5p).</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRACE OF ASBESTOS FOUND IN WATER  </P> <P> A study of El Segundo's drinking water has turned up evidence of asbestos, but  the cancer-causing substance was found in concentrations well within federal  health guidelines.  </P> <P> The highest asbestos concentration in the 18 tap water samples collected in the  citywide study was 1/20 of the maximum level considered safe by the federal  government, said Robert Gils, the study's author.  </P> <P> The concentrations were also well below the average levels found in a 1980  federal survey of water-borne asbestos in 406 cities, said Gils, an  Oakland-area consultant.  </P> <P> City Manager Ron Cano said the asbestos in El Segundo's water comes from water  pipes made with a type of concrete containing the material. He said the  relatively low levels of asbestos in city water supplies do not warrant  launching a special program to replace the pipes.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't recommend that," Cano said. "I think it would be an overreaction."  </P></p>

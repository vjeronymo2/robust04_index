			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Nynex, Viacom in entertainment joint venture Nynex, the regional telephone company serving the north-eastern US, and entertainment group Viacom yesterday announced plans jointly to develop entertainment services in the US and the UK. This is the first significant entertainment deal between the two to emerge from Nynex's Dollars 1.2bn investment in Viacom last autumn. That link-up helped Viacom win the Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount Communications, the film and publishing group. The two companies said they would explore the development of video on demand  -which gives consumers the ability to summon film entertainment when they want it - in the north-eastern US. The project would draw on Viacom's and Paramount's film and television programming libraries. They would also work to create inter-active versions of Viacom's cable TV networks, including the MTV music video channel and Nickelodeon, the children's television channel. They will also look into inter-active multi-player games which could be delivered over the Nynex network. In the UK, where Nynex is one of the leading cable television providers, the two will start by commissioning a study on the potential for services such as video-on-demand, a new film channel, new basic cable channels, special event telecasts, and trials of interactive services. Nynex has been criticised on Wall Street for its investment in Viacom, which some analysts regarded as a costly way of getting into the entertainment business, and one which failed to give the company any critical mass. Meanwhile, Blockbuster Entertainment, the video rental group which agreed to merge with Viacom during the Paramount bid, has not put the deal on the agenda for its May 24 annual meeting. The merger requires shareholder approval, and Blockbuster's inaction increased Wall Street expectations that the deal would not go through. Blockbuster agreed in January to pay Dollars 55 a share for Viacom B non-voting stock, but the market price of the shares has since fallen sharply. Viacom had been relying on the Blockbuster deal to bolster its cashflow following the Paramount takeover.</p>

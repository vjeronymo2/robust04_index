The Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said also that  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres had talked with his  Romanian counterpart in an "amicable" manner about the occurance  in Romania of "several isolated cases" of anti-Semitism. The  Israeli chief-diplomat said that, in spite of the correct  decisions and positions taken by the Romanian Government which  had been well received in Israel, he had to ask, because of the  sensible subject, the authorities in Bucharest to continue their  actions in the same spirit. The Romanian chief diplomat said  that such situations were "isolated" and explained that the  phenomenon could be linked to the transition period as well as  to the freedom of expression manifesting in Romania.</p>

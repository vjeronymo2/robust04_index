			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Letter: Demonstrating funding success Sir, Your leader, 'How to grab the EC money' (February 7), highlights the importance to the British government of clarifying the agreement, made in 1975 and put in more explicit terms in 1988, that EC regional grants should have a 'genuine additional economic impact in the regions concerned' and 'result in corresponding increase in total expenditure'. The differences of interpretation should be relegated to the agenda of the past and, if sustained, can only serve to cause unnecessary political embarrassment to Britain in her evolving EC role. In the future it is anticipated that the agreed expansion of EC regional programmes will be closely linked to the process of 'convergence', which makes it even more important to UK regions currently benefiting from access to EC funding that they demonstrate the success of those schemes, and, where necessary, sustain them in years to come. Christopher Beazley, MEP for Cornwall and Plymouth, The Grange, Devoran, Nr Truro, Cornwall</p>

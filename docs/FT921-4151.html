			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: BSN boosts beer interests with 24% of San Miguel BSN, France's leading food group, is to strengthen its position in Spanish brewing by buying a 24 per cent stake in San Miguel. The acquisition, at an undisclosed price, is a valuable addition to BSN's beer interests, which already include 33 per cent of Mahou, another Spanish brewer. BSN, under the chairmanship of Mr Antoine Riboud, is Europe's second largest beer group, with market leadership in France and Italy and strong positions in Spain, Belgium and Greece. Its other brands include Kronenbourg, Kanterbrau, Maes Pils and Peroni. However, BSN's beer business is less international than some of its other activities, in biscuits, mineral water and dairy products. In 1990, the beer division made 82 per cent of its FFr6.6bn (Dollars 1.18bn) sales in France, out of total group sales of FFr52.9bn. The San Miguel stake was sold by the March group. The purchase was made with the agreement of other investor groups, and leaves the family shareholders in majority control. The acquisition, valued at Pta13bn (Dollars 125m) at current Madrid stock market prices, gives BSN a stake in the Spanish beer market rivalling that of Guinness, which has a market share in excess of 20 per cent. San Miguel is the fifth biggest domestic brewer with a market quota of some 14 per cent. The other main foreign player in Spain's beer sector is Heineken, which owns 51 per cent of El Aguila, the second biggest brewer. The deal highlights the current drive by one of Spain's premier family controlled holding companies to realise its assets. Last week it announced it was selling a 15.5 per cent stake in Signet Banking Corporation of the US. The group had earlier unveiled plans to raise as much as Pta50bn through the sale of its electric utility interests in Spain. It is also understood to be seeking buyers for certain chemical companies it owns, as well as partners for its two domestic banks, Banco Urquijo and Banco de Progreso.</p>

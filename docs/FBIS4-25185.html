			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] When going down to the state-owned enterprises  and the rural areas of the Xianning Prefecture to conduct  investigation and study from 22 to 29 May, Governor Jia Zhijie  pointed out that all localities and departments should:  Implement the policies given to the province by the central  authorities in a satisfactory, full, and creative way; carry out  economic work in a thoroughgoing, careful, and solid manner;  strive to concentrate efforts in agriculture on implementing  policies and paying close attention to the construction of the  "rice bag" and "shopping basket" projects; make great efforts in  industry to tackle difficult problems and raise efficiency by  centering around the market; properly solve the pronounced  contradictions and problems in economic life; and should  continue to maintain and develop the current fine situation.  [passage omitted]    Jia Zhijie maintained that our province's current situation  can be summarized in three sentences: First, the situation is  unprecedented and fine rather than generally good. The main  indications are that the enthusiasm of the broad masses of  peasants for production is unprecedentedly high and a momentum  of breakthrough development has been maintained in grain and  cotton production and the development of a diversified economy  and township and town enterprises. A historic, great turn has  occurred in the development of industry, which has maintained a  relatively high growth rate, some state-owned enterprises have  managed to get, or are getting, themselves out of their  predicaments, and the industrial output in April increased by  12.2 percent over the same month last year, higher than the 5  percent for the nation's state- owned enterprises in the same  month. Urban and rural markets are brisk and reforms in  macromanagement structures, such as finance, banking,  investment, and planning, have been progressing smoothly.  Experiments in building a modern enterprise system are being  carried out step by step and opening up to the outside world  continues to maintain a good momentum. Second, is that in the  fine situation, there are really some difficulties and problems  hampering development and stability, which should not be  overlooked, and we should earnestly approach and properly solve  them. Third is that only when these difficulties and problems  in our advance are properly solved can our province's fine  situation, which has not come easily, be maintained and  developed. [passage omitted]    Jia Zhijie pointed out: It is necessary to correctly handle  the relationship between reform, development, and stability,  further remove hidden dangers, and maintain social stability.  He said: What counts in solving the problem of stability is  taking a two-handed approach: Take radical measures while  putting stress on taking precautions. At present we should make  great efforts to do the work well in the following ways: Firmly  putting price raises below the nation's average levels; doing  well from start to finish in improving the lives of the people  in disaster areas, areas around reservoirs, and poverty-stricken  areas, ensuring that they have enough food to eat and their  temporary shortages are smoothly overcome; doing an earnest job  of finding jobs for cadres and employees whose employment has  been affected as a result of reform; encouraging the companies  which were affected by reform to find a way out by increasing  income and decreasing expenditure, readjusting the  organizational structure, and cutting unreasonable spending, and  continuing to improve the basic daily necessities of the  enterprises which have suspended production totally or partially  and help some university and college students solve their  difficulties in their daily lives.    He urged all localities to pay close attention to the  development of the "rice bag" and "shopping basket" projects,  strive for innovative advances in developing a diversified  economy and township and town enterprises, and do an ever better  job in rural work. He pointed out: Our province's guidelines  for rural work are clear and definite. At present, all  localities should seize the favorable opportunity, further  implement the central authorities' and the province's various  preferential policies in support of agriculture, effectively  reduce the peasants' burdens, adopt effective measures to check  the excessively rapid momentum of price raises in capital goods  for agriculture, protect the peasants' immediate interests,  further mobilize their enthusiasm for production, ensure  effective supplies, and lay a solid material foundation for  stabilizing the market and commodity prices. [passage omitted]    While talking about running state-owned enterprises well and  maintaining the good momentum of industrial production, Jia  Zhijie pointed out: It is necessary to take measures to tackle  difficult problems and increase efficiency. [passage omitted]  All localities should give first consideration to and study the  market while helping the enterprises which have suspended  production totally or partially recovered production, by  deciding projects to launch, making decisions, and readjusting  the product mix and the enterprise organizational structure.  The fundamental way for enterprises to meet market demand is to  enable them to get involved in the market and strive to pump  fresh vitality into state-owned enterprises by deepening reform,  changing operational mechanisms, and establishing a modern  enterprise system.    Jia Zhijie stressed: To handle the relationship between  reform, development, and stability and maintain and develop the  fine situation, which did not come easily; party committees and  governments at all levels and various departments should further  change their work style and develop the good work style of being  practical and doing a solid job. What counts in doing this is  that leaders should set an example. Principal party and  government leaders at all levels must: Take the lead in cutting  the excessive number of document meetings and having less social  intercourse; be determined to go deep into the realities of  life; go down to the grass-roots units, enterprises, and the  rural areas by centering around the outstanding problems in  reform, development, and stability; do more investigation and  study; make great efforts to carry out their work; and solve  practical problems.</p>

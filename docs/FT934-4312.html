			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / DTI minister attacks EU steel subsidies The government yesterday risked further friction with fellow members of the European Union by pledging to fight for an end to state subsidies for inefficient Continental steel producers. Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said subsidies were at the heart of the steel sector's difficulties. 'The continued operation of inefficient companies propped up by massive state aid is directly responsible for the excess capacity and uneconomic pricing,' he told the British Iron and Steel Producers Association in London. 'The UK steel industry has had to take necessary but painful decisions. It is time for others to play by the rules and, if necessary, to suffer the pain of restructuring.' Mr Sainsbury's tough stance on the European Commission's controversial restructuring plans for the steel industry has irritated Germany, whose plan to subsidise Ekostahl, the troubled east German producer, is strongly opposed by the UK. Mr Sainsbury upset the commission last month when he told European counterparts in Brussels that 'no agreement would be better than a bad agreement' on subsidies. Agreement on the subsidies issue has to be unanimous. The November meeting of industry ministers ended in disarray after Italy rejected a commission compromise on cuts in subsidies and capacity at Ilva, the loss-making state steelmaker. Another industry ministers' meeting will probably be called for December 17, but Mr Sainsbury said yesterday that it would not be an easy meeting. 'I may be unpopular with some of my ministerial colleagues but I am determined personally to get us a much more level playing field,' he said. Mr Sainsbury received support from Mr David Stone, the association's outgoing president. He said that political decisions by national or regional governments to subsidise steel-related activities must be fought by the UK through every political means. 'Soft compromises brought about through ministerial fatigue, or from a sense of isolation, or in the theoretical interests of a 'greater Europe' must be resisted,' Mr Stone told the association's annual meeting. State operating subsidies to some Continental steelworks were being paid to ensure that other private-sector plants closed instead of 'politically sensitive' ones, he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Pavlovich Chubay, chairman of the </F> Trade Union Federation of the Maritime Region, conducted by  Albert Kubarev; date and place not given]    [Text] [Kubarev] I first met with my interlocutor, the  chairman of the Trade Union Federation of the Maritime Region,  Vladimir Chubay, in Vladivostok soon after the strikes which  occurred there. Recall that in August of last year 370  enterprises in the Maritime Region stopped work for a period of  from 2 to 24 hours. They struck in literally all sectors of the  economy.    As is well-known, at that time a "landing force" of 80  ministers and their deputies together with the chairman of the  government, Viktor Chernomyrdin, came immediately to the Far  East.    But now half a year has passed. Vladimir Pavlovich was in  Moscow on business, and when I met him here, naturally I wanted  to know if there had been any changes.    [Chubay] There have been, but for the worse. Based on the  results of the commission's work, the government adopted a  decree. It is not a bad document; it envisions a solution to our  basic problems: allocation of subsidies for the fuel and energy  complex, lower rates for transport shipping, and customs charges  are authorized to remain in the kray. But several months have  already passed and the paper really has not taken effect.  Moreover, we got a telegram from first vice premier Gaydar, who  now is already former vice premier. He told us not to expect  subsidies for bread, to take care of it ourselves.    But may I ask you, what can we do ourselves now when both  under the tsar and under Soviet power 50 percent of the food was  imported into the Far East from other regions? We do not grow  grain at all. An altogether different complex was established  here: machine building and fish, defense, and other sectors of  industry. And suddenly, right before winter comes this telegram.  To get grain you need some time and money. Our most critical  problem is transport. No matter what you are doing, everything  has to be imported from somewhere. And the price of transport,  despite the promises, has doubled again recently.    In short, the situation is desperate. The electricity has  been turned off at enterprises which did not pay their bills to  Dalenergo [Far East Energy System]. But how can they pay when  their partners have not paid them? It is an endless circle.  Dalenergo owes 40 billion rubles [R] to coal and black oil  suppliers.    Among our neighbors, in Japan, and even in America the cost  of electricity is the same throughout the country. There  electricity prices and, incidentally, grain prices too are  regulated by the state. But here the hydroelectric power plant  collective of 200 people privatizes the enterprise and inflates  prices at their own discretion.    Several days ago the hot water supply to apartments was shut  off. And the way they are heated the mercury column in the  thermometer does not rise above 12 degrees. Is that really  normal? People are forced to get small stoves ["burzhuyka's"],  especially in settlements.    [Kubarev] Vladimir Pavlovich, a few days ago there was a  report in RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA from the settlement of Bolshoy  Kamen. The state incurred debts of R20 billion to the Zvezda  defense plant. The workers have been without pay for 2 months.  When I was there, they complained of the same troubles. But the  chairman of the brigades council, Sergey Savitskiy, reassured  the comrades: "The government knows about us now and will take  steps." And the people believed the promises.    [Chubay] Of course they believed them. That is not what is  striking. How can officials of such high state rank give  promises so easily and not fulfill them?    [Kubarev] But are you really saying that the decree is not  bad? And that apparently someone else altogether is to blame for  it not working?    [Chubay] No, I do not agree! Do you remember what I told you  surprised us most at the meetings with the governmental  commission?    [Kubarev] Yes, I remember very well. And what I was told by  many people, incidentally, in particular the chairman of the  dock workers trade union of the Vladivostok Trade Port, V.  Reksha: "We have sent 3,000 letters and telegrams to Moscow on  the terrible situation in the kray. Not a word in response. And  then suddenly members of the commission which visited us  announce that they did not know anything about the crisis! Then  just how are simple people supposed to get through to the  authorities?"    You do not have to dig back into your memory very far:  highly  placed officials' references to their lack of information are  not so very rare. The thought comes to mind: isn't the reason  that our lives are getting worse and worse that the  powers-that-be do not know anything about it and simply do not  want to know?    [Chubay] That is just the trouble. Our Far East has been  driven into a corner! It is no secret that we have quite a large  number of military men and a large fleet. And everyone has to be  fed, and we receive this telegram: do not expect grain. On a  business trip to Moscow, I visited your stores here: eggs and  meat are a bit cheaper but they do not leave the counters.  People say, your (that is, our) pay is higher. Is that so?  Miners who extract tungsten, lead, and tin under difficult  conditions receive 50,000. Tell me, how does a miner live?  Things are even worse for fishermen.    The real disaster is fuel. Because of the lack of it, ships  cannot go to sea and sometimes are not even able to return to  port.    I am ashamed to say that the fishermen go to the shores of  South Korea for fuel and buy our very own fuel there, at three  times the price, for hard currency. It is delivered there by  Russian businessmen who buy it from the state for a song.    What do we do, get people to strike again? So that we are  again accused of playing politics? We do not want a strike, we  want to work productively and restore the country. Alas, the  Maritime Region has the highest mortality rate in Russia.  Especially among old men, they are just mowed down, and we bury  them... in plastic bags.    [Kubarev] So there is no way out?    [Chubay] Why, what do you mean? A new parliament has been  elected and the government has been reformed. I think that we  will find aid and support from them all the same. We are  approaching the elections to local organs of representative  power. Of the 28 seats in the kray duma, we figure to get at  least one-third. We hope that our deputies will not be so  hard-of-hearing as those fly-in hotshots.</p>

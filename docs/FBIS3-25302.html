In a letter to UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali, Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha drew his  attention to a UN resolution in terms of which funds were to be  given to the two organizations until their positions in South  Africa had been normalized. Mr. Botha said that in the light of  political developments in the country, and the organizations'  registration as political parties, the requirements of the  resolution had been met.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAUCHOS GET HAT TRICK, DEFEATING 49ERS FOR THIRD TIME  </P> <P> UC Santa Barbara disproved the theory that the odds are often against a team  trying to beat another for the third time in the same season.  </P> <P> The Gauchos, who had defeated Cal State Long Beach by 1 point and 11 points  during the regular season, eliminated the 49ers from the Big West Conference  tournament, 69-57, Thursday afternoon at the Long Beach Arena.  </P> <P> Coach Jerry Pimm, whose team improved to 21-7, didn't believe the theory,  anyway. "It really didn't go through our minds," he said. "You just line up and  play hard. I felt our preparation was solid."  </P> <P> Both teams concentrated on working the ball inside. The Gauchos, who shot 55%,  had an easy time doing that. The 49ers, who shot 43%, had a hard time.  </P> <P> "We got the ball inside pretty good; that's the key for us," Pimm said.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara took control of the game midway through the first half. In six  minutes, the Gauchos went from a 17-14 deficit to a 30-19 lead. Eric McArthur  scored nine points and Mike Doyle five during that run, which was aided by a  technical foul on Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington.  </P> <P> The 49ers, who finished the season 13-15, trailed at halftime, 38-29. But a  series of power moves by reserve center Marco Fleming helped cut the lead to  44-41 six minutes into the second half.  </P> <P> Carrick DeHart came back with a baseline jumper for the Gauchos, and after  Bobby Sears scored for Long Beach, DeHart hit from the wing for a five-point  edge.  </P> <P> Saved from danger momentarily, the Gauchos pulled away quickly. Frank Johnson  converted a rebound into a basket. Doyle made a layup after breaking the  all-court press. Doyle fed Lucius Davis for a lay-in, then scored inside  himself. A three-point play by DeHart topped off the surge.  </P> <P> The score was 59-48 with 6:02 to play, and Harrington conceded. "With six  minutes to go, we started preparing for next season," he said.  </P> <P> Fleming led all scorers with 20 points.  </P></p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Observer: Family fortunes When the family owns the merchant bank the chairman should be allowed to pay himself what he likes. Even so there are bound to be raised eyebrows at the way Sir Evelyn de Rothschild's salary has recently gone up. Over three years, he has moved from being one of the City's lowest paid merchant bank chairmen to one of its highest paid. In 1989 he received Pounds 261,000 and in the year to March 1992 Pounds 852,000 (including an unspecified one-off bonus). Leaving aside Warburg's Sir David Scholey, who more than doubled his Pounds 511,000 salary with a Pounds 687,000 long-term performance bonus last year, Sir Evelyn seems to have earned far more than any of his rival chairmen. Schroders' George Mallinckrodt got a 35 per cent rise to Pounds 590,000, while Peter Baring's salary was virtually unchanged at Pounds 511,000. Meanwhile, poor old David Peake at Kleinwort Benson had to make do with just Pounds 251,000 last year. The traditional rationale for the City's fat salaries is that they're the price necessary to stop top talent defecting overseas. But in Sir Evelyn's case it is hard to imagine him deserting the family firm. Given that he is over 60, and there was a bonus payment, the jump in his salary may have something to do with his future retirement plans. Rothschild's bank says the payment was vetted by its renumeration committee chaired by former Whitehall mandarin Sir Frank Cooper. Even so it must seem a bit steep to present top civil servants like Sir Robin Butler who is paid a paltry Pounds 109,000 for heading a workforce many hundred times larger than Sir Evelyn's.</p>

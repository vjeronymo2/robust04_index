			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Tamil guerrillas killed 24 Indian troops in a raid launched from a hospital  they had occupied in northwest Sri Lanka, an Indian Embassy official said in  Colombo, the capital. He said the rebels attacked the Mannar camp with gunfire  and rocket-propelled grenades, and the Indian troops did not return fire out of  consideration for the 87 civilians in the hospital. Guerrillas of the  Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam said the Indian soldiers were killed when  their commando unit overran the camp.  </P></p>

			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Letter: Call for new type of pension In Barry Riley's article on pensions (The Long View, January 11) there are several points which are not covered. To start with, pensioners are entitled to their pensions in the same way that insurance policy holders are entitled to their benefits under their policies. Anyone who has worked overseas and decided to maintain his DSS pension knows that he paid a premium, part of the NI contribution, specifically to cover his pension and nothing else. Barry Riley talks about a 'free gift from one generation to the previous one'. What about the free gift of a national infrastructure from one generation to the next one? If people entering work had to pay for assets and services built up by preceding generations, there would be no pension funding problem. Although the working population may decrease relative to the number of pensioners, productivity increases due to advancing technology should fill the gap. Nevertheless, it is high time there was a single national pension plan for all; government controlled, but privately administered and funded, but completely out of the hands of employers.

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Pennzoil unloads further Dollars 720m in Chevron shares PENNZOIL yesterday dumped more than Dollars 720m of its shares in rival US oil group Chevron on to the stock market, further unwinding the near-10 per cent stake it built up in 1989. The sale of about 8.2m shares, representing almost 2.5 per cent of Chevron's stock, prompted a sharp fall in its share price. They were sold at Dollars 89 each, pushing the market price down from Dollars 93 at Wednesday's close to as low as Dollars 88 3/8 at one stage. Pennzoil said it would show a Dollars 171m profit from the sale. The company built its stake with more than Dollars 2bn of the Dollars 3bn it received from Texaco in a settlement in 1988. The payment was made after a Texas jury found against Texaco for acquiring Gulf Oil after Pennzoil had already agreed to buy more than half the company. Yesterday's sale is the latest in a series of disposals. A year ago, Pennzoil swapped a block of shares representing 5 per cent of Chevron for a number of the company's US oil and gas properties. It still holds 9m shares, or 2.8 per cent of Chevron, and has issued bonds which are convertible into these shares. The sale follows a year-long run-up in Chevron's shares, which went as high as Dollars 98 3/4 .</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Yeltsin reappoints Gaidar in boost for reform moves MR YEGOR GAIDAR, the architect of Russia's economic reform, who resigned under pressure from parliament at the end of last year, is to rejoin the cabinet as a first deputy prime minister as the government acts to impose a tough package of spending cuts and tax rises. President Boris Yeltsin announced the appointment, a strong boost to faltering economic reform and an equally big snub to parliament, as he visited troops near Moscow. Mr Yeltsin was quoted by the official news agency Tass as saying that 'in this way the conflict between the deputy ministers Oleg Lobov and Boris Fyodorov will be decided'. Mr Lobov, who has been pressing a programme of state investment and controls on the president, in opposition to Mr Fyodorov's advocacy of strict macroeconomic controls and cuts in state expenditure, appears to be the main loser - and with him, the alternative economic strategy based on state credits and an end to voucher privatisation. The decision to invite back Mr Gaidar, issued to the 37-year-old economist by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, was taken around the time of a visit to Moscow earlier this week by Mr Laurence Summers, the US Treasury undersecretary. Mr Summers, who has been deeply concerned over the Russian reform progress, to which the Group of Seven governments had pledged a package of support worth Dollars 44bn, was said to be heartened by his visit. He hoped that the International Monetary Fund and World Bank lending programmes, suspended because of lack of progress on reform, would be resumed before the year end . The decision to bring back Mr Gaidar, whether or not taken under direct US/G7 pressure, is clearly meant as a signal that Russia remains committed to reform - and that Mr Yeltsin is willing to confront parliament in his struggle to replace the constitution as well as the economic system. Those close to Mr Gaidar say that he has already demanded that Mr Lobov, a former Communist party official with close links to Mr Yeltsin, should be fired. At the same time, senior officials in the finance ministry, Mr Fyodorov's base, cautioned last night that Mr Gaidar and Mr Fyodorov, although both radicals, could clash over policy implementation.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kmart loses backing of investor for stake sales Wall Street's biggest institutional investor is joining a rebellion against plans by Kmart, the troubled US discount store group, to sell stakes of up to 30 per cent in its four specialty retailing subsidiaries. The influential College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF), which holds 1.1bn of Kmart's 455.9bn issued shares, said it wanted Kmart to sell the subsidiaries completely, so that management could concentrate on improving the core discount store business. It also said it would withhold support for all five of Kmart's 13 directors seeking re-election this year, citing the company's 'significant long-term decline in market share, profitability, operating earnings and share price'. With only a day to go before the company's annual meeting on Friday, the CREF is the biggest of five investors to have spoken out against Kmart's strategy. The others are the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, one of the 10 largest US pension funds; the Florida State Board of Administration; the Ohio State Teachers Retirement System; and the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union. Between them, these investors control only a small percentage of Kmart's shares. However, they are hoping their public opposition to Kmart's plans will swing other shareholders against the company. Kmart, which has been struggling to compete with its more successful rival, Wal-Mart, ended five years of stagnant earnings by plummeting into net losses of Dollars 947m last year. Plans for recovery include the creation of new shares in its specialty retailing subsidiaries and the sale of up to 30 per cent of the shares in the marketplace.</p>

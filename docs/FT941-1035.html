			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Well-travelled grapes - Wine / Jancis Robinson finds striking contrasts between the wineries of the new world The 1994 wine harvest is almost over, in the southern hemisphere that is. Just back from a quick fix of carbon dioxide and grapeskin smells in Australian and South American wineries, I am haunted by two very different images of today's wine industry. In the Yarra Valley outside Melbourne, in the temperature-controlled hangar that is Moet &amp; Chandon's Australian offshoot winery, a stack of giant metal bins filled with Pinot Noir grapes wait patiently until Domaine Chandon's small team of cellar rats, and some extremely shiny equipment, are ready to press them into a new vintage of Green Point sparkling wine. The 1991 is yours for Pounds 10.49, up 50p from the 1990 because of spiralling demand. What makes this sight remarkable is that these tight, healthy bunches of shiny black grapes were picked four days earlier in the far south of Western Australia and have been shipped, in a refrigerated truck, across the notoriously unforgiving Nullabor Plain - the distance equivalent of shipping grapes from southern Turkey to Bordeaux. This is the Australian way of doing things - pragmatism unfettered by tradition, spurred on by a sophisticated market at home and abroad. A few days later I watched the 1994 vintage being delivered to Penaflor in Mendoza, Argentina's largest winery. Dozens of magnificently ancient lorries stood waiting their turn between weighbridge and continuous press, piled high with a jumble of indigenous Criolla and Cereza grapes, oxidising almost visibly in the sunshine. Penaflor boasts the world's largest wine vat, a subterranean concrete cylinder 10m high and 36m across, carefully painted on the outside to look like wood. Dinner parties for 500 have been held inside it. More usually it is filled and emptied every two months - with enough wine to fill almost 7m bottles, or 5m of the litre cardboard Tetrapaks that are so popular with South American wine drinkers. Intrigued, I asked to taste the wine blended in it, Termidor, Argentina's best selling wine, after being shown the increasingly exciting Trapiche range that is groomed for export markets in one small corner of the winery. The white, musky juice of these local grape varieties makes up all of the white and half of the red Termidor. I defy a European palate positively to enjoy the flavour of the white, but the red was respectably coloured and masked by a blend of Tempranillo, Barbera and Sangiovese (one of California's most sought after grapes at the moment). Termidor sells for just 1.20 pesos (80p) a litre. Given the domestic taste for heavy, low-acid, almost-oxidised wines that would be impossible to sell outside Latin America, and given the antique nature of most Argentine wine technology, it is a miracle that a dozen or so winery owners in Argentina are now enthusiastically gearing up for export. The wine industry is currently one of Argentina's most significant investment sectors. The Argentines are several years behind their neighbours across the Andes in this respect. Stainless steel has become much less of a novelty in Chile over the past few years, and Chilean wine has an established market for inexpensive Cabernet Sauvignon in the US, UK and other parts of northern Europe. But the Chileans are all too aware of Argentina's potential as the world's fifth biggest wine producer. As Argentines are wont to observe somewhat smugly: 'We're not really interested in what the Chileans do, but they're always worried about what we're up to.' Chilean wine exports slowed last year, but the 1994 harvest is the first prolific, if slightly cool, one for some time and grape prices have slumped accordingly. This, coupled with increasing winemaking skills, may help to win more customers, although the real difficulty is communicating the quality-not-quantity message across the winemaker-grapegrower divide. (Wine producers are therefore investing heavily in suitable vineyard land and Santa Rita, for example, expects to buy in no more than a fifth of its grapes by 1997.) Australian wine producers, on the other hand, are in a frenzy of export activity. Many of the most lauded now send more than half their production overseas, mainly to Britain but increasingly to Germany and, to a more limited extent, the US. Sweden is also an avid consumer of Australian wines shipped there in bulk. Wine now represents more than half of Australia's exports and it is the stated goal of its wine industry that exports should be worth ADollars 1bn (Pounds 480m) by the year 2000. New vineyards are accordingly being established all over the country, especially in the coolest, most south-eastern part of South Australia (a state which has yet to enjoy the phylloxera experience), and in the deep south of Western Australia - no longer so isolated, it would seem. The domestic market, a highly sophisticated one in which connoisseurship is spread both deeply and widely, is increasingly peeved at seeing so many of Australia's finest wines sailing away from the country's heavily unionised quays, and prices have been rising as a result. (Australia's first Dollars 100-a-bottle release, Yarra Yering's Merlot 1991, is sold out.) Grape prices for the 1994 harvest are at an all-time high as producers jockey to meet demand while new vineyards come into production. Some 'boutique' producers with deep pockets are said to have offered more than ADollars 2,000 a tonne for premium grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. The interesting development this year is that Shiraz, Australia's Syrah which has for long been the country's most planted red wine grape and has been despised for it, is now commanding the same price as Cabernet in many regions, particularly in parts of Victoria and the Barossa Valley where it performs particularly well. Earlier this year Australia signed a bilateral trade agreement with Europe which formalised its wine labelling, prohibited the use of such terms as Champagne, Hermitage, and Burgundy in the long term, and ratifed exact proportions of grape varieties and regions which would be allowed in blends. In theory, Australian wines should henceforth become more 'European' in constitution, but there are few signs that Australian winemakers will abandon their hallmark practice of blending the produce of a palette of wine regions which may be many hundreds of miles, and styles, apart. Green Point 1991 is a forward, exuberant, come-hither champagne method wine selling for Pounds 10.49 at bigger branches of most major chains. Trapiche's best buys are the Malbec 1990 Pounds 3.49 from Morrisons supermarkets and, a real humdinger, Medalla 1991 Cabernet Sauvignon Pounds 6.95 from Grape Ideas of Oxford.</p>

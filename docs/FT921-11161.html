			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Tories accused of poll tax negligence THE GOVERNMENT is intentionally jeopardising the ability of local authorities to collect unpaid poll tax for short-term political advantage, Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's environment spokesman, said yesterday. In a fierce attack on Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, he said the government's refusal to negotiate swift legislation to close the legal loophole over computer-based evidence on those who had not paid poll tax was a 'dereliction of duty'. Labour has offered to help through a short bill to remedy the legal difficulty. Yesterday Mr Gould received a letter from Mr Heseltine rejecting the offer and saying the matter would be resolved in a new clause in the council tax bill. Mr Gould said Mr Heseltine, the 'most ruthless and unprincipled' politician, had made his decision in order to blame Labour for surcharges that were certain to be added to poll tax bills for the additional costs incurred by non-payment or delayed payments. He said figures released recently by the Chartered Institute for Public Finance and Accountancy confirmed Labour's claims that final poll tax bills for 1992-93 would near Pounds 300 and not the Pounds 257 originally claimed by the government.</p>

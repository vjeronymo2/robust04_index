			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: WEAR MY LIPS  </P> <P> Attention Rolling Stones fans: There is now a line of Rolling Stones clothing  and accessories, carried by a number of nationwide retailers, including Macy's  and JC Penney. We hear the unisex and supposedly ageless pieces, priced from $6  for a bandanna to $450 for a bomber jacket, were designed "under the direction"  of lead singer Mick Jagger and drummer Charlie Watts. T-shirts, for example,  have prints originally done "in Mick's own hand." There are also decorated  Converse high-tops and leather motorcycle jackets with the Rolling Stones'  "lips and tongue" logo on the back. The Stones didn't throw in any pants, only  shorts, but there are skateboards. Can't you see it now? The Stones rolling out  on their skateboards, wearing their logo motorcycle jackets when they appear in  concert in Los Angeles next month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boy, George  </P> <P> Boy George has a whole new look, but his makeup is what we noticed first the  other night at the St. James Club, where he turned up at a party for Malcolm  Forbes' new magazine, Egg. George arrived with heavily penciled eyebrows, a dab  of glossy lipstick and a pale, sleek complexion that was thanks to his pancake  makeup. No skirts, dresses or dreadlocks to be seen on the man. His red silk  jacket came from a British designer whose name George forgets. And he found his  green high-top sneakers in New York.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Winning By a Nose  </P> <P> Fred and Gale Hayman, who co-created Giorgio perfume, are up to new adventures  this fall. He just introduced 273, a perfume named for his store's address, at  Saks in New York, to the strains of his favorite sounds -- mariachi music.  Meanwhile, she's putting final touches on the all-leopard environment from  which she'll launch her cosmetics line, Gale Hayman Beverly Hills, at  Bloomingdale's next month. (It's already available at Nordstrom.) He says Lena  Horne was among those who took home a bottle of 273, and she says Raquel Welch  and Gloria Steinem will be at her launch party. So far so impressive. But the  race to watch begins next spring, when she introduces her first solo scent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two for Japan  </P> <P> Designer Rachel London, whose 3-D flower fashions are favored by Jodie Watley,  tells Listen her Melrose Avenue store is being re-created, inch for inch, in  Japan. A group of Asian investors liked the eccentric look -- complete with  double bed amid the sales racks and paper roses taped to the ceiling. She isn't  free to name the investors. Meanwhile, Carmelo Pomodoro, the New York designer,  says Takashamaya, the huge Japanese retail company, is building him his own  boutique in Tokyo. He doesn't have one in the United States. Pomodoro's is  nothing like London's. It's a glass-walled, concrete-columned space inspired by  Palladio, the 16th-Century Italian architect. It opens Oct. 8, Pomodoro says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tune-Up Run  </P> <P> If you can't run, you can walk on Oct. 7 at the Reebok-sponsored 5K/10K Run and  Notables Walk to benefit the Los Angeles Philharmonic and youth music education  in Southern California. Participants will get a chance to rub elbows with  world-class runner Ed Eyestone and win the respect of Lakers' coach Pat Riley  and radio talk-show host Michael Jackson, co-chairmen of this latest addition  to fitness-inspired fund-raisers. Frills include gift certificates, tickets to  L.A. Philharmonic concerts, a jazz band and a $3 pancake breakfast. Fees are  $12 for entries postmarked before Sunday, $15 thereafter. Registration forms  are available at Front Runners stores in Brentwood and the Westside Pavilion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Monaco Moniker  </P> <P> Seems that during Ringo Starr's All Starr Tour, the erstwhile Beatle and his  wife, Barbara Bach, occasionally used the alias Monaco. The choice behind this  moniker is simple -- they live there. So it's no surprise that when tour  producer David Fishof walked into the Beverly Hills boutique, Club Monaco, he  decided to splurge on the incognito duo. For the Starrs and other participants  in the tour, Fishof picked up six baseball jackets and two bathrobes, along  with other odds and ends. All the items are emblazoned with the word Monaco, so  Ringo can proudly wear his alias on his sleeve.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another Elton John  </P> <P> Elton John shopping in Los Angeles doesn't surprise us. But Elton John buying  shirts and ties at the Polo Ralph Lauren boutique in Beverly Hills, now that's  a bit of a shock. Maybe he wasn't getting them for himself. "Oh, yes, he was,"  says a company spokesperson, noting that the rock star is a frequent customer.  Of course, the question is: Where does he wear the things he buys? "I have no  idea," the same spokesperson confessed. "I go to England often and see pictures  of him in the papers and see him on talk shows and he's never dressed in Polo."  Just one more fashion mystery.  </P></p>

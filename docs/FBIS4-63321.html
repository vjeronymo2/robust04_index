			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sharip Asuev] </F>   [Text] Groznyy (Chechnya) May 21 TASS -- The Chechen  Republic marked the 130th anniversary since the end of the  Caucasian war with a parade of the best units of the emerging  Chechen army in its capital city Groznyy on Saturday.    Dzhokhar Dudayev, republican president and  commander-in-chief  of armed forces, presented banners and standards with Chechen  symbols to 12 regular units before the parade.    A conference devoted to the anniversary since the end of the  50-year-long war of tsarist Russia against highlanders, was also  held in the Chechen capital on the same day.    Its participants, including guests from Saudi Arabia, the  United States and Jordan, noted that the Russian empire  conquered Caucasian peoples with fire and sword but could not  suppress their will for freedom.    Addressing the conference, Dudayev called for "establishing  an international tribunal to condemn the continued colonial  policy of Russia in the Caucasus".</p>

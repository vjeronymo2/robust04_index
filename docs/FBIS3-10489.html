			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has been reported that 100,000 Armed Forces  members will implement the Democracy Plan, which seeks to ensure  that the country's coming electoral activities will be held  normally and peacefully. Administrative Department of Security  [DAS] members will also participate in the plan, which has been  coordinated by the Defense Ministry.    The Democracy Plan consists of three main facets: security  of  candidates, security at the voting sites, and security of  National Civil Registry Office members, not only during the  elections but during the vote counting and the transportation of  ballot boxes as well.    General Celso Suarez, the Armed Forces General Command's  chief of operations, has told EL TIEMPO: "In most of the cases,  the police will protect the ballot boxes, and the Navy and the  Air Force will be in charge of protecting the general area  surrounding the voting sites."    Although no area in the country will be left unprotected,  there will be priorities, according to the Defense Ministry. In  the Uraba zone in Antioquia and Choco Departments alone, 8,000  Armed Forces members will guarantee normalcy before, during, and  after the elections, Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda has  reported. Pardo visited the area this week with high-ranking  Army and police officers and registry official Luis Camilo  Osorio.    EL TIEMPO has learned that the Armed Forces have decided to  give special attention to the Santander, Boyaca, Cesar,  Magdalena, and Meta Departments. The strategy adopted by the  police and DAS establishes protection of the candidates,  political centers, patrolling, and making available bomb squads  and investigation squads.    The candidates' protection includes making sure the  candidates for president follow the instructions issued by their  security chiefs and escorts. In theory, all candidates to  public positions can have official escorts. The large number of  candidates makes this difficult, however. For the time being,  the Defense Ministry is trying to establish who really requires  protection and determine priorities in the movement of escorts.    Suarez said: "The Public Force has offered the highest  security possible to those who request it. We must mention that  we are inviting all candidates to regional and municipal  security committees to present their concerns and needs."    The high-level official confirmed consultations with the  candidates had facilitated the study in each case to recommend  the respective security measures. He also admitted that the  military forces are analyzing the possibility of candidates'  avoiding travel in certain areas of the nation with public order  problems.    When making reference to this week's attacks and kidnappings  as part of the guerrillas' plan to hamper the electoral process,  Suarez said that even though kidnapping and murder have become a  profession for the rebels, neither the citizens nor the  political class have been intimidated.    He also responded to criticism according to which the  Democratic Plan is only a transitory reaction that does not  solve the true problem of the rebels. The officer said that the  plan is not new. Nevertheless, he added, it goes without saying  that "any person or group that tries to alter or hamper the  normal development of the elections will be the object of a  timely reaction by the Public Forces."    According to military sources, the deployment of personnel  to  implement the Democratic Plan should not in any way hamper the  development of offensive operations against the guerrillas  throughout the nation. "It is important to highlight that this  plan will be implemented without impairing the counterinsurgency  offensive. Currently we have the capability to handle both  fronts appropriately," Suarez noted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Vladimir Vodusek: "Sad Defeated Foes"] </F>   [Text] "The biggest project after Demos," as Dimitrij  Rupel has assessed the unification of the political center,  marks the final defeat of the United List, which did not succeed  in its transformation from a party of "directors" to a party  with a social democratic profile. The United List has lost the  unnecessary "crusade" against [Defense Minister] Janez Jansa and  will after the unification of the center probably play a role of  wealthy utopian communists with ample financial backing.    After the completion of the unification, the United List  will  probably be forced to withdraw gradually from the coalition  although the protagonists of unification emphasize that a  reshuffle of ministerial departments is not in its background.  It is interesting that even [Foreign Minister] Lojze Peterle  and the Christian Democrats oppose the Democrats, the Greens,  and the Socialists assuming ministerial posts. They believe  that the United List should stay in the coalition despite the  unification of the center, because, owing to the burden of its  past, it is more controllable than the new Liberal Democracy.  Objectively speaking, the new party will take the segment of  the political spectrum that has hitherto been covered by the  United List and at the same time also a proportion of its  voters, but it will primarily take ministerial posts.    The unification of the center also means the end of trauma  for at least some Democrats, who with 9 percent of the votes at  the first elections held the most important posts in Slovene  politics for two years. The story about the political center  also means the end of the utopian idea about philosophers and  philanthropists in politics, who used to play the role of bad  conscience in the parliamentary democracy and by doing so first  killed off the Slovene Democratic Alliance, later Demos, and  finally -- people like Rudi Seligo and Tine and Spomenka Hribar  -- left the party, but not politics. Some intellectuals in  politics even today cannot come to terms with the fact that  their vote in parliament counts as much as a vote of a deputy of  the Slovene National Party or the Slovene Peoples' Party [SLS].  The problems in the unification of the center should,  therefore, not be sought merely with the Liberal Democrats, but  primarily in the Democratic Party, where some people are not  absolutely convinced about the pragmatism of Igor Bavcar and  Dimitrij Rupel. Even though Rupel, Bavcar, and Tancig would not  relinquish their ministerial posts if "the reformists" left the  coalition, the unification of the center is evidently a  long-term project -- especially in the light of the local  elections, where parties lacking finances or party  infrastructure will be condemned to defeat.    The emergence of the new Liberal Democracy also means that  the ZSMS [the former Socialist Alliance of Youth] faction of  Jozef Skoljc and the Democrats with their state-forming pedigree  will clash again, but [Prime Minister] Janez Drnovsek obviously  does not have much room for maneuver. The left wing is occupied  by Milan Kucan, while on the right wing it is not yet quite  clear how the conflict, whose main protagonists are brothers  Podobnik and Lojze Peterle, will end for the Christian  Democracy. Christian Democrat Ivan Oman on one occasion said  that the Slovene Christian Democratic Party [SKD] and the SLS  will merge only once its leaders have passed away. Of course,  in realpolitik not even antagonisms last for ever, and one can  thus at least expect a joint appearance of "the anticorruption  league" at the local elections if not the actual unification of  the SDK and the SLS. The "unprincipled coalition" would do the  biggest service to Janez Jansa by pushing him into opposition,  as he would then be able to prepare for the looming early  elections in peace. There is a belief among the new Liberal  Democracy that the prime minister yields to much to the defense  minister and "the confessional" part of the coalition. We will  soon see whether the new Liberal Democratic bloc is against the  right wing or whether, at least as concerns the Democrats, an  if-you-can't-beat-them-join-them strategy is lurking in the  background.    The story about the unification, which will mark the  Slovene political scene for a long time, is not merely about who  will take what ministerial post but also about who will, through  the Liberal Democracy, appoint ministers and form the  government. The public opinion polls show that the rating of  the parties has not changed much since independence and after  all the affairs, with the exception of the United List, whose  crisis headquarters have established that they had lost by their  wrong policy of antagonizing Jansa, which at the same time  weakened the influence of President Milan Kucan, and contributed  toward the rising popularity of the defense minister.    Janez Drnovsek, who has never concerned himself much with  faction struggles, will definitely remain the central figure of  the new Liberal Democracy until the elections. Secretly, he is  perhaps coveting the post of the president of the state, where  he is not without competition even though Milan Kucan has  announced on several occasions that he will not run in the  forthcoming elections.    Beside the SKD and the SLS, which will definitely have  advantage at the local elections, personnel is the key problem  of the parties that have emerged with the democratic elections,  because they cannot cover approximately 300 new communes.  Namely, the total membership of some of these parties hardly  exceeds the number of local communities, as it primarily  consists of pragmatic elites. This is also how the interest in  the unification of the center could be interpreted. The times  of the proverb "two Slovenes, three parties," are over. Only  those who have the money, the electoral base, and above all  clear programs for which they are willing to fight until the end  will survive on the political scene. "A bloc policy" is in the  process of being created in Slovenia and the time of "the Cold  War" is nearing, for which some politicians have already lost  their nerve before it even starts.</p>

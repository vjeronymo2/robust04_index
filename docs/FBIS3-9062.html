			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Voters Are More Uncertain"] </F>   [Text] Voter support for various parties seems to be clear  in March 1994, two months before the first round of  parliamentary elections, with the supporters of various parties  preserving their former character. The Hungarian Socialist  Party [MSZP] continues to firmly maintain its leading position:  Some 18 percent of the 937 citizens surveyed by the Szonda  Ipsos Institute would vote for the MSZP if elections were held  this Sunday. The support for the MSZP has remained practically  unchanged over the last five months. The gradual loss of  supporters of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] has  continued, with 10 percent of all the people surveyed supporting  them; with this figure, it continues to be in second place. The  proportion of supporters of the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ] dropped by 3 percent; in the case of this party, we are  witnessing a break in the slightly upward trend of recent  months. Although none of these changes taken separately is  considerable, the 5-percent drop in the support of the two  liberal parties taken together is considerable.    The support for the other parliamentary parties has remained  practically unchanged. Regarding the parties outside  parliament, we can say that the extent of their support is far  below the threshold needed to make it into Parliament. A new  development in this area is that the Agricultural Federation has  become a party with a measurable amount of support.    The voters give the MSZP the biggest chance of winning the  elections. According to 24 percent of all the people surveyed,  the MSZP will receive most votes (compared with only 21 percent  in February). Some 11 percent of the people thought that the  SZDSZ would win the elections, 6 percent thought the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF], and 6 percent thought the Fidesz.    The most interesting development this month is that the  proportion of citizens without a firm party preference reached  41 percent, a figure never achieved before. At the same time,  readiness to participate in the elections remained at the high  level measured last month (61 percent of the people surveyed are  sure they will vote, and 16 percent will probably vote). It is  a paradoxical effect of the official start of the election  campaign that people who would like to vote have now become  uncertain.</p>

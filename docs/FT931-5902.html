			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Army urges Yeltsin to end deadlock THE top command of the Russian army has urged President Boris Yeltsin to take 'resolute measures' to end the political deadlock, according to the daily Izvestia, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. The newspaper reported that 'during a security council meeting chaired by Mr Yeltsin, military representatives expressed concern on the development of the political crisis and demanded that the president take resolute measures to end it'. The deliberate publicity given to this normally closed discussion highlights the momentum gathering behind a presidential strike against his encircling opponents in parliament and elsewhere - possibly in the form of a declaration of an emergency, or of presidential rule. Mr Anatoly Sliva, deputy head of the president's legal advisory department, said yesterday the referendum planned for April 11 following an agreement between the president and parliament in December could not now legally be cancelled. A meeting, probably next week, of the Congress of People's Deputies seems certain to repudiate its earlier agreement. Yesterday, talking to women's groups, Mr Yeltsin said Russia could split into warring states unless opposing sides ended their differences. He asked the groups to use their influence to cool tempers. The governor of Ukraine's central bank announced yesterday that on March 18 he will raise Ukraine's discount rate to 180 per cent as part of the government's drive to stabilise the Ukrainian economy, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev. Mr Viktor Iushchenko, appointed to head the National Bank of Ukraine last month, said that the refinancing rate would be pegged at 90 per cent and that enterprises unable to pay their debts would be forced into bankruptcy. 'If we do not weed out those enterprises which are dragging us backwards our economy will never survive,' he said. Editorial comment, Page 19</p>

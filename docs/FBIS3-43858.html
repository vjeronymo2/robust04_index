Sporadic  firing was heard on Saturday night, but according to reports it  wasn't serious. The shots came from the Makoanyane Military  Base about 11km outside the capital, home of the faction whose  demand for a doubling of army salaries led to the clash.  Residents nearby told SAPA on Sunday it appeared the shots had  been fired into the air, and there were no reports of injuries.    Members of the Royal Lesotho Defence Force's Reccie Unit --  the other faction which is believed to be loyal to the  government -- remained stationed in the mountains on the  outskirts of Maseru on Sunday.    Fears of a possible coup in the tiny enclave were quashed on  Saturday with the help of South African Foreign Minister Pik  Botha. He flew in at the request of the Lesotho Government, met  separately with all the parties involved -- including political  -- and brokered a truce. However, Mr Botha told his guests  South Africa would not tolerate a Lesotho Government which came  to power by force, and vowed to bring it to its knees.    Lesotho and South African Government officials confirmed to  SAPA the pay issue was believed to be a smokescreen for  political opposition to the ruling Basotholand Congress Party,  which swept to power in elections last year.    Mr Botha also met the leader of the main opposition Basotho  National Party during his one-day visit.</p>

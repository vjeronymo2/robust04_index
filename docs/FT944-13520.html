			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / War by other means: David Buchan argues that France regards virtually all tactics as fair in trade policy Halloween this year coincides with the ritual of the Night of the Long Knives when newly appointed European commissioners carve up the portfolios - and themselves. Mr Jacques Santer, the new Commission president who will allocate the jobs this weekend, has recently had a timely reminder of why entrusting Europe's trade and industry policy to a French commissioner would be widely considered as daft as putting a Briton in charge of farm policy. France has threatened to veto an international agreement to scrap shipbuilding subsidies painstakingly negotiated by the outgoing Commission with other industrial countries. Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's European Union affairs minister, has promised French MPs that he is ready to invoke 'vital national interests' to block the agreement. Yet the sector employs just 5,880 people out of a total workforce of nearly 20m. French presidential politics are partly to blame. Mr Jacques Chirac, who is rivalling Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to be the main conservative candidate in next spring's presidential election, has for reasons best known to himself made support for French shipbuilding an obsessional part of his campaign for the Elysee. Mr Balladur believes he must match him in this obsession. But in fighting to retain subsidies for shipbuilding, both men follow in a long tradition of state interventionism that goes back to the 17th century and Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV's economic overlord. Colbert subsidised many shipbuilding and shipowning companies, which all collapsed when his death brought the subsidies to an end. Some would argue this showed the pointlessness of creating such artificial companies in the first place. Others - including the present French government - seem to see the real error in putting a stop to subsidies. Yet the Colbertin sense of being in a permanent economic struggle with other countries still pervades modern French thinking to a remarkable degree. The only difference is that France's chief economic enemies today are the US and Japan; in Jean-Baptiste's day, it was England and Holland. Earlier this month, France's defence and economics ministries sponsored a teach-in on 'economic war' in Paris. This showed that the French - in a way that is both admirable and irritating - refuse to sit on the laurels of their undoubted achievements in foreign trade, which include last year's FFr80bn (Pounds 10bn) trade surplus recorded in spite of a generally strong franc. France believes that foreign competitors are waging total economic war against the country, and therefore regards virtually all tactics as fair in parrying these attacks. General Francois Mermet, the retired head of France's DGSE intelligence service, which was once accused of spying on US industry, told the conference that France should have 'no hang-ups' in mobilising all its resources in the battle for foreign contracts. The French sense that world trade is somehow unfair is reinforced in an area dear to Colbert's heart - luxury goods. Mercantilists such as Colbert believed that a country should run a payments surplus to gain gold to pay mercenaries or bribe enemies in time of war. But Colbert added the refinement that the surplus should be in luxury goods which are, by definition, not essential to any war effort and might have the added benefit of rendering foreign consumers more effete. Three centuries later, France has half the world market in luxury goods, according to the aptly named Colbert Committee which represents French fashion, perfume, wines and spirits companies. Many of these products are easy to fake, leaving the country exposed to counterfeiting. And France has taken draconian measures this year against counterfeiters. However, economic nationalism has become harder to justify with international co-operation in industries such as aerospace and defence. Their products commonly have components from several different European countries. The view increasingly proclaimed in France, therefore, is that in aerospace and defence, all Europeans are on the same side. They face a common enemy in an American industry that is determined to offset the sharp contraction in its home defence market by killing off European competitors, with Washington using or abusing political influence in US client states where necessary. Giving substance to this Euro-rhetoric, France opened last week's biennial navy equipment exhibition in Paris to other European defence companies under the name of 'Euronaval'. It is perhaps a pity that Mr Santer does not have a defence dossier to distribute, because there the French are certainly thinking European.</p>

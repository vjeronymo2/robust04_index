			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Dollar rallies A strong November jobs report in the US helped the dollar rally yesterday, finishing above Y100 in London for the first time in nearly two months, writes Philip Gawith. The dollar's rally was prompted by the expectation of higher US interest rates, with the market believing the Fed will be forced to take further steps to curb inflation. The dollar finished one yen firmer at Y100.4, from Y99.34. Against the D-Mark it finished at DM1.5778, from DM1.5722. With little fresh information to trade on, sterling finished slightly weaker at DM2.461, from DM2.4639, and Dollars 1.5598 from Dollars 1.5672. The D-Mark was little changed in Europe, though the Italian lira gained ground to close at L1,026 from L1,028. The slightly jagged upward progress of the dollar reflected the mixed message of the jobs report. 'There was something in there to satisfy everyone,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America in London. Although the market focused on the headline rise in non-farm payrolls, this was partially offset by falls in hourly earnings and the average working week. Some analysts, however, said the fall in the unemployment rate to 5.6 per cent, from 5.8 per cent, spelled danger. Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, commented: 'Given the momentum of the economy, it is now unlikely that unemployment will stop falling until it is close to 5 per cent - deep into the inflation zone.' He said the market would now be expecting a 25-50 basis point rise in US rates at the December 20 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Ms Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, a private sector business-research group, supported this view, saying: 'Interest rates probably have to go much higher to discourage the momentum building in the consumer sector.' Mr Hawkins said the jobs report added 'a little' pressure on the Fed to act soon, but he did not expect them to raise rates in December, unless inflation data later this month is very poor. Whether the Fed moves sooner or later, Mr Hawkins said 'the ballgame has now changed in favour of the dollar.' Not only was the Fed finally perceived as having raised interest rates to a level where policy could be seen to be neutral, but US rates were now at a level where it actually paid to hold dollars. Two other factors appear to be helping the dollar: the shrinking Japanese current account surplus, which should remove support from the yen, and the dollar's tendency in recent years to rally in the festive period. According to a fortnightly survey by IDEA, the financial analysis service, the dollar is currently the most popular 'buy' currency. On a two month outlook, the median rates expected are DM1.59 and Y100.25. The dollar bears, however, have by no means thrown in the towel. SG Warburg, for example, says that the dollar is being supported by the perception of rising real interest rates. It argues, however, that real rates have probably peaked, on the assumption that inflation must start to rise, just as real rates in Europe are likely to start rising. Warburg predicts a 'significant further fall' in the first half of 1995, to DM1.40-50 and Y95-100 by mid-year. The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.15bn money market shortage at established rates in its daily operations.</p>

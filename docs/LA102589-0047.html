			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KRENZ GOES FROM HATED TO WAIT-AND-SEE  </P> <P> For East German dissidents, Egon Krenz is the man they loved to hate.  </P> <P> While Krenz's predecessor as national leader, Erich Honecker, was viewed as  misguided but well-meaning, Krenz was seen as the rock-hard anti-reformer.  </P> <P> After his first week in the nation's top three offices -- head of state,  Communist Party chief and chairman of the Defense Council -- Krenz is being  given a second look, not only by East Germans but by Western diplomatic  observers.  </P> <P> Baerbel Bohley, a founder of the opposition New Forum, says Krenz -- who at 52  is the youngest member of the ruling Politburo -- should be given a chance to  show what he can do. So far, what he has said and done has given rise to  optimism in some quarters and skepticism in others.  </P> <P> "His first speech was not impressive," a diplomat said, "but he has started  seeing churchmen and workers and saying some conciliatory things. But he is  going to be judged not by what he says but what he does."  </P> <P> A 21-year-old mechanic taking part in a church vigil for arrested dissenters  said, "He's making some good gestures, but they are only gestures, maybe just  tactical moves to give the right impression."  </P> <P> Gethsemane Church, where the vigil is taking place, is papered with statements  from dissenters, and anyone on the steps may be questioned by agents of the  security service. The mechanic ignored a bystander who appeared to be such an  agent and said, "We want to see results: more travel and free elections."  </P> <P> West German political figures have adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward  Krenz, but one West German party aide said he thinks Krenz will make an effort  to improve the relationship between the two Germanys.  </P> <P> Karsten Voigt, a foreign affairs expert with the opposition Social Democratic  Party, said in a recent conversation that he has known Krenz for 15 years.  </P> <P> "He may surprise us," Voigt said. "He may turn out to be much more flexible and  open than depicted."  </P> <P> There does not seem to have been much flexibility in Krenz's past. For a dozen  years, under Honecker, he was head of the state security apparatus; he was in  charge of the electoral commission that approved what was widely regarded as  rigged voting; he complimented the Chinese government for its crackdown on the  pro-democracy movement last summer in Beijing, and early this month, while  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was in Berlin, Krenz ordered the police  to break up popular demonstrations.  </P> <P> In private, he is reportedly less austere than his public persona.  </P> <P> "His background would indicate that Krenz knows what's going on, which is more  than you could say about Honecker," a political observer here said. "In a  police state, the police may be the only ones who know what's going on."  </P> <P> Other analysts suggested that Krenz's tough background may be just what is  needed for the introduction of much-needed political and economic reforms.  </P> <P> "He has a hard reputation, and only a hard man will lead this country out of  its problems," a Western diplomat said.  </P> <P> The diplomat pointed out that it was conservative President Richard M. Nixon  who made the breakthrough with Communist China, and that it was a conservative  successor, Ronald Reagan, who came to terms with Gorbachev.  </P> <P> "People change in jobs," a West German diplomat remarked, "particularly when  faced with the realities of life."  </P> <P> How Krenz deals with East Germany's realities has become a fascinating area of  speculation.  </P> <P> "Krenz says he wants to discuss reforms," a diplomat said, "but not the  socialist system itself. Yet it is the system itself that needs changing."  </P> <P> Krenz and the party's ruling Politburo are faced with the problem of how to  liberalize East Germany's rigid society and at the same time hold to the  socialist ideal. Without this ideal there would be no need for a separate East  German state, and Communist leaders admit this.  </P> <P> Rolf Heinrich, another of the New Forum leaders, talked about this problem with  a reporter. A lawyer, Heinrich was barred from practice earlier this year after  publishing a book, "The Guardian State," that was critical of the government.  </P> <P> "The thing for Krenz and his people to do is to show that things are going to  change," Heinrich said.  </P> <P> What could the government do quickly to regain public confidence?  </P> <P> "First," Heinrich said, "he could restore the possibility for travel, East and  West. Then he could declare a law for free elections.  </P> <P> "Third, he could abolish political offenses as criminal acts. At a stroke of  the pen, he could recognize opposition groups like New Forum. These would cost  nothing. And if they are really serious, they would announce changes in the  socialist system -- for example, that a worker would be paid more for extra  work."  </P> <P> Already, Heinrich said, "Things are moving. Last spring I was considered an  enemy of the state. Now I am only considered useless to the state. That's an  improvement under Krenz."  </P></p>

The premier told a meeting in Beijing on the struggle  against  corruption and for a clean government that it is essential to  handle well the relations between reforms and development on the  one hand and stability on the other and strengthen leadership  over the struggle against corruption and for a clean government.    He said that every Communist Party member and every  government functionary must conscientiously subordinate all  their work, including anti-corruption struggle, to the overall  efforts of reform, development and stability.    The premier reviewed the achievements of the anti-corruption  struggle, saying that it has boosted the confidence of the  masses of the people and promoted reform, opening and social  development and stability.    But he said that much remains to be desired by the people  and  what has been achieved has not been consolidated. He called on  the governments at all levels to strengthen leadership and  persist the struggle stage by stage and make it more fruitful.    He warned not to relax the anti-corruption efforts or stop  where it is.    While making investigations into corruption cases, Li Peng  said, emphasis should be made to investigate into and deal with  major cases, which must be exposed without delay, irrespective  of official rankings.    While carrying on with the anti-corruption struggle, Li  said,  it is necessary to perfect the systems, especially the legal  system, in order to deal with the root cause of corruption.    He called on officials to carry forward the fine traditions  of the party and perform their duties honestly and serve the  people whole-heartedly. He urged them to study more and attend  less social functions, carry out investigations and study, hear  the voices of the people and do concrete things for them,  improve their work efficiency and overcome bureaucracy, and take  the overall situation into consideration in doing everything so  as to ensure the smooth implementation of the reform measures to  be produced this year.    Li concluded that the campaign against corruption and for a  clean government is not an expedient measure, but a strategic  step to maintain the country's long-term stability.    The meeting on the struggle against corruption and for a  clean government was called by the State Council. Cao Qingze,  minister of supervision, Chen Qingtai, vice-minister of the  State Economic and Trade Commission, and Liu Jibin,  vice-minister of finance, reviewed the anti-corruption struggle  and its achievements over the past year.</p>

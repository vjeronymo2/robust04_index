This exposes the climate of  suspicion prevailing in relations between the authorities and  the opposition. Nonetheless, the Mauritanian Government says it  is determined to organize the elections in an open manner. As  an indication of its goodwill, the lists of polling station  heads and assessors have been published. Here is Salem Meshbour  Salem with a report from Nouakchott.    [Begin Salem recording] Polling station heads and their  assessors have been appointed nationwide. The governors of the  13 provinces that compose Mauritania have been asked by the  government to organize introductory seminars on the  administrative, technical, and legal procedures for the  municipal elections. To this end, a training workshop is  currently being held in Nouakchott for all the senior government  officials selected to supervise the 28 January municipal  elections. [passage omitted]    Despite the training and preparation of government officials  charged with ensuring the regularity of the polls, the country's  opposition parties do not seem to be convinced in any way. They  have condemned the mobilization of 2,000 nonresident soldiers to  vote for the candidate of President Ould Taya's Democratic and  Social Republican Party in the Nouakchott Arafat district.  Among these soldiers, the opposition has mentioned the names  and ranks of the National Army and Gendarmerie chiefs of staff.  However, the law stipulates that members of the Armed Forces  can only vote in their places of residence or work. [end  recording]</p>

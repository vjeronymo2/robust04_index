			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: New chairman at Intercare Intercare Group, the ac-quisitive manufacturer and supplier of healthcare products, has responded to its flagging share price by raising its dividend and splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive. The shares yesterday rose 14p to 150p after the Stockport-based group reported a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.31m for the year to October 2. Mr Peter Cowan, chairman and chief executive, said the group's shares had suffered along with the rest of the healthcare sector, and there was also market concern about small, acquisitive companies that did not conform to the Cadbury recommendations on corporate governance. Mr Cowan, who has a 10 per cent stake in Intercare, said the board had decided to separate his roles, with his full agreement. He will remain as chief executive, while Mr Robert Shepherd, 62, will become non-executive chairman. Mr Shepherd founded Priestly Footwear in 1956, which was acquired by Pentland Industries in 1972, where he became deputy chairman. He retired from Pentland at the end of 1992. Mr John Padget, 57, who has been a non-executive director of Kwik-Fit Holdings since 1981, will join the board as the fourth non-executive director. Intercare's sales increased by 34 per cent to Pounds 39m and earnings per share rose to 10.5p (9.5p). Mr Cowan said the strength and diversity of the businesses enabled the board to increase the final dividend to 2.8p, raising the total for the year by 35 per cent to 3.5p (2.6p). The results included a Pounds 320,000 profits contribution from RTH, the Dutch supplier of specialised wheelchairs which the group acquired in May for an initial Pounds 1.8m. Mr Cowan said Intercare would continue its strategy of concentrating on medical devices used by the disabled, the elderly, and the optical markets.</p>

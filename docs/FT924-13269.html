			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nafta redraws the American farm trade map - The far-reaching effects of the agreement to phase out protectionism IF THE North American Free Trade Agreement goes into effect as planned in 1994 its provisions will have far-reaching effects on the region's agriculture. At this point, the continent's farm trade has been largely complementary. The US and Canada export grains to Mexico, and Mexico supplies them with tropical products, fruit and vegetables. This simple arrangement could change over the next 15 years. Unlike other parts of the agreement, the negotiators were unable to reach a single farm trade accord for all three countries. The understanding between Canada and Mexico calls for the elimination of all tariff and non-tariff barriers with the exception of those in the dairy, poultry, egg and sugar sectors. Canada is expected to tackle its protected sectors within the farm trade negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Canada will immediately exempt Mexico from import restrictions covering wheat, barley, beef, veal and margarine. The two countries will eliminate immediately or phase out within five years tariffs on many fruit and vegetable products. Tariffs on remaining fruit and vegetable products will be phased out over 10 years. Between the US and Mexico a more extensive deal has been agreed. All non-tariff measures affecting agricultural trade will be eliminated when Nafta goes into effect. They will be converted into tariffs and phased out over 15 years. More than half of all farm trade between the US and Mexico will be tariff-free immediately upon the start of the agreement. The US will use its longest transition periods for sugar, certain fruits and vegetables and orange juice. Mexico will use its longest for milk powder, maize and dry beans. American grain farmers are generally happy about the new market potential, but the National Association of Wheat Growers is furious that the US negotiators failed to convince Canada to make the workings of its wheat board more transparent. Testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, the president of the Wheat Growers, Mr Madison Angell, complained that Canada currently controlled more than three quarters of the Mexican wheat market, despite the geographical advantage enjoyed by the US. 'The reason for this abnormality,' he said, 'is that the US has been unwilling to match subsidised competition. There is no indication that the Bush administration will go head-to-head against the Canadians in the future if the Nafta is implemented.' All three countries have agreed to move towards domestic support policies that are not trade-distorting. They have agreed to give notice of intent to introduce a subsidy on farm exports to another Nafta country Mr Angell called for price reporting by all exporting countries to a neutral international body and requested US legislation requiring a system of end use certificates specifying the name of the importer and the use to which the grain would be put. This would preclude imported grain being re-exported with the benefit of further subsidisation from the second country. Canada already has an end use certification requirement on US grain. Farm groups opposing the Nafta - and there are several - complain that one of the worst loopholes in the agreement is the permission granted to Mexico to import all or part of its domestic food needs from third countries. They say Mexico would then be free to ship its domestic production to the US duty-free. They are particularly worried about meat. Although US negotiators say American meat exports to Mexico will continue to rise, there is a great deal of worry that agribusinesses will set up cattle ranches, run by cheap labour, in Mexico to undercut US ranchers. Cargill's Excel division - the second largest US meat packer - has already begun to move production to a huge new plant in Saltillo, Mexico, and expects to begin operations soon. The Institute of Agriculture and Trade Policy said Mexico is already developing barter trades of oil for feedgrains from Argentina, in anticipation of greatly expanded cattle feeding operations. Mexico now produces about 20m head of cattle each year and consumes between 18m and 19m, according to the institute. 'Under the Nafta, Mexico can eventually export to the US every single cow it produces and simply import cheap beef from the rainforests regions of Central and South America or highly subsidised beef from Europe to meet its domestic food needs,' it said. The US sugar industry will continue to be protected by a world-wide sugar quota. Any increases in Mexican sugar exports to the US would come at the expense of other producers, such as Caribbean countries. However, Mr Jack Nelson, president of the Rio Grande Valley Sugar Growers Association in Texas, said in the long term the pact 'probably will end up destroying a major part of the domestic sugar industry'. Mexico has agreed to give the US an increased market share for its maize exports, starting with 2.5m tonnes in the first year of the pact; all Mexican protection for maize (as well as for beans, the other Mexican food staple) will end in 15 years. This puts in jeopardy Mexico's 2.74m small maize farmers, most of whom are Indians and peasants eking out living on tiny mountain plots. They may leave their land to seek work in either Mexican factories or in the US as labourers. It is unclear whether or not they will find work in the US, which has put at risk its own fruit and vegetable sector - particularly in Florida. If it cannot compete with Mexican fruit and vegetables, it may no longer need Mexican workers. There are winners and losers in all free trade pacts. The Private Sector Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, appointed by the Bush administration, said the gains were pretty well distributed between the countries. A slightly larger percentage of Mexican products than US products would benefit from the Nafta in the first ten years. However, since Mexico's tariffs were generally much higher, the Mexican reduction would have 'a greater trade liberalising effect'.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Europe's malaise benefits Ontario-Hydro ONTARIO-HYDRO'S CDollars 2bn global bond offering, launched yesterday, benefited from the malaise afflicting most European markets. Dealers reported pent-up demand for high-yielding non-European paper, and the 10-year bonds were quickly sold out. The bonds were priced to yield 68 basis points more than the comparable Canadian government bond. Ontario-Hydro's comparable secondary market bonds are trading at around the same level. By the end of trading, the spread had widened by a basis point or two as a result of a rally in Canadian government bond prices. In the French bond market, Credit National launched two offerings, totalling FFr3.5bn, fungible with outstanding issues maturing in 1994 and 1999. Although political uncertainty over the French referendum on European union continues to inject caution into the market, higher yield levels have started to encourage domestic investors to return. Both deals were priced to offer a yield pick-up over secondary market levels, but bonds were not snapped up. The FFr1.5bn three-year deal was priced to yield 30 basis points above the comparable French government BTAN, a 15 basis point pick-up over the outstanding deal; and the FFr2bn 7-year deal was set to yield 42 basis points over the comparable OAT, 10 basis points up on existing paper. Caisse Nationale des Autoroutes, the French motorway financing agency which had planned to tap the Ecu market prior to its collapse last week, is now likely to switch funding to either the domestic or Euro-French franc bond market, according to bankers. France Telecom, which had also planned to raise funds in Ecu, is not expected to seek alternative funding. In the D-Mark sector, two borrowers took advantage of the firm tone of the market. The Kingdom of Denmark launched a DM500m five-year deal, priced flat to the German bund market, via WestLB, while LKB Baden-Wurttemberg, the German regional bank, launched a DM1bn zero-coupon deal due 2012 via Dresdner Bank. Despite the strong tone in the market, issuance is likely to be limited by the lack of swap opportunities. Club Mediterranee, the leading French holiday village group, is expected to launch a FFr1bn convertible bond issue within the next few days, writes Sara Webb. Club Med was hit by the Gulf war and the recession in some of its home markets last year, at a time when it had just expanded its airline interests. The company swung to a loss of FFr17m (Dollars 3.14m) in the year to October 1991, compared with a profit of FFr395m in the previous year, and investment bankers point out that it is likely to be seen by investors as a recovery stock. 'There's nothing comparable in the market if you want to play the tourism sector, and investors are likely to be interested in converting into the equity given that this is a strong turnaround situation,' said one banker. Credit Lyonnais has been awarded the mandate for lead-manager. The seven-year convertible bond will be split into two tranches - FFr600m for the domestic market and a FFr400m international tranche. The coupon is expected to be set at 6.5 to 6.75 per cent and the conversion premium at 8 to 12 per cent.</p>

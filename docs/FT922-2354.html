			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Business chiefs shed few tears over abolition INDUSTRIAL organisations shed few tears yesterday at the passing of the NEDC, while the reaction from union leaders was generally angry. The response from the Engineering Employers Federation captured the mood of industry. 'This opens the way for an industry-government dialogue on an informal and less rigidly structured basis,' Mr Neil Johnson, director-general, said. Sir John Banham, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said abolition was 'precisely in line' with the CBI's Business Agenda for the 1990s, published last year. 'For many years the NEDC has appeared to be an anachronism that was left over from the corporate state era - thankfully now in the past.' The CBI was pleased that 'any useful work' done by the NEDC's sector working groups - 'little Neddies' - would continue under the Department of Trade and Industry. The Institute of Directors warmly welcomed the abolition of what Dr Ann Robinson, head of the IoD policy unit, called 'a hangover from the days of the corporatist, collectivist system. It was the creation of politicians and special interest groups who thought they knew better than individuals expressing their preferences through the market.' A note of caution was sounded by Mr Ian Deslandes, acting director-general of the Building Employers Confederation. 'Nedo has provided an important forum for discussion for the industry as well as producing some valuable studies to improve standards and efficiency within the industry,' he said. 'We are naturally concerned to see what plans the government has to replace these functions.' The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said it was crucial that industry should be able to meet regularly and discuss issues with the government. Mr Norman Willis, Trades Union Congress general secretary, said there had 'never been a greater need for government, employers and unions to work together to solve both the short-term and long-term problems of the British economy'. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said: 'This is amazing. We are in the depths of recession and the government is going to scrap the one body where government, business and unions can sit down together and listen to each other.'</p>

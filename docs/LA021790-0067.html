			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERTOWN IS SHADOW OF ITS FORMER SELF;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: IT'S A RUDE AWAKENING FOR PLAYERS WITH MAJOR LEAGUE EXPERIENCE  EXPECTING MAJOR LEAGUE TREATMENT.  </P> <P> One of the few men with absolute power to end baseball's lockout fitted his key  into the deadbolt.  </P> <P> "Like I said," remarked the official as he opened the door to the Dodgers'  spring clubhouse. "Empty."  </P> <P> The room didn't look or feel like baseball. It didn't even smell like baseball.  </P> <P> It was crammed with empty lockers -- metal ones lining the walls, wooden ones  scattered and stacked across the middle of the floor. Underneath the clutter  was a pile of long boxes, taped shut so one could only assume they were bats.  Draped across a table were heaps of dark blue towels. This was not a locker  room, but a storage room.  </P> <P> "Strange, isn't it?" asked the official, who wished to remain anonymous. "This  room could belong to anybody."  </P> <P> Try spirits.  </P> <P> "This place is a ghost town," said Dodger minor leaguer Bill Bene, one of 57  prospects who began spring training Friday in the invisible shadows of the  missing 38 major league Dodger players and their five coaches. On this first  scheduled day of workouts at Dodgertown, the lockout of baseball's major  leaguers by the owners became both official and noticeable.  </P> <P> The minor leaguers were scattered among five fields. The buildings were  strangely quiet as they baked in the mid-afternoon sun. Dodgertown Theatre got  into the dispirit of things Friday night by showing "Scrooged."  </P> <P> And the fans said the heck with it. Last year, on the first day of workouts,  observers estimated that more than 500 people crowded the Dodgertown sidewalks  and grassy paths. Friday, the total was closer to 30.  </P> <P> They came not because they wanted to cheer, but because they were curious. They  did not ask for autographs, or try to shake hands. It became apparent most of  them were not sure what they were watching.  </P> <P> This was because, for the first time in recent years, the minor leaguers did  not wear the white major league jerseys with their names on the back. They all  wore minor league blue, with no identification other than a number. It was as  if the Dodgers wanted nobody to forget the lockout, including those players  with major league experience who had been invited here and promised that they  would be treated like major leaguers.  </P> <P> "They were talking about having to rush my big league jersey down from Los  Angeles, and now I get here and everything has changed," pitcher Mike Munoz  said. "Everyone is treated the same, everyone is treated like a minor leaguer,  no matter what. It's different than I thought."  </P> <P> Said Billy Bean, another major league prospect: "They want to make sure  everybody knows this is a minor league camp. It brings all of us back to  earth."  </P> <P> For those minor leaguers who thought they would be receiving pointers and pine  tar from their favorite millionaires, it was an even bigger disappointment.  </P> <P> "This is kind of a drag," said Eric Karros, a former UCLA star scheduled to  start this season at double-A San Antonio. He hit several long batting practice  home runs in front of minor league coaches, then yawned.  </P> <P> "It doesn't seem like we're going at it like last year," he said. "Not the same  excitement. It's like we're just waiting for the big league guys to show up."  </P> <P> So are Dodger officials. While Vice President Fred Claire and Manager Tom  Lasorda have been cleared to attend, they will not arrive until next week. Even  the Dodger major league scouts have been asked to stay away.  </P> <P> "That makes sense," scout Mel Didier said from his Texas home. "What do I scout  when I get there? An empty field?"  </P> <P> Lasorda wasn't taking things so patiently.  </P> <P> "I'm just sitting here waiting and hoping," Lasorda said. "I just want to get  the word that, hey, this thing is over with and we can get started. We've got a  lot of question marks on this team. We have a lot of work to do."  </P> <P> The delay may force Lasorda to carry more than the usual 10 pitchers, simply  because the starters won't be able to pitch as long.  </P> <P> "This will test our bullpen, because the starters really need six weeks of  spring training," Lasorda said. "If they don't get it, they might only be able  to go five or six innings in their first few starts. We'll need more guys down  in the bullpen."  </P> <P> Such a decision would affect the fate of pitchers such as Tim Crews, Mike  Hartley, Pat Perry and Munoz, all of whom could be fighting for the fifth and  final spot in the bullpen.  </P> <P> With Lasorda missing, probably the most noticeable man at camp was not a player  or a coach, but muscular John Skinner, who wears a shirt and tie -- and a  beeper. He was seen peeking around corners and checking fields, with a list of  non-roster players under his arm and a frown on his face. He said he worked for  the commissioners' office, but would offer no further comment.  </P> <P> "Aw, they just sent somebody here to make sure everybody is following the  rules," said Guy Wellman, the minicamp director. "Every camp got one of those  guards. This ain't your usual year."  </P></p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Company property valuations criticised ONE IN 10 companies are providing users of company accounts with property valuations that bear little comparison with market values, a survey by Company Reporting, an Edinburgh-based journal, says. The report adds that only a third of company accounts show signs of recent property revaluations. A total of 62 per cent of companies are continuing to revalue at least some of their properties and half of these have done so within the last three years. The report criticises the accounting standards for tangible assets. It says a strong lobby would prefer to see a return to a historical cost approach because once a business occupied a property it was no longer subject to property market forces. The survey covered 565 company accounts published in the last year. Company Reporting Limited. 68 Dundas Street, Edinburgh, EH3 6QZ.</p>

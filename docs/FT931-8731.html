			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / ANC fails to ratify power sharing plan THE African National Congress yesterday failed to ratify a power-sharing plan agreed in principle last week with the government, damping hopes of rapid progress toward a constitutional settlement in South Africa. ANC officials said the organisation's policy-making national executive committee had decided to defer ratification until its members had been consulted. This could take weeks or months, and delay the planned timetable for transition to democracy, which calls for the first multi-racial elections early next year. Multi-party constitutional talks, due to begin later this month, could open on schedule, but progress will be frustrated unless the ANC gains rapid endorsement of the power-sharing plan from its members at regional level, who tend to be far more radical than the national leadership. If regional leaders reject the the plan, which calls for multi-racial power-sharing until the end of the century, the government had made clear it would consider putting the deal to a national multi-racial referendum, over the heads of the ANC, to try to break the logjam, the officials said. ANC negotiators, who agreed the principles of power-sharing with the government last week, remain confident they will be able to persuade the wider membership to endorse the deal, though yesterday's decision represents an embarrassment for them, and possibly a serious defeat. Hard-line national executive members are understood to have criticised the deal in Tuesday's meeting, even booing members of the organisation's negotiating team. The radicals believe power should be shared with the ruling National Party only during a nine-month period, while a post-apartheid constitution is written, and not for the five-year period agreed in negotiations with the government. The ANC faction which supports the deal hopes endorsement from the regions can be gained within a fortnight, posing no serious obstacle to progress in negotiations. Much will depend on whether the ANC decides to canvass membership opinion exhaustively, or through regional executive structures which can be rapidly sounded out. The executive's failure to ratify the deal shows the ANC's constant dilemma in negotiations: whether to conclude deals secretly and present members with a fait accompli, or try to gain support from the organisation's diverse and fractious membership at every stage. The role of ANC leader Nelson Mandela will be crucial. If he backs a power-sharing deal, it seems unlikely the executive would oppose him.</p>

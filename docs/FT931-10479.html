			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Peter Black rises 27% on back of interest cost cut REDUCED interest costs and improved margins lay behind a 27 per cent advance in interim pre-tax profit at Peter Black Holdings, the personal care and footwear group. The share price rose 14p to close at 180p, its highest level for four years. The pre-tax profit increase from Pounds 4.52m to Pounds 5.73m was struck on flat turnover of Pounds 61.1m (Pounds 60.5m) in the six months to November 28. Nearly two thirds of sales are to Marks and Spencer. Operating profit rose nearly 7 per cent to Pounds 6.15m (Pounds 5.76m). Interest costs were cut from Pounds 1.24m to Pounds 419,000. Mr Stephen Lister, finance director, said internal cash generation had reduced net debt to Pounds 3.6m - gearing of 9 per cent - compared with Pounds 10.5m in November 1991. In the personal care division, like-for-like turnover was flat at Pounds 21m (Pounds 22m) after allowing for a small disposal. Pre-tax profit rose to Pounds 2.65m (Pounds 2m). Mr Gordon Black, joint chairman whose family controls 39 per cent of the equity, said sales of toiletries and gifts were satisfactory, but the cosmetics market remained difficult. Benefits flowed through from the concentration of production on one site instead of two, a move made in late 1991. At English Grains, the own-label business had done better than the brands. The company made about 1.5bn pills a year, with vitamins as the biggest sellers, and capacity was being increased. In footwear and accessories, pre-tax profit grew to Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 1.75m) on turnover of Pounds 33.1m (Pounds 31.8m). Sales rose at Newbold, which makes fashion shoes for M and S and other retailers, and in the import business. At the Keighley footwear and accessories subsidiary, profit improvement came from enhanced efficiency. Distribution - which encompasses contracts for more than 30 companies - and leisure/retail at Hornsea Freeport together increased profits to Pounds 845,000 (Pounds 762,000) on sales of Pounds 7m (Pounds 6.69m). Earnings per share rose to 7.05p (5.56p) and the interim dividend goes up to 0.93p (0.77p). COMMENT Peter Black's revival has been given a fair wind by the resilient M and S, but the management also played its hand well. Signs of this are the financial discipline that has led to debt and stock reduction, rationalised production and expansion of third party distribution. Within the M and S circle Black is serving areas of potential in women's shoes and cosmetics. Outside it, progress continues to be made in sales to other retailers. With profit growth restored on sluggish turnover, a significant increase in demand would have a rapid impact on the bottom line. With profits weighted towards the first half, a full-year figure of Pounds 8.3m (Pounds 6.6m) is forecast, giving a p/e of 17.5. The share price has shot up by nearly three quarters in less than three months and so the bargain days are gone. It remains worth holding.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both banks that commented objected to the relaxation of the prohibition in &sect;612.2150(j) against employees acting as real estate agents or brokers because of a strong potential for creating conflicts of interest, especially for staff appraisers. In addition, one commenter observed that such a relaxation would be inconsistent with the functional independence required by FCA appraisal regulations. Another commenter asserted that the phrase ``for the employee's own account'' is unclear and suggested substituting ``intended for the employee's own or immediate family use.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of the commenters' concerns and assurance that the prohibition is not a particularly burdensome requirement for staff appraisers, the FCA has decided not to adopt the appraiser exception at this time. In addition, the final regulations substitute ``intended for the use of the employee, a member of the employee's family, or a person residing in the employee's household'' for ``for the employee's own account,'' to clarify that the latter term was not intended to permit an employee to act as an agent or broker for commercial purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 612.2155_Employee Reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCC commented that the scope and frequency of reports required by &sect;612.2155 are unwarranted, unduly burdensome, and unduly costly below the senior officer level. The FCC recommended that the FCA distinguish between senior officers and other employees in the reporting requirements. The FCC stated that, in its judgment, reports by non-senior officers when hired and biennially thereafter are fully adequate, especially since employees are required to report covered activities as they occur in the interim. They also recommended that the FCA remove the specific reporting requirements and require institutions to establish reporting procedures to ensure that relationships and activities subject to the regulations are properly disclosed and acted upon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCC commented on proposed paragraph (b)(1) of this section, which requires employees to file an annual statement disclosing the name of any relative or entity controlled by relatives that transact business with the institution or any institution supervised by the institution. The concern raised was that the disclosure is to be based not only on actual knowledge, but also upon reasonable inquiry. This was considered to be unreasonably broad in view of the definition of ``relative,'' because many such relatives may be virtual strangers to the employee in question and it is difficult to know what reasonable inquiry is in any particular case. The FCC also suggested that ``relative'' for purposes of disclosure be limited to immediate family members, as defined in &sect;620.1(e) of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same modifications that were made to the director reporting sections have been made to the employee reporting sections in the final regulations. Part 620 reporting requirements are focused on matters not already within the institution's knowledge and specifically restricted to employees who are subject to disclosure requirements, namely senior officers, as defined in part 620 of this chapter. The final regulations allow the institution to determine employee reporting frequency for matters not required for part 620 disclosures, but the institution must establish reporting requirements sufficient to permit the effective enforcement of the regulations and the standards-of-conduct policy. This will allow institutions to exclude certain individuals or classes of individuals from the reporting requirement based on the functions the employee performs. For instance, positions where there is a substantial degree of supervision and a low level of responsibility may make the reporting requirement unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCC commented that it appears &sect;612.2150(d) prohibits an employee from serving as a director of an entity that transacts business with the employing or supervised institution, while &sect;612.2155(b)(2) requires an employee to report the name and nature of any entity in which the employee has a financial interest or on whose board the employee sits, if the entity transacts business with the employing institution. The final regulations delete the reference to entities on whose board the employee serves in the reporting requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

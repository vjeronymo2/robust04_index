			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD EWING JR; AIDS OUTREACH GROUP CO-FOUNDER  </P> <P> Richard (Rick) Ewing Jr., the last surviving member of the three founders of  Being Alive, an AIDS-support organization devoted to helping those stricken  with the illness, has died in a Los Angeles hospice.  </P> <P> Jeff Knox, a spokesman for the group that tried to keep its members focused on  celebrating life rather than contemplating death, said he died of AIDS  complications Oct. 12. Ewing was 37.  </P> <P> Ron Rose and Scott Barry, the other two founders, died of the illness in April  and May, respectively.  </P> <P> Ewing, an advertising agency copywriter, came to Los Angeles in 1983 from  Texas, where he had been involved in a Houston mayoral campaign.  </P> <P> He was diagnosed in March, 1986, as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome,  and with Rose and Barry that year started a loosely knit association that  successfully reached out to AIDS victims who found themselves isolated from  friends, family and jobs.  </P> <P> The three men taught activism rather than acceptance. As Barry said early in  the organization's formative months, "although our lives may be shorter, they  can still be quality lives and productive."  </P> <P> They held monthly meetings, published a newsletter and set up a speakers  bureau. Candlelight walks and vigils were held to help the public understand  the frustrations and needs of AIDS sufferers while campaigns were launched to  lower the prices of the drugs that were keeping AIDS patients alive.  </P> <P> At his death, Ewing had been working for the AIDS Hospice Foundation.  </P> <P> In July, 1987, Ewing received the Kenneth Schnorr Memorial Award from the AID  for AIDS organization, another support group. Schnorr had been an earlier  victim.  </P> <P> Ewing's survivors include his parents, a sister and brother.  </P></p>

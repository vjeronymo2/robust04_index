			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Futures slip sharply EUROPEAN futures contracts fell back sharply yesterday after the Bundesbank kept its officially posted rates unchanged at its council meeting, writes James Blitz. Dealers in interest rate markets had assumed that the German central bank would yesterday cut 25 basis points off the discount rate, which is at 8.00 per cent. However, it made no alteration to monetary policy, nor did it announce a new fixed rate repo for next week's money market intervention. The March Euromark contract retreated 11 basis points to finish at 91.93. There are no more council meetings between now and the contract's expiry in less than two weeks' time, and the contract is close to converging with the level of three-month D-Mark interest rates, which yesterday were at 8.15 per cent. French franc futures retraced sharply in the wake of the Bundesbank meeting, although they are still trading in the middle of their recent range. The March contract dropped 40 basis points from its opening level to close at 88.31, and the June contract also lost 40 basis points to end at 90.90. French three-month cash rose  5/16 percentage point to 11 7/8 per cent, and the one-month rate was  1/8 firmer at 11 3/4 per cent by the close. Sterling futures also weakened, in spite of recent assurances from UK officials that a reduction in german rates would not have meant an easing of British policy anyway. The March contract dropped 11 basis points from the opening level, finishing at 93.97. Three-month cash was more or less unchanged at 6 1/16 per cent, in spite of difficulties removing a large Pounds 1.55bn shortage. Despite the clear disappointment about yesterday's decision by the Bundesbank, dealers clearly believe that the European exchange rate mechanism will remain intact, tying French rates to Germany's. The futures market is predicting that three-month D-Marks will be at 6.98 per cent in June and that three-month French francs will sell at 9.1 per cent, providing a premium of more than 200 basis points against France. One dealer said that the futures prices would have converged yesterday if the market thought that the ERM would break up because the French wanted to bring short-term rates down.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Reporter's Memorandum" column by Chong Chong-sik, </F> director of the European News Headquarters in Vienna:  "International Atomic Energy Agency's `Limitations'"]    [Text] It took a mere two hours and 15 minutes for the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to refer the North  Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council.    All delegates to the IAEA Board of Governors looked  relieved.    The IAEA dropped the North Korean nuclear issue as the  United  States and other powerful countries thought it would. They had  chosen this approach among many possibilities because the IAEA  governors would easily accept this formula without opposition.    It has been proven that this approach had been correctly  chosen. Hours before the meeting began, it had been speculated  that the meeting would conclude the discussion in a few hours.  The IAEA spokesman frequently came out of the meeting room and  smiled, as if to say that the meeting was progressing well.    When we analyze the entire scene, we realize that the IAEA  does not want to do its duty regarding the North Korean nuclear  issue. The IAEA should be involved in and resolve any nuclear  issue worldwide. This time, however, the IAEA referred the  North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, where  "power" is applied to resolve issues. This, in a sense, is an  act of shirking its duty, which the French delegate severely  criticized.    When the governors cast votes on the IAEA resolution, they  did so after examining if it would be correct for them to refer  the North Korean nuclear issue to the `power' of international  politics, not if North Korea had really rejected nuclear  inspections.    The UN Security Council will decide on the North Korean  nuclear issue based on the interests of various member nations  and the power structure of international politics. Each country  involved, however, expressed its view on this issue at the IAEA  Board of Governors meeting. A majority of governors voted for  the resolution because they agreed they should deal with the  North Korean nuclear issue by mustering the "will of the world"  at the United Nations. Some of the governors abstained after  examining their own interests and nonnuclear concerns.    Five among the 35 governors abstained. This means  one-seventh expressed semiopposition on this issue.    The IAEA stressed that it would absolve North Korea anytime  it receives nuclear inspections. The prevailing opinion,  however, was that no IAEA governor expected that North Korea  would do so.</p>

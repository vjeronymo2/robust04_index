			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics (New in Brief): SNP hits back at Labour on economy THE FIERCE dispute over the economic impact of Scottish independence continued unabated yesterday as nationalist MPs hit back at Labour's claims that a nationalist government would run up a Pounds 7bn deficit in its first year, Ivo Dawnay writes. In a party political broadcast last night, Mrs Margaret Ewing, Scottish National party MP for Moray, said Labour's offer of a devolved Scottish parliament was simply a 'prospectus for continued poverty and economic stagnation'. Her claim reflected widespread anger among nationalists that Labour has adopted 'smear' tactics on the cost of independence. They claim these directly parallel the Tories' allegations that a Labour government would bring in big rises in taxes and spending. Countering the charge, Mrs Ewing said a devolved assembly would have no powers over North Sea oil revenues, set to rise to Pounds 5bn in 1997, and no powers to make Pounds 1.5bn savings by scrapping the Trident nuclear programme. ***** BR COMPENSATION: The government would be reluctant to tolerate increases in the sums paid by British Rail in compensation once the new passengers' charter comes into effect, Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, suggested yesterday. The government had 'no plans to be associated with' any scheme that would involve significant costs, he said. The 'sensible' way of improving service would be to create performance targets which BR would strive to meet. BR paid between Pounds 6m and Pounds 7m in compensation last year, Mr Freeman said. His remarks followed a claim by Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, Labour MP for Workington, that BR would probably have to find Pounds 40m for compensation payments. ***** OIL RIG SAFETY: Early legislation to protect workers on North sea oil rigs who complain about the inadequacy of safety arrangements from victimisation by their employers was demanded from both sides of the Commons last night. Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, promised to consider if the objective could be achieved by amending a private member's bill sponsored by Baroness Turner of Camden, a Labour peer, which is due for second reading in the Lords tomorrow.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Beckenham board defends shares Directors of Beckenham Group, the USM-quoted maker of ductwork systems and specialist distribution, yesterday said they knew of no reason for the recent substantial fall in the share price. The directors said the results for the year to October 1991 would be announced on April 14. Although they showed substantial losses and write-downs, directors said that management figures for the first four months of the current financial year were significantly better than for the second half of 1991. Banking facilities had recently been renewed and the order book was ahead of last year. The shares yesterday rose 2p to 9p.</p>

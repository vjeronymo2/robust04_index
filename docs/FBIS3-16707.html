Filatov told TASS on Thursday that the decision to dismiss  Viktor Cherepkov was adopted after the local prosecutor's office  initiated criminal proceedings against him on charges of  corruption. However, the mayor refused to show up for  interrogations and preferred to barricade himself in his office  and "attracted armed people to his side", he said.    "It looks as if the example of rebels from the `White House'  in Moscow, who provoked bloodshed in the capital last October,  was borrowed by Cherepkov and his supporters", Filatov said,  adding that the sacked mayor tried to "win political dividends"  from the criminal case.    Filatov quoted law enforcement agencies in Vladivostok as  saying that Cherepkov is accused of taking huge bribes.  Prosecutors in Vladivostok said he could not remain the mayor  as the position allowed him to exert pressure on subordinates  forcing them to destroy discrediting documents.    Filatov also quoted Interior Minister Viktor Yerin as  telling  him that "an operation to unblock the mayor's office and avert  disorders" had been carried out in Vladivostok.    Cherepkov left the office by 11.00 hours GMT (21.00 local  time) and Filatov said public order in the city was being  restored.    Konstantin Tolstosheyn was appointed acting mayor.</p>

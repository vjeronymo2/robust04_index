This shows that the Japanese authorities have no elementary  conscience and morality and that they are trying to evade the  blame for the crime, stresses NODONG SINMUN today.    The news analyst says:    The issue of "comfort women for the Army" is a criminal case  against humanity, in which the Japanese imperialists in the  past drafted more than 200,000 Asian and European women, mostly  Koreans, as sex slaves for the Japanese Army by invoking state  power and vpolated and killed them.    The Japanese Government, far from apologizing and  compensating for the shocking crime of human rights violations  without precedent in history, denies the issue itself. Unable  to repress resentment at its shameless behavior, many former  "comfort women" testified to the criminal case.    The Japanese authorities, however, doubt if they are really  former "comfort women" far from feeling remorse of conscience at  the heartrending testimonies of those who made a narrow escape  from death.    Anyone, if he is not an insensible person, will not ourn a  deaf ear to the touching appeal of the surviving "comfort women".    The Japanese authorities, the offender, do not admit the  crimes at which the world is resentful, because they do not  honestly reflect on the seriousness of the crime and do not want  to part with the crime-woven past.    If Japan thinks it can gloss over the past crimes without  atonement, it is a mistake.    The Japanese authorities must frankly admit the pash crimes,  clarify the truth and sincerely apologize and compensate for  them.</p>

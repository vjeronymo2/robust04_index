			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOME FOR WAYWARD GULLS  </P> <P> If it's true that birds of a feather usually flock together, nobody told Russ  and Mildred. These two baby gulls had to be different.  </P> <P> Instead of hatching on a remote island or rugged seaside cliff, as gulls are  wont to do, the gull chicks were born in a cactus planter -- on a private dock,  near crowded Balboa Pier, right outside William and June House's living room.  </P> <P> "This is the first breeding record of the Western gull in Orange County," said  Sylvia Gallagher, a National Audubon Society member for almost 20 years and  director of the Orange County Breeding Bird Atlas.  </P> <P> "The closest they normally breed is on the Channel Islands. I didn't believe it  until I saw them."  </P> <P> The Houses' two-story home on Balboa Peninsula isn't exactly Santa Catalina  Island. But for a mother bird in a pinch, it apparently was good enough.  Chirping contentedly and closely guarded by their parents, the two fluffy  gray-and-white chicks, now about 2 weeks old, seem unruffled by their  waterfront home, with its panoramic view of the sun-drenched bay and fleets of  colorful yachts.  </P> <P> "I thought my claim to fame would be my husband's ear surgery. Not a bird,"  said June House, whose husband is a local ear surgeon.  </P> <P> House didn't know her visiting chicks, which resemble ducklings, were unusual  until one toppled out of the nest and she called the National Audubon Society  for help.  </P> <P> "This woman called me and said a baby sea gull had fallen out of its nest onto  her deck and she wondered what to do," Gallagher said. "I said, 'Hey, it can't  be a sea gull. Gulls don't nest around here.' But she insisted it was. She said  she knew a sea gull when she saw one. She was quite offended. So I decided to  toddle on down there, and she was right. It really was a gull."  </P> <P> The baby gulls are the first to be recorded in Orange County and the first seen  on the Southern California mainland between Point Loma and Point Conception  since 1935, when a pair was spotted in La Jolla, Gallagher said. The Western  gull is the most common sea gull found in Southern California.  </P> <P> "Since this area was settled, they haven't nested here," Gallagher said. "They  are colonial birds, and there isn't room for a colony here."  </P> <P> The gulls' new home is perched on some of the highest-priced real estate in  Southern California. Most people, like the Houses, who have owned their bay  shore retreat for 27 years, would call it their dream home.  </P> <P> But for sea gulls, the first choice of residency is an isolated, rugged  coastline, not jam-packed Balboa, with a backdrop of the towering high-rises of  Newport Center. The peninsula gets so crowded that the summer motto among  residents is "Bike it or boot it, but leave the car at home."  </P> <P> Kimball Garrett, author of a widely used Southern California birding handbook,  said the sea birds usually hatch on the Channel Islands and the remote seaside  cliffs around San Luis Obispo, with some occasionally found nesting near Point  Loma in San Diego County.  </P> <P> "Sea birds have very little defense against mammalian predators, so any bird  that nests on the ground in these heavily populated beach areas won't do very  well," said Garrett, who is ornithology collection manager at the Los Angeles  County Museum of Natural History. "They are normally island nesters."  </P> <P> Perhaps California is becoming so overpopulated with gulls that they are being  crowded out of their usual breeding areas, he said.  </P> <P> "I'm not surprised that there are Western gulls out there looking for overflow  nest sites," Garrett said.  </P> <P> Audubon experts said they don't know why the breeding pair chose the Houses'  planter. But so far, the chicks, already about six inches long, are safe and  healthy.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["M.N."-signed commentary: "Risk"] </F>   [Text] The threats in the nuclear dispute between the  United States and North Korea are indeed terrifying. Kim  Il-song's diplomats have foreboded that sanctions would be  tantamount to a "declaration of war." U.S. Defense Secretary  William Perry has warned that North Korea might feel provoked to  trigger a war: "And we are accepting this risk."    The hazardous venture of the dictator in Pyongyang requires  nerves of steel. All the neighbors of the isolated old Stalinist  are worried that the Americans might not have such nerves.  South Korea, Japan, and China have appealed to the Clinton  administration to keep quiet. The Americans are anxious to  prevent the worldwide spread of nuclear arms, while the Asians  are worried that the confrontation might quickly escalate.    Asian patience will probably solve the Korean crisis rather  than demands for quick punishment. Kim Il-song will be 82 next  week. His bankrupt regime might implode before a test explosion.  The South Koreans are as much afraid of the one as of the  other. This is why they have now called for the return from  threats to dialogue.</p>

Admiral Limberis is the  head of a Greek military delegation which is on an official  visit here at the invitation of General Petrov.    A diplomatic settlement of the Yugocrisis is the most  effective one, Admiral Limberis said. The two countries share  the view that all Balkan countries should refrain from military  intervention in the conflict, such intervention would be against  the interests of the region, he said.    The signing of the programme comes as proof of the excellent  state of Bulgarian-Greek relations in the military area, Admiral  Limberis said after the ceremony. The document opens up new  prospects for broader cooperation, which would be to the mutual  benefit, he added. Now that Bulgaria has signed the Partnership  for Peace plan, there is one more challenge and reason for  cooperation, he said. The programme envisages that joint  exercises will have a new content, including purely peacetime  and rescue operations, the guest said. The expansion of  cooperation will serve the cause of peace, Admiral Limberis  stressed. From this corner of Europe, Bulgaria and Greece are  sending a message for peace dialogue, if the climate created by  them spreads to the other Balkan countries, it would be very  much for the good of the Balkan nations, Admiral Limberis said.    The 1994 joint action plan is fully consistent with previous  documents on friendship and cooperation between Bulgaria and  Greece, as well as with the military agreement signed by the two  Defence Ministers, General Lyuben Petrov said after the signing  of the programme. Military contacts between Bulgaria and Greece  after the fall of the totalitarian regime in this country in  1989 have been regulated by a cooperation agreement between the  two Defence Ministries signed in Athens in 1991. Greece was the  first NATO member with which Bulgaria signed a document on  military cooperation. The new programme is also consistent with  the documents of 1992 and 1993 adding new confidence and  security-building measures to those envisaged in the Vienna  Document of 1992, it is also consistent with NATO's Partnership  for Peace plan, General Petrov said. The programme will  undoubtedly be implemented and will promote security along the  Bulgarian-Greek border, as well as stability in the region as a  whole, General Petrov said.    Work on programmes for cooperation between the Defence  Ministries of Bulgaria and Greece began in 1992, the press  learned from Lieutenant-Colonel Stefanov, head of the  Information and Military Contacts Department of the Office of  the Chief of the Bulgarian General Staff. This is the third  document, it is of a practice-oriented nature. The training of  Bulgarian Air Force pilots in Greece for rescue operations at  sea, which started three years ago, is a priority for Bulgaria.  Contacts in different areas have developed. Military units  have exchanged visits. There is steady cooperation in military  training. Bulgarian experts have been training Greek military  officers and noncommissioned officers to operate the Osa missile  system and BMP-1 armoured personnel carriers handed over by the  army of what was formerly East Germany, said Lieutenant-General  Stefanov.</p>

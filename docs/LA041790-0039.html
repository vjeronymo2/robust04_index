			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KRISHNAS WIN REPRIEVE ON SELLING TEMPLES  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that the Hare Krishna religious sect will  not have to sell temples in San Diego and elsewhere to satisfy a $5-million  judgment involving an Orange County mother and daughter, at least until after  the court considers whether to hear an appeal of the judgment.  </P> <P> The justices' decision upholds a ruling last week by Justice Sandra Day  O'Connor, who had blocked a California Supreme Court justice's order that the  Hare Krishnas must sell some of their assets to pay the award.  </P> <P> An Orange County jury in 1983 had awarded $32.5 million to Marsha George of  Cypress and her daughter, Robin George, in their lawsuit against the Hare  Krishnas. The mother and daughter claimed that the Hare Krishnas had coerced  Robin George into running away from home and joining the sect at age 14, then  hid her from her parents as they searched the country for her.  </P> <P> The trial judge, James A. Jackman, reduced the award to about $10 million, and  the 4th District Court of Appeal further reduced it to $2.9 million plus  interest, which amounts to more than $2 million.  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to meet in early May to decide whether to  hear the Hare Krishnas' appeal of the case.  </P> <P> If the high court does not hear it, the case reverts to Judge Jackman for  administration of the payment to Marsha George and her daughter, whose married  name is Robin Westerkamp. If the court does decide to hear the case, said the  Georges' attorney, Lynde Selden II, it could be "another two years" before the  issue is decided.  </P> <P> A state judge last month ordered that the Krishnas sell enough assets -- which  could include five of its temples, including ones in San Diego and Laguna Beach  -- to pay off the mother and daughter. But the Hare Krishnas argued that the  sale would destroy the sect and amount to an interference in its religious  freedom.  </P></p>

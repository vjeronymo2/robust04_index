			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MOVE BUYS FIRM A LITTLE TIME FROM ITS CREDITORS;  </P> <P> AMERICAN TOXXIC SELLS BCL TO BOLSTER CASH POSITION  </P> <P> American Toxxic Control Inc., a troubled Huntington Beach maker of equipment  for cleaning up hazardous waste, said Monday that it had agreed to sell its BCL  Associates Inc. unit.  </P> <P> The buyer is Earth Technology Corp., a publicly held environmental engineering  consultant in Long Beach.  </P> <P> The terms were not disclosed. American Toxxic said it was selling BCL -- a  Huntington Beach environmental consulting and testing concern -- because  American Toxxic is short of cash. Also, it is still in danger of defaulting on  a $4-million debt, the company said.  </P> <P> The sale of BCL -- expected to close by the end of the month -- bought American  Toxxic a little more time from its creditors, Merrill Lynch Business Capital  Inc. and a small San Francisco investment fund, BBU Mezzanine Fund. The two  have now extended their deadline to May 25 for declaring American Toxxic in  default, the company said Monday.  </P> <P> Earth Technology, meanwhile, employs 350 and had earnings of $1.2 million last  year on revenue of $40.8 million.  </P></p>

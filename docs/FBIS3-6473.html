The news analyst says:    If the puppets are interested in North-South dialogue and a  peaceful settlement of the reunification question, they must  refrain from war exercises against the dialogue partner.    Their continued play with fire, which is incompatible with  dialogue, cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate act to  obstruct the working-level contact at Panmunjom and frustrate  the exchange of special envoys. This is proved by the South  Korean rulers' wrong dialogue stance toward the working-level  contact.    By making the exchange abortive, they intend to put a spoke  in the wheel of DPRK-U.S. talks, hinder the settlement of the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and slay fellow countrymen  with the help of foreign sword.    The double-faced acts of the "civilian"-veiled warmaniacs,  who sharpen the sword against fellow countrymen behind the scene  of dialogue for the exchange of special envoys, are bound to  face criticism at home and abroad.    The nation will never pardon the "civilian"-veiled  warmaniacs  who stick to confrontation at a time when the entire fellow  countrymen are all out to achieve reunification in the 1990s  through the unity of the nation.</p>

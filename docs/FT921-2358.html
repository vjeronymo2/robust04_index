			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Party disks - Ballot Box All national newspapers, are entirely electronic and all articles are thus written and edited on computer terminals  - which ought to make it easy to print the party manifestos. Not so: it is the glossiness that causes the strain. The computers don't like it. This year, unasked, one party supplied us with a floppy computer disk with the contents of its manifesto. Another gave us a disk, but charged Pounds 50. The third tried to help but failed to provide a disk until after the first edition had gone. For the record, it was the Liberals who supplied the disk on time and for nothing. Labour was also efficient, but made the charge. It was the Tories who couldn't keep up, but at least they have not demanded a fee. Not perhaps the usual party images.</p>

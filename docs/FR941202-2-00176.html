			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3.4.6&blank;Assessment Team Coordination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When the identity of the assessment team is known, the lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessor should contact each person and begin planning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct of the assessment. As early as possible the lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessor should:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Coordinate travel plans, including the hotel and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation arrangements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Notify each team member of the dates of the assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and pre-assessment team meeting;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Ensure that each team member has been briefed on specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for the assessment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Define the time allotted for the assessment. The lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessor should be careful not to underestimate the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed to conduct the assessment; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Confirm for those individuals who will be conducting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records review, their familiarity with the records to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed. Each member of the assessment team should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aware of their responsibilities during the assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The lead assessor should also arrange to provide copies of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable NELAP/State standard operating procedures (SOPs) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> team members who do not already possess these documents. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the lead assessor may need to assure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment team is aware of proper procedures for receipt and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handling of confidential business information (CBI). The lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessor should determine the level of experience of each team  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> member in conducting laboratory evaluations or records reviews  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under NELAP/State requirements. The lead assessor may need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to guide less experienced team members, both prior to and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the assessment as well as with report preparation. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lead assessor should assemble the team just prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment to attend to last minute details.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3.4.7&blank;Gathering Assessment Documents and Equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Besides preparing the assessment plan and reviewing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrediting body records and laboratory submissions prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducting the assessment, the lead assessor should gather and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepare the necessary documents and equipment to be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the assessment. No single list of documents and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment can be appropriate for all assessments. The lead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessor's experience in the field and information obtained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during pre-assessment planning should assist in preparing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lists tailored to specific assessment sites and needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific needs will be determined by the requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment, the availability of equipment, conditions at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory, NELAP/State policies, and whether advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification of an assessment is given.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3.4.7.1&blank;Types of Documents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Documents necessary for the assessment should be prepared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the assessment, whenever possible. The lead assessor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should obtain copies of the required assessment forms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several spare copies of each form should always be carried.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessments may require: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Notice of assessment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Assessment confidentiality notice;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Conflict of interest form;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Assessor credentials;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Assessment assignment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Assessment notification letter;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Attendance sheet, opening and closing conference;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _assessment appraisal form. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the lead assessor should be certain to take the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following documents and materials on an assessment:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

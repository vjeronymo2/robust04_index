			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Racal A visitor from Mars might wonder what was the point of the Racal/Chubb demerger. Given that Racal expects both the separated companies to trade on a similar rating, the deal will not unleash the value of a wildly undervalued asset. Indeed, the inevitable duplication of some head office functions means that separation may not release any value at all. It may have been that when the plan was originally hatched Chubb's assets were undervalued, but Racal shares have risen since then, reflecting better management of Chubb and the prospects for Racal's recovery. The deal, and its associated costs, is in the price. But since the company is set on its course, investors must assess the companies separately. Both have managed improvements in cash flow through control of working capital, but there are worries about how hard Racal can squeeze, and the stronger company is clearly Chubb. In the longer term, Racal Electronics' dependence on defence and low-margin communications business is also likely to depress its rating. Chubb may no longer be the target for cheap acquisition specialists that it was, but it is still attractive. Investors must be tempted to take the Chubb share and run.</p>

"The Bophuthatswana cabinet decided it was opposed to  registering for the South African elections in April. The  cabinet also decided the matter should be addressed by a full  sitting of the Bophuthatswana Parliament. A special full  parliamentary sitting has been called for Tuesday, March 15,"  spokesman Alwyn Viljoen said.    The decision was taken at a special cabinet meeting on  Monday  morning in the midst of a civil service strike that is  threatening to cripple the homeland. President Lucas Mangope  went from the meeting to a government building where he was due  to address striking teachers and health workers.    Earlier he told strikers that if they wanted to continue  their strike they should go home. Only government workers at  management level had remained at their posts by Monday  lunchtime, a government source said. The strikers are demanding  that their pensions be paid out and that Bophuthatswana be  re-incorporated into South Africa.    Bophuthatswana's decision does not necessarily disqualify  its  ruling Christian Democratic Party from participating in the  elections. Both government and African National Congress  President Nelson Mandela have indicated the deadline for  registration could be shifted. However, the Independent  Electoral Commission has said practical considerations made late  registrations difficult.    Bophuthatswana arrived at its decision as its Freedom  Alliance partners -- the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Afrikaner  Volksfront [National Front] -- began meeting in Pretoria to  devise the alliance's approach to international mediation of  South Africa's constitutional dispute.</p>

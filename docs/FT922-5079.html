			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Colombia gives asylum to Peru's ex-president THE Colombian government said yesterday that it had granted political asylum to the former Peruvian president, Mr Alan Garca, who had taken refuge in its ambassador's residence in Lima. Mr Garca, president from 1985 to 1990, has been a fugitive since Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori dissolved Congress and suspended the judiciary on April 5. Mr Garca's party, the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (Apra), said it had instructed him to leave the country because his life was in danger. He entered the Colombian embassy on Sunday evening. Last week Mr Garca made a surprise appearance in one of Lima's shanty towns and was being seen as the main focus of opposition to Mr Fujimori. Colombian radio said Mr Garca was to be flown to Colombia last night in a private plane. Amnesty International, the human rights group, said yesterday that human rights violations had continued in Peru since President Fujimori took power nearly two years ago, writes Stephen Fidler, Latin America Editor. It expressed concern about 'widespread 'disappearances' and extra-judicial executions by the security forces'.</p>

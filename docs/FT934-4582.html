			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Cocaine trafficker Escobar shot dead Pablo Escobar, chief of the Medelln drug cartel, and probably the most wanted man in the world, was killed by a special task force yesterday afternoon in Medelln, Colombia. The task force surrounded the house where he was hiding in a residential area of the city, bodyguards opened fire on the police and Escobar was shot as he tried to escape over a roof. Two of Escobar's men were apparently killed with him. General Octavio Vargas, commander of the task force, said the house had been located on the basis of intelligence. The death of Escobar, 44, is very important for President Cesar Gaviria, not just because Escobar was responsible for smuggling thousands of tonnes of cocaine and killing hundreds of people, but because his escape from jail in July 1992 left the government looking incompetent, foolish and corruptible. The US embassy in Bogota immediately issued a communique congratulating the Gaviria government on its success. Although Pablo Escobar's trafficking organisation had virtually collapsed as his henchmen were killed or captured over the past 16 months, he continued to hold Colombia in thrall. His terrorist tactics, with massive car bombs, kidnappings and selective political assassinations, made people feel that he, rather than the government, was in control of the country. Escobar started as a small-time thief and gunman and began to build up the cocaine trafficking business in the late 1970s. By the mid-1980s the Medelln cartel had become a powerful trafficking and crime organisation and Escobar had amassed one of the biggest fortunes in the world. In 1991 he surrendered to the authorities after bargaining for easy terms and ensuring that he would be guarded by his own men. When he escaped from jail a year later it was clear that he had been living in luxury and running his business from the prison. Since then he had been on the run. The government is hailing this as a big victory in the fight against drug-trafficking. However, the Cali groups have already taken over most of the cocaine traffic.</p>

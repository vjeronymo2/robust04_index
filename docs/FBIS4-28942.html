			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["National Conference Must Be Convened" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The present situation  makes it incumbent upon our compatriots to come out without  hesitation to the plaza of the national conference which will  open a new chapter of national reconciliation and unity,  irrespective of residence and job, if they to not want to fall a  victim to big powers but really want the peace and peaceful  reunification of the country, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed  article today.    The great unity of the nation is the best way out for all  the fellow countrymen to remove the danger of a nuclear war  facing the nation, defend the peace of the country and open a  phase of turnround for its independent and peaceful  reunification, the paper notes, and goes on:    All the fellow countrymen in the North and the South and  overseas fully support the convocation of a national conference  which will seek a short cut to reunification in the 90s by  promoting the great unity of the nation and pooling the will and  wisdom of the nation, surpassing differences in ideology, idea  and political view.    But the Kim Yong-sam group, which dislikes the peace and  peaceful reunification of the country, is desperately opposing  our proposal for the convocation of a national conference  unreasonably branding it as "united front tactics" and is  cracking down with the bayonet upon the South Korean students,  political parties and organisations and individual figures  aspiring after the opening of the national conference.    The Kim Yong-sam group answered our proposal with its role  of  the shockbrigade in the "nuclear" row of the outside forces  against the northern half of Korea, clamouring for "a tough  response," "an international cooperation system" and "sanctions  against the North."    This reveals the vicious plot to block the great unity of  the  nation by frustrating the convocation of the national conference  at any cost and ignite a nuclear war against the North together  with outside forces. This is an unpardonable criminal act which  can be done only by such rare traitors and warmaniacs as the Kim  Yong-sam group which takes no notice of the country and the  nation, peace and peaceful reunification.    The Kim Yong-sam clique is trying to block the convocation  of  the national conference for national reconciliation and unity  with sword-brandishing and war moves, but in vain.    Unshakable is the will of the 70 million fellow countrymen  to  convene the national conference and tide over the present  difficulties and open the road of the country's peace and  reunification.</p>

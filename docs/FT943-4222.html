			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hotels help Brierley to post record profit Improved occupancy rates in London for the Mount Charlotte Thistle Hotels helped Brierley Investments achieve a 58 per cent rise in profits to a record NZDollars 430m (USDollars 259m) for the year to June 30, Mr Bob Matthew, chairman, said yesterday. Provincial hotel performances were also better, leading Brierley Investments  -which owns 70 per cent of Mount Charlotte - to 'confidently expect substantial improvements in Mount Charlotte's profitability'. He said most New Zealand and Australian subsidiaries and associate companies performed well during the year, with strong profit contributions from Air New Zealand, Australian Consolidated Investments, textile group LWR Industries, Sealord Products, Union Shipping and the Skellerup Group. Subsidiary and associate company profit contributions were up 17 per cent to NZDollars 318m from NZDollars 273m, and investment company contributions rose 43 per cent to NZDollars 283m from NZDollars 197m. Earnings before parent funding costs and overheads were up 23 per cent to NZDollars 565m.</p>

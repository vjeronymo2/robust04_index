			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER FUN IS OVER FOR THE FRENCH -- THE BICYCLE BANDIT IS CAUGHT  </P> <P> They finally caught the bicycling bank robber of the Loire Valley last week  after his exploits -- nine successful bank robberies before he was nabbed on a  tenth attempt -- had entertained France for more than six months.  </P> <P> Even the motive for his crimes satisfied the tradition of French crime. No need  to cherchez la femme. Soon after his capture during a heist at a bank in the  town of Les Herbiers in the Vendee region, Jean-Jacques Guillon, 28, who once  used the name of a popular cheese as his alias, reportedly told police he had  done it all for love.  </P> <P> "I'm sure it was the girl," said a woman who identified herself as Guillon's  stepmother at the small family farm near Chinon, a wine-growing town in the  Loire Valley. "He started seeing her about two years ago. She lived about 70  kilometers (42 miles) away. They were planning to live together."  </P> <P> Another report in one of the regional newspapers suggested that the tall,  sturdy Guillon (6-feet-3, 230 pounds) -- described by his rugby coach at the  Chinon Sporting Club as a "gentle giant" -- may have been trying to raise money  to save his father's struggling farm.  </P> <P> Either way, it was a good tale for the French press. Beginning in May,  reporters for the newspaper Nouvelle Republique du Centre-Ouest began tracking  the bicycling bank robber's holdups. One reporter dubbed him the "ecologist  armed robber" because he did not waste any fossil fuels while committing his  crimes.  </P> <P> Another journalist, mimicking the breathless sports jargon used to describe the  annual Tour de France bicycle race, described the series of robberies as  different stages of a rigorous athletic test:  </P> <P> "He set a tortuous pace, but at each staging point the record fell. Twenty  thousand francs here; 50,000 francs there. But the Yellow Jersey (the shirt  worn by the leading rider in the Tour de France race) finally went to a little  savings and loan in the town of Melle: 430,000 francs."  </P> <P> "I've never seen anything like it," the chief investigator on the case said  admiringly. "One job and he gets 430,000 francs ($70,000) -- something usually  achieved by professional gangsters."  </P> <P> In each robbery, the system was the same. The target was a small bank or  savings institution in a small town with streets and alleys too narrow for  automobiles to give chase.  </P> <P> Always dressed in a blue jacket and a blue ski-cap and carrying a blue plastic  bag -- hence, one of his nicknames, Le Grand Bleu, or the Big Blue -- the  robber would enter the bank and wait patiently in line for his turn at the  teller window.  </P> <P> Sometimes he would inquire about opening an account, giving the pseudonym  Gerard Roblochon. Roblochon is a famous French cheese, but, as one writer  pointed out haughtily, not a blue cheese -- which would have fit in better with  his color scheme.  </P> <P> Finally, he would pull out a revolver and demand all the money in the till.  Money stuffed in his blue bag, he would back out of the bank and mount his  faithful bike, not a fancy multigear racing machine but a clunky common vehicle  with a bell.  </P> <P> Pedaling furiously, he would beat his retreat on a narrow street, load the bike  into his car, which bore phony license plates, and drive away.  </P> <P> Police had nary a clue to his identity except for a blurred photograph taken by  a hidden camera at one of his latest targets. Coincidentally, police had been  in Les Herbiers a few days before, showing the photo to tellers who recognized  Le Grand Bleu almost as soon as he crossed the threshold.  </P> <P> Alerted by the tellers, two local police officers arrived but required the help  of two passing firefighters to disarm the holdup man. On Thursday, Guillon was  taken before a magistrate in La Roche-sur-Yon for a preliminary hearing.  </P> <P> The chronicled exploits of the bicycle bank robber have provided a summer of  diversion for the vacationing French. At the end, they were beginning to be  compared to those of the 19th-Century literary character Rocambole, a rogue and  a daring thief created by author Pierre Ponson du Terrail.  </P></p>

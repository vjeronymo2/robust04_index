"We feel the machines are a step to  providing a convenient location for our customers to perform banking  transactions," said Jack J. Brown, Stater Bros.' chairman, president and chief  executive.  </P> <P> According to Stater Bros., the ATMs are able to handle transactions for more  than 95% of all bank cards held by consumers in Southern California.  </P> <P> The six-month pilot program is expected to begin by December. In addition to  the Costa Mesa store, the test will be at stores in Grand Terrace, Rancho  California, Pomona and Fontana.  </P> <P> Stater Bros. has 101 stores, 15 of them in Orange County.  </P></p>

The Russian Federal Assembly has not ratified the  document yet.    The consular convention is based on the principles of the  Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 24 April 1963. It is  a bilateral agreement that supplements the principles of this  multilateral international legal act. The convention determines  the procedure for the establishment of consular offices and  appointment of consular officials; consular functions, benefits  for consular officials and their rights and duties as to the  protection of their citizens' interests.    According to Natalya Zarudna, the ratification of the  convention will promote the establishment and development of  Ukrainian-Russian consular relations, as well as the protection  of rights and interests of Ukrainian and Russian citizens.  Ukraine has already signed such conventions with China,  Romania, Hungary, Poland, and Kazakhstan.</p>

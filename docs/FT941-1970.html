			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Arts: The Case of Rebellious Susan - Theatre What a marvellous place the theatre must have been at the beginning of the present century: Ibsen, Strindberg, Chekhov, Wilde, Shaw, Granville-Barker bursting out all over. And so modern. Here were grown-up plays for grown-up people: articulate and educated writers providing for an equally educated audience. No doubt it was very middle class and possibly slightly earnest, but it was theatre. In Richmond the tradition continues. Even the revival of an almost forgotten play - The Case of Rebellious Susan by Henry Arthur Jones - has the house captivated almost throughout. The piece has its faults. First performed at the Criterion in 1894, the text was tampered with by the actor-director Charles Wyndham on the grounds that the original might have been too shocking. In the version that has come down to us, it is not quite clear whether Susan has committed adultery in Cairo in order to show that what a husband can do a wife can do too. Her disaffection may be all an elaborate pretence. There are other ambiguities. Not all the motivations are intelligible. Who was the only love of the divorce lawyer, Sir Richard Kato QC? Moreover, the play ends on a note of sentimentality not wholly in line with what has gone before. Perhaps Susan should have stuck to her rebellion. Nevertheless, she puts up a good fight. So do some of the other women. Kato has a young ward called Elaine Shrimpton. Her oratory leads to the storming of the Clapham Post Office, fully reported in The Times. Admiral Darby, one of the more unfaithful of the species, has a very forgiving wife, significantly called Victoria. The house where the revolutionary Elaine lives in south London is in Gladstone Road. Clapham indeed comes in for a good deal of stick as being a boring, conventional London suburb. This goes down extraordinarily well in front of a Richmond audience. One cavil. If you are going to revive a play like this, you must pay every attention to detail. The set in the lovely, tiny Orange Tree theatre brings it off. Yet some of the costumes do not quite fit. I cannot imagine that Sir Richard Kato would wear a morning coat that looks as if it has been picked up from Oxfam. Kirky, the footman, also looks a bit scruffy. For the rest, however, this is a scintillating production directed by Auriol Smith. Is it a comedy or a tragedy? In the course of the play Jones seeks to answer the question himself: 'My comedy isn't a comedy at all. It's a tragedy dressed up as a comedy.' That is about right. Sarah-Jane Fenton as Susan becomes steadily more attractive as the piece goes on. Orange Tree, Richmond. (081) 940 3633</p>

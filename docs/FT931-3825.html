			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Books: Much Whiggery pokery - JH Plumb admires the political skills of a remarkable man DUNCANNON: REFORMER AND RECONCILER 1782-1847 by Dorothy Howell-Thomas Michael Russell Pounds 19.95, 400 pages THIS IS a very pleasant, quiet book. It does not flash or thunder or try to impose an ideologicai interpretation or go in for psychoanalytical theory. In the hands of a professional scholar, it would probably have been three times as long, burdened with five times as many footnotes and dragged behind it a bibliography of 20 pages. The result would have been less readable and probably less wise. Sometimes the book skirts on thin ice when the author ventures into European problems or Britain's economic development, but the ice never cracks. Apart from a few weaknesses, it is an excellent book, in its quiet way seductively readable and illuminating. Reading it is like eating a dish of well-buttered brown bread, very nourishing, very sustaining, and very rare these days. It is about John Ponsonby, who became Viscount Duncannon as a schoolboy and succeeded as 4th Earl of Bessbrough a few years before he died in 1847. The old Ponsonby estates were in Ireland, near Kilkenny, but the family rarely went there for his mother was sister to Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, (and a Spencer) and preferred their house at Roehampton. Indeed, Duncannon was born into a very large whig network which took Charles James Fox as its hero and leader: a part, therefore, of that vast whig cousinage based principally on London but which also spent a lot of time visiting each other. The core of his circle were the Cavendishs, Spencers, Fitzwilliams, Lambtons, Howards and Lambs. Duncannon was related to most of them. It was a dissolute society enjoying the kind of sexual freedom which people enjoy today but with its own taboos (you did not sleep with marriageable girls of good family) and shibboleths (male infidelities were mere 'scrapes' and openly gossiped about). The tone was set by the Devonshires: the Duke brought up his bastards in the same nursery as his legitimate children. His mistress, Lady Elizabeth Foster, was a close and loving friend of his wife. Their more dangerous obsessions were drink and gambling - in the case of Fox and the Duchess of Devonshire almost ruinously so. Duncannon's mother, whose lover, Granville Leveson-Gower, was 12 years younger than herself, bore him two girls but they were brought up apart from the family. She was almost as extravagant as her sister, Georgiana. To put it mildly, the whig cousinage was randy, extravagant, alcoholic and arrogant. One of the fascinations of this book is to see how the scions of this group adjusted to the vast political and social crises which ravaged Britain between 1810-50. Their world was toppling and changing as fast as our own has done this last few years. Duncannon, in his somewhat subfusc yet debonair manner, was remarkably effective in guiding Britain through those tempestuous times. He made three great contributions to British political and social life. He strengthened the office of Chief Whip; cleaned up the morass of antiquated administration that was responsible for public and Royal buildings; and kept Britain afloat and almost at peace in Ireland during the turmoil caused by the Union. His skills were a capacity for business, for the quick mastery of a complex brief which is the hallmark of 'a man of business' in politics. As Chief Whip he kept the whig opposition coherent during the long premiership of Lord Liverpool, creating an umbrella that sheltered and kept together old-fashioned whigs like Fitzwilliam and red-hot radicals like Alderman Wood. His attention to detail was prodigious and he obviously possessed the most important yet elusive of political qualities - charm. He was always relaxed, cool and courteous, yet rock-like in basic principles derived from Fox. This biography is easy and enjoyable to read, not profound in itself but driving one to brood on the complexities of politics and the art of governing in a changing world where the future was hard to forecast. Some of our cabinet could read it with advantage. Dorothy Howell-Thomas is to be congratulated for resurrecting a remarkable man not only important in his day but significant to posterity.</p>

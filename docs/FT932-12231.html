			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Arts: Today's Television Would you rather know the 'true story' of life in suburban Australia or the 'true story' of a New York paparazzo? Sylvania Waters is telling us the true story of what happens when you put a documentary film crew into a family home, an idea which Paul Watson tried with the Wilkins in Reading 20 years ago. He pinched the idea from 'An American Family', a US series made in 1972. Now he has another go with the Baker-Donaher family in Sydney. As with some members, at least, of the Wilkins family, some of the Australian family also regret that they ever agreed. In today's episode it is Christmas and Laurie and Noeline bickering as usual. Pregnant Dione has broken her foot and Michael is away in Europe playing rugby (9.35 BBC1). 'Blast 'Em]' is a 90-minute documentary in Channel 4's True Stories slot which follows Victor Malafronte, a young American photographer who earns a living snatching shots of 'celebrities' such as Madonna, Michael J. Fox and John Kennedy Jr. One big exclusive can set you up for life, so Malafronte does not pull his punches.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu has revealed that the  South-North dialogue is not a precondition for the third round  of U.S.-DPRK talks. He clearly stated that if North Korea  accepts the additional International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  inspection, the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks will begin.    In a news conference with foreign reporters at the Press  Center on 20 April, Foreign Minister Han said that South-North  dialogue is very important for a comprehensive and complete  resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue, but the  South-North dialogue can be a long-term precondition to solve it.    Minister Han also said that what is important under the  current situation is for North Korea to accept the IAEA's  inspection so that it can prove that it is not developing  nuclear weapons. In addition, he stated that if North Korea  shows the will to comply with the UN Security Council's  president statement, the U.S.-DPRK contact can resume.</p>

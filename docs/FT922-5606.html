			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Judge orders acquittal of banker A FORMER UK head of principal trading and sales with Banque Paribas was cleared yesterday on the directions of an Old Bailey judge of involvement in an alleged insider dealing network. Mr Keith Tondeur had denied a charge of unlawfully dealing in the shares of Pleasurama, the leisure group, in advance of an announcement of a bid for the company by Mecca Leisure in 1988. The charge was one of seven against Mr Tondeur and his four co-defendants relating to Pleasurama on which Judge Bruce Laughland directed the jury to acquit. The remaining defendants still face between them eight charges under the 1985 Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act relating to takeover bids in 1988 by Hawthorn Leslie Group, the USM-quoted cellular phone company, for ECT Cellular and London Car Telephones, and by Goodman Fielder Wattie, an Australian company, for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the UK foods group. Mr Tondeur had been accused of dealing on the basis of unpublished price-sensitive information he obtained from a co-defendant, Miss Catherine Rowlands, while she worked in the corporate finance department at Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank that acted for Mecca in the bid for Pleasurama. The judge said Miss Rowlands had received the information from a colleague who had heard it from another person in Samuel Montagu. None of the defendants had known the identity or position of the original source of the information, or that the person was an 'insider'. There was therefore no evidence on an essential ingredient of the Pleasurama charges under the act, the judge said. Miss Rowlands was acquitted of two charges of unlawfully communicating unpublished price-sensitive information but still faces one similar charge. Mr David Gray, formerly a stockbroker with Morgan Grenfell Securities, was acquitted on one charge of communicating information and one of counselling or procuring another person to deal. He still faces other charges. Mr William Liggins, a former Lazards fund manager, was acquitted on one of two dealing charges. Mr Mark Riding, former fund manager with the Co-operative Insurance Society in Manchester, was acquitted on one of three dealing charges. The trial continues today.</p>

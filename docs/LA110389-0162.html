			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Herald Examiner -- A Times story Thursday on the legacy of the Los Angeles  Herald Examiner incorrectly reported that a Herald editor sang the lyrics from  the 1977 tune "Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue?" to Louella Parsons after the  Hollywood columnist once mixed up the eye color of an actress. The lyrics  actually came from the 1925 song "Brown Eyes -- Why Are You Blue?"  </P></p>

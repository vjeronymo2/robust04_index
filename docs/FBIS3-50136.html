			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Martin Leka on a Democratic Alliance news </F> conference held in Tirana on 17 January: "Albania Cannot Become  Palermo"]    [Text] At 1300 on 17 January the Democratic Alliance [AD]  held a news conference in one of the halls of the Palace of  Congresses. Blendi Fevziu opened the news conference and read a  press communique from the party presidency.    The communique stated that the murder of Gjovalin Cekini on  14 January marked the tragic culmination of the state's campaign  to obstruct by any means the party's political activity.  Gjovalin Cekini was a participant in the first anticommunist  demonstrations in Albania.    The murder of this AD activist was political, the communique  continued, describing the murder and citing evidence relating to  it.    One of the culprits in the murder, Selami Cela, emerged from  a Mercedes without license plates a few minutes before the end  of the Shkoder meeting and spoke to a person who was in the car  of Ali Kazazi, the Shkoder Democratic Party [PD] chairman.    A second person involved in the murder was one of the many  PD  provocateurs in the hall where the AD's meeting took place.  Gjovalin Cekini was one of the leading activists of the AD  during the meeting, helping to defuse the tensions caused by the  PD provocateurs. Selami Cela was foremost among the  provocateurs facing the people who emerged from the meeting and  shouted "Long live Sali Berisha: There is only the PD in  Shkoder."    Gjovalin Cekini and his brother Pal tried to prevent Selami  Cela from using his weapon.    The communique went on to state that this murder marked an  extreme escalation of the war on the AD and was motivated by the  fact that some state officials and members of the ruling party  have embarked on the road of crime to fulfill and protect their  political and economic interests. For this purpose, they are  organizing themselves with the help of Mafia-style structures  and activities involving high level officials of the Albanian  state, members of the National Intelligence Service, local  government officials, professional criminals, traffickers in oil  and weapons, violators of the UN embargo against the former  Yugoslavia, and members of the Privatization Board or those who  have profited or expect to profit illegally from the board. All  these control and have taken hostage Shkoder's political and  economic life, joined in a criminal association.    As for the statement of the Ministry of Public Order  broadcast on Albanian Television yesterday, the communique  declared that this statement associated itself with the crime  and made political judgments that are in flagrant contravention  of the status of a depoliticized television station. This  statement differed from that issued earlier by stressing the  word "citizen" instead of the word "murderer" used before.    The communique called on the PD, the government, and the  president to identify and condemn the culprits fairly and fast,  and to identify, isolate, and condemn the mafia-style criminal  elements, so that crime and violence may not become a  characteristic of the first opposition party in Albania, which  rose up against crime and violence.    In conclusion, the communique stated that the AD appeals to  the governments of European countries and the United States, the  Council of Europe, the CSCE, and the Helsinki Community, asking  them to use their authority to intervene to ensure that the  tragic murder in Shkoder should not become a precedent for a  state of violence and terror.    Messrs. Neritan Ceka and Arben Imami then replied to the  questions of the journalists present.    The questions mainly concerned the recent incident in  Shkoder, but there were also others off the subject, to which  the speakers did not reply.    Asked by KOHA JONE about the recent incident's similarity  to the events of 2 April [1991] in Shkoder, Neritan Ceka replied  that these two events bore a similarity. This shows the  similarity between the regimes, he said, evident in the  statement of the Public Order Ministry and its collaboration  with the procurator. He went on to say that there are further  similarities, because both events made use of armed irregulars  [bashibozuko] because the politicians threw stones and then  covered their tracks, and because the Public Order Ministry  officials and those of the Procurator's Office have learned  nothing from the fate of their colleagues of 2 April. There are  similarities, because both events have their origins in hatred,  with the difference that in the first case this hatred was  ideological and in the second economic. Both cases involve a  collaboration between the politics and crime. Only a  dictatorship can be built on the basis of a mafia and of crime.  If the Albanians live with this kind of collaboration for two  years, there will then be no elections.    One question was what will the AD's strategy be if the  Public  Order Ministry persists in the same standpoint. Ceka replied  that we only have one strategy, which is democracy.    Answering a question from RlLlNDJA DEMOKRATlKE's journalist,  who said that this event could not favor the PD, Mr. Imami  replied that he was not sure to whose favor it went, but it is  the third occasion in Shkoder on which there has been an attempt  to sow terror. The first was the incident with the Socialists;  the second involved Azem Hajdari and the New Political  Initiative, and the third was this case involving ourselves,  which ended with a tragic murder. He stressed that it was the  same group attempting to sow terror. In every district, we have  encountered PD members who have turned on us with such methods.  Imami went on to mention an incident in Durres, in which a  person's two trucks had been held by the customs, and the PD's  people had asked this person to go to the AD's meeting and shout  against the AD, so that his trucks would be released. You, Mr.  Paloka, Imami continued, contributed your piece in yesterday's  article in which you said that one of the murderers was in the  meeting hall. I can add that they later met together in the  cafe of the main hotel. Asked if the incident was connected  with the embargo, Imami said that the AD was not the first to  denounce the embargo, and we are not talking about 30-40 liters,  about about a pipe linking the two banks of the Buna and a truck  with a big "Marshallah" plate that plies round Shkoder. We  accuse people who are vested with power, perhaps with  connections to the very summit of power, of breaking the embargo.    In connection with the pro-Serb declaration cited by the  Public Order Ministry statement, Imami stated that this was an  utter lie. The AD went to Shkoder to start the political new  year on 14 January, the anniversary of the first anticommunist  demonstration in Albania, a large number of whose participants  are now AD members. Gjovalin Cekini was one of the participants  in this demonstration, and one of the missionaries of the  Catholic church and of religious belief. We went to Shkoder in  order to put forward our ideas and our program. We were asked,  "Why did you go to Belgrade?" We explained our platform and  standpoint on this matter, our standpoint on Kosova, etc. As  for the statement that we have neither killed Serbs, nor have  they killed us, this is simply a lie perpetrated by the police  authorities. Imami underlined that RILINDJA of 16 January on  page 11 states that the AD is putting its political views on the  market, and he continued, "The fact is that the Serbs and the  Albanians have killed and murdered each other, but have not  wiped each other out; thus it is normal to start a dialogue."  In other words, our statement in Shkoder was quite the opposite  to what was alleged by RILINDJA DEMOKRATlKE and the Public Order  Ministry statement. I also possess a recorded cassette of this,  Imami concluded in reply to this question.    Neritan Ceka, asked if the AD discerned anybody responsible  for this incident, replied that this question should be put to  Sali Berisha, president of the Republic, who had warned the  socialists in connection with the earlier incident in Shkoder  with the words "What did the Socialists want in Shkoder?" The  president would have done well to have asked "What do the  Motionists [mocioniste, parliamentary group that founded the AD]  want in Shkoder?" before this putsch in Shkoder was organized.    Among the many replies given by Messrs. Ceka and Imami, we  would single out the answer concerning the meeting of the AD  deputies with the general director of the republic's police and  the leading police officers of Shkoder, who told the deputies  that they were "concerned about extinguishing religious conflict  in Shkoder," a strange statement to emerge from a news  conference given by AD leaders. The AD leaders said that the  motive behind the Public Order Ministry's statements was to  confuse the public. We would also single out Imami's statement  that he had told the spokesman of this ministry to look for and  find former Sigurimi collaborators from the head of state  downwards.    In connection with the AD's demands for cooperation with the  PD, Ceka said among other things: Return the money of Arsidi  and Zhulali to the Albanian State Bank; denounce the Islamic  pact and Albania's adherence to it; and seriously fight against  corruption and political crime.    In reply to a somewhat obscure question from an ATA  journalist, Ceka replied, "We are merely pleased that ATA takes  an interest in the AD. So much nonsense is talked about it...."    In conclusion, the chairman of the news conference gave the  floor to Neritan Ceka, who said, "I will tell you something.  The AD is not made up of men who are frightened." Let me say,  and let people realize clearly, that "Albania cannot become  Palermo, and there is no turning back." That is all I have to  say.    We emphasize that the news conference aroused great interest  and passed without incident, in order to scotch rumors  circulating yesterday about alleged incidents during the news  conference. At the news conference, an AD member, a participant  in the Shkoder meeting and one of the organizers of the first  anticommunist demonstration, published in the conference hall  the names of Gjovalin Cekini's murderers, including that of  Selami Cela, who has often been mentioned recently in Shkoder,  as well as in Public Order Ministry statements.</p>

The first resolution expressed their support for the peace  talks between the government and the Moro National Liberation  Front (MNLF); the second recommended the establishment of a  consultative mechanism between the peace panels and the Mindanao  community.    Present in the meeting held Friday afternoon were Defense  Secretary Renato de Villa; Interior Secretary Rafael Alunan  III; Presidential Assistant for Mindanao Paul Dominguez;  Lieutenant. General Thelmo Cunanan, Southern Command commander;  Governor Liningding Pangandaman of the Autonomous Region of  Muslim Mindanao; Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte; and  Representatives Maria Clara Lobregat (Laban [Party], Zamboanga)  and Nur Jaafar (Lakas [Party], Tawi-tawi).    The meeting assessed the peace and order situation in  Mindanao in the wake of the bombings perpetrated by radical  groups, the current peace talks between the government and the  MNLF, and the progress of the East-Asian Growth Area.    President Ramos told the meeting he was determined to reach  a  pact with MNLF rebels "in a just and honorable way without  bloodshed." The president, however, stood pat on the  government's position disallowing MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari from  being escorted by 500 armed bodyguards when he entered Cotabato  City for the signing of the cease fire agreement.    The signing of the cease fire agreement scheduled 11 January  was postponed due to the MNLF's demand to provide Misuari with  armed escorts.</p>

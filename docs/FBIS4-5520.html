			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- Thanks to the  leadership of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song who has  made uninterrupted trips to give on-the-spot guidance to the  people all his life the Korean people are victoriously advancing  the revolution and construction along a straight path, with the  most correct line and policy of socialist construction, says  NODONG SINMUN today.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying:    "The leader's life can be said to be a life of constant  trips  of on-the-spot guidance to the people. The leader has rendered  great services for the people all his life and he is making  uninterrupted trips of on-the-spot guidance to the people still  today in his eighties."    The author of the article says:    The history of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song's  revolutionary activities is recorded with protracted struggles  and feats; it is a history of on-the-spot guidance, for which he  has always found himself among the people and shared weal and  woe with them.    He always goes wherever workers, farmers and working  intellectuals live and work, hears what they want and demand,  and fully reflects it in new lines and policies for a victorious  advance of the Korean revolution.    The Chongsan-ri spirit and method, the revolutionary work  method of our party, was created in the course of his continuous  on-the-spot guidance. He guided Chongsan-ri on the spot for  half a month, grasped with his keen insight the matured demand  of our revolution at a new stage of development and clearly  indicated the orientation and concrete tasks of socialist rural  construction. In this period, he set a great example of the  revolutionary work method, including the method of the superior  helping the subordinate and giving precedence to political work  in all affairs.    The unique policy of agricultural cooperativization, which  was the first to indicate the way of transforming economic  sectors on socialist lines before technical reconstruction, the  Taean work system, a chuche-based system of socialist economic  management, and the new system of agricultural guidance were all  created and proved their worth in the course of his on-the-spot  guidance.    In the course of his on-the-spot guidance, the great leader  conceived and created with his tireless activities all the  unique ideas, theories and policies of our party including the  line of the ideological, technical and cultural revolutions, the  rural theses, the theses on socialist education, the chuche  method of farming promising bumper harvests under whatever  unfavorable conditions, the invincible vitality of which has  been fully displayed along with the victorious advance of our  revolutionary cause.    If one believes in the people and relies on them, one gains  everything and wins victory every time--this is the unshakable  creed of Comrade Kim Il-song. So, he has traversed the long  course of revolutionary struggle with absolute trust in the  people and the firm determination to lead the revolution always  in reliance on them.    There is no such leader as Comrade Kim Il-song who has  performed great exploits, always finding himself among the  people, sharing weal and woe with them and enjoying their praise  and deep trust, with the noble idea of "believing in the people  as in heaven" as his motto.    Our people deeply feel through their historical experience  and reality how honorable and happy they are to live and make  revolution under Comrade Kim Il-song who visits people for  on-the-spot guidance all his life. They are staunchly fighting  full of confidence and optimism, entrusting their destiny and  future entirely to him.    It is because he always finds himself among the people,  mobilizes them and leads our revolution from victory to victory,  that the socialist cause of chuche is firmly defended, the  challenges and aggressive moves of the imperialists and  reactionaries were decisively repulsed and the Korean  revolution and the cause of anti-imperialist independence have a  bright future.</p>

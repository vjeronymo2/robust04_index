			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt holds its ground as other bourses decline BOURSES mostly fell yesterday, for a variety of reasons, while Frankfurt seemed to surprise itself by registering a new closing high for 1991, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw particular strength in the big three chemicals, in utilities and in the tyre company Continental as share prices generally held their ground. The FAZ index rose 0.11 to 680.39 at midsession and the DAX by 1.94 to 1,603.36 at the close. Volume rose again, from DM6.0bn to DM6.5bn. The top ten active stocks included the chemicals, Veba and RWE in utilities and Conti, which traded in DM400m as it rose DM6.50 to DM224.50. Mr Detlev Klug of B Metzler in Frankfurt said that the Conti buyer had managed to remain invisible during market hours; a number of dealers will be pursuing the story today, sensitive to stakebuilding possibilities with a merger offer from Pirelli still extant. BASF led chemicals higher with a rise of DM4.70 to DM247. Opinions have been divided on the big three's ability, and inclination to maintain dividends which yield around 8 per cent to German shareholders. In utilities, also regarded as defensive, Veba rose DM5.70 to DM339, and was fourth in the volume chart in turnover of DM405m on a Dresdner Bank recommendation, RWE following in DM265m with a rise of DM5.50 to DM408. PARIS was pulled down to its lowest close this month by Wall Street's weak opening. The CAC 40 index ended down 1.07 per cent or 19.44 at 1,802.91 in volume of FFr1.7bn. Michelin and Peugeot were both weaker ahead of their 1990 results which are due to be released today. Analysts, meanwhile, were intent on 1991 prospects. The tyre manufacturer fell FFr2 or 2.2 per cent to FFr88.20 with 181,150 shares traded while the car company lost FFr22 or 3.9 per cent to FFr536 in 114,925. BNP, whose long-term debt was put on Standard &amp; Poor's creditwatch list last Friday, fell 3.6 per cent or FFr10.50 to FFr279.50. MILAN fell on the final day of the April trading account as professionals, who had speculated on a firm close to the trading month, squared their positions. The Comit index fell 3.88 to 587.66 in volume estimated at slightly more than Monday's L161bn. Fiat fell L104 or 1.8 per cent to L5,528, weighed down by options-related selling and renewed fears that difficult trading conditions so far this year might force it to cut its dividend on 1990 results. Shares controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti remained weak, with Cir down L65 or 2.5 per cent to L2,550 and Olivetti off L100 to L3,830. On the other hand, the insurance sector resisted the weaker trend with some success. Generali lost only L80 to L36,900. Sai and Toro bucked the trend, closing up L290 or 1.6 per cent and L460 or 1.7 per cent at L18,500 and L26,710 respectively. AMSTERDAM came off the day's highs as Wall Street opened lower. Trading was thin ahead of the Bundesbank's meeting on Thursday. There were fears that the Dutch would have to follow suit if Germany raised its interest rates. The CBS tendency index, having set a 1991 closing high of 97.1 on Monday, lost 0.6 to close at 96.5 yesterday. Royal Dutch eased Fl 1.20 to Fl 153.40 after Monday's surge, while Unilever, which reached an all-time high on Monday, fell Fl 3.60 to Fl 163.30. ZURICH fell 1.2 per cent after its holiday on Monday, featuring profit-taking in pharmaceuticals, and acrobatics in the arms and engineering concern Oerlikon-Buhrle. The Credit Suisse index closed 6.7 lower at 554.3, Roche bearers easing SFr30 to SFr7,490 on higher profits and dividend for 1990, and Ciba-Geigy losing SFr130 to SFr2,740 on Friday's news that its first-quarter sales dropped 8 per cent, and that 1991 will be a difficult year. Oerlikon, also on Friday, offered a swap from non-voting certificates into bearer shares on a five-for-two basis. The certificates jumped SFr56, or more than a third yesterday to SFr196, while the bearers shed SFr10 to SFr510. STOCKHOLM fell on higher domestic interest rates. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 5.9 to 1,092.9 in volume of SKr289m after SKr235m. The day's most heavily traded share was energy group Sydkraft's C share which fell SKr1 to SKr120 in volume of SKr24m. Heavy trade was also noted in Trelleborg, the free B shares rising SKr1 to SKr139. BRUSSELS saw shares in Societe Generale de Belgique lose BFr30 to BFr2,240 after reporting 1990 results at the lower end of expectations. The Bel 20 index rose 1.33 to 1,209.40.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE Eurotrack 100 - Apr 16  --------------------------------------------------------------------                              Hourly changes  Open     10 am    11 am    Noon     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm      Close 1117.71  1117.92  1118.79  1118.08  1117.40  1116.06  1114.78   1113.65  --------------------------------------------------------------------             Day's High 1119.35           Day's Low 1113.01  --------------------------------------------------------------------       Apr 15        Apr 12       Apr 11       Apr 10        Apr 9      1125.46       1116.71      1108.33      1102.87       1111.57  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

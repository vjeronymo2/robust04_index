Asked about the faction  sponsoring, training, and rehabilitating these Afghan Arabs, the  Afghan leader said that all the major Afghan factions have such  camps, and that the Arab region will witness new waves of  violence unless conditions in Afghanistan calm down and one  central authority is established.

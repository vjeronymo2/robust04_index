			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: A GP among the specialists - 11th in a series on fee-based advisers Andrew Swallow is clear about his role as a fee-based independent financial adviser. He says he acts as his clients' general practitioner, not their specialist. If they need a financial service that Swallow believes can be undertaken better, or more cost-effectively, by someone else, he calls on his established professional connections among accountants, solicitors and stockbrokers. Similarly, he and his colleague, Sarah Keens, do not undertake discretionary investment management. He says: 'I don't think a small IFA can run a discretionary service because this requires full-time skills. We can't see how a small organisation can maintain the skills necessary to provide structural investment and financial advice and, at the same time, undertake the specialist work necessary to manage funds on a discretionary basis.' Swallow is the founder of Andrew Swallow IFA, based in Ipswich, Suffolk, and established four years ago. A previous winner of Money Management's independent financial adviser competition, he used to work in the insurance industry and also spent four years in an IFA partnership. This broke up because Swallow wanted to work exclusively on a fee basis. He argues: 'When IFAs charge commission, the only difference between them and the direct salesman is that they can sell lots of policies while the Allied Dunbar salesman can sell only one.' Although Swallow works from a large, modern bungalow close to the countryside, his clients tend to be concentrated in the Greater London area. 'We get them from recommendations and professional connections,' he says. 'I was lucky that I was with a Lloyd's brokerage in London for two years.' Swallow describes his 'average financial planning client' as earning more than Pounds 75,000 a year and/or having total assets of more than Pounds 500,000. This dominance by the better-off is one that he regrets but feels is inevitable. 'It is a great distress to me that the people who would benefit most from independent financial advice cannot afford to pay for it,' he says. 'We will consider any size of funds on our personal financial planning side, but our fees make it unlikely that we will undertake investments of less than Pounds 100,000. We all do occasional charity cases - re-arranging modest affairs without charge - but you can't run a business on these. My view is that IFAs eventually will deal only with the wealthiest 5 per cent.' Swallow's fees are time-based and range from Pounds 45 to Pounds 110 an hour. Clients are always consulted on the treatment of any commissions that arise. 'We are fully computerised and we itemise the bill for every item,' he says. 'We are just moving to a new system that times by the second. I feel that a financial adviser who is treating clients' investments has to be even more transparent on fees and commissions than an accountant or solicitor.' Swallow also points out that: 'Far too much of the work is non-productive nowadays. That's why fees have to be so ridiculously high. You have to do so much research, reading and training.' The Swallow service starts with an assessment of all a client's assets. This includes a detailed investment policy schedule and an individual balance sheet and cash flow forecast. The analysis can take three to six months to complete. 'Once we know the extent of a new client's assets and have agreed these with them, we can provide the appropriate advice,' explains Swallow. 'Typically, our clients tend to be very busy in their own life, earning a lot of money, and they want that portion of their affairs sorted out for them. 'You often find that the most brilliant and successful people are absolutely clueless in my department. Then again, some are very difficult to deal with because they are so big and you have to be quite forceful sometimes to bring them to the table. I sometimes say to people: 'If you would do this, or if you would reply to correspondence, I could cut my fees in half'.' Swallow also draws up financial plans for small businesses, and manages employee benefit arrangements. Roughly one-third of the firm's income comes from its 29 corporate clients. 'We act predominantly for small PLCs, director-owned companies and partnerships,' says Swallow. 'We produce our own member booklets. I find it extraordinary that most IFAs who do corporate benefits wouldn't dream of doing their own booklets, as they are in the best position for this.' He places great importance on client contact, arguing that one of the strengths of a fee-based firm over one based on commission is the ability to forge close relationships. Private clients receive quarterly bulletins and an annual review, and Swallow says: 'It is unusual for us to speak to a client fewer than two or three times each year. A lot of clients contact us once a month.' He also has monthly contacts with corporate clients. Swallow adds: 'We try to be pro-active. But, as we are paid by the hour, we have to be somewhat circumspect to ensure that clients do not feel we are trying to drum up fees on their account.'

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 28 (AFP) -- Austria's vice-chancellor,  Erhard Busek, will boycott a visit by Chinese Premier Li Peng  which begins Wednesday [29 June] to contest China's position on  human rights.    Busek said he "will not participate in any of the meetings  scheduled during Li's visit," because of comments made by Li  that the question of human rights in China was not the business  of foreigners.    Busek, head of the ruling conservative party (OevP), said he  "simply does not understand" Li's comments. "This attitude is  purely and simply unexplainable even accounting for China's  history," he was quoted by his press service as saying. "Human  rights concern everybody," he added.    The OevP shares the coalition government with Chancellor  Franz Vranitzky's Social-Democrat Party.    Li was scheduled to sign Vienna's Golden Book for visitors  on  Thursday but other OevP leaders said they too would boycott this  ceremony, so the ceremony has been officially cancelled "because  of scheduling problems."    Austria is the first leg of a European tour by Li which will  take him to Germany and Romania.</p>

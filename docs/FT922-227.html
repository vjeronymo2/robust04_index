			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / The genetic threat to capitalism: America One of the advantages of Washington, FT colleagues assured me before I left London, is the intellectual stimulation provided by its extensive network of well-funded thinktanks. You will be one step ahead of us, they said, because most of the new ideas in economics and social policy originate in the US. Perhaps I have been asleep, but the intellectual excitement has been strictly limited in the past 18 months. By and large, the conservative thinktanks are still recycling ideas advanced by Friedrich Hayek in the 1950s. The liberal (left of centre) groups remain knocked off balance by this resurgence of authentic liberalism. At last, however, I can report a faint whiff of something new, or at least something a little less hackneyed. Several analysts are worrying that the American ideal of an open, mobile society is being undermined by a growing genetic stratification of the population. The fear, baldly put, is that America is heading towards a nightmarish science fiction future in which a clever and affluent elite effectively walls itself off (physically as well as socially) from the bulk of society, which lives in comparative poverty. The twist is that the affluent group is self-perpetuating because members marry each other, thus transmitting their genetic advantages to future generations. Those outside the charmed circle remain socially and economically depressed because of an unfair distribution of innate ability. This disturbing thesis is explored by Mr Mickey Kaus in a recent cover story for the New Republic magazine based on his forthcoming book 'The End of Equality.' As Mr Kaus notes, the argument was first advanced more than 20 years ago by Mr Richard Herrnstein, a Harvard psychologist. Mr Herrnstein is himself writing a book on the subject, in collaboration with Mr Charles Murray, the social critic who stunned Washington in the early 1980s by advocating the abolition of welfare. In a meritocratic society, the Herrnstein argument runs, social standing reflects the pay and prestige attached to your job. Your ability to succeed in the workplace in turn depends on your mental abilities. The implication is that if mental abilities are heritable, social standing is heritable. The sons and daughters of the successful will therefore tend to be atypically successful. This raises the spectre of horrible new class divisions based on genes rather than titles or property. The irony is that the greater the efforts to eliminate traditional obstacles to personal advancement, the greater the risk of genetic stratification. For example, as educational opportunities are broadened, it becomes more rather than less likely that those gaining the top qualifications - and hence the top jobs - will have the greatest innate ability. The feminist revolution, while increasing opportunities for women, has also exacerbated the problem. With both partners now typically working, the pay and employment status of women has a bigger impact on marriage decisions. A generation ago, doctors often married nurses; now they are more likely to marry fellow physicians. In business, MBAs are more likely to marry fellow professionals than secretaries and so on. In days gone past, Mr Kaus points out, people who failed economically could blame their misfortune on extraneous factors, such as lack of education or social barriers. But if such obstacles are removed, people will be forced to confront their own natural limitations. The risk is an ugly society in which the successful consider themselves superior rather than merely privileged or lucky. It is probably too early to judge whether genetically-based social stratification is a serious threat. But the argument can be challenged on several grounds. The linchpin is the assumption that mental abilities are largely inherited. If IQ and other purported measures of ability are mainly determined by environmental rather than genetic factors, the thesis collapses. I hope this is the case, but I do not pretend to have thoroughly reviewed the scientific evidence. The other weakness in the argument is the claimed link between abstract measures of mental ability and economic success. At present, the US system favours those who shine in academic aptitude tests. It is difficult to get into the top universities without high test scores. And America is so sold on qualifications that it is difficult to get a top job without several badges from one of these institutions - usually a PHD or professional qualification as well as a first degree. But nobody has shown that this very lengthy mental training is actually necessary or indeed relevant to job performance. It could be little more than a comfortable cartel run by, and on behalf of, the upper middle classes. In a truly entrepreneurial society, personality and energy are likely to be as important determinants of success as academic aptitude. After all, there is nothing inherently complicated about most of the services that people want. And while technology is getting more complex, it is often surprisingly easy to use. There is no denying, however, that Mr Kaus and others are raising troubling issues. An aristocracy founded on differences in innate ability potentially poses a bigger threat to social harmony than all the kings and queens of history put together. We should no longer fight shy of a public debate about the social implications of genetic differences.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Arts: The pride of Lyons - The success of a new house in a city that decided to back opera Things are going well for the Opera de Lyon. Unlike most European opera companies, it has been almost immune to the recession, thanks to an inflation-proof public subsidy. Its controversial new theatre, designed by Jean Nouvel and inaugurated last year, has overcome most of its teething problems and been grudgingly accepted by the public. After a period of consolidation, the company is back on the offensive. This season includes two world premieres and tours to Frankfurt and San Francisco. The latest new production, Berlioz's La Damnation de Faust, was expensively cast and made ambitious use of laser lighting. It has been recorded - as will Les Contes d'Hoffmann (with Roberto Alagna) and Werther in coming months. With about half its productions released on video or compact disc, the Opera has become one of Lyons' most powerful symbols at home and abroad. Artistic director Jean-Pierre Brossmann says the key to the company's rapid development has been political will. Lyons' centre-right city council - headed by an opera-loving mayor, Michel Noir - actively promotes culture. Public subsidy accounts for 75 per cent of the Opera's FFr185m (Pounds 22m) budget. 'Lyons is not a rich city,' says Brossmann. 'It simply made a choice - to target social and cultural issues, to give people hope through education and culture. Opera houses are not just places for subsidised entertainment. They have a formative role to play in society. We have the ideas, but there has to be agreement between what we do and what the politicians are prepared to support.' The company has gone out of its way to make itself accessible. In its commissioning of new operas, it has tried to find works which are understandable rather than esoteric. It staged a special children's version of Die Zauberflote. It also helped pioneer Lyons' passeport culturel, a low-price ticket enabling students to sample the work of the city's six main performing arts institutions. Brossmann wants the scheme extended to the general public. He says opera companies must beware of tailoring their work to the preferences of regular opera-goers. 'You have to mix your public, and cast your net as wide as possible. We try to unite in one building the best of each system - you could describe it as a bit of Covent Garden, a bit of English National Opera and a bit of Opera Factory.' It sounds like a model opera company, but the truth is different. The Opera has won preferment at the expense of other cultural institutions. The Orchestre National de Lyon, for example, languishes in an unsuitable hall and now faces competition from the Opera's high-profile concert series. The city was forced to axe its Berlioz festival and the equally short-lived festival of 19th-century French music. The Opera's new theatre is also far from ideal. You cannot deny Nouvel's achievement in packing so much into the original neo-classical shell - double the working space, double the number of performances. But the stage machinery still creaks, and the pit is irredeemably narrow. Front-of-house circulation is restricted by narrow escalators, and the unrelenting black decor makes it hard to see the steps. Even the toilets reek of designer conceit. The high-tech appearance of the theatre goes hand-in-hand with the company's trendy production style, which aims to bring in as young an audience as possible. The policy is dressed up as 'a fresh look at the classics' - there is not a single 'traditional' staging in the repertoire - but the result rarely goes beyond a superficial gloss. That was certainly true of Louis Erlo's abstract-minimalist treatment of La Damnation de Faust, the first new production of the season. Erlo's box of tricks included a frame of green lasers for Faust's study and a wall of illuminated red studs for the tavern scene. It looked sophisticated, but had little relevance to the dream-like nature of the work. The opening scenes on the Hungarian plains were crude and static, and the portrayal of Mephistopheles as a voice in Faust's psychological make-up robbed the action of its headlong expressive potential. At least the music had space to cast its spell - particularly in the choral scenes, where the warmth of sound bathing the stage was intoxicating (chorus master Richard Cooke). The orchestra responded keenly to Kent Nagano's direction, but one searched in vain for the suppleness, spontaneity and sense of wilful engagement which mark out the true Berlioz conductor. The cast, in vaguely modern costumes, was headed by the formidable trio of Thomas Moser, Jose van Dam and Susan Graham. For all his idiomatic pronunciation, Moser is not a natural French romantic tenor. He lacks the liquid tone for this music, and tends to look big and clumsy. Van Dam's Mephistopheles has seen better days. He still colours the words with exemplary skill, but his top notes have to be carefully managed, and his characterisation has lost its sting. Graham's Marguerite, by contrast, was captivating - a picture of fragrant, unspoilt womanhood. Her exquisite carriage and golden timbre, the sensuous way she handled her props, the depth of feeling implicit in her singing of 'Et combien je l'aimais]' - it would be hard to imagine a more complete performance.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Murdoch cuts price of Times to 30p NEWS CORPORATION is cutting the price of The Times nationwide by 15p to 30p. The move - which will take immediate effect - is unprecedented in the recent history of Britain's broadsheet newspapers. It follows an experimental 15p cut to 30p in Kent, which has produced a consistent rise in circulation of between 12 per cent and 15 per cent since it was introduced on August 2. The national price cut, which is expected to be permanent, will herald one of the most intense periods of competition between broadsheet newspapers in living memory. The decision is a surprising one for a publication that in the past has been marketed as the 'top people's paper'. Mr Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, has long suspected that newspapers are too expensive, and that the way to reverse current falls in circulation is to cut costs. A 30p Times, News Corporation hopes, will take the paper from its current circulation of about 370,000 to well above 400,000 and into second place in the broadsheet market behind the Daily Telegraph. The Guardian is seen as impregnable with its own distinct liberal readership, and the immediate target is The Independent, which has been going through difficult times both financially and editorially. It is believed, however, that Mr Murdoch has framed a long-term policy to compete head-on with the Daily Telegraph and dislodge some of its circulation of about 1m. News Corporation's price cutting started earlier this summer when The Sun lopped 5p off its 25p cover price. The result has been a modest 300,000 increase in sales - enough of a success to justify extending the cut into 1994.</p>

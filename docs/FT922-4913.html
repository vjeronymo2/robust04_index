			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Qantas and Australian to merge AUSTRALIA'S Labor government yesterday announced plans to merge two government-owned airlines, followed by a sale to the private sector of all the capital in the merged carrier. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said Qantas, the international carrier, would pay ADollars 400m (Dollars 303m) today to acquire Australian Airlines, the domestic carrier. Mr Keating said the merged airline would be privatised through the sale of 35 per cent of its shares to foreign airlines, and the sale of the remaining 65 per cent to Australian interests. British Airways, Singapore Airlines and Japan Airlines are seen as contenders in the sell-off. He added that the sale was expected to return a net ADollars 1bn to the government, implying a sale value of more than ADollars 2bn, after taking account of the ADollars 400m cost of acquiring Australian and Qantas' refinancing requirements of between ADollars 600m and ADollars 1bn. Mr John Ward, Qantas chief executive, said the merged airline would be valued at between ADollars 2.4bn and ADollars 3bn. Such a price tag would make the sale Australia's biggest privatisation, dwarfing the ADollars 1.3bn sale last year of 30 per cent of the government-owned Commonwealth Bank. The government has not yet decided whether there should be a ceiling on foreign holdings. However, it hopes to sell most of the shares reserved for Australians by way of a flotation early next year. Mr Keating also announced the establishment of an independent tribunal to award international routes to the merged airline and Ansett Australia, the privately-owned domestic airline which is to be Australia's second international carrier. The announcement marks the fourth significant change in Australian aviation policy since October 1990, when deregulation of the domestic market swept away decades of strict government control. The government said in April 1991 it would privatise 49 per cent of Qantas and 100 per cent of Australian, but banned the two airlines from holding equity in each other. In February, it said cross-shareholdings between the two airlines would be allowed, but confirmed that 51 per cent of Qantas would remain in government hands. It also foreshadowed the award of international licences to Ansett and the creation of a single aviation market with New Zealand. The latest change of policy reflects a growing conviction among ministers that the value of the two airlines would be increased significantly by a merger and full privatisation. Only a handful of serious bidders emerged for the separate sales, led by British Airways, Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand. The sale of 100 per cent of the capital in the airline would breach Labor policy, and will have to be confirmed by a special party conference. Labor's parliamentary party approved the proposal yesterday, but there was strong opposition from the influential left-wing faction, which supports the existing policy of maintaining 51 per cent government ownership of Qantas. The government would also retain a 'golden share' to protect national interests, such as the ability to commandeer aircraft during emergencies.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACADEMY AWARDS AND IMAGES OF PHYSICAL DISABILITY  </P> <P> We in the disability community were euphoric over the choice of Daniel  Day-Lewis as best actor for "My Left Foot." But our bubble was burst by Joan  Collins.  </P> <P> In a TV interview, Collins expressed awe at the talent of Day-Lewis, a handsome  actor, she said, "who could make himself look so ugly!" This remark was a slap  to the 43 million disabled Americans. "Ugly," she said of a character with  cerebral palsy.  </P> <P> This is Hollywood; this is where images are made. If society must change its  negative image of persons with disabilities, this is where it ought to start.  </P> <P> "Ugly" is not how a person deviates from the physical norm; ugly instead is  prejudice.  </P> <P> LILLIBETH NAVARRO  </P> <P> Executive Director  </P> <P> Adapt Southern California  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

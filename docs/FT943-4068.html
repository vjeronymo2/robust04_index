			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / US and Cuba reach deal to halt flow of refugees The US and Cuba yesterday reached an agreement to halt the flow of Cuban refugees to the Florida coast in a move that marks the first co-operation between the two countries since a flood of migrants began last month. The agreement, which could pave the way for a slow improvement in broader US-Cuban relations, was agreed after over a week of meetings between the two sides in New York. It was welcomed by President Bill Clinton as a measure that 'will help ensure that the massive flow of dangerous and illegal immigration will be replaced by a safer, legal and more orderly process'. The US has agreed to admit at least 20,000 Cubans this year, in line with the existing US immigration quota, and could grant visas to another additional 6,000 Cubans currently on the waiting list. Although fewer than 4,000 Cubans have entered the US through legal channels in the past year, the immigration and naturalisation services set aside 27,835 visas for Cubans every year. Cuba is understood to have promised to curb the exodus of refugees. This would involve restoring the border patrols which prevent people from attempting to leave by boat. The Castro government encouraged the migration by allowing border guards to look the other way as rafts left Cuban shores. Cuba was understood to have sought a commitment from the US side to future talks on broader issues of the US-Cuba relationship, in particular the 32-year US trade embargo. Before this week's meetings with Cuba, the Clinton administration insisted that it would not discuss anything other than migration issues even if the Cuban side raised broader questions. However, evidence that the two countries can co-operate will have strengthened the hands of those within the administration who wish to open comprehensive talks with Havana. More than 32,000 people have fled Cuba over the past month. Most are being held at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and a detention centre opened earlier this week in Panama. The agreement did not include any provisions to allow them into the US and the Clinton administration was not expected to reverse its decision to interdict and detain rafters. The US is likely to encourage detainees to return to Cuba to proceed with legal immi-gration. Cubans bullish over UK delegation's visit, Page 3</p>

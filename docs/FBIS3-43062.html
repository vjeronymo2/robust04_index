The discovery of new  monoclonal antibodies allowing the identification of various  antigens of normal and tumorous tissue has expanded the  capabilities of morphological research. Peroxidase immunoassay  has enabled the evaluation of local immunity and the  morphological study of the role of various populations of  lymphocytes in the immune response, as well as the  identification of micrometastases in regional lymph nodes.  Despite that, the technique is little used in Russia, because of  the inadequate amount and inadequate variety of high-quality  reagents and the small number of studies of the procedures  associated with the technique. The researchers here developed a  variation of the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method that enables  immunomorphological studies on cryostate sections of tissue of  benign and malignant tumors of the mammary gland, as well as of  regional lymphatic nodes removed in radical mastectomy. The work  involved the monoclonal antibodies IKO-1, IKO-12, IKO-31,  IKO-86, and IKO-90. Among the round-cell infiltrates both of  benign and malignant tumors, the most pronounced expression was  noted for the CD3 antigen, which is typical of T lymphocytes and  was identified with IKO-90. CD3-positive cells were found to  predominate. CD22- positive cells among the infiltrates was  approximately equal to or a little more numerous than those with  benign tumors, with a ratio of 1:2 in relation to CD3-positive  cells. In regional lymphatic nodes without metastatic damage,  IKO-90[.sup]+[/] cells were noted most often in the  paracortical area as focal clusters. IKO- 12[.sup]+[/] cells  were identified, as a rule, in lymphoid follicles as focal  clusters. Usually, the center of the follicle was represented as  B-cells, with lymphocytes on the periphery expressing CD4 and  CD8 antigens. IKO-31[.sup]+[/] and - 86[.sup]+[/] cells  were noted most often as clusters in the interfollicular  regions. Lymphocytes labelled with the monoclonal antibodies of  IKO-1 were found in the follicles, pulpy cords, and  interfollicular regions. Figures 3, references 7: 5 Russian, 2  Western.</p>

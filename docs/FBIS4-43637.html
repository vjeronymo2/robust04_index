			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 21 (AFP) -- Two nuclear inspectors  supervising an experimental reactor in North Korea have been  granted permission to remain there through mid-July, David Kyd,  spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency, said  Tuesday [21 June].    "We made a request to North Korean officials and we were  granted without problem a two-week extension on the inspectors'  visas which expire at the end of the month," Kyd said.    He said that an IAEA request for visas for two new  inspectors  who would replace their colleagues has not yet been addressed.    On Monday another IAEA spokesman, Hans-Friedrich Meyer, said  that that the two inspectors supervising the Yongbyon  experimental reactor must be replaced as they are working under  difficult conditions.    Some 8,000 spent nuclear rods were removed from the reactor  before the arrival of the inspectors to supervise the process,  but the rods are still too hot for any extraction of plutonium.    Plutonium is a key ingredient to producing a nuclear bomb.    Sources close to the Agency said North Korea has new fuel  rods ready but there are no signs that it is planning to  recharge the experimental reactor.    They said Pyongyong wants to examine the reactor first,  especially since some fuel rods had broken, causing a radiation  leak. But it could be put back into service before the winter  to help meet the country's energy needs.    A crisis over North Korea's refusal to open its nuclear  facilities to inspections was defused over the weekend after  Pyongyong promised to allow fresh IAEA visits and offered to  hold a breakthrough summit with South Korea, almost 50 years  since the two were divided by the Cold War and the ensuing  Korean conflict.    The freezing of North Korea's nuclear programme and  international inspection of its facilities is the main condition  being set by the United States for dropping its threat of  sanctions and returning to joint talks.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Upbeat Clarke warns on borrowing MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, yesterday delivered an upbeat assessment of the recovery but warned that tough decisions must be taken in next month's Budget to reduce government borrowing. The recovery 'is really happening', he said. Although he was 'concerned a bit' that the recovery was 'still not very strong', the economy was 'going along quite well'. While there were occasional 'blips', the recovery was stronger than the government could have hoped at the time of the Budget in March, he said. Since he succeeded Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor in May, Mr Clarke has avoided trumpeting Britain's growth performance and has frequently warned of the dangers posed by the recession among Britain's main trading partners in continental Europe. Yesterday, while acknowledging that unemployment and crime rates were too high, he struck an optimistic note. Britain was the first country in Europe to come out of recession and was set to grow faster than any of its main European competitors this year and next. 'We can begin to lift our horizons to look beyond recovery and set ourselves the realistic aim of making Britain the most dynamic and most successful economy in Europe,' Mr Clarke told the conference. The UK, he said, had 'good news to build on'. Interest rates were at their lowest levels for 16 years. Inflation was 'down - and staying down'. However, Mr Clarke said that Britain 'must lead the way' in reducing government borrowing. He said that his first duty as chancellor was to tackle debt by reining back public spending. But he did not rule out tax increases in his November 30 Budget. 'As Margaret Thatcher discovered in her courageous Budget of 1981, when the first priority is to balance the books, tight control over public spending is not always enough.' The chancellor said that everyone wanted lower income taxes - and a tax system that protected the saver and encouraged the investor and entrepreneur. However, he said it was necessary to get back to sound public finances to achieve this. Mr Clarke strongly defended the tax increases announced in the March Budget by Mr Lamont. These were 'absolutely vital'. Most of the increased revenue would come from people in work, with the better off paying the most. Three quarters of the tax increases would come from higher National Insurance contributions, cuts in income tax allowances and a clampdown on tax avoidance. Mr Clarke was unrepentant about the plans to raise nearly Pounds 3bn in a full year through levying value added tax on domestic fuel from April. Defending the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel, he pointed out that: two thirds of the revenue would come from households with Pounds 12,000 a year or more; gas, coal and electricity prices had come down so prices would be unchanged in real terms from five years ago; extra help would be given to the poorest members of society.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bank's rescue leaves bitter taste - The Credit Lyonnais bale-out is unpopular A favourite topic of conversation among French financiers has for years been the precarious state of Credit Lyonnais, one of the biggest and by far the most controversial of France's banks. However, recently their comments have adopted a rather bitter tone. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who was parachuted into Credit Lyonnais last autumn to succeed Mr Jean Yves Haberer as chairman, is approaching the final stages of negotiations with the French government over a recapitalisation package to repair the state-controlled bank's battered balance sheet. The timing of the rescue will be critical. Credit Lyonnais, burdened by the heavy losses and provisions left by Mr Haberer's frenetic expansion strategy, made a net interim loss of FFr1.05bn (Dollars 175.6m) in the first six months of last year. This sent its capital ratio to just above the legal minimum of 8 per cent. It is expected in late March to announce an even larger loss, of up to FFr4bn, for 1993, which would push the capital ratio below the minimum. This means Mr Peyrelevade and the government must agree terms for the recapitalisation before the results come out. The critical question is whether they will manage to meet that deadline against the rising chorus of complaints from Credit Lyonnais's competitors. Recapitalisations are a familiar feature in the French public sector. The Bull computer company, Aerospatiale and Air France have all recently received - or are now negotiating - cash injections from the government. However, these groups, like most recent recipients of rescue packages, are involved with industry, not finance. Mr Marc Vienot, chairman of Societe Generale, and Mr Michel Pebereau, his opposite number at Banque Nationale de Paris, have argued publicly that it is unfair for the government to bale out Credit Lyonnais when their banks are left to fend for themselves. The counter-argument from the government is that it has no choice but to help Credit Lyonnais. The bank is paying a painful price for the over-ambitious policies pursued by Mr Haberer. The crux of its problems is his aggressive lending strategy, which left the bank heavily exposed to the rise in business failures and the fall in property values during the French recession. It has also faced huge write-offs on loans to a string of corporate catastrophes such as Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property group, and Switzerland's Sasea. Credit Lyonnais yesterday lodged an official complaint against the judge in charge of the Sasea receivership. The government hopes the other French banks will come round to its way of thinking. Many of them, privately, already have. 'No one ever likes to see a competitor being given preferential treatment,' said one senior Paris banker. 'But we all know that Credit Lyonnais is in a desperate state and that last thing we want is a French version of Banesto. We'd all suffer then.' Yet the complaints of Credit Lyonnais's competitors - coupled with the threat of opposition from the European Commission, which last month challenged the latest FFr2.5bn injection for Bull - may well affect the final shape of the recapitalisation package. The government is keen to allay criticism by minimising its direct capital injection, probably to between FFr3.5bn and FFr4bn, and to be seen to encourage Credit Lyonnais to raise capital on its own through asset sales. The group has already begun with last month's FFr1bn disposal of its 30 per cent stake in the Union des Assureurs Federales insurance group. Mr Peyrelevade is expected to indicate other areas for divestment when the 1993 results are published next month. In the meantime, he hopes to float off between FFr25bn and FFr28bn of Credit Lyonnais's property assets into a new state-owned company. Credit Commercial de France, another bank, implemented a similar scheme before its 1987 privatisation, as did Comptoir des Entrepreneurs, the property group, in its recent rescue. Analysts suspect that such a package should be sufficient to stabilise Credit Lyonnais. 'It ought to be enough, but everything depends on how bad the 1993 figures turn out to be and that's anyone's guess,' said Mr Stephan Arrouays, banking analyst at BZW. However, he, like other analysts, believes that Mr Peyrelevade still has a tough task ahead before it can achieve the government's final goal: privatisation. 'It's far too soon to say what effect the recapitalisation will have on the trading position,' said Ms Susan Sternglass, banking analyst at Goldman Sachs. 'It's possible that Credit Lyonnais might break even by the end of 1994, but Peyrelevade will have to provide firm proof of a return to profit before it is a sellable company.'</p>

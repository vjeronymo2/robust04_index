The meeting, summoned by President Carlos Menem, was  attended  by Defense Minister Oscar Camilion, Interior Minister Carlos  Ruckauf, the chiefs of staff of the three branches of the Armed  Forces, and Division General Mario Diaz, the chief of the Joint  Staff.    The meeting was also attended by Presidency Secretary  General  Eduardo Bauza, SIDE [Secretariat for State Intelligence] chief  Hugo Anzorreguy, Deputy Miguel Angel Toma, and Senator Eduardo  Menem.    The meeting analyzed the situation in Santiago del Estero  and  La Rioja, and studied a report submitted by Jorge Busti,  minister of government in the cabinet under the Federal  Government trustee in Santiago del Estero, who described the  social situation in this province.    According to the source, the report stated that social  conditions are now "totally different from those prevailing at  the end of December."    Concerning La Rioja, the possibility of a missile attack  against the presidential plane on 30 December -- which had been  mentioned by a press report -- was "totally ruled out."    The SIDE chief mentioned the information gathered by his  sector on the social situation in the provinces. He ruled out  "any reaction like that which is happening in Mexico," the  source said.    In brief statements made upon leaving the Olivos residence,  Camilion and Ruckauf said "there are no indications of possible  social outbursts in the northern provinces," adding that "the  situation in those provinces is under control."    The meeting was called for by Menem in light of the reports  of an attack against him and the reports -- which were also  denied -- of the presence of Argentine guerrillas in Mexico.    Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo today denied having  compared  the crisis in Santiago and the situation in Mexico, despite the  fact that almost all local publications made this interpretation  of the words he had uttered 24 hours before at the Finance  Ministry.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Trade starts in Grupo Tribasa on NYSE GRUPO TRIBASA, Mexico's second-largest construction company, started trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday after making an initial public offering of Dollars 263m in international markets, about a third of total capital. The offering was priced at Dollars 15.50 per American depositary receipt (ADR), at the low end of the price range of Dollars 15-Dollars 17. One underwriter commented that, given the weakness in the Mexican stock market - which from September 8 to September 21 fell nearly 9 per cent - there was little option but to price the issue competitively. The US took 50 per cent of the shares, Europe 30 per cent and Mexico 20 per cent. The underwriter said the offering was over-subscribed in all markets. If underwriters take up the option to buy more shares, the total value of the offering would rise to over Dollars 300m. Tribasa is the second Mexican construction company to be traded on the NYSE, following in the steps of Empresas ICA, the country's largest construction group. The Dollars 15.50 price per ADR values Tribasa at about 9.3 times prospective earnings, against current value of around 10.3 for ICA. Tribasa earned about 90 per cent of its revenues from the construction of Mexico's tollroads last year, far more than ICA. With the road programme in some financial trouble, and the Mexican government unlikely to grant many more toll road concessions over the next year, Tribasa is keen to expand into other areas, such as building water and electricity power plants. The company is planning to sell bonds backed by some of its more profitable toll roads in the near future. Assuming the Mexican government's imminent offer of bonds backed by the state-owned Cuernavaca road is a success, Tribasa will try to securitise its Ecatepec-Pyramides, and Chamapa-La Venta roads near Mexico City.</p>

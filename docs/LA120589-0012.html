			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: DISCIPLINE STYLES NEED BALANCE  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My father-in-law is an old-time military man and a believer  in firm discipline -- the "do-what-you're-told-because-you're-told" type. My  husband is of the "laid-back-who-cares" style and I'm in between. We have two  children and I'm constantly trying to figure out what type of discipline is  best. -- A.L.  </P> <P> DEAR A.L.: There's a difference between authoritarian and authoritative  discipline. Authoritarian discipline, such as that of your father-in-law,  doesn't stimulate or prepare the youngster to be able to think on his own,  while the authoritative discipline, that which lets the child know what is  expected and explains why this is correct behavior, teaches the child how to  think and make good decisions when the parents aren't around.  </P> <P> Authoritative parenting requires more effort than the traditional do-as-I-say  discipline, but the results eventually pay off.  </P> <P> Psychologist Diana Baumrind and colleagues at University of California at  Berkeley tracked children from preschool to high school to see what effects  their parents' discipline style had on their characters. Both youngsters of  authoritarian and permissive parents had low self-esteem. Those of permissive  parents were immature, had a hard time getting along with peers, tended to be  promiscuous and had the heaviest drug use. Children raised by authoritarian  parents were also immature and scored the poorest on verbal and math  achievement. Children with authoritative parents were outstandingly  well-adjusted, mature, happy, motivated and independent.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I can't understand why my 7-year-old daughter has taken to  hitting and abusing her dolls. She used to love them and now she seems to  delight in throwing them around and treating them badly. She's never been  physically abused that I know of, and in every other way, she's a sweet,  charming little girl. -- W.S.  </P> <P> DEAR W.S.: Maybe part of the problem is that she feels she has to be sweet in  order to be loved. She may not be able to express her angry feelings in any  other way. Little girls are often not able to deal with anger directly.  According to Dr. Helen De Rosis, an associate clinical professor of psychiatry  at New York University, this is due to subtle differences in the way children  are raised.  </P> <P> While little boys are encouraged to stand up for themselves and fight, little  girls usually aren't permitted to punch, scream and yell; it's not ladylike.  Girls are often expected to be timid and passive, while boys are allowed more  leniency when it comes to anger. Both little boys and little girls have a right  to be angry, but both need to be shown how to find constructive ways to express  it.  </P></p>

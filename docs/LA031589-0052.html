			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONFIRMATION HEARING FOR JUSTICE KENNARD SET  </P> <P> The state Judicial Appointments Commission will hold a confirmation hearing  April 5 in Los Angeles on the nomination of Appellate Justice Joyce L. Kennard  to the California Supreme Court, it was announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> The commission's quick action opened the way for Kennard to take office less  than four weeks after she was named by Gov. George Deukmejian to succeed  Justice John A. Arguelles, who retired March 1.  </P> <P> If confirmed as expected, Kennard would be sworn in immediately and be able to  take the bench when the court hears arguments in pending cases during the week  of April 10 in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Arguelles will remain temporarily with the court to conclude work on  cases in which he has participated.  </P> <P> Kennard's nomination must be approved by the majority of the three-member  commission, which currently includes Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, Atty. Gen.  John K. Van de Kamp and Appellate Justice Lester W. Roth of Los Angeles, senior  presiding justice of the state Court of Appeal.  </P> <P> The commission said it will receive written communications from individuals who  want to comment on the nomination until March 31. Those who want to testify  before the commission on April 5 must file a request in writing, including a  summary of their testimony, the commission said. The hearing is set to begin at  1:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Kennard, 47, now a member of the state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles, was  nominated to the high court by Deukmejian last Saturday.  </P></p>

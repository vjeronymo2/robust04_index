On  behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, I  extend felicitations to Chinese women of all nationalities,  women compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and overseas  Chinese women; as well as warm welcome to guests from various  countries present here today.    Chinese women constitute a great force for China's reforms  and opening up and modernization. Since China adopted economic  reforms and opened up to the outside world, there have been  great changes in Chinese womens outlook, with remarkable  progress in the quality of the women. Filled with ardor and  sincerity, they have actively taken part in economic  development; and have made important contributions in political,  cultural, and social sectors, as well as in safeguarding family  happiness. Chinese women enjoy a high status in society and  they really hold up "half the sky" in building socialism with  Chinese characteristics.    At present, China, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the  party's basic line, enjoys economic growth, political stability,  national unity, and social progress. In international  relations, the Chinese Government has steadfastly implemented an  independent foreign policy of peace; and has made positive  contributions to developing good neighborly relations with  peripheral countries, strengthening friendship with various  nations in the world, and promoting world peace and development.  China's international prestige has been enhanced, and China has  friends everywhere in the world.    In 1995, the United Nations will hold the Fourth World  Womens  Congress in Beijing. The congress is an important meeting to  study womens issues of the world. It is a great honor for China  to have the opportunity to prepare for and host the congress.  The Chinese Government, Chinese people, and Chinese women will  go all out to prepare for the congress, and will ensure its  success. Only some 500 days are left until the Fourth World  Womens Congress is convened. We should step up preparations and  strengthen leadership over the preparatory work. All  departments should work concertedly to provide favorable social  milieus and first-rate service for the convocation of the  congress. We should further attach importance to work related  to women at home, guaranteeing their status, protecting their  lawful rights and interests, and promoting their development and  progress to ensure the realization of various goals set in the  "Nairobi Strategy" before the end of this century. The broad  masses of women should make further contributions to society  while the community should do more concrete work for women. The  mobilization and participation of the whole society will be a  reliable guarantee for China's successful hosting of the Fourth  World Womens Congress.    Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider,  promoting development, and maintaining stability are the overall  interests of the work for the whole country and of the work  related to women this year. Womens federations at all levels  should get a clear understanding of the overall interests,  strive to do well in all fields of endeavor, and encourage women  at large to dedicate themselves to the great cause of  modernization. Once the strength of Chinese women is fully  harnessed, they will play an immeasurable role in promoting  social progress and prosperity. We earnestly hope that Chinese  women will, on the basis of striving to improve their  ideological, moral, cultural, science and technology, and  physical qualities, make still greater contributions to  promoting the building of material and spiritual civilization,  realizing the motherland's peaceful reunification, and  safeguarding world peace.    Comrades, friends! China is at an important development  period. It is the common will of all Chinese people, including  Chinese women, to turn China into a prosperous, democratic,  civilized modern socialist country. We believe that China's  future is bright and the world future is broad. Let us, under  the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang  Zemin at the core, unite and work with one heart and one mind in  striving from even greater victories in the cause of socialist  modernization!</p>

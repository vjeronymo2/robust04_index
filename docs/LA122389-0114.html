			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVABLE FEASTS: PRIMI -- PASTA TO GO FOR LAST-MINUTE PACKERS  </P> <P> So here we are again. Frankincense, myrrh and traffic jams: the perfect season  for curling up at home and taking out. How nice to find that Primi, that little  dream of a restaurant designed by Pierro Selvaggio, also owner of Valentino,  now has meals to-go.  </P> <P> Primi's menu, as you might know, is heavily weighted towards primi piatti --  salads, soups, antipasti, succulent first-course things. There are pastas,  risotti and a handful of piatti grandi, serious proteins, as well.  </P> <P> The odds of experiencing high pleasure are very good here. Primi comes through  most consistently -- all the way from the delicate rice potato and spinach soup  to a smashing gossamer-berried creme brulee -- with subtlety.  </P> <P> Now, I'm not going to say everything is perfect. The corn, barley and white  Tuscan bean soup ($6) is neutral. And the best thing about the snails, polenta  and fried parsley with a Cabernet sauce, which I found non-existent, is the  parsley (the dish is $10). Another quibble: the very fresh soft pneumatic white  rolls tucked in for dinner were absent at lunch. Still, this is a menu I'd  happily work my way through anytime.  </P> <P> To begin, piatto rustico ($8), is a fine assemblage of plump red and yellow  peppers; stout-hearted marinated Tuscan white beans; really meaty,  diamond-dense anchovies; moist Calamata olives; hunks of fine Parmigiano. One  caveat: the little mound of caponata laced with mint, parsley and pine nuts is  so honey-sweet it might have been doused with mead.  </P> <P> Orange-cured salmon ($8) looks like an exotic sea flower, something you'd see  during station breaks on KCET. Parchment-thin slices of roasted eggplant and  zucchini are wrapped around generous curls of orange peel-flecked fish.  Unfortunately, the salmon was so fat-streaked it resembled a piece of  seersucker.  </P> <P> Caesar salad ($7 for a large individual portion, $12 for the grand size) comes  pungently dressed. If you're planning not to eat right away, ask for the  dressing in a separate container. The house salad ($7) is an affable upscale  mix of radicchio, arugula, romaine and endive, which once came overloaded with  an overly oily dressing.  </P> <P> The dishes one step up on the hearty scale are all wonderfully done. Sonoma  lamb, Parmigiano and walnut salad ($11) is a fine mix of clear, strong tastes  punctuated with a good vinaigrette. Bracioline of veal ($16) -- three skewers  of lemony tender veal threaded with pancetta -- is beautifully executed. Its  moist whole sage leaves and cubes of polenta soak up the reduced veal juices --  it's as earthy and delicious as anything I've had all year.  </P> <P> Chicken and artichokes ($16) is a savory pleasure, with small morsels of  peppery chicken and a slip of a woodsy rosemary vinegar. Ragout of calamari  ($14) is more ferocious and peppery, its soft tender rings strewn with capers  and Calamata olives (not for the salt-shy).  </P> <P> Among the pastas, there's a delicious linguine with clams ($11), all garlic-  and sea-infused. I found the vegetable ravioli ($10) less pleasing. Gnocchi  ($10), which I don't think travels too well, is sweet and very plain. The dish  is supposed to be made with a sausage infusion, though I found no sign of it --  in fact there wasn't much sauce at all. There were, however, good slivers of  porcini mushrooms.  </P> <P> The best of the desserts is the aforementioned creme brulee with raspberries.  Others don't hold up so well as take-out fare. The "chocolate chocolate" pastry  purse, for example, turned soggy on the drive home. But the fruit and cheese  plate ($7) -- the first I've encountered in my take-out rounds -- is a rich  array of succulent goat and Italian cheeses and the ripest fruit. It's the  perfect way to end your feast.  </P> <P>  Primi, 10543 W. Pico Blvd., West Los Angeles.; (213) 475-9235. Take-out  available seven days. Street parking.

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Rescue plan agreed for property bank CDE Le Comptoir des Entrepreneurs (CDE), the French property bank, has agreed with its principal shareholders on a rescue plan which involves the sale of FFr9bn (Dollars 1.5bn) worth of credits and non-performing assets to a newly-created company. The plan will strengthen the balance sheet of CDE, victim of the downturn in the French property market. Provisions against non-performing property loans resulted in net losses of FFr940.5m in the first half of last year, compared with net profits of FFr23.7m in the first six months of 1992, forcing CDE to turn to its state-owned shareholders. The terms of the plan involve the establishment of a new vehicle for CDE's non-performing loans. The five state-owned financial institutions which have a controlling stake in CDE - the Caisse des Depots et Consignations, Credit Foncier, and the insurance companies Assurances Generales de France, Union des Assurances de Paris, and GAN - will hold the shares in the new company. The purchase of the assets from CDE will be achieved through a bond issue, the proceeds of which will go to the property bank. This is expected to take place in the first quarter. Industry observers said that the scheme is necessary to remove bad loans from CDE's balance sheet and restore its capital ratios. The principal shareholders in CDE have already taken substantial provisions against losses from the company. Analysts estimate that AGF, the largest shareholder with just under 30 per cent of the shares, faces costs of more than FFr1bn from its exposure to the property bank. The successful implementation of the restructuring plan should defuse the most serious crisis in CDE's 145-year history. It was founded to provide state-subsidised loans for cheap housing, but expanded into commercial and private property lending.</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Drink: Wine Auctions THE MARQUESS of Salisbury will not be holding any more big dinner parties - next Thursday, at Christie's, he is selling his last jeroboam of 1864 Chateau Latour. The jeroboam, equivalent to six normal bottles, has nestled in the cellars at Hatfield House since it came over from Bordeaux. At some period, it was swathed in brown paper to protect it from the light and to ward off oxidisation. The bottle will excite serious collectors. The 1864 was one of the finest vintages of the 19th century - Queen Victoria served first-growth Lafite and Latour regularly - and the appearance of a jeroboam is unprecedented. In 1877, Christie's was selling this Latour at around 185 shillings a dozen magnums. Next week, the jeroboam is estimated at more than Pounds 2,500 - but a word of warning: the wine level has slipped down to the shoulder of the bottle, which could mean that it has passed its best. It depends if the air above it is benign. The buyer will have an anxious moment before he serves this rare remnant. The jeroboam is the star of a spectacular wine auction, the best at Christie's for many years. This is an ideal time to buy; prices for rarities are roughly at the level of a decade ago. Many of the over-excited collectors of the mid-1980s are sitting on wine they could sell only at a loss; but death makes a nonsense of such calculations and the backbone of the auction is the Parisian cellar of the late Cariar Kaspia, the great caviar king. Here are all the premier growths in excellent vintages. They range from four bottles of Lafite 1844 (estimated at up to Pounds 2,600 each), through the outstanding 1921 Chateau 'Yquem (up to Pounds 800 a bottle), on to the famed 1945 Mouton Rothschild, and beyond. Many of the wines, including the early vintages, have been tasted by Christie's expert, Michael Broadbent, who remains convinced that the pre-phylloxera vintages retain a distinction not matched after 1880. This is essentially a sale for serious wine buffs, but on July 2 Christie's will be selling claret and white Bordeaux for everyday drinking. Next Thursday's sale offers wines that will be bought by brokers to sell on to the world's grand hotels and restaurants; in particular, to the newly-opened and under-stocked - a third of the lots at Christie's last auction found their way to the Regency Hotel in Hong Kong. But the other two strands are curiosities that would give the rich pause: a selection of Tokay and of the 1792 Madeira. The two have a strong bond - they are the two longest-surviving wines. There should be few worries about drinking well-preserved 200-year-old Madeira or Tokay. The Madeira includes eight bottles of the famed 1792. One, estimated at Pounds 500-plus, is particularly well-travelled. It was part of a 'pipe' taken on board the ship transporting Napoleon to exile on St Helena when it stopped at Madeira for supplies. But the former emperor's gastric troubles prevented him from drinking the wine. In a nice twist, Sotheby's fine wine auction on Wednesday includes a bottle of 1818 Grande Fine Champagne cognac, embossed with a crown and and bearing the word 'Restauration' - obviously produced to celebrate the restoration of the monarchy in France. A report on the sale will be carried in Friday's FT.</p>

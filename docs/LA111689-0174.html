			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDONDO BEACH IS TAKING A NEW INTEREST IN ITS OLD-TIME BUILDINGS  </P> <P> The paint is peeling. The porches droop. Even their biggest advocate says  they're "ratty." Parked in a poplar grove in Redondo Beach, the two old houses  are so forlorn that to many they seemed landmarks only an architectural scholar  could love.  </P> <P> But love works in strange and manifold ways, the South Bay's oldest city is  discovering. Since last year, when the vintage homes were moved to make way for  condominiums, their planned restoration has drawn an unexpected flood of  volunteers -- ranging from bikers to Girl Scouts to Bhagavan Sri Babajhan  Al-Kahlil The Friend, a 46-year-old yogi from Lomita.  </P> <P> "They're literally coming out of the woodwork," marveled Jonathan Eubanks,  president of the Redondo Beach Historical Society.  </P> <P> In a place where soaring property values have meant the demise of historic  homes, such grass-roots rediscoveries of the past are gaining popularity. Like  many cities, Redondo Beach is acquiring a renewed appreciation of its heritage,  preservationists say.  </P> <P> In the last three years, homeowners in Redondo Beach have gotten a neighborhood  -- the 300 block of North Gertruda Avenue -- into the National Register of  Historic Places. Another, the 500 block of Garnet Street, is seeking city  designation as a local historic district. And this summer, after a five-year  battle, the City Council created a new Preservation Commission to oversee the  fate of the city's dwindling stock of older buildings.  </P> <P> To Eubanks, the new interest in restoration and the outpouring of volunteers to  work on the two vintage homes has been a relief. Their restoration is expected  to cost up to $350,000, and the Historical Society, which has promised to carry  it out, has less than $30,000.  </P> <P> Redondo Beach is not the only place where some people are concerned about  "merging into the megalopolis with no local character left at all," said Jay  Rounds, executive director of the Los Angeles Conservancy. In recent years, he  said, Long Beach and Riverside have created positions for city preservation  officers and West Hollywood has passed a "very advanced, very strong" historic  resources ordinance.  </P> <P> In each case, he said, the move follows a building boom of the sort that in  Redondo Beach has obliterated numerous old bungalows, theaters and other  landmarks.  </P> <P> "We lost our whole downtown to urban renewal in the 1950s and early 1960s,"  Eubanks said. "For years, Redondo Beach has been so developed in so many ways.  Now people are saying, 'Wait a minute -- where did my community go?' "  </P> <P> For Eubanks, that question today focuses on the two turn-of-the-century houses  transplanted to the city's Dominguez Park. The clapboard homes came to the  city's attention last year because one, the Morrell House, was standing in the  way of development.  </P> <P> High on a hill at 204 N. Catalina Ave., with a big wrap-around porch  overlooking the harbor, the house had been built by J. Edward Morrell, one of  the 97-year-old city's first construction magnates. With Queen Anne style and  Craftsman detailing, it is among the city's oldest homes and continued to color  local lore long after the Morrell family moved on to Santa Barbara in 1956.  </P> <P> For 14 years, an ancient form of yoga was taught there by Bhagavan Sri Babajhan  Al-Kahlil The Friend, known as Bhagavan for short.  </P> <P> The group was evicted in 1984 after the property changed hands. For about a  year, the house sat vacant, at the mercy of vandals. By the time Terry Ison,  the next -- and last -- tenant moved in, the walls were marred by punk  graffiti. The carpeting was ripped, the screen doors were gone and the big  porch railing was so rotten that Ison's friends used pieces of it for firewood.  </P> <P> In 1988, property owner Simon Chang decided he wanted condominiums there.  Lobbied by the Historical Society, the City Council voted to move the house to  a park where it would create a living museum of local buildings to be preserved  for their historical significance.  </P> <P> Now the Morrell House sits on cribbing at Dominguez Park, along with a modest  Victorian cottage of the Queen Anne style that also was forced out by  condominium development. The city has spent more than $300,000 to move and  landscape the homes. But officials worry that the Historical Society won't be  able to keep its pledge to restore them for up to $350,000.  </P> <P> "That's a lot of money for a nonprofit corporation that produces most of its  money from bake sales and the like," City Manager Tim Casey said.  </P> <P> But Eubanks, who admits that the houses are "pretty ratty," says the work can  be stretched over several years' worth of fund-raisers.  </P> <P> Eubanks sees more in the outpouring of support than the popularity of an old  house. The volunteers -- 150 so far -- include everyone from housewives to  engineers to King Harbor Neighborhood Girl Scout Troop No. 1344, whose leader  is Linda Rummler.  </P> <P> The desire to get her troop involved in volunteer service was only part of the  reason she signed up, Rummler said. The other part was that "people are getting  sick and tired of these condos overloading our community."  </P></p>

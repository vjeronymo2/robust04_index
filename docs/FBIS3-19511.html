That is what the Bundesbank's  March monthly report maintains in its preamble to an analysis of  the balance of payments situation, which, with regard to  long-term capital movements, has registered a record net influx  of 198 billion German marks [DM] -- four times as much as in  1992. It reflects expectations surrounding interest rate  reductions, a more favorable return on the German mark compared  to U.S. dollar investments, currency speculation considerations,  as well investments motivated by tax considerations on the part  of German investors.    In the case of trade in goods, despite "a poor situation for  exports that carried on well into the year," there was an  improved export surplus of DM59 billion (DM33.7 billion in  1992), which stemmed from a relatively steep drop in imports.  The deficit in services fell only slightly to DM36.2 (39.4)  billion.    This was also linked to the decline in registered net  capital  yields of DM10 billion, writes the Bundesbank. Because of  services deficits, German net asset holdings abroad have fallen  by DM100 billion to DM435 billion over the period from the end  of 1990 until the middle of 1993. It was also noted that as a  result of the transfer of domestic savings to foreign capital  centers prompted by the withholding tax on interest, there was a  significant increase in capital payments "abroad," which are  actually attributable to domestic investors. Over the past few  years, German net capital yield receipts "have been too low by  several billion German marks."    Purchases of securities from abroad rose to a record gross  sum of DM246 billion. Demand was above all for public authority  bonds (DM165 billion). At the end of 1993, DM500 billion worth  of securities issued by public bodies were held abroad, that is,  almost half of such securities in circulation.    German investments abroad totalled DM91 billion gross and  thus were below last year's level (DM114 billion). The reason  for the decline was reduced interest on the part of German  savers in foreign investment certificates: Only DM11 billion  (DM58 billion in 1992) were invested in such securities. "The  tax considerations that were to a large extent behind these  investments appear to have largely come to an end in the early  part of the summer," stressed the central bank. A "veritable  sales boom" occurred at the end of the year (taxation of  half-year profits) resulting in the total of Luxembourg-based  fund certificates held by Germans between August and the end of  the year falling by almost a third to DM80 billion.</p>

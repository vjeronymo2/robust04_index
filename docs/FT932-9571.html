			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television Over 30 years ago two American film makers produced a documentary about life in the 'well of death', a slum area of Palermo, capital of impoverished Sicily. Among those whose life was examined was Angela, 23 years old and already expecting her fourth child. Now the son of one of the original cameramen goes back to discover what happened to Angela. At one level life has improved. The slum has been torn down and she lives free from squalor and imminent hunger. At another level the family is still wracked by deprivation of another kind, by crime, ill health and lack of education. (True Stories, on Channel 4 at 9.35). Another peep into a foreign culture on BBC 2 at 9.40. Under the Sun follows two young Nigerian girls undergoing the Iria ceremony through which they learn about marriage by being confined in a room for six weeks where they are fattened up and taught feminine wiles. Not a bad night for comedy. It's a pity the repeats of Keeping Up Appearances, (BBC 1 at 8.30) with Patricia Routledge, clash with Just a Gigolo, (ITV) in which the Tony Slattery has a good line in double takes.</p>

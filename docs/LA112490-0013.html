			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> HARPER CONTINUES SLOW-GROWTH PUSH;  </P> <P> MOORPARK: THE FORMER COUNCILMAN, WHO LOST HIS BID FOR MAYOR EARLIER THIS MONTH,  CONTENDS HE MAY LAUNCH HIS OWN CAMPAIGN FOR A CITY ORDINANCE.  </P> <P> Although he lost his bid for mayor in this month's election, former Moorpark  City Councilman Clint Harper is not giving up his fight to slow growth in the  area.  </P> <P> Harper, who was soundly defeated by fellow council member Paul Lawrason in the  Nov. 6 election, said if the council does not approve putting a proposed  "comprehensive planning ordinance" on the ballot in March or June then he might  wage his own campaign to do so.  </P> <P> The ordinance, proposed by Harper while he served on the council, would give  residents the opportunity to vote on major developments that would require the  city to amend its General Plan, the blueprint for future development in the  city.  </P> <P> Harper, in an interview Friday, said Moorpark voters should be the ones who  determine the city's future growth and not the council.  </P> <P> "Residents are more conservative on land-use issues than politicians," he said.  </P> <P> Harper said he plans to talk to local activist Bob Crockford about the  possibility of putting together a campaign to place the measure on the ballot.  The two were successful in getting Measure F, the city's current slow-growth  ordinance, before voters in 1986.  </P> <P> Crockford said he would be willing to work with Harper again.  </P> <P> "If there are going to be major changes in the General Plan, then people should  be allowed to vote on it," he said.  </P> <P> Controlling growth was at the center of Harper's aggressive campaign against  Lawrason, whom he continually attacked for accepting developer contributions.  Harper said accepting money from builders would only influence Lawrason's vote.  </P> <P> Lawrason has dismissed Harper's accusations, saying that the developer  contributions meant little except that he had a broad range of support in the  community.  </P> <P> "I absolutely oppose rapid, out-of-control growth," Lawrason said. "My approach  has always been one of moderation. I have no intention of changing anything  along those lines."  </P> <P> Lawrason said he will continue to vigorously support Measure F, but opposes the  concept of a comprehensive planning ordinance. He said voters elect public  officials to make planning decisions for them, and that if they don't agree  with those decisions they can vote the officials out of office.  </P> <P> Harper disagrees.  </P> <P> "By the time it took to recall a council member, a lot of changes could have  already been made to the General Plan," he said. "By then, the damage is  already done."  </P> <P> Although he has not completely ruled it out, Harper said it is doubtful he will  run for the council seat that became available with the election of Lawrason as  mayor. Lawrason's council position expires in two years. The council, which had  the option of appointing an interim member to the panel, voted this week to  wait until a special election March 5 to fill the vacancy.  </P> <P> "I personally would love to do it," but his family is opposed to it, Harper  said.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, he said the fifth seat will be the swing vote on future  development issues, including the comprehensive planning ordinance that is now  being studied by city staff members.  </P> <P> Councilman Bernardo Perez, who supports the proposed ordinance, agreed with  Harper that as it stands now the council is split on whether to place the  measure on the ballot.  </P> <P> "If I didn't run myself, I certainly would do whatever I can to elect someone  to the council with philosophies similar to my own," Harper said.  </P> <P> Harper, a physics professor at Moorpark College, said he and his family moved  to Moorpark from Van Nuys in 1977 to escape the rapidly developing San Fernando  Valley. At that time Moorpark had a population of about 4,000. It has since  doubled.  </P> <P> Harper said since Moorpark incorporated in 1983, the city has lost some of its  rural atmosphere but that "it hasn't taken that last step toward urban sprawl."  </P> <P> For that reason, he said he will continue to speak out on growth and  environmental issues. "I don't have plans to fade into the sunset," he said.  </P></p>

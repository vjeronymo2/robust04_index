			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbean commodity problems forecast to continue - A report underlining the uncertainties surrounding the region's economic outlook COMMODITY exporting countries in the English-speaking Caribbean have been warned that they will continue to suffer from the problems of weak prices and uncertain access to markets that affected output last year. The Caribbean Development Bank, in its report on the region's economic performance last year, concluded that, although some countries and some commodities had done better in 1992, there was still cause for concern over continued preferential markets for sugar and bananas and weak prices for bauxite and oil. The Barbados-based bank, which provides loans for 17 members in the region, has resources of USDollars 847m. Its major contributors are the US, Canada, the UK, France, and Germany. Although three sugar producers reported reduced output, overall production by the CDB's borrowing members grew 8.6 per cent last year to 747,000 tonnes. There was increased production by Trinidad and Tobago, St Kitts-Nevis and Guyana, with the last improving by 52 per cent. The bank said Guyana's improvement, which was despite industrial unrest, was mainly the result of the restructuring of the state-owned industry. Booker Tate of Britain is managing the industry under contract from the government. 'Guyana, for the first time in five years, was able to meet its domestic requirements, in addition to fulfilling its international contractual obligations,' the bank reported. After defaulting on export quota commitments to the EC and the US Guyana met these in full in 1992. Sugar production declined last year in Belize, Barbados and Jamaica, and the bank said this was caused by several factors including poor weather, labour disputes, and weak export market prices. The bank said the region's industry was hit last year by a cut in the US quota that saw its members' combined access falling from 70,702 tonnes the previous year to 63,231 tonnes. The bank warned its members about the effects of future cuts by the US, saying: 'More sugar will have to be sold on the world market, at prices which are substantially below the preferential prices for sales to Europe and the United States.' It reported that banana production by its members recovered last year following a 'disappointing' performance in the previous year. More favourable weather contributed to the improvement, with exports growing by 18.7 per cent to 381,000 tonnes. The improvement was more marked in the Windward Islands (St Lucia, St Vincent, Dominica and Grenada) where exports expanded by 23 per cent. 'In some countries, performance in value terms was somewhat dampened by weak prices associated with reported declines in the overall quality of fruit, and the depreciation of the pound sterling in the fourth quarter of 1992,' the bank said. The region's currencies are pegged to the US dollar. The CDB warned, however, that there were still dark clouds over the region's banana industry because of the possible loss of preferences on the European Community market. A new EC regime, guaranteeing access of Caribbean bananas, will be implemented on July 1, but is being challenged by Latin American producers. The bank said the possible loss of preferences was a 'serious threat to regional producers, particularly the Windward Islands where banana exports account for as much as 60 per cent of export earnings'. Bauxite production by the bank's members - Jamaica and Guyana - fell 5 per cent last year to 12.3m tonnes. 'World market prices for aluminium weakened in response to declining demand associated with the fragile economic recovery in the industrial countries, increased exports from Europe, changes in manufacturing technology and the disintegration of the Soviet bloc,' the report explained. The reduction was most marked in Guyana where 1992 output fell 30 per cent below the 1.3m tonnes of the previous year. Regional crude oil production in 1992 fell 5.6 per cent to 50m barrels, the bank said. Trinidad and Tobago, the main producer, reported output of 49.5m barrels, while Barbadian production rose 5.3 per cent to 478,800 barrels. Grenada, the world's second largest producer of nutmeg, after Indonesia, recorded an 11.2 per cent decline in production in 1992, to 2,235 tonnes. 'The problem is related to low advance payments to farmers which caused them not to reap the nutmeg on time in 1992, and the break-up in 1991 of the Soviet Union, a major market for the product,' the CDB reported.</p>

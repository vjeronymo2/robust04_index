			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because national nonprofits are by definition nonprofit organizations, they are eligible to apply as subgrantees to States, Federal agencies, and other grantmaking organizations. In addition, in fiscal year 1994 they are eligible to apply for national direct funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (18)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Operating grant definition.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter noted that the description of operating grants in &sect;2521.20 of the regulations refers only to new or expanded programs. The commenter suggested adding on-going support for existing high-quality programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation agrees that the statute authorizes on-going support to operate programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change: &sect;2521.20 has been revised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (19)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National direct coordination.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters were concerned that the requirement that programs coordinate with the State commissions places too much power in the State Commissions. One commenter suggested that the regulations be revised to require national program applicants to meet and consult with State Commissions and to encourage, but not require, coordination of their efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation did not intend the coordination requirement to require State Commission approval. The regulations have been revised to clarify the extent of coordination that is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change: &sect;2522.100 has been revised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (20)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dissemination of information.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (&sect;2522.210) The regulations list a number of entities through which the Corporation will disseminate information regarding available AmeriCorps positions. Several commenters suggested adding community-based organizations to this list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This change has been made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change: &sect;2522.210 has been revised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (21)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Training investment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation require the grantees to spend between 5 and 10% of any grant on staff and participant training activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation agrees that adequate training_for both staff and participants_is a critical component of any high-quality program. In order to receive a grant, a program will have to demonstrate the existence of an appropriate training program. But because the training and capacity-building needs of the various other entities eligible to apply for AmeriCorps grants vary widely, the Corporation is not setting regulatory guidelines on what percentage of those grants must be spent on training and capacity building. However, the Corporation reserves the right to set such guidelines in the applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (22)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Disaster Grants. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  &sect;2524.50. One commenter suggested that we require disaster relief grants to go through the State Commissions. The commenter argued that this would better ensure the coordination of activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation wishes to maintain flexibility on this issue and thus is not changing the regulations. For a given disaster, disaster grants may in fact flow through a State Commission. However, there also may be instances during a disaster when the Corporation would wish to distribute disaster funds directly to programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (23)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Replication grants.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter wondered why the term ``replication'' does not occur in the regulations although it occurred in the preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Replication grants are allowable and they have been added to the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change: &sect;2521.20 has been amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (24)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Matching requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requested clarification as to whether the general 25% match was inclusive or exclusive of the 15% living allowance and health care match.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The corporation agrees that the matching guidelines require further clarification, and the regulations have been amended to provide clarification. For the purposes of calculating matching requirements, there are two broad budget categories: participant support costs and other costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participant support costs are comprised of living allowances, health care benefits, and child care costs, each of which has a different matching requirement as specified below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Health Care: Corporation funds may be used to pay for no more than 85% of total health care costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Child Care: Corporation funds may be used to pay for 100% of child care costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Living Allowances: Corporation and other Federal funds may be used to pay for no more than 85% of living allowance costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

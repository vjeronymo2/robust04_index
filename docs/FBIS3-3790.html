			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Business Should Be Done According to Agreement </F> on Airport Cooperation"]    [Text] Recently, Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and  foreign minister, said that although the Sino-British talks on  Hong Kong's political structure had broken down, China was still  concerned about Hong Kong's economy and Hong Kong people's  livelihood and would do its best to cooperate with the British  side. Whether such cooperation can be realized will depend on  the British side's attitude and actions.    With regard to Hong Kong's economy and Hong Kong people's  livelihood, the first thing that requires cooperation is the  airport issue. Does the British side actually have sincerity  for cooperation? Chris Patten said: "The sincerity the Chinese  side talked about meant that the British side had to completely  comply with the Chinese side's idea." He tried to mislead Hong  Kong people and this showed an irresponsible attitude.    The attitude of the Chinese side is open and above board.  The Chinese side holds that if there are agreements between the  Chinese side and the British side, things should be done in  accordance with the agreements. China has never required the  British side to act in compliance with the Chinese side's ideas.  The agreements were reached by the two sides on the basis of  equality, mutual accommodation, and complete willingness.  Acting according to the agreements does not mean that the  British side has to be obedient to the Chinese side; instead,  this just means that the British side should respect and abide  by its own promises and should keep good faith.    China and Britain signed a Memorandum of Understanding on  the  new airport in 1991 and both sides agreed that the new airport  should be constructed at low cost and should achieve high  economic efficiency. "The Hong Kong Government is responsible  for the 10 key projects related to the new airport" and "will  not leave any financial burdens for the Special Administrative  Region [SAR] Government." "The Hong Kong Government will hold  HK$25 billion as financial reserves for the SAR Government" and  "will consult the Chinese Government if it needs to contract  loans over HK$5 billion." All this was the solemn agreement on  which neither side can go back. The British side signed the  agreement in 1991 but, after that, it has continued to distort  and negate the provisions it did not like. Did it not just  regard the agreement as a mere scrap of paper? In such  circumstances, China must resolutely safeguard the agreement.    As a matter of fact, the Memorandum of Understanding did not  include any concrete financial package. In 1991, Anson Chan  openly announced that the British Hong Kong Government had  sufficient financial capacity for the new airport projects. If  that was the case, since the memorandum had been signed, the  British side should have been able to start the projects in full  scale and there should not have been any more trouble. However,  the British side did not really want to act according to the  memorandum. It required the Chinese side to provide a guarantee  for over HK$5 billion of debt and required that talks be held on  its financial package. Why did the British side insist on  holding further talks? It just tried to gain the Chinese side's  endorsement in order to contract loans from the private  financial institutions. Because the loans will be repaid after  1997 and after the withdrawal of the British people and Hong  Kong will then be a SAR of China, without the Chinese  Government's guarantee, the financial syndicates are not willing  to arrange the loans.    The first financial package dished out by the Hong Kong  Government included HK$73 billion of "callable equity." The  second financial package included HK$45 billion in loans. The  third financial package included HK$28 billion in debts. The  fourth financial package included HK$23 billion in debts and  mentioned that the debts owed by the Temporary Airport Authority  and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation would not be included  in the debts limited by the memorandum of understanding as they  did not require Hong Kong Government guarantees. Therefore,  there were many questionable and vague points in the fourth  package and the British side should clarify them. Otherwise,  the debts can become unlimited and the talks on the financial  package may become meaningless.    The British side said that, by 1997, it would leave HK$120  billion in financial surplus to the SAR but it was unwilling to  spend this financial surplus on the airport projects. However,  the existence of thi HK$120 billion is rather doubtful. The  Chinese side held that it was not necessary to leave such a  large financial surplus to the SAR, and HK$25 billion would be  enough. The remaining amount could be spent on the construction  of the airport. Is not that a simple way to resolve the airport  financial problem? The British Hong Kong authorities are  unwilling to spend the huge financial surplus and just want to  contract loans at an interest rate of over 10 percent so that  the SAR will have to repay both interest and principal of the  debts. What is their real intention? Do they want to give the  British financial institutions a business opportunity by  enabling them to earn long-term and high-rate interest income?  The interest expenditure will have to be borne by Hong Kong  people in the future; is this a reasonable option?    It is not impossible to contract loans over the ceiling of  HK$5 billion but it is impossible to exceed the ceiling by too  much. Moreover, the Chinese side must be consulted if the loans  exceed the ceiling. The British Hong Kong authorities should be  able find some ways to quicken the pace of the financial talks  as long as they work out a more reasonable package in accordance  with the memorandum of understanding.</p>

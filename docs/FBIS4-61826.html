			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Pilyatskin report: "Russia Has To Make Friends With </F> USSR's Old Friends. Nelson Mandela Will Become RSA's First  Black President 10 May"]    [Excerpts] Work is being completed on a dais enclosed by  three layers of bulletproof glass in front of the massive  government building in Pretoria. The official inauguration of  the Republic of South Africa's new president, Nelson Mandela,  will take place here Tuesday 10 May. [passage omitted]    Russia will not be represented even by the premier.  Admittedly, Russia's Foreign Ministry has issued a statement  expressing a "sense of profound satisfaction" at the restoration  of racial and social justice in the RSA and voicing hope for the  further development of the good relations that have taken shape  between our countries. It is, however, appropriate to note that  these relations have taken shape only over the last two and a  half years, while previously the USSR and the RSA were separated  by a thick curtain of mutual hostility and enmity.    However, there were long-standing friendly ties between the  CPSU Central Committee and the ANC and in particular with the  Communist Party, which was considered one of the most dogmatic  and obedient to Moscow in the world communist movement. Money  and weapons passed down secret channels at Soviet taxpayers'  expense for the "liberation struggle" in South Africa. Groups  of gunmen were trained on USSR territory. Perestroyka put an  end to all that. And when reforms began in the RSA as well,  links with the "friends" were put on ice.    At the start of the breakup of the USSR the then Soviet  leadership just did not care about the RSA. The Kremlin forgot  to telephone Mandela when he came out of jail. U.S. President  George Bush's telephone call of congratulations was virtually  the first. The ANC leader's trip to Moscow failed to take place  five times. The invitation from Mikhail Gorbachev was either  awkwardly sent at a time when it was known that Mandela was  leaving on another foreign trip or Moscow refused to host the  South African visitor owing to internal disarray.    It is to Mandela's credit that he never made digs at the  former "luminary of socialism." He only remarked when he was  given the Nobel Peace Prize last year that the only country that  has always helped the ANC is Norway. On the other hand South  Africa's Communists abused Gorbachev roundly, in August 1991  they congratulated the putschists, and they blatantly expressed  solidarity with the Supreme Soviet in its opposition to Russia's  president. The ANC and the Communist Party in unison with  Russia's Communists protested the establishment of diplomatic  relations with the RSA and President De Klerk's visit [to  Russia].    Now that the ANC has come to power Moscow has to organize  relations from scratch. I do not think that South African  Communists, influential within the ANC leadership, will change  their views of the democratic transformations within Russia.  But one can hope for pragmatism from the new RSA president.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THE HOMELESS  </P> <P> After nearly two years, there are finally settlements of two lawsuits brought  against Santa Ana over its policy of confiscating and discarding the personal  property of homeless people who sleep in the city's parks.  </P> <P> The city settled one of the cases by agreeing to pay 14 homeless people a total  of $50,000. That should give them a financial stake big enough to find  themselves a place to live. But the agreement in the other lawsuit is more  far-reaching, because it establishes more humane policies for dealing with the  possessions of those for whom a park bench still is home.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the settlement, the city will no longer conduct large-scale  "maintenance" sweeps of city parks. Instead, crews will conduct routine  cleanups that will allow the homeless to collect their belongings and move on.  In addition, items that are confiscated will be kept at a storage facility at  Eddy West Stadium near the Civic Center area, where many homeless spend nights  after storing their belongings during the day. Previously, confiscated items  were tossed out or stored at a place across town that made recovery difficult.  This is a far better solution.  </P> <P> As one property-law specialist observed of the city's confiscation policy, "one  man's trash is another man's bedroll." When the city first launched its  confiscation program, some of the homeless lost not only bedrolls but food or  important paper work, such as discharges from the military service. Others lost  photographs of loved ones. "The little things we own, we like to keep them," a  homeless man said of the belongings confiscated from him.  </P> <P> There are an estimated 10,000 homeless people in Orange County. Many more of  them gather in Santa Ana than in Orange County's other 28 cities, which has  presented city officials with a problem. But taking the few possessions of  those with little to begin with was a cruel way to deal with the situation.  </P></p>

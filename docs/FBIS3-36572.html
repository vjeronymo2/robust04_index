			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fedor Demchenko: "Trade Unions Set Ultimatum"] </F>   [Text] The leaders of eight trade unions of the base  industries have addressed a collective message to Russian  Government head V. Chernomyrdin. The activity of the organs of  management and the government's economic policy, the message  says, are leading to the winding down of Russian industry, mass  unemployment, and the further growth of social tension in labor  collectives.    The tough financial and tax policy, the release of prices  for  energy carriers, and the drastic increase in charges for rail  shipments have led to the point where enterprises have virtually  no working capital left. The fines stipulated for defaulting on  payments (over 700 percent per annum), the message stresses, are  in excess of all sensible limits. Enterprises are obliged to  take short-term credits at commercial banks at extortionate  interest rates. As a result the labor collectives are being  plunged deeper and deeper into poverty. At the same time "a  small group of the financial oligarchy is earning gigantic  profits."    Our numerous appeals to the president and government on  problems requiring immediate solution, the message's signatories  stress, are not meeting with a proper response. Government  instructions, given the present turnover rate among leaders, are  not being fulfilled. On instructions from members of the trade  union we insist on an immediate meeting with you personally, the  message concludes.</p>

Hosokawa made the pledge in a meeting with Soglo, who  arrived  in Japan earlier in the day for a four-day visit, Foreign  Ministry officials said.    The meeting lasted nearly 40 minutes and was followed by a  75- minute dinner, both at Hosokawa's official residence.    The Japanese aid includes 565 million yen to help Cononou  National University improve its medical equipment and another  500 million yen as a nonproject grant-in-aid, the officials said.    It also includes 46 million yen as the first cultural  grant-in- aid to purchase equipment for the state-run television  station to produce educational and cultural programs, they said.    The Japanese Government has already pledged Benin a total of  400 million yen worth of aid in fiscal 1993 that ends March 31,  1994.    The aid included 100 million yen in food and 300 million yen  to increase the production of food, the officials said.    Benin, a small country in west Africa bordering Nigeria, is  a  former French colony that became a republic in 1958, changing  its name from Dahomey in 1975. It has a population of about  five million.    It was under communist rule until 1990 but is currently  boosting democratization efforts, the officials said.    During the meeting, Soglo, 59, requested Japanese political  and economic support for his nation, they said.    The president is scheduled to meet Emperor Akihito and  Empress Michiko on Tuesday. He will visit Nagoya on Wednesday  before heading home Thursday.    Soglo visited Japan in 1990 as prime minister to attend the  emperor's enthronement ceremony. He also came to Tokyo last  October to attend an international conference on aid to Africa.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / UK Company News: Comeback for Denby Pottery Private investors will be offered a slice of the action when Denby Pottery returns to the market next month, valued at more than Pounds 40m. The stone wear kitchen products manufacturer is floating through a placing and public offer which is expected to raise about Pounds 10m. The proceeds will be used to pay off the debt incurred in the Pounds 5m management buy-out from Coloroll in 1990, which was backed by venture capital group 3i. The four executives who invested Pounds 140,000 in the buy-out and 3i are expected to sell up to half their holding in Denby. Both groups will retain substantial stakes in the business. Currently, management controls 55 per cent of Denby with 3i holding the rest. Denby is coming back to the market after a 13-year absence and a series of setbacks under the ownership of, initially, Crown House and then Coloroll, which collapsed in 1990. In the last three years Denby has increased sales and pre-tax profits at compound annualised rates of more than 25 per cent and 70 per cent respectively. Pre-tax profits for the year to the end of September were more than doubled at Pounds 2.7m. Sales were 41 per cent ahead at Pounds 17.6m. The company is forecasting a substantial increase in profits for 1994.</p>

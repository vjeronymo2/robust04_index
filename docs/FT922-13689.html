			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Arts: Deadly Serious - Ballet Everything about Deadly Serious, a combined homage to Alfred Hitchcock and spoof on his films, by the aptly named 'Adventures in Motion Pictures', seems promising. The publicity material has a nice wit. The evening is divided between the performance of two 'films': Overwrought is black and white and firmly located in 1939; Rear Entry is very technicolour indeed, and evokes Hitchcock's blondes and the vertiginous perils of hanging about in high places. But alas for promise. What I eventually saw on Wednesday night was a series of production gimmicks dimly connected with the tensions and terrors of Hitchcock's film-making, which are sent up in amateurish fashion. Matthew Bourne, director and choreographer of AMP, and also one of its six dancers (four male and six female), is part of the young generation of new British dance-makers who appear more caught up with presentation than with choreography. Like Lea Anderson and her Cholmondeleys and Featherstonehaughs troupes, there is a concern with message rather than movement, with production rather then dynamic invention. In the work of an ensemble such as DV8 we can see how movement in this genre of Physical Theatre has been forged into a language capable of urgent political, social, sexual statements. With such gifted performer-creators as Laurie Booth, Julyen Hamilton, Yolande Snaith, we find dance expressive, subtle, imaginatively stimulating. 'Adventures in Motion Pictures', in Deadly Serious, as in last year's Town and Country, provides unfocused sketches that are glosses upon existing cliches. It is supposed to be the most tremendous fun - and The Place audience has a whale of a time (though memory asks 'When do they not?') - and it leaves me stony-faced. There is a certain endearing undergraduate innocence about this show - which is excellently designed by David Manners and well lit by Rick Fisher - but its conflation of Hitchcockian characters and situations is neither ingenious enough, nor witty enough, to seem more than a brief sketch that has run to mountains of self-indulgent fat. The strain of homosexual intrigue that runs through it - one in three clinches, because of the balance of sexes in the cast, is between chaps  - is singularly unlike Hitchcock. The other thing that runs through the piece is the cast - who dash about ceaselessly, but to little purpose. Adventures in Motion Pictures is playing Deadly Serious at The Place Theatre, Dukes Road, London WC1, until April 18. Thereafter, the company tours southern and south-west England through May and June.</p>

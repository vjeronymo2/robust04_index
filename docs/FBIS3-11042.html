			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Haitian internal opposition to the return of  President Aristide, in facing the political blockade imposed as  an attempt to solve the crisis, appears ready to move for real  this time, following a congress held on 11 March in  Port-au-Prince. Now the leaders of opposition parties will try  to relaunch the mobilization this week. Rothschild Francois  filed a report:    [Begin recording] [Francois] Mobilization, unity, and  reconciliation are the watchwords of the coordination committee  that issued from among the political parties at the Visa Lodge  meeting. Those political formations, mostly hostile to President  Aristide, deem the political vacuum in the Haitian executive  dangerous and abnormal. Those parties, including the MDN  [Mobilization For National Development], FRAPH [Revolutionary  Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress], and RDR [Assembly  of Democrats for the Republic] blame the state for the misery  prevailing in the country. This situation could lead to a social  explosion in Haiti, according to the analysis of those parties,  grouped together within the coordination committee presided over  by Attorney Gregoire Eugene. For this assembly of political  leaders opposed to the return of President Aristide,  mobilization is imperative right now in order to extract the  country from the crisis.    [Eugene] Facing this imminent peril, it is urgent that the  entire national population mobilize. Following the meeting at  Visa Lodge on 11 March, it has been decided to launch a national  mobilization under the motto: love, unity, reconciliation. A  nine-member coordination committee has been established to  assure coordination of this mobilization imposed by the  realities of the difficult times we are experiencing. We make a  point -- given the national peril -- of giving an essentially  national character to the efforts for a solution to the crisis.    [Francois] The coordination committee intends to hold a news  conference on Wednesday. In this meeting, which will be open to  other political groups, more should come out regarding the  strategy that the committee intends to follow to achieve this  mobilization.    According to the president of the coordinating committee,  based on the initiatives of these political formations from the  opposition, the country must come out of the crisis. [end  recording]</p>

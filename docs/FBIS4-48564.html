			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Alliance for Democracy, Aford, has today  congratulated the president-elect, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, for  winning the presidential vote, and wished him success in his new  position.    The president of Aford, Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, spoke to  reporter (Francis Chicucuzeni) today, saying he was concerned  about the regional fragmentation of this country in the  elections.

Say, he has been voted overwhelmingly by the people  of the south, southern region. And it seems the MCP [Malawi  Congress Party] are holding the (?differential), and to my  disappointment the people of the north have voted for AFORD. It  will require a political acumen, leadership which is [word  indistinct] to make sure that the country is back on track as a  solely united country. Regardless of these factors which have  been created by the result of the election, if I were Bakili I  would definitely call on the MCP, the Alliance for Democracy for  a get-together meeting to discuss this problem first before  going to [word indistinct] [passage omitted].    [(Chicucuzeni)] And what is your message now to the  supporters of AFORD?    [Chihana] The supporters of AFORD, they must not worry. The  country has chosen Bakili Muluzi as the next president in a  democratic Malawi. I and my colleagues wish him all the best  and we'll definitely support him. [end recording]</p>

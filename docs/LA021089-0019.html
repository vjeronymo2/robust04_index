			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LIGHT RAIL IN L.A. COUNTY  </P> <P> Eventually the goal for Los Angeles County should be a light-rail line on each  side of every freeway. No bus system should monopolize a freeway lane, which in  the end defeats the purpose of the freeway!  </P> <P> The cost would not be as great as condemning and buying new land for rail  routes since land already exists!  </P> <P> Furthermore, just off the freeways in the Valley, as in other areas, are office  buildings and many shopping centers. North Hollywood, Sherman Oaks, Van Nuys,  Reseda, Tarzana, Woodland Hills and Canoga Park would be centers where most  people work or shop.  </P> <P> I remember the Red Car -- Chandler Boulevard and up Van Nuys. Today you're  going to have people against such an old Red Car route! It would also serve  less people!  </P> <P> Just follow the freeways with light rail!  </P> <P> VICTOR C.

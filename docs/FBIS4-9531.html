			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 27 Apr--In a letter on 27 April to Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak and Industry Minister Marek Pol, the  Trade Union Federation of Brown Coal Mining said that its  members are suspending their participation in the strike and are  ready for negotiations with the government on demands put  forward by the union.    "Because Decision No. 30 has been annulled, the federation  strike committee is suspending its participation in the strike  and obliging enterprise commissions to withdraw from strike  committees in enterprises after internal demands are met. When  the strike has been suspended, we are open to negotiations with  the government on the union's demands", federation miners said.</p>

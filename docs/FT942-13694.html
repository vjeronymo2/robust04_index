			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: Swiss land a hammer blow on Zantac / A look at the threat to Glaxo's best-selling ulcer treatment drug Like Muhammed Ali near the end of his career, the world's best selling drug Zantac is beginning to feel the blows raining down on it. The latest opponent for Zantac's manufacturer Glaxo comes from Ciba, the Swiss drug company which has landed a blow far heavier and more potent than any before it. Industry experts and investment analysts are coming to terms with the possibility that Zantac's reign could be coming to an end more quickly than any had forecast. For Ciba appears to be neatly sidestepping the patent defences on Zantac that looked as if they would protect it from competition until 2002. The stakes are immense. Ulcer treatment Zantac is easily the world's best-selling drug. Its annual sales of Dollars 3.5bn are the equivalent of more than two-thirds the entire UK National Health Service drugs bill. It accounts for more than 40 per cent of Glaxo's sales and probably a higher proportion of its profits. Ciba's move represents 'the worst possible scenario for Glaxo and profoundly alters the outlook for the company,' said analyst Mr Peter Laing, from stockbroker Salomon. 'In the past, the introduction of a generic version of a drug has cut sales by 50 per cent in 18 months.' (Generics are unbranded versions of drugs once protected by patents.) Mr Laing forecasts that Zantac's annual sales will fall from Pounds 2.4bn next year to Pounds 1.4bn two years later. Glaxo's shares have already fallen by 16 per cent since Ciba's original announcement on March 22. Yet such challenges are not new to Glaxo. The sheer size of Zantac's market has already attracted many challengers. In the early 1990s, Canadian generics companies attacked the patent on Zantac, arguing that it was too similar to an older version of the drug to warrant a separate patent. Judges have so far preferred Glaxo's argument that the earlier version, which has never been commercialised, had been improved upon. Last year, scientists showed that bacteria are involved in causing ulcers. Because bacteria are vulnerable to antibiotics Zantac might not be needed at all. But only a proportion of ulcer patients turn out to be susceptible to antibiotic treatment and diagnosis of who might be amenable to the new treatments is still tricky. Next month, SmithKline Beecham's ulcer drug Tagamet loses patent protection in the US. There will be perhaps 10 manufacturers producing unbranded versions of the product and it seems likely that some US doctors will be prepared to switch from Zantac to generic Tagamet on cost grounds. Swedish company Astra has a newer ulcer drug, Losec, that is taking market share from Zantac. Nonetheless, the marketing power behind Zantac and its efficacy continue to drive sales: it brought in 15 per cent more revenue in 1993 than 1992. Two factors make Ciba uniquely dangerous for Zantac. Firstly, it is avoiding patent protection by making the older form of the drug, and secondly its hand has been revealed with only a little over a year to go until commercialisation. Even sources close to Glaxo acknowledge that the company's position is now 'very weak'. Neither the patent courts nor regulatory authorities seem likely to come to its defence. Mr Mark Turner, a partner of specialist healthcare law firm Denton Hall, says that a patent defence might work if Ciba's production process involved the newer form either as an impurity or as an intermediate step. It does neither, insists Ciba. Glaxo is understandably quiet about what action it might take. Insiders say that it is exploring every legal avenue in its search for a defence. But it now seems likely that the company is also devoting its energies to coping with what seems likely to be cut-price competition for its main product starting next year. It is a threat that dwarfs anything it has faced previously.</p>

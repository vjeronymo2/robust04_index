			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Arts: Gorecki, Smetana and Janacek - London concerts This was very nearly the concert of the CD - same work, same soprano soloist (Dawn Upshaw) and orchestra (London Sinfonietta), and only the conductor (Paul Daniel) different. Since Electra Nonesuch's record of the Gorecki's Third Symphony continues to sit month after astonishing month at the top of the best-seller charts, it is only natural that the Sinfonietta should wish to draw on the benefits of that popularity. This band has every right to. They paid attention to the Polish composer and his music - including him, for instance, as focus of one of their 1989 'Response' weekend series, of which the Third provided the climax - at a time when it was an act of daring to do so. Now they have been able to bill two successive Gorecki evenings at the Barbican Hall and sell every seat. At Monday's, first of the two, the atmosphere was festive, very different from the general run of contemporary music concerts (the composer autographed programmes during the interval). It would be a stuffy soul who failed to rejoice in the orchestra's moment - shared, of course, with the composer himself - of success. But I do completely fail to comprehend how exactly it has come about: how, indeed, such an acreage of sustained banality could have struck a chord with the public at large. Perhaps the high-mindedness of the banality has something to do with it: the Third Symphony, the 'Symphony of Sorrowful Songs', is an essay in what one might call 'antique' style, with stained-glass harmonies and lush string textures displayed slowly and at length, over and over again, and it obviously requires - and in the sympathetic listener encourages - an ear of faith. Played and conducted with the greatest sensitivity, and sung by Miss Upshaw with exquisite simplicity, this 55-minutes-worth worth of relentless diatonic uplift was for me, nevertheless, excruciatingly hard to take. It was preceded by the Three Pieces in Old Style, an early (1963) harbinger of the holy-minimalist Gorecki still to come, and by the lighthearted Concerto for harpsichord of 1980 (played, as ever, by the brilliant Elisabeth Chojnacka), which has very little actual music in it but at least attempts to disguise its poverty with a snappy mode of address. If the crowd-puller in London on Monday evening was the Sinfonietta's Gorecki bash at the Barbican, Radio 3 in its ever fastidious, discriminating way chose to relay instead the Festival Hall's concert of Czech music, given by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Libor Pesek. There is a feeling that live concert relays are more strictly rationed on the network nowadays and that the selection of concerts is sometimes eccentric, but certainly the quality of the RPO performances justified the singling out of this event. Pesek paired Smetana and Janacek, giving over the first half to four of the symphonic poems from Ma Vlast, the second to the Glagolitic Mass. Throughout the RPO was on first-rate form, not just in the extrovert shows of the Mass where the brass excelled, but in the quieter, sustained beauties of the Smetana poems to which Pesek gave a sense of symphonic coherence, a consistent eloquence derived from beauty of tone and limpid phrasing. Even the rhetorical charges of Blanik the last poem in this selection, had a warmth and emotional focus that placed them far above run-of-the-mill programme music. Pesek's knack of getting something extra from all his orchestras clearly carries over to the vocalists with whom he works. The Glagolitic soloists were Helen Field, Ameral Gunson, John Horton Murray and Roger Roloff, the chorus the Brighton Festival; John Scott was the organist. All were superb; if one singles out Ms Field for special mention it is for the vivid directness of her singing and fearless attack. On this evidence Pesek is less furious in Janacek than some interpreters, but wonderfully, unfailingly, vital.</p>

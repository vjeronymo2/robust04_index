			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Arts: Today's Television Given the obsession with serial killers and ghastly crimes, it was obvious that TV drama would soon turn to forensic psychology, the glamour profession of the 1990s. The forensic psychologist is a modern witchdoctor. In a paranoid society, he offers reassurance that we have mind-readers who can track down the killers in our midst. Cracker (9.00 ITV), which starts tonight, is a grim and violent detective series set in Scotland. Robbie Coltrane stars as a police shrink with uncanny 'profiling' skills and a conventionally unhappy domestic life. At this time of year, ashamed by loss of face on holiday, many of us sign up for language courses and look for subtitled imports on TV. If French has been your Waterloo, you could start with Prostitute (9.00 C4). But be warned. In tonight's programme on the bleak lives of two transvestite prostitutes, the business of gender becomes sorely confused. If you are looking for laughs, try the new comedy Get Back (8.30 BBC), about the effect of recession on working-class folk in a particularly tatty area of north London.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The newly-elected people's deputies of Ukraine have  appealed to the people and the president of Ukraine. The appeal  reads as follows:    The election to the Supreme Council of Ukraine, despite  various pessimistic forecasts, took place in the overwhelming  majority of the constituencies. This is evidence of the growing  political consciousness of the citizens of Ukraine. Their faith  makes us, people's deputies of Ukraine, especially responsible  before the people. The new Supreme Council is called to make  decisive steps that would change the state of affairs for the  better, because the situation that took shape in our country is  a crisis situation.    Taking into account the fact that the new Supreme Council  will assume plenary powers in one month's time only, and time is  pressing, we appeal to the people of Ukraine and all the  people's deputies in this critical moment to estimate the  seriousness of the political situation and its possible  consequences.    We call on the president of Ukraine to suspend, within the  framework of his plenary powers, the effect of Article 3 of the  Law of Ukraine on the early election of the Supreme Council of  Ukraine and the president of Ukraine of 24 September 1993, and  the effect of Article 2 of the Supreme Council resolution of 3  February this year on enforcing the Law of Ukraine on the  formation of local bodies of power and self-government, until  the new Constitution of Ukraine is adopted.    We are convinced, says the appeal, that such a step is  utterly necessary in the interests of the state and the people  of Ukraine.    One hundred and twenty people's deputies of Ukraine from 20  oblasts and the Crimea Republic signed the appeal.</p>

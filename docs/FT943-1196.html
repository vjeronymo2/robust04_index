			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / House of Representives to vote on finance bill Legislation intended to increase the pressure on foreign governments to open their financial markets to US banks is expected to come to a vote in the US House of Representatives tomorrow, George Graham writes from Washington. But the bill, now called the National Treatment in Banking bill, is a pale shadow of an earlier measure which drew fierce opposition from free traders and foreign governments. The new bill has been much more narrowly drawn to cover only banks, and not other areas of the financial services industry. It also abandons measures that would have given the US Treasury the power to impose sanctions on countries which do not treat US financial businesses equally. Instead, it simply requires the Treasury to publish a list of countries which deny national treatment to US banks.</p>

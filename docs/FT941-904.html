			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Dangers of western gullibility: Boris Fyodorov argues the sooner Russia receives aid, the sooner policy will change - for the worse When one reflects on the events of the past five years, one begins to doubt if the west is really interested in Russia becoming an efficient market economy with a normal democratic political system. The signals are disturbing. When Yegor Gaidar's government was pushing forward in 1992, the west was deliberating. When progress was being made in 1993, we discussed stabilisation targets. But now Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the extreme nationalist, is elected to parliament, the west talks of disbursements. Former US President Richard Nixon comes to Moscow to embrace the ex-jail birds (the leaders of last year's failed coup), who showed themselves so bloodthirsty in the recent past. This certainly confuses many people here. Russian communists go to the US - that staunch bastion of western democracy  -and lots of people are enchanted and call them social democrats. But do they read the communists' programme? Western countries issue visas to Zhirinovsky and even talk about taming him through embracing him. This smacks of Munich. Let's not forget his plans about nuking some nations, changing borders, washing soldiers' boots in the Indian ocean. US President Bill Clinton's former room-mate at Oxford, now deputy secretary of state Strobe Talbott, coins a Soviet-type slogan: 'Less shock and more therapy.' Many people in the west, it seems, prefer to close their eyes to the simple fact that there never was any shock therapy, ever, in Russia. I have the feeling that the west often sees Russia through a distorted looking-glass, and sometimes applies to Russia different criteria for what makes a democracy or a normal market economy. Today, after the agreement on the next round of financial assistance to the Russian government (via the International Monetary Fund), I again see that some in the west are misinterpreting the political situation here, and want to sacrifice economic reform for illusory political dividends. Is it not clear that, for three months, not a single reform or even a simple economic policy measure has been enacted? Is it not clear that the west is being used to bury the remnants of the reforms? Is it not clear that a change in economic policy already affects foreign and domestic policy? Is it not clear that anti-western and nationalist attitudes are becoming more and more prevalent? I believe that, in 1993, our relations with the west were developing in the right direction. For me, it was not so much money but moral support that mattered. That is why when we saw, last August, that our targets had not been achieved, I was the first to alert the IMF and our government - though it would have been easy to cook the figures and get the money. We decided not to lie to ourselves and to the world. But now that the IMF has extended the second tranche of the systemic transformation facility, on the grounds that it will be politically beneficial to the west, I say: lock up the advisers who give such counsel and throw away the key. The sooner this money is handed over, the sooner we shall see a change in policy - in the wrong direction. I recall how Mikhail Gorbachev, after each new loan, would lose interest in any kind of economic reform. The Dollars 1.5bn is immaterial to Russia, given the scale of its problems, and would be eaten up in a matter of minutes. Its importance is that it would be taken as a seal of approval on 'corrections' to the policy. This is now a purely political matter. The stakes are high. The idea is to abandon western-type economic policies, with western approval. Enemies of reform go against their very nature to curb credit in order to get the loan. The externals may be different on the outside - but the substance is the same. IMF representatives are bullied, made to wait for hours by nonentities in reception rooms, and then are treated to a lesson in geography, as a map is spread to show how big Russia is and therefore how much it needs special treatment. Please do not believe western experts who claim - just as our nationalists do - that Russia is so special that nothing from the civilised world applies to it. That is stupid: inflation is inflation in any country. Those who want Russia to move more 'gradually' than now should come here and try to live on an average Russian salary for two years. Will the west be gullible or hypocritical? Will it play the game? I do not know - but I think western taxpayers have a right to know how and to what ends their money is being spent, when they have problems of their own back home. This means that a budget should first be approved by parliament, and the new government's track record examined. The government's performance on inflation - that is, the rate for which it is responsible, not the one it inherited from last year - starts only in May, because of the three or four-month time lag between credit policies and the inflation resulting from them. There is no valid reason to hurry before being reasonably sure that this government's new virtue is real. I would not advise minimising the importance of the debt rescheduling. There are too many people in senior positions in the Russian government who think it patriotic to take as many loans as possible and then quietly plot about debt forgiveness and debt reduction. In 1993, we resisted doing this, by reducing borrowings and refusing even to talk about debt forgiveness. I do not believe in compensation for local incompetence, and sometimes corruption, in matters of external finance. I think it is important for creditors to be sure that fiscal discipline is in place, and that obligations will really be honoured. I support President Boris Yeltsin and am committed up to the hilt to the reforms. But I am sure that a weakening of the western position on stabilisation will be detrimental to my country.

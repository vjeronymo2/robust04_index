			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning the cabinet heard a thorough briefing  on the abduction of Mustafa al-Dirani, and the ministers praised  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the chief of staff on the  operation. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz adds that the  ministers heard briefings on the situation in Gaza and Jericho,  mainly by the coordinator of government activities in the  territories. It was reported that unless funds are received in  these areas, chiefly for the Palestinian police, the situation  there will deteriorate.    Prime Minister Rabin reiterated his criticism of 'Arafat's  call for a jihad to free Jerusalem, and once again rejected  'Arafat's explanation. Foreign Minister Peres was more moderate  in his remarks on the issue. The cabinet is currently dealing  with the housing problem.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0920 GMT on 22 May carries  a  similar report, live from the Prime Minister's Office by  political correspondent Udi Segal, which adds: "Ministers  Shetrit and Tzaban noted the genocide taking place in Rwanda.  The cabinet decided to express its shock in view of the murders  in Africa. Foreign Minister Peres said he would examine the  possibility of providing humanitarian aid to Rwanda."]</p>

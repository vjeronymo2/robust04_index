			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Economic Affairs on 13 January  assessed our country's 1993 achievements in protecting  intellectual property rights and found that progress was made  both in legislative and administrative measures. Minister of  Economic Affairs P.K. Chiang said that he would offer  explanations, write U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, and ask  the United States to drop Taiwan from the Section 301 "priority  watch list" during this year's review.    It is time again for the United States to carry out a review  of the Section 301 clause of the Omnibus Trade Act. Every  April, the United States publishes a blacklist of the countries  which violate intellectual property rights. During an urgent  situation last year, our country rapidly adopted the eight  reserved clauses of the ROC- U.S. agreement on the protection of  intellectual property rights but was still included on the  "priority watch list."    The Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday held a  interministerial coordination meeting on the protection of  intellectual property rights and assessed our achievements last  year in this regard. In 1993, our country adopted a cable  television law, a trademark law, and a patent law; fulfilled its  commitments to the "memorandum of understanding" (MOU) signed  with the United States, and implemented measures to prevent the  export of counterfeit goods.    P.K. Chiang said: "This year, our country will not suffer as  much reprisal pressure as last year." He will write Kantor and  ask the United States to remove Taiwan from the reprisal list.    Vice Economic Affairs Minister Li Shu-chiu pointed out after  the meeting: Our country's measures to protect intellectual  property rights were quite effective last year. We should  continue, however, the unfinished legislative work this year in  honoring the MOU. We have promised to adopt the video recording  law by January of this year, but the draft law will be submitted  to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation together with the radio  and television law.    The integrated circuit layout protection law is another bill  which will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for deliberation.  It has been decided that the industrial design law will not be  separately enacted and will be incorporated into the patent law  as an article on new design patents. The business secrets law  is being studied by the Commercial Department [of the Ministry  of Economic Affairs].</p>

			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Volvo ends Lex Irish contract VOLVO, the Swedish car manufacturer, is terminating its exclusive import agreement with Lex Service in the Irish Republic following similar moves towards direct distribution in the UK. The company has decided to end its contract with Lex four years early after launching a European marketing section in Brussels. Plans for direct distribution in Ireland by the Swedish group follow trends elsewhere in Europe set by manufacturers such as Nissan and Toyota in acquiring control of import-distribution operations held by independent franchises. Volvo will take over Lex's existing outlets and its staff will be employed by a new dealership subsidiary - Volvo Car Ireland. The deal should be completed next month if approved by European Community merger officials. Irish sales, however, represent only a fraction of Volvo's market in the British Isles. Of the new cars sold in Ireland last year, 1,351 were Volvos - 2.15 per cent of the market - compared with more than 47,000 units sold on the mainland. Mr Mark Young, assistant company secretary at Lex, said the company now hoped to import other makes of car and concentrate on private and commercial leasing. Yesterday's agreement will contribute to the Pounds 70m which Lex expects to raise this year through the sale of operations such as its European electronics components business. Lex's share price closed up 7p at 212p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "The Northern League has not fully understood the  elementary distinction between government and institutional  reform: It must be clear that the government does not in any way  have the task of reforming the institutions."    Gianfranco Fini, the leader of the National Alliance, was  replying to Umberto Bossi. Fini added that "presidentialism is  the only corner in government where federalism can exist, but  federalism does not mean overturning the article of the  Constitution which assigns primary functions to the State and  residual functions to the regions". Fini then recalled that  there could not be a parliamentary majority without either the  Northern League or the National Alliance.</p>

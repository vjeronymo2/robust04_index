			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour speech may come when Commons debates Maastricht MR JOHN SMITH may make the main Labour speech when the Commons debates the principle of the Maastricht treaty's social chapter, probably later this year. Labour party strategists are considering the move as part of an effort to increase the number of high-profile Commons appearances made by the Labour leader. Strategists feel the set-piece Commons speech remains Mr Smith's forte rather than the thrust and counter-thrust of prime minister's question time. Another possibility would be for Mr Smith to open a debate chosen by Labour on one of its allotted quota of opposition days. Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, did this once during the last parliament. The government consented last month to a separate vote on the principle of the social chapter which could take place before the bill enacting the treaty in UK law took effect.</p>

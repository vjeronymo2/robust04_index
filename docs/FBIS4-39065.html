			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Latipov: "What the Bankers Will Discuss"] </F>   [Text] The goal set by the International Banking Congress,  which will take place in Vladivostok on 12-16 September, is to  discuss the problems of establishing a solid creditworthy  regional banking system and strengthening its influence on the  process of bringing the Far East's economy into the world market  and Pacific economic integration.    The idea of the congress is supported by the Central Bank of  Russia, a number of ministries and agencies, and the Central  Bank's main administration for the Far East.    So what do the bankers intend to discuss at their congress?    First and foremost, the task is to give Asia-Pacific region  financiers a real understanding of the state of the Russian Far  East economy. There will also be a discussion of the state of  the banking business in Russia and its special features in the  Far Eastern region. The bankers will exchange experiences of  business development in the course of reforming a national  economy.    The International Banking Congress promises to be quite  representative. About 300 foreign and Russian commercial banks,  exchanges, joint-stock companies, joint enterprises,  enterprises, and organizations in the Far East have been invited  to participate. The names of just a few of them will suffice to  get an idea of how impressive this undertaking is. For instance,  among those who have already accepted an invitation to  participate are the Central Bank of Russia, the Bank of Tokyo,  the Deutschebank, Credit Suisse, the Manhattan Bank, the  Russian-American Foundation, Far Eastern commercial banks, and  others.    The congress will feature an exhibition of investment and  innovation projects. The organizational committee is ready to  accept such projects for review and assist in their placement.    It is assumed that the congress will adopt a declaration on  the basic directions of interaction between Asia-Pacific region  banks and will work out recommendations for Far Eastern  commercial banks on development strategy and prospects.    The congress organizational committee addressed future  participants: "We will be grateful to those bankers and joint  venture entrepreneurs who are able to send to the congress  organizational committee comments and proposals for improving  foreign economic activities, foreign currency regulation,  investment policy, and financial and organizational conditions.  Please contact us at 71 Svetlanskaya, [Vladivostok] 690008,  telephone 26-69-33, 22-80-19."</p>

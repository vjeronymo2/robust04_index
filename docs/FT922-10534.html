			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Ulster leaders begin fresh round of talks NORTHERN IRELAND's political leaders began talks yesterday in a fresh attempt to test whether decades of distrust in the province can yet be overcome. The resumption of negotiations at Stormont, outside Belfast, marked a reaffirmation of UK ministers' belief - or perhaps hope - that by juggling conflicting aspirations of nationalist and unionist leaders, and of the UK and Irish governments, a political solution can be found. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, acknowledged the scale of his task in a written statement - his sole public comment - talking of the province's political impasse being resolved 'step by step'. In fact the agenda, as in the original set of talks under former Northern Ireland secretary Mr Peter Brooke last summer, is far grander - exploring the 'totality of relationships' including those between the republic and Northern Ireland and those between London and Dublin. Yet no participant pretends it is a 'peace conference' to secure an early to end terrorist violence. Another Roman Catholic was shot dead in north Belfast yesterday by loyalist paramilitaries. The timetable is tight. Three months have been set aside before the next Anglo-Irish conference, which is the cut-off point because of the hostility of Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist party leader and the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, to talking while the conferences take place. Talks - also involving Mr John Hume's nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and the cross-community Alliance party - are planned for only two or three days a week. Most critically, 'strand two' of the talks - when discussion turns from a devolved government to relations between Northern Ireland and the republic - is due to begin 'within weeks'. It is the point at which the Irish government enters negotiations and a test of Unionists' willingness to talk to Dublin. It could be the breaking point. The rift may not be irreconcilable but inter-government rows do not help keep suspecting local political leaders at the negotiating table. Nevertheless there is renewed optimism. Already the talks have almost exceeded the achievements of last year, when seven weeks of wrangling delayed the start of plenary sessions. The tensions and insecurities of politicians unused to negotiations have been lessened by familiarity. Sir Patrick will make less of a feature than his predecessor of diplomatic niceties. A business committee has been set up to stop plenary sessions stumbling amid procedural rows.</p>

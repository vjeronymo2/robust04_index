			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS STOP ATHLETICS AGAIN, 5-0  </P> <P> They might be giants at full strength and full roster, but without Jose  Canseco, and now Mark McGwire, the Oakland Athletics have been reintroduced to  the rest of the pack in the American League West.  </P> <P> With McGwire joining Canseco on the disabled list Wednesday night, the suddenly  vulnerable A's went down to their second consecutive defeat at the hands of the  Angels, losing, 5-0, before an Anaheim Stadium crowd of 24,650.  </P> <P> That's one run in 20 innings for the Athletics, who have been outscored, 12-1,  the last two days. Tuesday, Bert Blyleven beat them, 7-1, with a four-hitter,  and Wednesday, Kirk McCaskill, Greg Minton and Bryan Harvey combined on a  three-hit shutout.  </P> <P> And that lower back strain McGwire had been complaining about? It turned out to  be a herniated disk, an injury that put McGwire immediately on the 15-day  disabled list. He is expected to miss a minimum of three weeks.  </P> <P> With Canseco probably sidelined through mid-May because of a torn ligament in  his left wrist, the A's find themselves in mid-April missing their lineup's  heart, a duo that produced 74 home runs and 223 RBIs in 1988.  </P> <P> Canseco and McGwire have become the Bashed Brothers.  </P> <P> And the mighty Athletics, winners of 104 games last season, have become just  another contender in the AL West.  </P> <P> "I'm sure there are some teams thinking, 'They're not the same without those  guys,' " Oakland Manager Tony LaRussa said. "Our challenge is to show that  we're still a very good ballclub without them."  </P> <P> Without them, LaRussa has been starting rookie Felix Jose in right field in  place of Canseco and will resort to Dial-A-First-Baseman to replace McGwire.  LaRussa said third baseman Carney Lansford, catcher Terry Steinbach, outfielder  Stan Javier and Wednesday's triple-A recall, Billy Beane, will all play some at  first base.  </P> <P> "It should be interesting," LaRussa said. "We've felt all along we have a deep  ballclub. Here's our chance to show it."  </P> <P> McGwire will return to Oakland today to begin physical therapy. Last year,  McGwire missed seven days toward the end of the regular season because of  similar back pain.  </P> <P> "I've had back problems most of my life," he said. "I didn't think it would be  this bad for me, (but) this was probably going to happen to me sometime."  </P> <P> The pain, caused by a spinal disk rubbing against a nerve, forced McGwire to  make a choice: Rest now . . . or pay later.  </P> <P> "If I kept (playing in this condition), I'd eventually have to have surgery  like Dave Winfield," McGwire said. Winfield, the New York Yankees outfielder,  figures to be sidelined through late July after undergoing back surgery in late  March.  </P> <P> Life without Canseco and McGwire has been difficult for the A's: Seven hits in  two days and only three hits Wednesday night -- two of the infield variety. The  only line-drive hit of the game belonged to No. 9 batter Walt Weiss, who had a  single to right field with two out in the fifth inning.  </P> <P> McCaskill, 2-0 after limiting Oakland to two hits in six innings, broached the  subject of the Bashless A's gingerly.  </P> <P> "I think it's fairly obvious their lineup is not as strong without those two  guys in there," McCaskill said. "They still have a very good team, but those  are two of the best players in baseball. They've got to miss them."  </P> <P> Angel pitchers certainly didn't. When McCaskill was removed by Angel Manager  Doug Rader after six innings because of a stiff back, Minton came on to allow  one scratch single in two innings before Harvey retired the side in order in  the ninth.  </P> <P> On a bad night for backs, McCaskill insisted his stiffness was nothing more  than "standard," adding: "I could've kept pitching. I've had a little stiffness  since my last start. It's probably due to the damp weather. It didn't worry me  one iota."  </P> <P> With Angel starters throwing complete games two of the previous three days,  Rader saw the moment as a good time to get his top two relief pitchers some  work.  </P> <P> "Taking all things into consideration, even though (the stiffness) wasn't  major, coupled with Minton and Harvey needing work, shutting him down was the  proper thing to do," Rader said.  </P> <P> By then, the Angels had a 3-0 advantage, courtesy of a two-run triple by Mark  McLemore and Dante Bichette's second home run in four days. This homer, coming  on an 0-1 pitch by loser Curt Young (0-2), was measured at 418 feet over the  left-center-field fence.  </P> <P> Brian Downing made it 4-0 with a bases-empty home run in the seventh, before  Bichette drove in the Angels' fifth and final run with an eighth-inning double.  </P> <P> Despite missing four of the Angels' first nine games, Bichette leads the club  in batting (.357) and is second in RBIs (4). He also is tied with Downing for  most home runs (2).  </P> <P> That's the kind of production the A's are accustomed to -- production they'll  have to find from new sources the rest of the month.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> It's still early, but entering Wednesday's game, the maligned Angel pitching  staff had an earned-run average of 3.00, with the five starters checking in at  3.31. Last season, Angel starters finished with a composite ERA of 4.56. "If  there's been a real bright spot so far, starting pitching is it," Angel Manager  Doug Rader said. "I'm elated. It's been as big a plus as we've had." Bert  Blyleven, 1-0 with a 1.93 ERA after Tuesday night's four-hitter, says the Angel  rotation has drawn inspiration from the heavy criticism it received during  spring training. "So much has been said about the negative part of our ballclub  being pitching," Blyleven said. "We take a lot of pride in keeping the ballclub  in every game we pitch. We're on a mission. If Mike Witt goes nine innings and  I go nine innings, it adds a sense of competition among the starters. I'm sure  Kirk McCaskill wants to go nine innings (Wednesday). All that creates positive  thinking, which is what we need."  </P> <P> Shortstop Dick Schofield missed his first start of the season because of the  chest injury he sustained Tuesday. Officially, Schofield's diagnosis is  tightness of the right pectoral muscle, which, basically, prohibits him from  loosening up his throwing arm. Schofield was available only for pinch-running  duty Wednesday night. . . . So Punny It Hurts: Z Channel broadcaster Joe Torre  watched Oakland's Curt Young brush back Glenn Hoffman with an inside pitch and  mused, "Is that called 'dustin' Hoffman?' "  </P></p>

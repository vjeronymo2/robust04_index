			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F> 1979 2429): "Why Has Corruption Within the CPC Worsened?"]    [Text] Beijing, 4 May -- Corruption is one of the biggest  evils in Mainland China today. Perhaps in order to act on its  promise to investigate and tackle serious cases, the CPC  announced on 12 April the final verdict on the sensational and  unprecedented financial swindle involving the Great Wall  Company. Shen Daifu, the former president of the Beijing Great  Wall Electric-Machinery Technology Company, was found guilty of  corruption and bribery and sentenced to death; Li Xiaoshi, a  former vice minister of the State Science and Technology  Commission, was also found guilty of accepting bribes and  corruption and received a 20-year jail term. That same day,  RENMIN RIBAO issued an editorial stressing the maintenance of  being alert to corruption in the long term, indicating the  authorities' intention to wage another long battle against  corruption.    Informed sources in Beijing revealed that the CPC's  transformation of the drive against corruption into a long-term  effort obviously has to do with the fact that corruption is  becoming increasingly serious and is growing unchecked. There  have been three onslaughts of corruption among Chinese  officialdom over the last decade or so, each worse than the  preceding one. The first occurred around the late 1970's and  early 1980's on the crest of the first mercantile tide and took  the form of abuse of power for monetary gain. The second saw  rampant "official speculation" in the mid-1980's, and the third  began in 1992 with the entry of power into the factors market  and power-for-money deals, in which credit, securities, and  property became "juicy gains" for corrupt officials.    Corruption among officials chiefly takes the form of  overseas  trips sponsored on public funds, reckless spending and waste,  graft involving huge amounts of money, increases in the number  of criminal gangs, consecutive offenses motivated by strong  greed, and increasingly open and blatant power-for-money deals.  <H5>  Corruption Within the Party Is in Fact Power Corruption </H5>   Even worse, some officials have absconded with money  obtained  through bribery and the abuse of power to foreign countries to  live comfortable lives there. Some cadres sold highly  confidential documents they spirited out of the country for huge  amounts of money, causing enormous economic losses to the  country and society and very bad political repercussions.    Increasingly rampant corruption became a target for  criticism  from all sides at the two sessions of the Eighth National  People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] as deputies and members aimed at  corruption with deafening volleys. The authorities responded by  having Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, and  Procurator General Zhang Siqing reveal details about  investigations into corruption cases to the two sessions and  announcing seven serious cases in hand: 1) the Li Xiaoshi and  Shen Daifu cases in Beijing mentioned at the beginning of this  report; 2) cigarette smuggling involving Wang Jianzhi, the  former party secretary of Rushan City, Shandong Province, Liu  Qishan, the former commercial bureau chief, and Fan Zhanwu, a  former CPPCC member in the Weihai City Prevention Bureau; 3) the  extraordinarily serious bribery and crime case in which five  bureau chiefs and 10 office heads of the Minjiang Project Bureau  of the Ministry of Power Industry accepted a 3 million [currency  not specified] bribe; 4) the extraordinarily serious case of  corruption, bribery, and misappropriation in which Gui Bingquan,  grain bureau chief in Changtu County, Tie Lin, Liaoning  Province, his deputy bureau chief Yang Maoyuan, and 23 others  accepted a 2.5 million yuan bribe. 5) the case of Guo Zhengmin,  head of Guizhou Province Public Security Department, accepting a  100,000-yuan bribe; 6) the bribery case of Chen Zhiwen, of  Beijing's Changping County Procuratorate; 7) the case of Li  Kainan, member of the Hubei Higher People's Court Judiciary  Commission, who accepted bribes.    These seven serious cases show that corruption among  mainland  party and government officials is in fact power corruption.  <H5>  Deng and Chen Urged High-level Authorities To Come to Grips </H5> With Corruption Sources said that worsening power corruption  prompted the CPC to launch another anticorruption struggle in  the summer of 1993, which was conducted under the direct command  of senior CPC statesmen.    As soon as the anticorruption struggle began, Deng Xiaoping  pointed out to the CPC leadership collective of the third  generation: "There must be a correct estimate of the extent of  corruption. Some say corruption is spreading Is it that  serious? In my view, to a considerable extent, this estimate is  accurate about some departments and areas. If the Communist  Party can lead reform, it can surely lead the masses to stop  corruption. The key lies in a firm attitude and a clear stand.  We must not let others take up the anticorruption banner and  tasks. The Communist Party must do this job well. A few years  ago, I said that it was necessary to correctly grab a number of  corrupt elements and hit them and some big figures hard. Show  no mercy to them, as long as they have committed a crime,  however highranking they are -- even cadres at the ministerial  and provincial levels. Now, let us take a look: Are there  cadres at the ministerial and provincial levels committing  crimes? I think there must be. A few decades ago I put forward  grabbing reform and opening up with one hand and hitting  economic crime with another. This, like `grabbing with both  hands' and `two hands equally tough,' was repeatedly brought up  over the last few years. It seems we did right. We may have to  persist in this for the next few decades or 100 years. In  addition, we must also stress that the anticorruption efforts  must be legislated for. Corrupt phenomena must be tackled with  the legal system and legal weapons, so that the anticorruption  effort can rely on law and will persist."    Later, Chen Yun and Peng Zhen also said that the Communist  Party would not be able to do so again if it did not pursue the  anticorruption struggle now. "Corruption eats into the  foundations of the party and turns the party against the people.  When the party is rotten and has no power to solve its  corruption problem, other people will step forward and overthrow  it as a corrupt phenomenon. We must be alert to the seriousness  of this problem. Realistically, it is the biggest threat."    Under the prodding of senior CPC statesmen, CPC General  Secretary Jiang Zemin made a startling speech on 28 February  this year at the third plenary session of the Central Commission  for Discipline Inspection on planning for anticorruption work.  He said: "The problems uncovered by the anticorruption  struggle are serious. Corruption has spread to many sectors of  social life, especially to cadres in CPC party and government  organs. Power abuse, embezzlement, fraud, stealing impounded  goods, obstruction of justice, bribery, and graft have reached  alarming proportions. The danger of the party and the country  being toppled if we are not determined to fight this tough  battle against corruption, is real enough." He also said: "We  will be toppled if we do not handle the economy well.  But--suppose the economy is doing well--we will still be  toppled if corruption spreads, graft and bribery run amok, and  the party is divorced from the people."  <H5>  Unrestrained Power Invariably Leads to Corruption </H5>   All of this suggests that the high-level CPC authorities and  senior statesmen are united in their attitude toward the  anticorruption task and are equally determined. However,  corruption has continued unabated and has even escalated  recently in some sectors. Why?    A person in Beijing political circles pointed out that this  has to do with the permanency of ruling status in Mainland China  assigned to the Communist Party. He said: Such permanency  gives the Communist Party a superior sense of "being always in a  ruling position" and prevents it from taking the erosion of its  ruling position by corruption seriously. And when corruption  becomes so serious that it finds itself unable to eliminate it  completely, it starts worrying too much about its ruling status,  so much so that it would rather cover up the seriousness of  corruption in order to retain its secure position, and it will  not allow outside political forces or social groups to question  or challenge its power and mandate to rule over the corruption  issue. It refuses outside supervision of any sort and  forestalls the formation of restraining mechanisms. Power  without supervision and checks invariably leads to corruption.    This person also said: The corruption of power within the  CPC now has developed from "power-for-money" deals in the  economic realm to "power-for-power" deals in the organization  and personnel realms. So-called "power-for-power" deals refer to  installing one's confidantes in official positions, forming  cliques, removing outsiders, and turning one's department and  system into virtual fiefdoms. They are even more harmful than  "power-for-money" deals. Therefore, if a relatively independent  supervisory organization is not set up, the struggle against  corruption can only deal with symptoms and not the underlying  cause. But if corruption, now the most serious social pollutant  in Mainland China, cannot be weeded out, the CPC will not be  immune to the danger of being toppled.</p>

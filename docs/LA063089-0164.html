			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> PAY UP, JURY TELLS DRUNKEN GAMBLER  </P> <P> A jury ruled today against a high-roller who claimed an Atlantic City casino  plied him with alcohol and painkillers, forcing him to gamble until he lost  $165,000.  </P> <P> A federal jury deliberated for about three hours Thursday and today before  finding that Shmuel Aboud, 44, of New York City must pay a $28,000 gambling  debt he amassed in 1985 at the Golden Nugget Casino-Hotel.  </P> <P> Aboud had contended he suffered from narcotic and alcohol intoxication and the  casino took advantage of his condition. The jury ruled that the Golden Nugget  acted negligently, but that the casino's action did not cause Aboud's gambling  losses.  </P> <P> "This tells the patron that they can't get drunk and blame someone else,"  Golden Nugget attorney Steven Horn said after the verdict. "We think that this  claim was totally frivolous -- a lie -- and the jury believed it."  </P></p>

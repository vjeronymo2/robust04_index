			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Peers deplore threat to defendants' right to silence The government came under pressure in the House of Lords last night to provide new safeguards for defendants in criminal cases who continue to exercise the right to silence when questioned by the police. Lord Alexander of Weedon, the Conservative peer who is chairman of National Westminster Bank, joined other leading lawyers in criticising proposals to permit juries to draw inferences from a defendant's refusal to respond to police or give evidence in court. Lord Alexander, who is also chairman of the all-party law reform group Justice, said the proposed change to the right-to-silence procedure amounted to a 'charter for unlimited police interrogation'. The criminal justice and public order bill was given an unopposed second reading, but the government faces opposition when the right-to-silence clauses are debated during the committee stage. Viscount Runciman - the crossbencher who presided over the royal commission whose majority report opposed any change in the right to silence - said the bill would lead to an increased risk of wrongful convictions. He said that if the change was introduced experienced criminals would continue to remain silent. Trials would take longer, he said, involving additional costs of between Pounds 36m and Pounds 60m a year. Lord Runciman said those who believed police malpractice had been eliminated were not living in the real world. Support for the bill came from Lord Rawlinson, attorney-general in a former Tory government, who said it introduced a 'rightful change'.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / This Week: Television If our heads were screwed on we wouldn't have our feet planted so firmly in the arms industry. That, in simple form, is the argument made by campaigning journalist John Pilger in Network First (Tuesday, 10.40-11.40pm, ITV). Pilger, who reduced the world to shocked silence when he came out of Cambodia with pictures of skulls piled upon skulls, turns to polemic with a piece that looks at our dependence on weapons manufacturing (it soaks up 50 per cent of Britain's R&amp;D budget and employs 10 per cent of its workers). He talks to the men who turn a blind eye when weapons are sold to our enemies. Omnibus (Tuesday, 10.15-1.25am, BBC1), the leading arts series, devotes a two-hour special to Pink Floyd. The programme will trace how a pop band with a pop image became the exact antithesis as a result of deaths and drug abuse. Pink Floyd have been credited with the first concept album and producing the most spectacular concerts. There will be a chance to assess the latter with footage from the group's sell-out concerts. Last year the parish church of Yately in Hampshire saw the arrival of 1,500 mourners for the funeral of 28-year-old Sean Devereux, an aid worker in Somalia, who was killed after criticising the local war lords, as well as the US marines then stationed there. Peter Kosminsky, who made Shoot To Kill and The Falklands War, directs The Dying Of The Light (Wednesday, 8.00-10.00pm, ITV). The Trial (Friday, 9.00-9.50pm, BBC2) is an engrossing look at legal procedures. It is as gripping as any court-room drama, with an added frisson because it is unscripted. This opening programme follows a murder trial and tails the accused into the subterranean chambers below the courtroom when he talks to his counsel. The series required much smooth-talking; the producer even volunteered to play for the Law Society football team. In 1566, Elizabeth I announced a national lottery to renovate English ports, but it is not recorded who hosted the draw. Four centuries later, it is impossible to escape the brouhaha surrounding the draw for The National Lottery Live (Saturday, 7.00-8.00pm, BBC1), hosted by Noel Edmonds. ITV isn't taking any chances. It has scheduled its main attraction of the evening, Diana: Portrait Of A Princess (Saturday, 8.00-9.00pm, ITV), to start after Edmonds has finished. The Princess Of Wales has allowed the cameras to follow her for nine months; interestingly, the deal was struck weeks after she announced that she was withdrawing from public life.</p>

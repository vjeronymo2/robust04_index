			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPENING FOR LAVISH POST OFFICE DELAYED  </P> <P> The much-anticipated opening of the lavish new Beverly Hills Post Office on  Maple Drive has been delayed at least until October, postal officials said.  </P> <P> The four-story structure, which will include underground parking, is nearly  complete, but construction crews apparently underestimated the time it would  take to finish the final phase of the project.  </P> <P> When the post office is finished, it will become the main postal facility in  Beverly Hills, replacing the one on Crescent Drive. Postal officials said  Beverly Hills residents can expect faster mail service once the building is  completed because city postal workers will move back there from their temporary  office in West Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Observer: Potted shrimp Good news for barbecue-owners. The Minneapolis Grain Exchange is planning to launch a black tiger shrimp futures contract later this year. When used in conjunction with an existing contract on white shrimp, it should now be possible to buy and sell contracts covering around 90 per cent of world's shrimps. With 300 investors playing the white shrimp contract, it seems only a matter of time before some big fish start chasing up the black tiger shrimps.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Aissa Garcia and Roverto Gili] </F>   [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 8 Jun (PL) -- Liberal  presidential candidate Ernesto Samper, 44, today stated his  intention to continue his country's ties with Cuba and to oppose  the U.S. blockade on the island if he becomes president in the  next elections.    I am going to maintain the ties President Cesar Gaviria  Trujillo restored, because in this era of pluralism that Latin  America -- and we hope Colombia as well -- is living there can  be no country with which we do not have relations, Samper said  during an exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA. "My  irrevocable decision," Samper added, "is not just to maintain  open relations with the island but also not to accept any  measure that entails increasing the difficulties the Cuban  people are already experiencing."    I am totally opposed to the (U.S.) blockade and any measure  that worsens the living conditions in that country, Samper, the  Liberal presidential candidate in the runoff elections to be  held on 19 June, stated. Samper's sole opponent this time is  Conservative Andres Pastrana. The two ran in the first round on  22 May in a field with 16 other candidates, but neither one was  able to garner 51 percent of the votes, as the Constitution  establishes.    Samper also said that he will try to bring about a change in  the agenda of the Nonaligned Movement to bring it in step with  the times. As for his national platform, Samper said the only  way to legitimize the economic opening process in Latin America  is through social investment. I do not see, he stressed, any  other way that it may trickle down and make everybody feel part  of the economy.    The Liberal leader ran for president in 1990, but current  President Gaviria won the primaries. On the eve of those  elections, he was the victim of an attack in which he was shot  11 times. Four of those bullets are still lodged in his body.  Colombian news media have reiterated that his Conservative  adversary in the current elections is using or repeating the  programmatic budgets Samper had outlined earlier. "He  (Pastrana) has a sort of guilt complex over everything he has  copied this past year, but it is sufficient to see what his  platform is: pretty reactionary, neoliberal, and prehistoric,"  he commented.    Samper, a lawyer and economist, met with PRENSA LATINA  envoys  in his main office shortly before leaving for the town of  Toribio, some 60 km south of Bogota, the site of a strong  earthquake registered on Monday where approximately 150 persons  lost their lives, although the tragedy may leave an even higher  toll.</p>

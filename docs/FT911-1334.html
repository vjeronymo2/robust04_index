			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Microvitec fails to make inroads into Logitek THE HOSTILE bid by Microvitec, the USM-quoted computer peripherals manufacturer, for Logitek, which provides computer services, reached a temporary deadlock after Microvitec failed to increase substantially its stake despite a second extension of its offer deadline. Microvitec announced that it bought Logitek shares on the market at 17 1/2 p on Thursday, bringing its stake to 21.12 per cent. The deadline is May 9. After issuing a defence document in early April, Logitek has made no further comment on either the bid or its results for the year to end-March. It warned earlier that profits would be affected by difficult conditions in the second half. Over the weekend, it passed its last opportunity - the 39th day after the official offer was made - to make a new statement on its financial position in response to the offer. Mr James Bailey, chairman of Microvitec, said the refusal of Logitek to make a statement regarding its results, was a 'poor show' for its institutional shareholders who have been waiting for such a statement on which to base their decision.</p>

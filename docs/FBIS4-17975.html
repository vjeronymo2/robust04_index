			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Sergey Oleynik] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 Apr -- "I would describe the current  state of Russian-Irish relations as excellent," said Irish  Deputy Prime Minister of Foreign Affairs Dick Spring, in an  interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. Spring is in Moscow  on an official visit.    "I expect to see progress in two directions as a result of  the present visit: on the political front and in the economy,"  Spring stressed. "For the first, a broad range of international  problems -- among them, reform of the UN, disarmament,  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, and the latest events in  Russia and the region -- are to be discussed at tomorrow's  meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. On many  of these issues, our positions are very close and we hope to  strengthen the mutual understanding we have achieved and to map  out prospects for future work."    One important practical result of the visit should be the  conclusion of a bilateral agreement on avoiding double taxation.  "Today, I had meetings with representatives of Irish business  circles in Moscow," Spring said, "and all of them drew my  attention to the importance of adopting a document of this kind.    "Generally speaking, we are very proud of the successes of  Irish business in your country," Spring emphasized, "and are  doing everything we can through diplomatic channels to assist  it." Muscovites are well aware of Irish company Aer Rianta's  joint ventures -- the Irish House on Arbat Street and the Duty  Free shops at Sheremetyevo II and in a number of the capital's  hotels. Other Irish companies are following Aer Rianta's lead.  I note the expansion of the Garden Ring supermarket chain in  Moscow.    Ireland is also involved in projects to develop Russian  management and rebuild the food sector, the municipal economy,  and the services sector, including those being implemented  within the European Union's programs. "But the main thing is  that Irish businessmen are optimistic and are ready to expand  their activities in Russia. I share their optimism," the deputy  prime minister concluded.</p>

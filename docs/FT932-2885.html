			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Russia's quest for a future guaranteed in writing RUSSIA'S constitutional convention broke up yesterday without meeting President Boris Yeltsin's deadline for finalising a new draft constitution, a task which a conciliatory commission will now try to complete over the next 10 days. The 700 delegates, including heads of regional administrations and parliaments, political parties, and different interest groups, are due to reconvene on June 26. A statement adopted by a majority of delegates simply confirmed that they supported the goal of a 'free, law-based, secular state whose highest value was the individual, and his inalienable rights and freedoms'. The conciliatory commission of 60 representatives will try to iron out differences among delegates over what changes should be made to President Yeltsin's draft and what should be added to it from parliament's rival draft. In addition, under the direction of President Yeltsin's chief of staff, it will seek to elaborate a mechanism for adopting the constitution if the Congress of People's Deputies, or full parliament, fails to adopt it, as well as rules for early elections to a new parliament provided for by a new constitution. 'The convention is like a sword of Damocles hanging over the Congress,' said Mr Kakha Bendukidze, a leading entrepreneur and delegate. While falling short of its master's aims, the convention was at least remarkable for what it did not give away - and that is Russian statehood. In his haste to get a new constitution adopted against the wishes of the Congress of People's Deputies, it had been feared that Mr Yeltsin would make too many concessions to the Russian Federation's constituent republics. In the event, the 20 republics, created by the Bolsheviks to give Russia's ethnic minorities a semblance of statehood even though they account for just 18.5 per cent of the population, had every reason to be upset with yesterday's closing statement. Although it is not clear whether this was a tactical manoeuvre or a hardening in Mr Yeltsin's stance towards the republics, the statement dropped a reference to them as sovereign states, but the 66 regions, which want at least equal rights to the republics in the economic sphere, as mere 'state formations'. This prompted leaders of three of the biggest republics, Yakutia, Tatarstan, and Karelia to threaten to stay away from the convention when it reconvenes next week. In his closing speech, Mr Yeltsin warned the republics against pressing for too much independence, saying this could lead to their own break-up. It was a sign of his confidence that deputies would be less of a problem than the republics that Mr Yeltsin simply taunted parliament for talking of holding its own rival constitutional convention in July. 'Our work is going so swiftly that we will be finalising everything in June,' President Yeltsin claimed.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STUDENT DISPUTES IMAGE OF WESTLAKE  </P> <P> I am currently a senior at Westlake High and am enjoying the success of our  football team.  </P> <P> Our team has worked hard all year and it is finally paying off.  </P> <P> One of the bright spots on our team has been quarterback Todd Preston. I am  happy to see that Todd is getting the attention he deserves. However in Jeff  Riley's article of Oct. 25, I found the means by which you praised him  unforgivable. I am referring to the blatant stereotyping of Westlake students  in order to show Preston as the kid who has simple tastes as opposed to the  "Westlake" student.  </P> <P> Todd Preston sticks out at Westlake as much as a snake does in 10-foot grass.  This may come as a surprise, but the average Westlake student does not own a  BMW, aspire to be a corporate lawyer, or take part in the "Westlake fashion  world."  </P> <P> Some of us drive old cars, seek middle-class jobs and wear T-shirts and shorts.  I'm not too sure where the Westlake in the article is, but the school I attend  is totally different. Maybe the next time you write about our school, you  should come and see what Westlake is all about.  </P> <P> PHILLIP ATKINSON  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- A cut in key lending rates  by the German Bundesbank will stimulate Germany's economy and  will be generally helpful for the world economy, a Bank of Japan  (BOJ) source said Thursday [14 April].    Japanese financial market sources expressed surprise at  reports out of Frankfurt on the rate cut, but said the scale is  small and unlikely to affect foreign exchanges.    In Frankfurt, the German central bank announced it will  slash  its discount rate to 5.00 percent from 5.25 percent per annum,  and the Lombard rate to 6.50 percent from 6.75 percent per  annum, effective from Friday.</p>

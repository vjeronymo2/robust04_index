			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / European banks issue Emu warning European banks warned yesterday that European monetary union (Emu) would be impossible before the next century because the banks would require at least five years to plan for a single currency after the Emu starting date was announced. The warning came as EU finance ministers admitted that all but two EU members were in breach of the Maastricht treaty's rules on excessive deficits and government debt, two of the most exacting criteria for achieving Emu. Members of the European Banking Federation said that they had warned the European Commission that the switch from fixed exchange rates to sole use of the European currency unit (Ecu) would require longer than officials anticipated. The federation is currently surveying banks in EU member countries in order to provide evidence to the commission that Emu will take several years to implement. The results of the survey should be presented by the end of the year. The Emu timetable calls for 'rapid introduction' of the Ecu as the single currency following the start of the third stage of Emu, when exchange rates are locked. This is due to take place between the start of 1997 and the start of 1999. Mr Alan Kettley, chairman of the federation's committee on Emu, said that commission officials appeared 'still wedded to their timetable' but banks were trying to persuade them that the technical changes required were too large. Mr Kettley said that banks would prefer a 'big bang' approach, under which participating countries switched from their domestic currencies to the Ecu rather than having a dual currency system for a period to smooth the way. He said that large retail banks would require the most time to make technical changes such as altering cash machines and computer software. It would be bound to take much longer than switches such as British currency decimalisation. Leaders of the British Bankers' Association said that they would prefer the UK to participate in monetary union because it would help banks. EU ministers yesterday accepted a commission recommendation that only Ireland and Luxembourg fulfil the criteria which call for annual deficits to be less than 3 per cent of GDP and accumulated debt to be less than 60 per cent of GDP. The commission will offer recommendations for corrective action to the 10 other EU members at a meeting of finance ministers in Luxembourg on October 10. But ministers may split over whether to publish the recommendations. Mr Henning Christophersen, economics commissioner, said he favoured publication as a means of stepping up public pressure on government; but Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said it was a matter for the Council. Mr Waigel, who chaired the meeting in Brussels, said the fact that states were willing to submit to the 'excessive deficit' procedure underlined a consensus for reducing public borrowing and managing national finances responsibly. The agreement to remove Ireland from the excessive debt procedures came amid recognition that it has made considerable progress in reducing its stock of debt, from around 116 per cent of GDP in 1987 to 89 per cent of GDP this year. Mr Bertie Ahern, Irish finance minister, said the Dublin government was determined to be in a position to join the first group of countries trying to create a single currency before the end of the century.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (15): Smoke gets in their eyes - Fuel and power are a marketing nightmare The restructuring and privatisation of eastern Germany's electricity and brown coal sector was arguably one of the greatest challenges facing the Treuhand and the federal government. Brown coal, or lignite, exists in large quantities in Germany and is reclaimed by open cast mining mainly for use in power stations. Faced with the agonising choice of opening the sector to the market or protecting jobs, the compromise agreed in August 1990, between the former east German government, the Treuhand privatisation agency, and west Germany's utility companies ensured that eastern Germany's energy sector would not be exposed to the full rigours of real competition. The Treuhand had inherited two huge and notoriously inefficient fields - Laubag in the states of Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt, and Mibrag, in Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony. Employing more than 110,000 people before unification, productivity at the two fields was at least 50 per cent below west German levels, even though east Germany's per capita energy consumption was among the highest in the world, exceeding west Germany's by more than 25 per cent. The potential for waste was enormous. Furthermore, the former east German communists had made brown coal mining a top priority, but failed to allow for the effects on the environment by working out a coherent strip mining plan. By 1989, brown coal accounted for 70 per cent of the region's primary energy consumption. A third of east German railway capacity was engaged in serving this single industry. The Treuhand also inherited the chain of filthy, polluting power stations which ran on brown coal. The plants, run by Veag, east Germany's main electricity company, is due to be privatised later this year. The Treuhand's scope for privatising the electricity sector was restricted from the beginning by the Stromvertrag, or Electricity Contract between the former west and east German governments. Signed in August 1990, it authorised west German utilities to own 51 per cent of east Germany's 15 utilities groups (all under Veag), with the remaining 49 per cent held by east Germany's municipalities. In return, the west German utilities, which include RWE, PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk, would undertake a large investment programme for Veag. To underwrite investments of about DM46bn in east Germany's electricity network, the Stromvertrag stipulated that east Germany's regional utilities must, over the next 20 years, buy 70 per cent of their energy from Veag. Meanwhile, Rheinbraun, RWE's brown coal subsidiary, began assembling a west German consortium to buy east Germany's Laubag brown coal fields as the fuel source for Veag. Laubag will fuel Veag. As for the Mibrag fields, it had been sold last December to an Anglo-American consortium comprising Britain's PowerGen, NRG of Minneapolis, and Morrison-Knudsen of Idaho. Dozens of east Germany's local councils had challenged the Stromvertrag at Germany's Constitutional Court on the grounds that they had the right to 100 per cent of the assets, and not just the 49 per cent stake bequeathed to them in the Stromvertrag. They were overruled. Veag's ownership structure remains intact. In the restructuring of the electricity and brown coal sector, the Treuhand had to establish one criterion: that the value of Laubag and Veag - both interdependent in the sense that Veag relies on Laubag's coal, and both have the same buyers - could not be played off against each other. Since electricity prices in Germany are among the highest in the European Union, there were fears that the bidders for Laubag would beat down the Treuhand with the aim of concentrating on extracting large profits from Veag's electricity sales once the privatisation deal had been closed. After endless negotiations, the settlement for the sale of Laubag and Veag is nearly complete. Last February, RWE, and the other utilities agreed in principle to buy Veag for DM8bn, while Rheinbraun will make a down payment of DM2.1bn for Laubag, with a commitment of a further investment of DM6bn over the next 20 years. In all, Laubag's current work force, down from more than 60,000 to just under 12,000, will be further reduced to 7,000 by the year 2000. Veag, which before unification had a work force of around 29,000, now employs 14,500, and the numbers will continue to fall. Treuhand officials argue that, given the constraints of the Stromvertrag, they attained their twin goal of securing jobs and privatising the industry. Nevertheless, once Veag and Laubag is finally privatised, it will give west Germany's utilities a virtual monopoly over the generation and distribution of electricity throughout east Germany. Mr Jurgen Stotz, a member of Veag's board, staunchly defends the Stromvertrag and says that even if he could start again to restructure Laubag and Veag, he would not radically change what had already been done. 'We were faced with a political and social problem,' he explains. 'We had to find a way of securing a future for brown coal, a DM40bn investment programme to upgrade, or build a total of 12,300 megawatt capacity (most of it reliant on brown coal) and at the same time have a programme to introduce a massive recultivation policy.' Mr Stotz added that when the restructuring is complete, the east's energy sector, including the brown coal fields, will not be subsidised, unlike west Germany's hard coal, each tonne of which is subsidised by about DM180 to keep coal imports down - 'what we have done in eastern Germany will have been worth it,' he said. Nevertheless, some energy experts still ask whether it would have been possible for Bonn to revise the Stromvertrag in a way which would open Veag and Laubag to international competition, thus giving the east German consumer cheaper electricity as well as making eastern Germany the catalyst for opening up the country's energy sector to competition.</p>

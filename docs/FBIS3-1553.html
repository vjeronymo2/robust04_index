He told local journalists that he was confident of the  future  of China's long-term development.    Lee also expressed optimism on the prospect of  Sino-Singapore  ties, saying that great potential exists in bilateral  cooperation since the economy of the two countries is  mutually-complementary.    He said that since Singapore is short of land, and the labor  costs are very high, it needs to export its capital, technology  and management expertise.    Thus, Lee added, to develop friendly cooperation with  foreign  countries, including China, is part of Singapore's overall  strategy.    Lee and his party arrived here on Thursday [24 February].    Yesterday, Zhang Lichang, mayor of Tianjin, gave Lee a brief  introduction to the development of this largest industrial city  in north China.    Lee also visited Tianjin's technology development zone and  Tianjian port.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: RMC sparkle Having underperformed the market as a whole by some three percentage points this month, building materials sprang to life yesterday following good interim results from RMC Group which pushed the shares up 19 to 927p. The shares are a notoriously tight market and only 243,000 changed hands but the stock was heavily in demand, backed by an upgrading of profit projections from a broad range of securities houses. BZW is now pitching for Pounds 252m pre-tax for this year, up from Pounds 220m previously. But the stockmarket consensus is probably closer to Pounds 240m. The excitement in RMC washed over on to Redland which gained 18 to 508p and Tarmac, 6 1/2 higher at 146p. Both companies unveil interim statements next week.</p>

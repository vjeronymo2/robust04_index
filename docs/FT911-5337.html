Results due THIS week sees yet more results from construction and building materials companies. Attention will focus not so much on profit falls but whether any more rights issues appear. Average forecasts for Blue Circle, due on Thursday, suggest pre-tax profits of about Pounds 195m last year compared to Pounds 231.8m in 1989. Higgs &amp; Hill is expected to report between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m (Pounds 26.5m) on Wednesday, barring increased provisions on commercial and residential property. Trusthouse Forte, the leisure group, is expected to report a 20 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to around Pounds 210m (Pounds 260m) for the year to end-January on Thursday. However, much of the fall will reflect lower profits on property sales of perhaps Pounds 10m compared to Pounds 45m. Lep, the freight forwarding and security company reporting 1990 results on Thursday, must regret that Mr Michael Ashcroft's ADT, now the subject of a lawsuit from the Canadian company Laidlaw, holds 27 per cent of its shares. The market will not take much notice of its profits while that drama hangs over the stake. Nevertheless, analysts expect Lep to report a rise in pre-tax profits to about Pounds 33m (Pounds 26.5m). Interim results to the end of February from Albert Fisher, the acquisitive fresh food distributor, also due on Thursday, are expected to show Pounds 44m pre-tax (Pounds 19.9m). Much of the improvement will come from interest receivable. Of more concern to the market are questions over the sudden departure of Mr Keith Brackpool, the head of the US business.

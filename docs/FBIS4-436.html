			<p>BFN     [Text] Concerning the repatriation of the expatriate  community in Rwanda, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and the  UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda [UNAMIR] today signed an  agreement to make the repatriation operations easier. Here is a  summary of the agreement in three points:    1. The beginning of hostilities between RPF combatants and  soldiers of the presidential guard led to some foreign countries  asking for their nationals to be evacuated from Rwanda.    2. The RPF commits itself to facilitating the evacuation  operation as long as the following conditions are respected:    A. The evacuation operation will last 48 hours as of  0700 on 12 April.  B. Foreign troops charged with carrying out the evacuation  operations will be organized in convoys and accompanied by  UNAMIR observers.  C. UNAMIR will inform the RPF, at least one hour  beforehand, of the distances to be covered and the itinerary to  be followed by the convoys, and also the approximate duration of  the various operations.  D. The RPF will authorize the passage of convoys under its  control and will stop fighting along the axes used by the same  convoys.  E. UNAMIR will verify that these RPF conditions are  respected and will report the slightest incident to the RPF in  the shortest possible time.    3. At the end of the evacuation of the expatriate  community, foreign troops who are not members of the UNAMIR will  have a period of 12 hours to leave the country. It is UNAMIR's  duty to inform the foreign troops deployed in Rwanda for  evacuation operations that they must respect the terms of the  agreement.    The agreement, whose contents have just been read, was  signed  between the RPF and UNAMIR today. Seth Sendashonga, youth and  culture minister in the broad-based transitional government  signed on behalf of the RPF and Major General Romeo Dallaire  signed on behalf of UNAMIR.</p>

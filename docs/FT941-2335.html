			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / More US aid for Kiev to disarm Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, yesterday promised Ukraine an additional Dollars 100m (Pounds 68.4m) to help dismantle its nuclear warheads and finance defence industry conversion, Reuters reported from Kiev. Mr Perry's visit is part of a broader American effort to reward Ukraine for its decision last month to give up its nuclear arsenal. The three agreements he signed in Kiev earmark Dollars 50m to help dismantle the nuclear missiles in Ukraine, Dollars 40m towards the conversion of Ukraine's powerful military industries to civilian production, and Dollars 10m to fund tighter security for the shipment and storage of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Mr Perry's assertion that America's relationship with Ukraine 'is of great strategic importance to us' was a welcome signal for his Ukrainian hosts. The Ukrainians have been feeling increasingly threatened by their Russian neighbours and are eager to build stronger ties with the west.</p>

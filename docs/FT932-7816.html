			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: ScottishPower There is clearly something to be said for being first in the privatisation queue: nervous ministers and merchant bankers tend to err on the side of caution when making business assumptions and pricing offers. It is thus ScottishPower's misfortune to have been the government's third attempt to price correctly the UK electricity industry. The Treasury has managed to truss the business so that it has neither the slack RPI caps of the regional electricity companies, nor the generous dividend cover of the generators. Small wonder, then, that the shares have underperformed the FT-A electricity sector since privatisation. Yesterday's figures give some support to those who argue that ScottishPower can start to make back some ground. Underlying profits growth was 18 per cent, and the expansion of the interconnector between Scotland and England will provide a growing stream of unregulated earnings. The company's management is also making strides to throw off the cosy pre-privatisation culture. Yet there are worries - most notably the failure to achieve the rate of return on the electricity transmission business projected at the time of flotation. Turnover growth is also likely to be sluggish unless some fierce Scottish winters spark demand. Despite the interconnector, there is little reason to suppose that the shares can yet move to a below-market yield.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / People: Finance moves The Rt Hon Tim Renton MP has become parliamentary consultant to ROBERT FLEMING HOLDINGS. ***** John Fenn has been appointed London representative of the BANCO ECONOMICO of Salvador, on the retirement of Gerald Walkden. ***** Derek Tullett has become president of TULLETT &amp; TOKYO FOREX INTERNATIONAL GROUP and Rick Magee chairman. Mark Perkins has been appointed to the board of Tullett &amp; Tokyo Forex (London). ***** David Gillespie has moved from BZW to be finance director of QUILTER GOODISON COMPANY. ***** Allied-Lyons, the international food and drinks group, is continuing to mend its fences with the City. Miles Rivett-Carnac, 59, a deputy chairman of Barings, has been appointed a non-executive director. Michael Jackaman, who took over the chairmanship of Allied-Lyons following the Pounds 147m currency trading loss last year, says that Rivett-Carnac's extensive international background in merchant banking and investment will bring a valuable extra dimension to board deliberations. Rivett-Carnac is the second non-executive to be appointed to the board since Jackaman took the helm last year. John Robb, Wellcome's chief executive, was appointed in October and other new non-executive faces are expected. Jackaman says that he would like the number of executive and non-executive directors to be roughly equal. New directors will be appointed for three years, with the option of renewing their term for another three years. Jackaman first met Rivett-Carnac when Barings was one of the advisers on the group's Hiram Walker acquisition. However, he stresses that Barings is not retained as Allied-Lyons' permanent financial adviser. Given that Rivett-Carnac is close to retirement, Jackaman says he thinks there is no conflict of interest in having the chairman of one of the City's bigger fund managers on his board.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Summary] The Trade Ministry has reported that Singapore  is currently Cambodia's most important trade partner. Up to 40  percent of all imported goods on sale in Cambodian markets are  from Singapore, which also tops the list of countries bringing  in major goods such as oil worth around 350 millions dollars  [currency not further specified]; around 20 millions dollars  worth of construction materials; and several other millions of  dollars worth of fabrics, television sets, video machines, and  other consumer goods. After Singapore, Vietnam brings in about  20 percent of all goods, the most expensive of which is oil.    Apart from these two countries, which hold 60 percent of the  Cambodian market, there is Thailand. Imported Thai goods  include construction materials, cement, iron bars, fabrics,  canned food, and other consumer goods. Imported goods also come  from Japan, Hong Kong, the PRC, Taiwan, and Malaysia. Cambodian  goods make up only 10 percent of the market; they include fish,  meat, vegetables, rice, and a small quantity of handicraft items.    According to the Trade Ministry, Cambodia exports only four  goods: natural rubber, aquatic products, soybean, and sawn wood.  The latter has been banned by the government since April. Other  agricultural products have been exported but so far only  surreptitiously. The authorities therefore are not yet in a  positon to check the volume of these goods and cannot yet  include them on the export list.    Some economists have predicted that Cambodia could export a  lot of agricultural products if security is not a major problem  for farmers.</p>

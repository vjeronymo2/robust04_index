			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES 100;  </P> <P> THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> WHO, WHAT &amp; WHERE;  </P> <P> DIGGING FOR DATA: HOW IT ALL CAME TOGETHER;  </P> <P> RESEARCHERS PORED OVER INFORMATION ON 830 CALIFORNIA COMPANIES TO UNCOVER THOSE  THAT MET CRITERIA SET BY THE TIMES AND MZ GROUP.  </P> <P> This third annual edition of The Times 100 is designed to provide a systematic  look into the dynamics of California business by ranking the performance of  companies headquartered in the state.  </P> <P> The information was collected and analyzed by MZ Group, a business analysis and  database publishing firm in San Francisco (415-543-8290) headed by Mansoor  Zakaria and Kevin Colosimo. MZ's research was coordinated by Helen Arrick.  </P> <P> MZ Group gathered information on 830 California-based companies whose stock is  publicly traded, relying on databases, corporate and government reports, a mail  survey and direct telephone contact with company representatives. Certain  historical and other selected data were provided by Standard &amp; Poor's  Compustat, Warner Computer Systems and IDD Information Services.  </P> <P> The tables generated by MZ were reviewed closely by Times editors and  reporters. Criteria for the rankings were developed by The Times and MZ Group.  </P> <P> MZ Group used financial data as reported at a company's fiscal year-end for  years 1987, 1988 and, if available, 1989. If 1989 fiscal year-end data had not  been reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the most recently  reported four quarters were used. (The Exceptions table on Page 46 lists  companies for which this applies).  </P> <P> If a company's fiscal year ends between January and May, its financial results  are reported for the previous calendar year. For example, the financial data  for a company completing its fiscal year in February, 1990, will be reported as  1989 results.  </P> <P> Financial data from 1988 and 1987 has not been restated for acquisitions and/or  discontinued operations. This allows the reader to see actual historical growth  for the company, whether from internal growth or through acquisitions.  </P> <P> A few companies have majority-owned subsidiaries that are traded as separate  entities. The financial results for these subsidiaries are presented  independently as well as on a consolidated basis in the accounts of the parent  companies. This applies to: Caesars World (parent) and Caesars New Jersey;  Unocal (managing general partner) and Union Exploration Partners; ICN  Pharmaceuticals (parent) and SPI Pharmaceuticals; ICN Biomedical (parent) and  Viratek.  </P> <P> Two California-based companies included in this supplement are majority owned  by firms outside California but are traded as separate entities. Union Bank is  80% owned by Bank of Tokyo, and National Health Laboratories is 95% owned by  Revlon Group.  </P> <P> </P> <P> General Criteria  </P> <P> All companies must be publicly traded on the New York or American stock  exchange or the NASDAQ system or over the counter and have their headquarters  in California.  </P> <P> Income is defined as after-tax income from continuing operations and excludes  extraordinary items and gains or losses from discontinued operations.  </P> <P> Sales excludes excise taxes, extraordinary income, revenue from discontinued  operations and other income, such as interest. For banks and savings and loan  associations, revenue equals the sum of interest and non-interest income. For  insurance firms, revenue equals the sum of earned premiums, realized gains or  losses from investments and net investment income. For all charts except the  stock market performance charts, companies must have had at least $50 million  in 1989 sales.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Section Notes  </P> <P> The Bottom Line -- Return on equity measures the profit that a company earns  for every dollar common stockholders have invested in the firm. Return on  equity is defined as income available to common shareholders divided by average  common shareholder equity. Income available to common shareholders is  calculated by subtracting preferred dividends (if any) from income from  continuing operations. The Times 100 table ranks companies by the average  return on common equity for the past two years.  </P> <P> For The Times 100 table, companies must have met the following criteria:  publicly traded since December, 1987; sales in 1989 greater than $50 million; a  profit from continuing operations in 1989 and 1988; no negative common equity  for each of the past three fiscal years and not more than twice as much  long-term debt as total shareholder equity.  </P> <P> Companies in the Top 25 and Bottom 25 in Absolute Profits must have been  publicly traded in 1989. Just as the Top 25 in Absolute Profits ranks companies  by dollar amount of profits from continuing operations, the Bottom 25 ranks  companies by dollar amount of loss.  </P> <P> The Top 25 Banks and S&amp;Ls table shows return on assets, which measures the  percentage profit for every dollar in assets. Companies must have been publicly  traded in 1989, with total assets exceeding $1 billion.  </P> <P> The Top 25 in Profit Margins provides the percentage profit for every dollar in  sales. Companies must have been publicly traded in 1989, with total sales  exceeding $50 million.  </P> <P> The Born Again table shows companies that have had the greatest turnaround from  a loss in 1988 to a profit in 1989. The Nose Dives table lists firms that have  suffered the greatest setback from a profit in 1988 to a loss in 1989.  </P> <P> As with the other charts shown in the study, results for previous years have  not been restated.  </P> <P> Real estate investment trusts and limited partnerships were not eligible for  inclusion in this section because income for these companies, which is not  taxed at the company level, is not comparable to after-tax income for  corporations.  </P> <P> The Giants -- The Sales 100 table ranks companies by net revenue. For banks and  savings and loan associations, revenue equals the sum of interest and  non-interest income.  </P> <P> The Biggest Service companies table ranks service companies by net revenue.  Service companies include entertainment, leisure, media, retail, utility,  transportation, wholesale, business and personal service, investment, real  estate and insurance companies.  </P> <P> View From the Street -- Market value is a company's stock price times the  number of outstanding shares and generally reflects the esteem in which  investors hold a company's stock and the confidence that they have in its  future. Book value is total stockholder equity, or assets minus liabilities.  Book value is shown as of the latest fiscal year-end or, if not available, the  most recently reported quarter.  </P> <P> Companies on the Favorites and Forlorn tables must have had 1989 sales of at  least $10 million.  </P> <P> For the Charging Ahead and Falling Behind tables, a company's stock price on  April 10, 1989, must have exceeded $2. Stock prices as of April 10, 1988, have  been adjusted to reflect stock splits and stock dividends.  </P> <P> For the Lowest-Priced and Highest-Priced Companies tables, a firm's market  value on April 10, 1990, must have exceeded $100 million.  </P> <P> The Divvying It Up list of dividend yields ranks companies on the ratio of  their current indicated annual dividend to their stock price as of April 10,  1990. In most cases, this figure is the latest quarterly dividend multiplied by  four. There is no guarantee that the same amount of cash dividend will be  declared for subsequent quarters this fiscal year or that a dividend will be  declared every quarter. The list excludes real estate investment trusts and  master limited partnerships because their dividends often include a return of  capital.  </P> <P> The Top Performing IPOs table ranks companies that had their initial public  common stock offering in 1989 by the stock price appreciation between the  initial offering date and April 10, 1990.  </P> <P> Growth -- Sales growth can come either by generating new business or acquiring  other firms. To be included on The Sales 100 table, a company must have been  publicly traded since 1987, with 1987 sales exceeding $30 million.  </P> <P> Companies eligible for the Fastest Profit Growth table must have been publicly  traded and shown a profit from continuing operations for the past three years.  1987 income from continuing operations must have been at least $10 million.  </P> <P> The Human Factor -- California-headquartered companies are ranked by the number  of full- and part-time employees worldwide at fiscal year-end, excluding  consultants and contractors. Employment figures are estimates provided by the  company. If fiscal year-end results were not available, employee estimates are  from the latest completed quarter. The table does not include companies that  are large employers in the state but are not headquartered here.  </P> <P> The Most Productive Employees list ranks only the top companies in each sector  by revenue per employee worldwide, but the group average is computed from  figures on all the companies in the industry that were surveyed.  </P> <P> Hiring trend data was obtained from the companies. Companies used the following  guideline when responding to the question: "What is your hiring outlook for the  upcoming 12 months?": increasing (up more than 5%), neutral (between 5% up or  down), reducing (down more than 5%).  </P> <P> Regional Profiles -- Same criteria used for the main tables.  </P> <P> Who, What, Where -- All companies on The Times 100 profitability and Sales 100  tables are profiled and listed alphabetically.  </P> <P> EXCEPTIONS  </P> <P> Lists companies whose fiscal year does not coincide with the calendar year or  those whose fiscal year-end 1989 data was not available when data was compiled.  In all tables in which these companies are listed, data was derived from the  four quarters ending in the month shown and is compared to the 1988 fiscal  year.  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.20IN:2.00IN:2.66IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Fiscal  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Data based on  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Company  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> year-end  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 12 mos. ending  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Adac Laboratories  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Sep.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Sep., '89  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Adaptec  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Mar.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Dec., '89  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Adobe Systems  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Nov.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> Nov., '89  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Adv.

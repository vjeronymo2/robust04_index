			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Air Canada vows to prevent rivals' alliance THE fight for survival between Canada's two leading airlines has intensified with a vow by Air Canada to use every weapon at its disposal to block an alliance between Canadian Airlines International and American Airlines, based in Dallas. Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada's newly-appointed chief executive, said the Montreal-based airline would lodge a strong protest with the federal government against its rival's proposed deal, which is at an advanced stage of negotiation. In addition, Air Canada has demanded immediate access to the lucrative trans-Pacific route to Japan currently reserved for Canadian. Air Canada also wants to be allocated half of Canadian's slots at Japanese airports. American Airlines has proposed acquiring a minority equity stake in Canadian and forging a comprehensive operating alliance. Air Canada and Canadian lost almost CDollars 400m (USDollars 336m) between them last year, and it is widely assumed that neither can survive in its present state. But the two carriers are pursuing different solutions to their problems. Air Canada has pressed for some form of merger, leading later to an alliance with one of the emerging multinational airline groups. It hopes to generate public sympathy by insisting that Canadian's deal with American would inexorably lead to one of the country's most visible businesses being swallowed by a foreign giant. But PWA, Canadian Airlines' parent, sees the deal with one of the strongest US carriers as a way of giving itself immediate protection, as well as greater access to the valuable US market. PWA responded to Mr Hollis' statement by insisting that its proposed alliance with American 'will minimise job loss and maintain competition in Canada'. PWA said its discussions with American were 'progressing well and we plan to see them through to their conclusion'. The government has yet to show its hand. One Toronto analyst said that, provided American is willing to limit its equity stake to 25 per cent, the argument that a merger will lead to huge job losses and a monopoly in the domestic market is likely to carry considerable weight in Ottawa.</p>

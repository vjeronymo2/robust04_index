			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Nationwide director paid Pounds 250,000 compensation MR JOHN Hutchinson, whose contract as Nationwide Building Society's corporate strategy director was terminated last December, was paid Pounds 250,000 compensation for his loss of office, the society disclosed yesterday. Mr Hutchinson, who was appointed as Visa International's UK managing director in April, was given the sum in compensation after the society decided that it should concentrate on cutting costs and overheads in traditional operations. The society also disclosed that the total compensation of Mr Tim Melville-Ross, its chief executive and highest paid director, fell to Pounds 215,000 in the year to April 4, against the Pounds 220,000 Mr Melville-Ross received the previous year. The performance-related bonus paid to Mr Melville-Ross fell to Pounds 13,000 against Pounds 23,750. The bonus was calculated on several measures of performance including customer service performance in the previous financial year. The total annual bonus paid to executive directors of the society, which is the second largest by asset size after the Halifax, fell to Pounds 39,000 (Pounds 76,000), while the directors' total annual salary fell to Pounds 562,000 (Pounds 608,000).</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA'S BEST: PEANUTS FOR PARTICULAR PEOPLE  </P> <P> The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg  </P> <P> P.O. Box GN  </P> <P> Williamsburg, Va. 23187  </P> <P> Free Brochure  </P> <P> Check or Credit Cards  </P> <P> Add $1 per item per shipping address  </P> <P> Thomas Jefferson grew them, P. T. Barnum hawked them and George Washington  Carver invented hundreds of ways to use them. Today the United States is the  world's leading producer of peanuts.  </P> <P> What do these goobers have going for them?  </P> <P> To begin with, they're good for you: Peanuts roasted in their skins are more  than one-fourth protein, a good source of B vitamins and contain as much iron  as an equal amount of spinach.  </P> <P> More important, they taste good. The best we've tried come from The Peanut  Shop, a pint-sized place in Williamsburg, Va., that's been doing business the  same careful way for more than 20 years. Their jumbo, meaty nuts are cooked  daily in peanut oil without additives or preservatives, and shipped directly to  you in a classy can.  </P> <P> These aren't your everyday peanuts -- these are peanuts for particular people.  They're not too salty and they're not too greasy. It's as if the peanuts from  your past went out and got a degree.  </P> <P> A 2 1/2-pound tin (salted or unsalted) costs $12.95.

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: NFU dual-pricing plans backed by wildlife charity THE UK National Farmers' Union's proposal for a dual-pricing system for farm produce as an alternative to the European Commission's blueprint for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy has won enthusiastic endorsement from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The RSPB, Europe's largest wildlife charity, has long been pushing for a system of 'cross-compliance' based on the US model. Such a system aims to cut overproduction by offering the farmer a choice between setting aside land and receiving prices for produce at the full, subsidised support rate, or producing to maximum capacity but without price support. The NFU plan envisages that those farmers who do not take land out of production would receive reduced support. Mr Jim Dixon, RSPB agriculture spokesman, said: 'We are delighted that the NFU is seriously considering this principle as its own alternative CAP reform.' He said the EC plans had established the principle of cross-compliance. They call for sharp price cuts, with full compensation for small farmers and partial refund to large farmers, but only if they set aside land. The RSPB seeks an alliance of environmentalists, farmers and politicians to 'strip the (EC) proposals of the discrimination in favour of smaller farms - who are not necessarily the best conservationists'.</p>

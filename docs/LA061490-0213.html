			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNMENTS GET IN THE ACT TO AID BUYERS  </P> <P> The crunch on first-time home buyers is particularly acute in Southern  California. The price of a typical home in Los Angeles County is about  $225,000.  </P> <P> With home prices soaring beyond what most people can afford, government leaders  are beginning to intervene.  </P> <P> Around the Southland:  </P> <P> * Pomona, May, 1990. The City Council approves the sale of $58.4 million in  bonds to help first-time buyers purchase new and resale single-family homes at  low interest rates.  </P> <P> * Norwalk, January, 1990. The City Council votes to sell about $16 million in  bonds to build apartments for low- and moderate-income senior citizens. At the  same time, the council considers allocating money to help residents buy a first  home.  </P> <P> * Anaheim and Santa Ana, November, 1989. The James Irvine Foundation donates  $100,000 to Habitat for Humanity in Orange County. The money will be used to  help build six condominiums for first-time buyers.  </P> <P> * Glendale, August, 1989. The City Council approves spending $300,000 to  rehabilitate the city's older single-family homes.  </P> <P> * Simi Valley, July, 1989. The City Council votes to issue $15 million in  municipal bonds that will provide about 25 buyers with low-interest loans and  affordable down payments.  </P> <P> At the state and national level:  </P> <P> * January, 1990. Gov. George Deukmejian calls for a five-year, $2-billion  program that will lend down-payment money to first-time buyers and help them  obtain mortgage interest rates at below-market levels.  </P> <P> * November, 1989. President Bush asks Congress to let first-time buyers  withdraw up to $10,000 without penalty from Individual Retirement Accounts for  down payments on homes. He also proposes $2.15 billion in federal grants over  three years to help low-income Americans buy public housing and vacant or  foreclosed properties owned by the government. Congress considers these and  other proposals of its own. HOWARD BLUME  </P></p>

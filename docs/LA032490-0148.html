			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OLIVIER TO BE LOS AMIGOS BASKETBALL COACH  </P> <P> Clayton Olivier, a two-time Orange County player of the year in 1979 and '80 at  Los Amigos High School, has been named the school's varsity basketball coach.  </P> <P> Olivier, who started three seasons at USC, replaces Famous Hooks, who resigned  this month after compiling a 33-58 record in four seasons.  </P> <P> Los Amigos finished 2-19 in 1989-90.  </P> <P> Olivier, 29, coached the school's junior varsity team to a 12-10 record last  season and was the freshman coach in 1988-89.  </P> <P> "Clayton was a consensus favorite with the kids and had the support of other  coaches in our athletic department," said Dave Auxier, Los Amigos athletic  director. "He has a way of dealing with people, and I thought he would put the  necessary time in to get the program back on the right track."  </P> <P> Los Amigos was among the county's top programs during Olivier's playing days,  winning Garden Grove League titles during his junior and senior year.  </P> <P> Olivier, a 6-foot-10, 240-pound center, averaged 30.7 points and 12 rebounds as  a senior.  </P> <P> Olivier helped USC win the Pacific 10 basketball title in 1985. He spent one  season playing in the Continental Basketball Assn. before bone spurs in his  left and right ankles ended his professional career.  </P> <P> Auxier said he interviewed 10 candidates. Don Grable, runner-up for the job,  will become the school's junior varsity coach.  </P></p>

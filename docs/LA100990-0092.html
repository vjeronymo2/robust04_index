			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FINAL ARGUMENTS DUE IN SPY TRIAL OF EX-FBI  AGENT  </P> <P> A federal judge is expected to hear closing arguments today in the case of  Richard W. Miller, who is accused of passing secret documents to his Soviet  lover.  </P> <P> The decision by U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi, who is hearing the case in  Los Angeles, on whether to convict Miller comes at the end of the ex-agent's  third trial.  </P> <P> It is likely to put an end to the 6-year-old case that has been an  embarrassment to the FBI. The case could end with Miller becoming the only FBI  agent ever convicted of espionage.  </P> <P> Consistent with portrayals of Miller in the earlier trials, prosecutors during  the past seven weeks have characterized him as a bumbling FBI agent who was  smitten by Soviet emigre Svetlana Ogorodnikova.  </P> <P> Miller, 53, who has never testified in his trials, is charged with six counts  of bribery and espionage.  </P> <P> Takasugi said he will decide the outcome of the case after hearing closing  arguments Tuesday.  </P></p>

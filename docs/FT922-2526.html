			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: Barr accuses FDA of making untrue claims BARR Laboratories, the New York-based generic pharmaceuticals company, yesterday attacked the US Food and Drug Administration for seeking an interim injunction to stop it marketing medicines. The company said allegations filed by the FDA at a New York court last Friday were untrue or misrepresentative. FDA inspectors visiting Barr's manufacturing sites last year said the company's manufacturing practices were not up to standard. A court hearing at White Plains, New York, has been set for June 24. Barr's attack on the FDA follows a long-running feud with the organisation. The company says it has more than 80 drug applications outstanding and not one has been given approval since 1989. In April, Barr won a battle with Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK over the US patent for Nolvadex, ICI's best-selling cancer drug. Barr said then it planned to distribute Nolvadex within 12 months. Barr is also challenging the validity of Wellcome's patent for Retrovir, the drug used to treat patients with the Aids virus, HIV. Barr stopped marketing certain medicines in an attempt to placate the FDA in April. The company has since announced it planned to reduce its workforce of 530 by about 25 per cent.</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / People: Pentos books Perlin Pentos, the struggling specialty retailer, is rebuilding its board which currently lacks a finance director as well as sufficient weight of non-executives. Howard Perlin, director of acquisitions and disposals at Sears until March, was yesterday appointed to the board as the first of two or three new non-executive directors, according to chairman Sir Kit McMahon. Perlin, below, who left Sears saying he wanted to set up in consultancy and build up a portfolio of non-executive directorhsips, explained that one of his main reasons for accepting had been McMahon himself. 'I admire his willingness to be frank about what happened. He didn't want to be chairman; I am impressed by what he has faced up to.' Pentos founder Terry Maher, who had been both chairman and chief executive, was ousted towards the end of 1993, when the company reported losses of Pounds 70.6m for the twelve months to December 31. While Perlin was introduced by headhunters Heidrick &amp; Struggles, Sir Kit was easily able to check him out. Perlin had joined Sears as personal assistant to Geoffrey Maitland Smith, who now chairs the retail group, and who is well known to McMahon, as they sat together for several years on the board of Midland Bank. McMahon says that while Pentos has 'not got the plate out', Perlin's considerable experience of company disposals may come in useful, in due course.</p>

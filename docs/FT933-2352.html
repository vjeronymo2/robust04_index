			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Arts: Fame: more precious than money - The semi-finalists in the Leeds piano competition NIGHT AFTER night, Leeds has been playing host to a grand pub-pianist contest. I was truly sorry to miss it - but unfortunately it coincided with the 11th Harveys Leeds International Pianoforte Competition (classical), and that had a prior claim. From Monday to Wednesday last, its 12 semi-finalists - survivors from the original 76 contestants - played their make-or-break solo recitals. Last night and tonight the six lucky finalists are delivering their chosen concerti on BBC television, with Simon Rattle and his City of Birmingham Symphony. Why do up-and-coming young pros (for Leeds, they must be under 30) put themselves through such a stressful, possibly excruciating, even humiliating experience? Simply for the chance of being noticed. In a musical world over-populated by pianists, it is a rare debutant who can get public notice in a major capital. The Leeds contest ensures an invaluable string of engagements for its winners, more precious than the generous money-prizes (now bigger than ever). And if these international competitions are to matter so much, better that there should be lots of them: even the most distinguished juries are fallible, and performers have their unlucky off-days. Among the semi-finalists Francois-Frederic Guy (24, already a member of Boulez's Ensemble InterContemporain) must have had an off-day. His Mozart sonata, K570 in B-flat, had no detectable spark of life, nor was there the least hint of a visionary thrill in his Skryabin 5th. Unluckier still, he offered his tame, underpowered Brahms no. 3 the day after the 29-year-old American Mark Anderson had delivered that declamatory sonata with barnstorming assurance (young Brahms himself was a famously hefty performer) and in magnificent orchestral colours, from crystalline trickles to barking trombones. Anderson also gave us a superb Bartok Improvisations, their pawky springs and hesitations sounding so spontaneous that listeners may have thought them his own ideas. And though we had admired Filippo Gamba's Debussy that afternoon, in 'Les fees sont d'exquises danseuses', Debussy's fairies (inspired by Barrie's Peter Pan in the Kensington Gardens]) had not danced at all; for Anderson they did, airily and eerily. For mature range and communicative power, nobody else matched him in these semi-finals. Though the Taiwanese Ya-Fei Chuang (22) was fluently practised in the 'Ondine' and 'Scarbo' of Ravel's Gaspard de la nuit, Schubert's Sonata-Fantasy and her slower Rakhmaninov pieces were in dire need of some ongoing impulse. Elisso Bolkvadze (26, from Georgia) and the Russian Margarita Shevchenko (25) both played Gaspard complete. Some compromises were needed to accommodate Miss Bolkvadze's small hands in the big chord-stretches of 'Le Gibet', but her faultless old-school technique was masterly in Chopin's Andante pianato &amp; Grand Polonaise, and Prokofiev's 2nd Sonata. Despite the town hall's swimming-bath acoustics, her tempo for Liszt's 'Feux Follets' was breathtaking. In elegant pink pyjamas and a cascade of red-gold hair with a bow, Shevchenko lived up to her image. Her fleet fingers were as soignee as the soft, winsome curves of her lyrical line, alike in Schubert's late B-flat Impromptu (the 'Rosamunde' one) and Rakhmaninov, and the 4th Chopin Scherzo and Gaspard. The distinct climates of those pieces melted together under her all-purpose charm. Contrariwise, her compatriot Katia Skanavi (21) - lean and sulky in black jacket, leggings and spiky lovelocks, as near punk as you can get without actually safety-pinning your ears - stormed bitterly through Schubert's A minor Sonata D784, and crowned her sulphurous reading of Schumann's Kreisleriana with an epilogue of dry, unwinking, baleful precision. Extraordinary performances, potently original. By comparison the resonant, well-planned, extrovert accounts of Chopin's 24 Preludes and Rakhmaninov's 2nd Sonata that we heard from Maxim Philippov (also 21) sounded reassuringly familiar. But his Ravel 'Alborada' was terrific: miles away from Lipatti's legendary poise, and that much nearer to the controlled detonations that Ravel composed. The six finalists are: Mark Anderson, Riccardo Castro, Filippo Gamba, Leon McCawley, Maxim Philippov and Margarita Shevchenko.</p>

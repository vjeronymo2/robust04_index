			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: India fears export fall in diamonds A STEEP fall in India's exports of cut and polished diamonds is feared next month after a disruption in imports of 'rough' diamonds, on which the exporters depend. The fall is expected to follow the 50 per cent cash deposit put on letters of credit for raw diamond imports three weeks ago by the Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank, as part of a package to delay imports and ease pressure on foreign exchange reserves. The supply of raw diamonds will last untill May when exporters fear operations will stop if the levy is not repealed. Mr Kaushik Mehta, chairman of the gem and jewellery export promotion council, says two hundred thousand will lose their jobs. Mr Mehta objects to the 50 per cent cash margin payment because diamond traders operate on volumes and thin profit margins. This is the second crisis in the diamond businesses in a year. Finished diamond exports fell by a fifth in April to June last year following a dip in the US offtake and a shift in demand to large diamonds from small ones, in which India specialises. India's exports of finished diamonds and jewellery in the year to March 1991 dropped by 3 per cent to Rs53.1bn (Pounds 1.53bn).</p>

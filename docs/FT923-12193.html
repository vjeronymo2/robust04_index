			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / World Trade News: E German yards to get aid Denmark yesterday lost its bid to stop the EC Council of Ministers giving Bonn permission to pay some DM6bn (Pounds 2.1m) in restructuring aid to six shipyards in the former eastern Germany, writes David Buchan. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Denmark's foreign minister, was outvoted by his fellow EC foreign ministers when he claimed that this aid could damage the prospects of Danish yards.</p>

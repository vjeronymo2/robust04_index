			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Basis of contacts between Sir Sonny Ramphal and BCCI Sir, I write to refute the innuendos contained in your article, including the headline, about me concerning arrangements with Bank of Credit and Commerce International initiated long before its closure ('Sir Sonny had special loan', February 16). As chairman of the International Jury for the Third World Prize, my contacts with the bank were essentially with its president in his capacity as chairman of the board of trustees of the Third World Foundation. They were, therefore, mainly concerned with the bank's philanthropic work, which included support not only for the foundation and the Carter Centre but such Commonwealth-related causes as the Commonwealth Cambridge Trust. I explained fully to your correspondent the significance of the new foundation which I was expected to lead after leaving the Commonwealth Secretariat. It was to be devoted to issues of development, security and environment in a north/south context. I considered it extremely important that such a global institution should come into being; and was ready to devote my time after leaving my Commonwealth post to bringing it to fulfilment. The contractual arrangements discussed with the bank were entirely in that context and of course made full provision for assured repayment. At the time, it was reasonable to assume that BCCI's banking activities were being properly regulated by the Bank of England. Within weeks of the closure of the bank, it was my legal advisers who brought all these matters to the attention of the then provisional liquidators. In the result, my own claims against the bank and liabilities to it were the subject of an overall settlement, negotiated through legal advisers and by due process more than a year ago. Your correspondent has also referred to a Commonwealth Secretariat Cambridge symposium in 1989. The then director of the legal division of the Commonwealth Secretariat, Mr Jeremy Pope, has specifically refuted the suggestion that I or anyone in my office had any awareness of the matters relating to that symposium and confirmed that the discussion itself did take place.

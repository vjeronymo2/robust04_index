			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marina Roman and Bogdan Tiberiu Iacob on </F> statements by party leaders regarding the government formula:  "Will the PDSR, CDR, and PD(FSN) Smoke a `Peace Pipe'?"]    [Text] CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania]: "We are  not interested in participating in the government, but in the  application of our anticrisis program!"    PD(FSN) [Democratic Party-National Salvation Front]: "A PDSR  government supported by the opposition is possible, but only on  the basis of a well-defined political pact."    PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania]: "A PDSR monocolor  government is viable, but for no longer than six months."    Last week's meeting of the CDR leaders projected an  original,  even thrilling, alternative to the forefront of the political  arena by bearing in mind the savage post-revolutionary duels  between those in power and those in the opposition: the  possibility of a political pact between the main parliamentary  blocs -- CDR, PD(FSN), and PDSR, with a view to supporting a  monocolor, reformist government of the ruling party. It is more  than obvious that in the current domestic and international  situation, this offer of "smoking a peace pipe" would be, from  several points of view, the best solution. What remains to be  seen -- after the negotiations that will soon be held -- is to  what extent this can be put into practice, because Romania's  very future is at stake. Here are some opinions by a few  leaders of the parties involved in this question:    Emil Constantinescu, CDR president: "After more than two  months of so-called negotiations, the PDSR has reached the  conclusion that there is nothing to change and it is proposing a  new minority government. Thus we are asking ourselves where is  that national interest that even Mr. Adrian Nastase places above  party interests, as he says? Only after the PDSR allies had  launched an utterly irresponsible blackmail campaign by  attacking basic state institutions and extending their vulgar  actions to those in power, actions which up to then had served  their interests through attacks on the opposition, did the  ruling party announce that it might consider a reformist  minority government. As far as we are concerned, we are not  necessarily interested in participating in government at this  time, but in applying the CDR program for coming out of the  crisis. The only possible way is to discuss a tangible program  with precise elements and deadlines. If we reach an  understanding on this, we will be able to form a new  parliamentary majority to support an efficient and competent  government. Every drawer is full of programs; however, there  has been no political will to apply them. And as a consequence  of the activity of the current government, something very  serious has happened: the political infiltration of the middle  echelon! Even if we now came up with a competent government, it  would be difficult for it to implement its program because of  this middle echelon that has taken shape. Recent differences in  the leftist wing have clearly demonstrated the infiltration in  this echelon of antireform-oriented people. This is one of the  most serious of Romania's problems at this time."    Dinu Patriciu, vice president of the Liberal Party '93: "In  no way will we support a PDSR government, because our objections  are linked both to the program and to the competence of those  whom the PDSR can appoint to the government. When I say  competence, I mean it in its broader sense, that is resulting  primarily from a certain mentality. And, through its origin and  political actions, the PDSR has proved that the mentality of its  people does not permit them to think politically in the sense of  denationalization, decentralization, debureaucratization, and  destablization. We have different aims, and thus we can only  have different policies. A PDSR monocolor government would be a  catastrophe! As far as Professor Emil Constantinescu's  statement is concerned, it is of a personal nature and in no way  the result of discussions within the CDR Executive Committee.  My opinion is that such a government would not have the  necessary parliamentary support. Cars that drive down the  middle of the street are in the way of both those on the left  and those on the right.    Radu Al. Timofte, PDSR senator: A PDSR minority, monocolor  government is as viable as can be but not for a long time. It  could not last longer than six months unless a very serious pact  is concluded with the other parliamentary parties and unless  this pact is observed by its signatories.    Ion Diaconescu, first vice president of the National Peasant  Christian Democratic Party: During the Convention, we decided  not to change the attitude that we have had so far, and to  preserve our uncompromising stance. We will participate in  government only if the PDSR renounces its monopoly on state  power. As for parliamentary support, which the CDR and PD(FSN)  could grant to a PDSR minority government, I can tell you only  that we will support, as we have done so far, only those laws  that in our view are objective, beneficial, and reformist, and  we will reject the others. Within our alliance, however, there  are reservations about a possible so-called opening by the  current power toward the opposition."    Adrian Severin, PD vice president: "When we talk about a  viable PDSR government, I think that it has to be clear that we  are not referring to the current government. We will not  support a government against which we have supported two censure  motions and two simple motions. A minority, monocolor PDSR  government -- other than the Vacaroiu government -- supported by  the current opposition, that is the CDR and PD, is possible, but  only on the basis of an explicit political pact that will define  the national interests, the ways and means to accelerate and  intensify the reform process, the way to isolate extremist  political forces and stop their access to the levers of power,  as well as guarantees for the operation of democratic  institutions. Such a formula does not mean a political alliance  between the PDSR-CDR-PD, but just a way to cooperate at a time  of crisis."</p>

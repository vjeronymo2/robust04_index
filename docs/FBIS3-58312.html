			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Klaus-Peter Schmid: "The Last Becomes the </F> First"]    [Text] Athens--The Athenians had waited longingly for the  rain. Dust was everywhere. Smog made it hard to breathe. Then,  after almost half a year of drought, the Attic sky opened up for  three days in November. The floods destroyed houses, swept away  cars, and put the streets under water. "We are not prepared for  something like this," was the excuse that one Athenian gave.    Many think that this is similar to the rain of money from  Brussels: for years huge sums have been flowing to Europe's  poorest member country but it has not really helped. About 6  percent of the Greek national product comes from the budget of  the European Union [EU]. That is equal to approximately half of  all Greek tax receipts. Every year Brussels pays every Greek  household the equivalent of 4,000 marks [DM], and the trend is  rising.    It must have been quite a shock for the Greeks when in the  early summer of 1992 Jacques Delors, president of the European  Commission, reproached them for their lack of success: "Greece  must have a voice in Europe but not just to present its  demands." The Greeks are not catching up with their partners.  When they joined the EC 12 years ago, they were richer than  Portugal and now they are last. They have the lowest per capita  income, the lowest productivity, and the highest inflation.  Stefanos Manos, conservative minister of economics until the  election defeat in October, already fears: "We are lagging so  far behind that we are endangering the solidarity of our  partners."    "Nonsense," others retort, "we are richer than the British,  not to mention the Portuguese." One ought to add at least 40  percent to the national product to reflect reality. For the  policeman drives a taxi after his shift is over, the civil  servant has a second job at half past three, the teacher with  his salary of DM1,000 gives private lessons at home, and the  craftsman refuses to write out a bill. There is illicit work and  tax evasion in Western Europe as well but nowhere in the EU is  the shadow economy nearly as strong.    Athen does not have beggars. Instead, the streets are full  of  large limousines. No where are there as many BMW's registered  per capita as in Greece. Every day the traffic in the capital  nearly comes to a standstill.    But behind this facade is Greece's backwardness. It is still  often impossible for days to call abroad during office hours.  Important highways are in a deplorable state. Private industry  provides only 12.5 percent of the national product. The banks  earn a lot of money but the payments system is archaic. The  Greek is forced to pay social security contributions, doctor  fees, and electric or telephone bills with bundles of cash.    For a long time, Athens handled the billions from Brussels  as  though it did not have to account to anyone. Here a church roof  was patched, there a health center was opened, and somewhere  else a superfluous congress palace was built--and for years no  one pointed out where the money was coming from. Only lately did  the Commission notice that its money benefited mostly the  political friends of those governing. It was being said in  Athens that foolish spending and the giving away of money were a  thing of the past and that projects performed as favors no  longer had a chance. Certainly Greece's unfavorable geography,  its peripheral location, and the countless islands raise the  costs of any plans for regional development. And the Greeks  always add another argument: unfortunately one must reserve 7  percent of the national product for military expenditures on  account of Turkish aggression, more than in any other country in  NATO.    But what has long been known in Athens and what they are  reluctant to change: the greatest obstacle on the way to a  modern state is the state itself. Everyone mistrusts it and  cheats it, but they all want to be civil servants. The most  frequent assessment of the work of the bureaucracy is that it is  omnipresent and inefficient. That applies not only to the  agencies but also to state enterprises and public institutions  such as hospitals or schools. "No reasonable Greek sends his  children to a public school," asserts an Athenian.    Vasso Papandreou, member of the Brussels commission until  the  end of 1992, points out a no less paralyzing effect: the state  apparatus is firmly in the hands of the respective governing  party. The socialist deputy, not related to the head of the  government, demands: "We must first make the state independent  of the parties. Otherwise we cannot do it."    But it would be the task of the century to get rid of the  established clientele system, which also involves a good deal of  nepotism. It is not just friends who are supported shamelessly,  but above all one's own family is fed. When the conservative  Premier Konstantin Mitsotakis entrusted his wife and daughter  with government offices, the Left cried out in protest. But  hardly was the socialist Papandreou in power when he brought his  wife into the outer office and his son into the government.  "Other countries will become party states before we develop in  the opposite direction," thinks the political scientist Dimitris  Charalambis from the University of Athens.    In addition, many see the Orthodox Church as hindering the  development. In principle, it is not a state church. But  religion and the state are closely interwoven in Greece, not  only because almost every Greek professes Orthodoxy but also  because it provides a good deal of national identity.    The church is a pillar of the state; it freely makes deals  with the powerful. Athenian Archbishop Seraphim defended the  colonels at the time of the military dictatorship with the same  matter-of-factness based on the Bible as he now does the  socialist Papandreou and the deputies. When it came to a mass  demonstration against recognition of the former Yugoslav  republic of Macedonia last year, the Orthodox bishops marched at  the front of it and incited nationalistic feelings. Critics also  find fault with the lack of reality and antimodernism of a  clergy that is paid from the state treasury.    Do the Greeks know what they have in Europe? "We have a  historical relationship with Europe," declares Thanos Lipowatz,  "that is characterized by attraction and repulsion." The  professor for political psychology points out Greek fears of  losing their own identity in Europe. At the same time, however,  the economic imperative is in effect and it appears that it more  strongly influences public opinion. Meanwhile, everywhere in the  country there are blue signs with the 12 golden stars indicating  a construction project financed with money from Brussels. The  funds for the huge construction site for the Athens subway come  largely from the community pot. The farmers have never had it so  good; 80 percent of agricultural produce is subsidized and the  production of olive oil was never so profitable. It is no wonder  that in surveys the Greeks are ahead of everyone in their  positive attitude toward Europe.    The socialist deputy Papandreou also asserts: "The people  here feel that they belong more to Europe than to the Balkans."  But Greece does not have a common border with any other state of  the EU. Despite its proud history, the feeling that the West  sees it merely as an appendix of Europe hurts. It is certainly  more than a coincidence that the friendly passer-by at the  airport asks: "Are you staying in the country or are you flying  to Europe?"</p>

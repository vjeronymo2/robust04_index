The amendment, prompted by a petition from the Danish and Swedish Meat Research Institute, is based on scientific research showing the use of carbon dioxide to induce death in swine to be an effective and humane slaughtering method. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> May 26, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Dr. William O. James, Director, Slaughter Inspection Standards and Procedures Division, room 202 Annex Building, FSIS, USDA, 300 12th Street SW., Washington, DC 20250&hyph;3700, (202) 720&hyph;3219. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This final rule has been determined to be not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Executive Order 12778 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This final rule has been reviewed pursuant to Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This final rule will permit swine to be humanely slaughtered in official meat-packing establishments through the administration of carbon dioxide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State and local jurisdictions are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) from imposing any requirements with respect to federally inspected premises and facilities, and operations of such establishments, that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA. States and local jurisdictions are also preempted under the FMIA from imposing any marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements on federally inspected meat or meat food products that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdiction over meat products that are outside official establishments for the purposes of preventing the distribution of meat products that are misbranded or adulterated under the FMIA or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into the United States. States and local jurisdictions may also make requirements or take other actions that are consistent with the FMIA, with respect to any other matters regulated under the FMIA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the FMIA, States that maintain meat inspection programs must impose requirements on State-inspected products and establishments that are at least equal to those required under the FMIA. These States may, however, impose more stringent requirements on such State-inspected products and establishments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No retroactive effect will be given to this final rule, and applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted before any judicial challenge can be taken to the application of these provisions. Those administrative procedures are set forth in 9 CFR 306.5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Effect on Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Administrator has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of the carbon dioxide (CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) slaughtering methods is voluntary. FSIS is not aware of any domestic establishments that are currently planning to use this swine slaughtering method. Even if some establishments decide to use the method, there is no indication that a substantial number of establishments will. There will be no impact on entities other than establishments engaged in the slaughter of swine and the sale of swine carcasses and parts for human food. A significant investment will be required by large or small entities establishing CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  slaughtering facilities. Inspection program experts estimate that an investment of $50,000 to $100,000 per slaughtering line would be necessary, depending on the size and complexity of the establishment. The decision to make this initial investment will be entirely up to the establishment, although this rule authorizing CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  slaughtering of swine could be a factor in making the decision. This investment could be more than offset by a reduction in manpower required for restraining, stunning, and handling hogs after stunning. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / International Company News: Microsoft restates anti-trust denial MICROSOFT, the US personal computer software developer, is continuing to co-operate with a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) probe into alleged anti-competitive actions, the company has confirmed. This follows a report that the FTC may soon file charges of 'exclusionary behaviour' against the company. 'Microsoft is in frequent contact with the FTC on the investigation of Microsoft. We continue to believe that the company has done nothing wrong,' it said. Microsoft had previously acknowledged it was subject to an FTC anti-trust probe. Microsoft shares fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 79 7/8 on Friday, following publication of the report in Business Week magazine. Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, has frequently expressed incredulity that the FTC could find any wrongdoing by his company. However, executives at several of Microsoft's competitors who say they have been interviewed by FTC investigators, are convinced Microsoft has used its dominant role in the personal computer software market unfairly to prevent competition. As the supplier of Dos and Windows, the most widely used personal computer operating systems programs, Microsoft has a dominant position in that market. The Seattle-based company is also gaining market share in the applications programs market.</p>

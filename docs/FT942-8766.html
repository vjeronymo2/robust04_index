			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Forestry Commission sale may be doomed The government is poised to abandon plans to privatise the Forestry Commission after officials recommended earlier this week that its management and accounting techniques were too inefficient for a sell-off. Ministers met on Tuesday to examine whether the commission, which manages 1.1m hectares of Britain's forests, could be sold to the private sector. The ministerial committee on industrial, commercial and consumer affairs studied a report by the Forestry Review Group which examined options for the organisation's future. Although they took no final decision, it is understood that they rejected privatising the commission because of what one official called 'a lack of business efficiency in the organisation'. In particular the report by the review group said that the commission had old-fashioned practices which needed to be exposed to modern management and accounting techniques before it could be sold. Treasury officials have argued strongly for the commission to be privatised in an attempt to hold down public expenditure. A senior Whitehall official did not rule out yesterday that Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, could press again for that option. But it is understood that the Treasury's arguments have been undermined by Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, a rightwing backer of the free market. Officials said he argued at the meeting for management changes to be introduced before a sell-off. Late last year three former top executives at the commission argued that privatisation would produce a meagre sum and reduced income for the state. They argued that only Pounds 500m might be raised in a sale, compared with a 1992 book value of Pounds 1.7bn. Those funds could be further eroded because of the loss of revenue from timber sales.</p>

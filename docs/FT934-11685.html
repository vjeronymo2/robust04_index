			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: DSM DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, swung into a net loss of Fl 52m (Dollars 28m) in the third quarter of 1993 from a net profit of Fl 53m in the previous year, underlining the continuing difficulties it faces in weak European markets, writes Ronald van de Krol. The company cautioned that it also expected to post a loss for the fourth quarter. The third-quarter figures take DSM's results for the first nine months of the year to a net loss of Fl 42m from a net profit of Fl 263m in the same period of 1992.</p>

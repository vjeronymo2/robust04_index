			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jagodina, 28 Jan (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic,  president of the Srpska republic, said today that international  power brokers were doing as they pleased and were playing cruel  games with the nerves of an entire nation that wants only what  belongs to it.    Commenting for Radio Jagodina [in Serbia] on the latest  threats of military intervention and proposals to lift the arms  embargo for the Muslim side only, Karadzic said that the Bosnian  Serbs have done everything for a peaceful solution but they were  still exposed to relentless threats.    In reality, Srebrenica has never been a problem because we  have allowed the Dutch battalion to replace the Canadian unit.  However, the international community needs to aggravate the  situation due to its obligations to the Islamic states. France  wants to humiliate the NATO alliance and cause its downfall and  so forth, Karadzic said.    Karadzic said once again that the opening of Tuzla airport  was out of the question because this would mean that the Muslims  would receive large amounts of weapons, which they were getting  anyway.    It is absurd to discuss the lifting of the embargo on  weapons  for the Muslims when they have been receiving them from the  Americans and Islamic states for a long time. The Muslims are  well armed and, according to their own claims, they have 200,000  soldiers. We think that they have even more, Karadzic said.    He also spoke of the discrepancy between Europe and the  United States in respect of the ways for solving the Bosnian  crisis and about the increasing number of claims by certain  states that negotiations were no longer necessary as the Muslims  were scoring victories on the battlefield.    The Serbs could be interested in this option. If we are  talking about a status quo, the Serbs will keep 70 percent of  the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina or possibly go down  to 64 percent to which we have the right in the name of peace.  If the Muslims opt for war, all percentages will be out of the  question, Karadzic said.    Karadzic said that the option chosen by the Muslims and  their  allies was already clear, adding that this would perhaps finally  be revealed as early as the next round of Geneva negotiations  scheduled for 10 February.</p>

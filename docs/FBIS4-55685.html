			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Pascal Barollier] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo, May 18 (AFP) -- The United Nations will  launch a campaign next week to raise the $530 million it  estimates is needed to rebuild the war-torn Bosnian capital,  according to a confidential report obtained by AFP Wednesday [18  May]. The report said the fundraising operation would kick off  in Vienna on May 24 and 25. The figure of $530 million was just  set here after a year-long study by the Interim Coordination  Board (ICBO), a body created last April under UN Resolution 908  to determine Sarajevo's needs, handle the fundraising and  attribute the reconstruction contracts to international firms.    The ICBO assessment was led by its chairmen, William  Eagleton  of the United States and Edouard Rousselot of France. Rousselot  said their report estimated $270 million was needed to get  emergency services in working order within six weeks, and  another $260 million for what were called medium-term needs over  the next two years.    It is to be officially presented to the special UN envoy on  ex-Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, in Zagreb on Friday, then go on  to Vienna for the actual start of the campaign, he said. The  report is divided into seven broad chapters: water, gas,  electricity, city services, civil engineering, city planning and  health and education, according to Rousselot.    City services covers public transport, telecommunications  and  garbage collection, while civil engineering includes airport  management, railroads, bridges, highways and public buildings.    Rousselot said that reinstating water, gas and electricity  services "will represent about 30 percent" of the $530 million.  But he said the hardest task will be to persuade governments to  commit themselves to investing in Sarajevo's reconstruction.    The ICBO functions like an American-type trust. It now has  no funds at all and has operated up to now entirely off the UN  budget in New York. Its chairmen will present their proposals  to donor countries and institutions at the Vienna meeting next  week. Contributors will then be called to New York in June to  detail their offers to the ICBO, which in turn will open bidding  on reconstruction contracts. Several international officials  involved in the project have said the Vienna meeting will be the  first "moment of truth" to gauge how willing states involved in  the peace effort in Bosnia are to take part in the next stage,  post-war reconstruction.    "A certain number of Moslem countries are not even asking  questions and already have their money ready," said one of these  officials who asked not to be named. But another raised doubts  about French and British participation in rebuilding Sarajevo  after more than two years of war, saying he feared a "return to  the good old French way of saying 'everything will work out'  while not putting any money on the table."    Rousselot said in talks between ICBO and Bosnian officials,  the Bosnians have already questioned why France has shown no  great interest in getting as involved in the trust project as it  has been on the ground, where its forces form the largest  contingent in the UN peackeeping force.    Recession-hit France has already spent three billion dollars  -- nearly six times Sarajevo's estimated reconstruction cost --  for maintaining its troops in Bosnia and Croatia over the last  two years of warfare, according to military sources here who  requested anonymity.</p>

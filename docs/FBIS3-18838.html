			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- GDP in the states of former  East Germany increased by an average 7.1 percent in real terms  in 1993, and thus rose by more than had been expected. This was  announced by the Federal Economics Ministry in Bonn today. At  7.4 percent in the second half of the year, it grew clearly more  than in the first half of the year. Gross domestic product per  worker in the states of former East Germany reached around 46  percent of the Western level last year.    In the view of Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt,  the Federal Statistical Office's data confirm that there has  been a high rate of growth in eastern Germany over the past two  years. Following a temporary deceleration, the economic catching  up process evidently has started to accelerate again somewhat.  However, this could not yet be described as a self-sustaining  recovery in the states of former East Germany. [passage omitted]</p>

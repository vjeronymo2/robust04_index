			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: THE CHIP MAY PROVE MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD  </P> <P> Former Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal, who spent part of his youth in  China, was asked on ABC's David Brinkley television show Sunday what he thought  was going on in China today. "The same thing that is happening throughout the  Communist world," said Blumenthal, who is now chairman of Unisys Corp., "and  that is really the computer revolution. Over the last 40 years, because of the  tremendous power of that little chip, everything that we do and that the  Communist countries have had to learn to do is governed by this new  technology."  </P> <P> People are dying and this guy's talking about semiconductors. Is he kidding?  </P> <P> No. Blumenthal is making a profoundly serious point -- the same one made by  former President Reagan on Tuesday when he declared in London that "the Goliath  of totalitarian control will rapidly be brought down by the David of the  microchip."  </P> <P> The point is that the fax machines and computer networks made possible by  advances in microelectronics -- which began with the transistor in 1947 --  undermine Communist systems, because they defeat its central planning and  control of people's lives.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Impossible to Control'  </P> <P> They do so by putting information in people's hands. On one level,  microelectronics keeps students in China in touch with each other and with the  70,000 Chinese students who are currently in the United States. Through fax  machines and computer networks, they communicate information on missing  individuals and news of families. Information may not save lives,  unfortunately, but it does undermine the Big Lie.  </P> <P> And beyond that, says Blumenthal, elaborating on the thought he expressed on  television, "the enormous pools of information created by microelectronics are  impossible to control from the top."  </P> <P> It seems evident that there are a lot of fax machines in China. One or two fax  machines can be controlled by secret police. Hundreds are more difficult to  control. And if China is to progress into the modern world, there will be  thousands of fax machines and control becomes nearly impossible.  </P> <P> It is not immediately evident that the driving forces of the modern economy  undermine political control, but they do.  </P> <P> With computerized money markets, businesses gather capital everywhere, and  local control diminishes. With computerized desktop publishing, a government  can't so easily stop the presses.  </P> <P> Two decades ago, the Soviet Union seized a Xerox machine from a U.S.  correspondent because he was allowing dissidents to run off their underground  newspaper. But today, copying machines are portable, computers can be held in  the palm of a hand and are harder to seize.  </P> <P> </P> <P> International Networks  </P> <P> Even the means of production can be disseminated widely instead of being  controlled by a central source. Thanks to microchips capable of storing  information equal to 125,000 of the letters and numerals you are now reading,  production changes profoundly. The knowledge is in the machine, not the  instruction manual. The precise specifications of an automobile, the dimensions  of windows and fenders, can be put onto microcircuits that control the cutting  of the metal and molding of the shapes. And goods can be produced anywhere  because those specifications and instructions can be transmitted instantly over  international networks.  </P> <P> All of that is possible if you're in the network -- as China's students in the  United States are, but China's politicians are not. "The students have been  communicating on Bitnet," says Richard Judy, director of Soviet and Eastern  European Studies at the Hudson Institute in Indianapolis. What is Bitnet? It is  an international computer network, powered by 1,306 mainframe computers that  link scientists and scholars in the United States, Canada and Mexico with Earn,  the West European network, and with AsiaNet in Japan.  </P> <P> "Communication and trading of ideas goes on all the time on Bitnet," says Judy.  And it is that network that Chinese students at places such as Harvard,  Berkeley and Columbia have been able to use -- at least in the United States.  </P> <P> Such networks are the nerve system of the modern industrial world. But China  itself is outside such networks, as is the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.  Thus their scientists are limited, their technology several steps behind.  Control from the center is possible, but it is control of a technologically  backward and materially poorer society.  </P> <P> It was to escape that condition that Communist societies have been trying to  liberate their economies. But liberation isn't easy. "In order to manage a  modern economy, you need people who are clued in," says Blumenthal. "You must  allow students to have information."  </P> <P> For over a decade, China has been sending 20,000 students a year to the United  States. The government's problem was that it couldn't restrict what they -- or  its own young people at home -- were learning.  </P> <P> Now China wants to reverse course. But it's going to find that it cannot shut  access to political ideas even while going forward economically. In the age of  the microchip, you can't stop the flow of information. "Power comes out of the  barrel of a gun," said Mao Tse Tung. But that was a long time ago, and now  there's another kind of power coming out of fax machines and computer screens.  </P></p>

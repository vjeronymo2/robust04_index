			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 21 (YONHAP) -- North Korea sent a  message to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on  Wednesday [20 April] proposing that IAEA inspectors witness the  upcoming change of fuel bars at their 5-megawatt atomic reactor  in Yonbyon.    The message said the fuel bars of the atomic reactor would  be  changed in a few weeks.    Sources in Vienna said the proposal was North Korea's first  response toward the demand by the world community for additional  international inspections of their nuclear facilities.    In the message, North Korea did not say whether they would  accept additional inspections of six other nuclear facilities.    North Korea claims that the atomic reactor has been in  operation since 1986 and that they never changed its fuel bars  after 1989 when some fuel bars were changed due to a mechanical  trouble, during which they said they extracted 90 grams of  plutonium on an experimental basis.    A YONHAP report from Berlin said IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer  confirmed that a contact of some sort was going on with North  Korea.    He said that IAEA Director-General Hans Blix would decide  whether to accept the North Korean proposal probably Thursday  afternoon.    The IAEA had an emergency meeting Thursday morning to review  the North Korean overture, the report said.</p>

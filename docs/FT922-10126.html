			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Cookery: A vegetarian virtuoso like Annie Bell, about whom I wrote last week - is one of today's bright young band of cooks who love vegetables and fish but do not eat meat. Until last Christmas Tomasi was chef-patronne of Frith's restaurant in London's Soho. When the new year dawned she changed tack, closed the restaurant and set up her own cookery school, Turnaround Cooks. The move is a happy one. Sharing ideas as she cooks, and talking over more ideas as you eat together, suits her better than the restaurant scene where chef and customers are, for the most part, separated by the service door. Tomasi is warm, gregarious and generous, an exuberant cook. There is nothing schoolmarmish about her and her classes are very informal. Nominally they are demonstration classes rather than hands-on, but I would call them participative. Her personality, the size of the kitchen and the numbers per class (15 at most, more often 10) see to that. At Turnaround Cooks you will find no meek rows of passive audience looking up to The Cook performing on stage, never getting closer to the food than an overhead mirrored glimpse. Instead everyone gathers round the stove and table, close enough to weep when onions are peeled, to share an occasional splattering of extra virgin olive oil, and to lend a hand with this or that  -stirring, cutting, kneading or whatever. All the senses are thoroughly engaged: sight, smell, sound and touch, as well as taste. This is a 3D cooking experience, charting every nuance of change as a dish progresses from raw ingredients to serving and eating. Tomasi's is a contemporary cosmopolitan style of meatless cookery. It draws its inspirations from the fresh, spicy flavours of places as far flung as Thailand and the Caribbean, as well as her native Italy. This makes it particularly attractive to the young, and stimulating for slightly stuck-in-a-rut cooks who are in search of new adventures, but it is unlikely to enthuse diehard classicists or followers of haute cuisine. Most of her courses are one-day affairs, and vegetarian cookery is the subject of many of them. The chocolate workshop, pasta and bread-making, fish cookery, Thai cookery, and Italian regional cakes, puddings and biscuits are other favourite subjects. Sometimes Tomasi is joined by guest cooks (Anna Del Conte will team up with her for a series on Italian regional cookery in the autumn) and five-day intensive courses are being introduced in June. These will include visits to Brixton, Berwick Street and other London markets to shop for the key ingredients to be cooked. A ticket to one of Tomasi's classes might make a splendid present to give to a godchild or niece. I would probably buy two tickets and go along myself as well - to spice up my ideas, and because a day in Carla Tomasi's company is such fun. The fee (usually Pounds 50 for a one-day course, inclusive of lunch with wine) strikes me as a bargain, and an added attraction is the location. Turnaround Cooks' classes are held in London's Notting Hill Gate, in the kitchens of Books for Cooks, mecca for those with an appetite for culinary reading. SPINACH DUMPLINGS IN TOMATO &amp; BASIL BROTH Carla Tomasi reckons that this lovely recipe is enough to make a generous main course lunch or supper dish for three people, or a substantial first course for four. For the dumplings: 1 1/2 lb spinach;  3/4 lb ricotta cheese; 2 1/2 oz freshly grated Parmesan (plus a little extra for serving if liked); freshly grated nutmeg; 2 eggs; a little seasoned flour. For the broth: 1 x 800g (or 2 x 400g) can(s) of plum tomatoes; 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil; a few basil leaves; 2 garlic cloves; a little passata (optional). To make the broth, first sieve the canned tomatoes and dilute with an equal volume of water (use the empty can(s) to measure it). Add a dash of passata if the tomatoes are pale, as they may be very occasionally. Chop the garlic and basil finely. Heat the olive oil in a roomy saucepan with a large surface area and saute the garlic and basil briefly over high heat. Add the tomatoes, simmer gently without a lid for 20-25 minutes and season to taste. For the dumplings, first cook the spinach until very tender. Drain, squeeze out the water and process to a puree. Add the ricotta, Parmesan, a generous seasoning of salt, pepper and nutmeg, and the lightly beaten eggs. Process again to mix well. The mixture will be slack and slightly sticky, too soft to shape into neat, perfectly round dumplings - which is why the Italians call them malfatti (badly made or mis-shapen). Do not be put off: the taste and tender light texture are exquisite. Chill the mixture if time permits, so it firms up a little. Then, using oiled or wetted spoons or hands, divide and shape it into soft green blobs slightly smaller than ping-pong balls. Sit them on a floured baking tray and set aside until shortly before serving. If refrigerated, the dumplings will keep for two to three days. To finish, bring the tomato broth back to a bare simmer. Shake the tray of dumplings to roll them about and coat them lightly all over with the flour. Then slide them into the liquid, one by one in quick succession. They will sink as they dive in and swim to the surface when cooked, about 10 minutes later. Keep the flame very low throughout poaching: barely a bubble should break the surface of the liquid. Lift out the dumplings with a draining spoon when they are ready. Serve them in warmed soup plates with the tomato broth poured round them, and maybe a grating of Parmesan sprinkled over them.

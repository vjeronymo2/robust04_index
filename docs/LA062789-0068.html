			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET LAWMAKERS WILL MULL OVERHAUL OF LEGAL SYSTEM  </P> <P> The new Supreme Soviet, meeting for the first time Monday, approved a sweeping  legislative agenda that would overhaul the legal system and give Soviet  citizens more power in virtually every aspect of society.  </P> <P> The deliberations were held out of earshot and sight of the Soviet public. A  last-minute decision led to a ban on live television and radio coverage of the  session.  </P> <P> The ruling, disclosed by the Tass news agency, contradicted an announcement in  the weekly central television program guide, which said that proceedings would  be shown live.  </P> <P> The two houses of the revamped Supreme Soviet, beginning its inaugural full  session, approved a 21-point legislative program for the next six weeks that  will consider laws affecting every sphere of life, giving citizens more say in  areas ranging from courts and churches to trade unions and grass-roots  government.  </P> <P> The future makeup of the Soviet government also was high on the agenda as  lawmakers faced the task of confirming or rejecting Premier Nikolai I.  Ryzhkov's handpicked Cabinet choices. Ryzhkov is scheduled to address the  Parliament today on his proposed Cabinet, Tass said.  </P> <P> Yevgeny M. Primakov, chairman of the Soviet of the Union, one of the two houses  of the Supreme Soviet, told lawmakers that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will  brief a joint session of Parliament on his trips to West Germany and France  when he returns from his Paris summit in two weeks.  </P> <P> Previous legislatures were rubber-stamp bodies that met briefly and  complacently "approved" nominees for the highest government posts, supplied by  the Communist Party.  </P> <P> The political system was overhauled last year at a special party conference  called by Gorbachev. A significant result of that landmark conference --  multi-candidate parliamentary balloting held earlier this year -- was preceded  by boisterous election campaigns that captivated the nation.  </P> <P> Anatoly I. Lukyanov, first vice president of the Supreme Soviet, cautioned that  the sweeping proposals on the legislative docket approved Monday are not  binding in the session, scheduled to run until Aug. 4.  </P> <P> Lukyanov "noted that putting draft laws on the agenda does not mean that all of  them should be endorsed at the current session," Tass said. "This only means  that the discussion of certain draft laws has started."  </P> <P> But the scope of the proposed legislation was stunning.  </P> <P> Draft laws placed on the agenda significantly extend such basic rights as the  freedom of assembly, conscience and self-government.  </P> <P> Some of the laws would give more rights to workers, consumers and inventors.  Others prescribe massive overhauls of the Soviet criminal and tax codes.  </P></p>

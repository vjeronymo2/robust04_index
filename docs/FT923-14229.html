			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Leaders seek end to Gaza infighting SENIOR Palestinian leaders in the Israeli-occupied territories yesterday struggled to defuse the most serious dispute to date between Islamic fundamentalists and the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Gaza. The row erupted on Tuesday night into gun battles and street fights in which a teenager died and 50 people were wounded. The unprecedented fighting, which followed a period of growing internal tensions in the densely populated strip, was between the so-called military wings of Hamas, a popular Moslem fundamentalist group, and Fatah, the mainstream PLO faction headed by Mr Yassir Arafat, the organisation's chairman. Young Fatah and Hamas activists have jostled for supremacy in Gaza's refugee camps and towns for several years. But the sharp escalation of their rivalry may have wider implications as Palestinians prepare for peace talks with the new government led by Mr Yitzhak Rabin. Hamas, which is estimated to have the support of about 40 per cent of Gazans, opposes the peace talks and is particularly hostile to accepting an interim settlement based on limited Palestinian autonomy, as outlined by Mr Rabin. Most in the PLO, including Fatah, have accepted the proposals in principle, but now face the task of making a deal acceptable to the Palestinian public. Yesterday, Dr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, the Gaza-based head of the Palestinian peace talks negotiating team, met Hamas leaders in an attempt to bring the latest fighting under control. But Hamas activists are determined not to have their voice suppressed. The European Community yesterday handed over Dollars 35m (Pounds 18.3m) to aid the building of homes for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>

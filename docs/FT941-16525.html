			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Boundary changes may remove familiar faces from Commons Several prominent MPs may find themselves defending marginal seats at the next general election if proposals to redraw their constituency boundaries are implemented this year. Party managers say that four government members - Mr Nicholas Soames, the food minister, Sir George Young, the housing minister, Sir John Wheeler, Northern Ireland minister, and Sir Derek Spencer, the solicitor-general - will find that, on the basis of votes at the last general election, boundary changes should mean that their seats go to Labour. The Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland and Wales, which are charged with ensuring that constituency electorates remain roughly the same size, are steadily reshaping Britain's general election map for the first time since 1983. Their proposals are not due to be completed until the end of the year. But they have already forced at least four members of the government and about 20 other MPs to start considering their options if they wish to avoid losing their seats at the next election. Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor whose current seat is being abolished, is among prominent backbenchers in the same position. Others include Mr David Alton, the Liberal Democrat MP, and Dame Janet Fookes, Tory MP for Plymouth Drake and deputy speaker of the House. However, Labour and Conservative party managers warned at the weekend that the changes may affect several other MPs who remain unaware that the spotlight will fall on them. An official at one of the major parties who is monitoring the changes said that the successor to Mrs Edwina Currie could find that the changes turn her Derbyshire South constituency into one of the most marginal Tory seats. Mrs Currie, who will contest the Bedfordshire South seat in the European Parliament this year, is to leave the Commons at the next general election. At the last election Mrs Currie held her seat with a majority of 4,568 over the Labour candidate. However, there are proposals to withdraw from her constituency a ward which contributed about 2,000 of that majority. Party managers believe that Sir George Young will find that his Ealing and Acton constituency is strongly Labour-leaning at the next election, after five Hammersmith wards have been added. Officials from the Conservative and Labour parties say Sir John Wheeler will have problems with his Westminster North constituency (due to become Regent's Park and Kensington North), which he defended with a majority of just 3,733 at the last election. For Mr Soames, the loss of part of the Mid-Sussex District from Crawley could dent the 7,765 majority which he had at the last election. Although he is not affected by current proposals, Mr Winston Churchill will have to fend off a Labour attempt to have his constituency abolished instead of Mr Gerald Kaufman's. Both MPs have seats in the Greater Manchester area, where the Boundary Commission has to select one constituency for abolition. 'In England only 17 out of the 46 counties have yet been decided upon by the commission,' said an official at one of the major parties. 'There is still a lot of water to go under the bridge.' Constituency boundaries are being redrawn because demographic changes have led to a sharp shift in populations out of metropolitan centres and into the shire counties over the last decade. This has created expectations that the restructuring of the political map will favour the Conservatives. According to Westminster Communications, a political consultancy, the Tories would have won six more seats at the 1992 election and Labour lost one had the proposed changes been implemented at that time. If their worst fears are realised, some of these MPs could have the opportunity of fighting some of the 20 or so seats that will be created by the Boundary Commission for England at the next election. However, an MP would have to judge whether it would be politically acceptable to desert a constituency simply because it had turned into a marginal.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WHO WILL LOSE WHEN CONSTITUENCY MAPS ARE REDRAWN?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Norman Lamont, ex-chancellor (Kingston upon Thames) Seat may be abolished  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- David Alton (LD Liverpool Mossley Hill) Seat likely to be abolished  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dame Janet Fookes (C Plymouth Drake) Changes likely to bring in Labour wards  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sir Derek Spencer, solicitor-general (Brighton Pavillion) Changes likely to bring in Labour wards  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gerald Kaufman, Labour ex-minister (Manchester Gorton) Seat likely to be abolished  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sir George Yount, housing minister (Ealing and Acton) Likely changes would make seat safe for Labour  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sir John Wheeler, Northern Ireland minister (Westminister North) Change likely to make seat safe for Labour  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Emma Nicholson (C Devon West and Torridge) Changes likely to bring Lib Dem wards into constituency  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: assessments made by Conservative and Labour party researchers  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

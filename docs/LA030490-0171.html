			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NBA NOTES;  </P> <P> THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING ON 'THE DAYS OF OUR HAWKS'  </P> <P> When we last tuned in to "Days of Our Hawks," Coach Mike Fratello was noting  that his team's largest problem was a "low basketball I.Q." He made the  observation before ordering his team to miss free throws on purpose in order to  improve its free-throw shooting.  </P> <P> Yes, life seems to always be wild and crazy with the Hawks, who are as  unpredictable as ever. Last week, they were humiliated by the host Pacers,  losing by 27 points. It was their 11th loss in 13 games. Afterward, Hawks guard  John Battle said, "We don't know our roles anymore. We don't know each other."  </P> <P> And, of course, two nights later, the Hawks ended the Pistons' 13-game winning  streak with a 112-103 victory in Atlanta. Perfect. When nothing is expected,  the Hawks are at their best.  </P> <P> The Hawks are led by the inconsistent but flamboyant Dominique Wilkins, whose  presence seems to guarantee only inconsistency and flamboyance. Wilkins, as  always, is capable of spectacular dunks and big numbers. But when is the last  time Wilkins, who is shooting 45.7% from the field this season, had a great  game when the Hawks beat a great team? It seems to have been a long time.  </P> <P> Last week when they beat the Pistons, Wilkins had 16 points. In their victory  over the Rockets, he had 26. Against the hapless Heat, he had 36.  </P> <P> In fairness, Wilkins hasn't had a lot of consistent help, especially from Moses  Malone, whose ups and downs have been so pronounced that he was left off the  All-Star team for the first time in 12 years. Malone's most notable achievement  this season, in fact, was his assertion that he was more important than  Fratello, who is in the last year of his contract. Perhaps Moses has a second  career in mind.  </P> <P> The Hawks still are without guard Doc Rivers, who has missed the last 25 games  because of back problems. And Jon Koncak has missed 15 games after arthroscopic  knee surgery. But both players are expected to be back in two weeks. In fact,  for the last two or three weeks, both players have been scheduled to be back in  two weeks. "Every time we ask," a Hawks spokesman said, "the doctors say two  weeks." Even the Hawks doctors act like Hawks.  </P> <P> Koncak, by the way, is now a Very Important Hawk. He averages only 4.0 points  and 4.5 rebounds, but, we are told, he plays great defense. The Hawks gave  Koncak a six-year, $13.5-million contract last season, and now we know why --  to play defense.  </P> <P> The Hawks have regained the services of Battle, who missed 16 games after  arthroscopic knee surgery. And Kenny Smith, who was acquired from the Kings for  Antoine Carr, is continuing to learn the system.  </P> <P> If the season ended now, the Hawks would be the eighth-place playoff team and  would meet the Pistons in the first round. Perhaps they could even advance to  seventh place and play the Knicks.  </P> <P> Which brings up a story. Muhammad Ali once said that one of the reasons he  defeated Sonny Liston the first time was because he had acted so wild and crazy  that Liston was unnerved, thinking he was getting in the ring with a lunatic.  </P> <P> Any opponent who studies the Hawks' situation closely will understand Ali's  strategy. And the scary thing is that they may understand how Liston felt,  which is why the Hawks, if healthy, are a potentially dangerous playoff team.  </P> <P> Bleak times for Cavs -- If the season ended now, the Cavaliers would not make  the playoffs and would not have their No. 1 pick, which they sent to the  Clippers in the Ron Harper-Danny Ferry deal.  </P> <P> Like the Hawks, the Cavaliers have been hurt by injuries, losing Mark Price for  eight games, Larry Nance for 17 and Brad Daugherty for 41. But even though they  now are healthy, they were unable to take advantage of the home court in  February. They played 9 of 11 games at home, but had only a 6-5 record.  </P> <P> Now they are in a period in which they play 10 of 13 on the road. If they can't  win at home, they're probably not going to win on the road. By the time they  get back home, they may have taken another step backward.  </P> <P> Mark of maturity -- Somebody must have had a serious discussion with Mark  Jackson between Sunday and Tuesday, and he must have listened. After the Knicks  lost to the Pistons and Jackson was booed, he said the fans didn't matter.  After the Knicks defeated the Mavericks Tuesday, he admitted the fans' booing  bothered him, which was another way of saying the fans did matter. Perhaps  someone pointed out to Jackson how unwise it was to belittle the fans.  </P> <P> Jackson is correct in pointing out that the fans have little patience with him,  but there is a way to reverse that. Stay in shape, play hard, don't taunt the  fans and don't minimize their importance.  </P> <P> A rookie teacher -- Another interesting theory from San Antonio on the Rod  Strickland-Maurice Cheeks trade: Cheeks, in part, was supposed to provide the  veteran support to make David Robinson's transition from two years of  inactivity to the NBA as easy as possible. The Spurs have been pleasantly  surprised to discover, however, that maturity is one of Robinson's major  strengths.  </P> <P> Therefore, the veteran influence became less important. And the Spurs also  believed that despite the questions about Strickland -- his moodiness and  pouting and, as the Knicks said, "lack of time management" -- Robinson would  provide such a good example for Strickland that any distractions would be  minor. And they may be right, which, again, will say a lot about the greatness  of David Robinson.  </P> <P> Bring on the Spurs -- The Mavericks had won 14 of 17 games before being  overwhelmed by the Knicks Tuesday and the Celtics Wednesday. The Mavericks had  hopes of catching the Spurs, but it seems unlikely. Mavericks guard Rolando  Blackman said, however, that the Mavericks would like to play the Spurs in the  playoffs, and the Strickland-Cheeks deal would have little effect on the  outcome.  </P> <P> "The main thing for us is that it doesn't matter if they have Strickland or  Cheeks," Blackman said. "We can beat them with either player if we have our act  together. They replaced a good player with a good player who is younger, but  that doesn't matter to us because if we play the way we can, we can beat them."  </P> <P> Around the league -- Life figures to be quite different for Pete Myers, now  that he is a Net instead of a Knick. But the biggest difference won't be  playing for a losing team instead of a winning one. The biggest difference will  be that when the Knicks play the Nets at the Meadowlands, Myers will no longer  be playing for the team that gets cheered.  </P> <P> The Celtics complained last year that Leonard Armato, Brian Shaw's agent, did  not give them a chance to negotiate to keep Shaw from going to Italy. It is  significant that Shaw recently fired Armato before signing with the Celtics,  who said Shaw will not join the team until next season.  </P> <P> The Mavericks offered the Bucks two No. 1 picks and Adrian Dantley for Ricky  Pierce before the trading deadline, and the Bucks seemed interested. But Bucks  owner Herb Kohl vetoed the deal.  </P> <P> Jazz President Frank Layden on NBA Commissioner David Stern's five-year,  $27.5-million contract: "The head of the Colombian cartel doesn't make that  much money."  </P></p>

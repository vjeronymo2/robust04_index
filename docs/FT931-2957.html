			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Siemens shares US rail order SIEMENS, the German electrical engineering group, claimed yesterday that its share in a US order for 350 diesel-electric locomotives provided a firm base for further expansion in the American railways market. The DM1bn (Dollars 600m) order from Burlington Northern Railroad, one of the biggest rail freight carriers in the US, was the largest single investment in the history of US railways, Siemens said. The lead contractor will be General Motors' locomotive division, EMD, which will build the engines in factories in Illinois and Ontario, Canada. The Stuttgart-based group will earn around DM170m, excluding income from licences granted to EMD, from the supply of three-phase alternating current motors. The first eight 4,500 horsepower locomotives will be delivered this year and the rest of the order will be completed by the end of 1997. Compared with the direct current diesel-electric motors commonly used in the US, Siemens said its power units were cheaper to run and maintain. General Motors is recalling 1.8m pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, equivalent to about 50 per cent of the vehicles' production, to correct a transmission fluid problem, Reuter reports from Detroit.</p>

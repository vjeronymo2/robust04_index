			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Observer: Man from the Bank As everyone agrees, Norman Lamont today has very little room for manoeuvre on interest rates. In practical terms, the Bundesbank holds the key. So it is appropriate that the Budget speech coincides with the arrival in London of Karl Thomas, one of the most influential members of the German central bank's policy-making council, for discreet chats with Whitehall and City eminences. The softly-spoken Thomas is one of the few members of the Bundesbank council with practical as well as theoretical understanding of monetary policy. Now president of the Hesse bank - one of 11 regional central banks whose chiefs sit on the council - he previously headed the Bundesbank's department dealing with monetary and credit affairs. On his visit, he will be talking with both Treasury economic secretary John Maples and Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of England. And besides pleading for understanding for the Bundesbank's tough interest-rate policies, he'll be banging the drum for Frankfurt as headquarters of the proposed European central bank. Even so, the Bundesbank will not be so crass as to offer the Treasury any pre-Budget advice. Thomas will not be seeing Maples until after Lamont's statement is well out of the way.</p>

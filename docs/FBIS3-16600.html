One thing is clear:  If the second theory is true, the movement is toward the  ousting of the Aliyev regime in Baku. [passage omitted]    While hostilities were under way in Karabakh, equally  curious  events occurred in Moscow yesterday. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has  learned that a delegation of representatives of the Azerbaijani  opposition secretly came here to announce the creation of a  Democratic Front and, subsequently, a coalition government or an  emergency committee under former president Ayaz Mutalibov (who  has been hiding from Aliyev in Moscow). Opposition members  think that Azerbaijan is on the verge of collapse. According to  their reports, 60 percent of the republic's territory is  currently not controlled by the Baku regime, while Aliyev's main  opponent, Prime Minister Suret Guseynov, has decided to wash his  hands of it and has resigned. The opposition, however, plans to  put forward their own proposals for overcoming the crisis -- by  way of rapprochement with Russia -- and their options for the  Karabakh crisis settlement within the framework of a general  peace settlement in the Caucasus.    According to reports from Azerbaijani sources, Azerbaijan  Foreign Minister Gasanov and Defense Minister Mamedov also  stayed in Moscow yesterday on a secret mission. Presumably they  were busy bargaining about their own political future in the  event Aliyev is removed from office. Gyandzha's fall may well  become a signal for the coup. So, Aliyev's fate is in the hands  of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Or of Moscow.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICE DEPT. WON'T ARGUE ABORTION CASE  </P> <P> The Justice Department refused Friday to seek permission to make an oral  argument during the Supreme Court's consideration of a Minnesota law  restricting abortions for teen-agers.  </P> <P> The decision to forgo oral argument appears to signal that the department will  not use the Minnesota case as the occasion to renew its argument that the  landmark 1973 abortion-rights decision be overturned.  </P> <P> Justice Department spokesman Daniel Eramian said the Bush Administration still  has as a legal goal the overturning of that decision, Roe vs. Wade.  </P> <P> Eramian said, however, that "it's premature" to say if the brief that Solicitor  General Kenneth Starr still plans to file in the Minnesota case will address  that issue.  </P> <P> Eramian said the department intends to join the attorney general of Minnesota  in defending the law, which requires teen-agers to obtain the permission of  parents -- even those not a part of their lives -- to get an abortion.  </P> <P> But the Minnesota case may not present the best opportunity for the Justice  Department to continue its argument that the high court should overturn Roe vs.  Wade, said a department source who spoke on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> The solicitor general, often called the 10th justice in legal circles, must be  careful to preserve his special relationship with the high court by not  pressing legal arguments that have been freshly rebuffed by the justices, the  source said.  </P> <P> It could be insulting to the justices if the Justice Department quickly returns  to the Supreme Court to raise the same legal point that the court rejected in  July when the justices refused to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the source said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Missouri Case  </P> <P> The Justice Department specifically urged the high court to use a Missouri case  to overturn the 1973 precedent, a request made in oral argument by former  Solicitor General Charles Fried.  </P> <P> The high court in that case held that the Missouri law did not run afoul of Roe  vs. Wade, and therefore the 1973 precedent was left intact even though the  statute prohibited abortions in state facilities or in hospitals on state land.  </P> <P> Because it involves a law restricting the rights of teen-agers, Hodgson vs.  Minnesota does not deal as squarely as the Missouri case with the fundamental  issue of a woman's constitutional right to abortion.  </P> <P> The fact that the Minnesota attorney general is not seeking to overturn Roe vs.  Wade in his argument before the court may also be a factor in the Justice  Department's reasoning.  </P> <P> The abortion-rights issue is a politically vexing one for President Bush, who  has shifted his stance from pro-choice to anti-abortion in the last decade.  </P></p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Large majority predicted for merger LEADERS of the AEU engineering union and the EETPU electricians predicted yesterday that their members would vote overwhelmingly for a merger in a ballot that begins today. After a three-week campaigning tour taking in 30 cities they said they expected the 1m members of the two unions to vote by at least four to one in favour of merger. Amalgamation of the unions would create a powerful rightwing force in union politics and might take the EETPU back into the Trades Union Congress. Leaders of both unions have promised a vote of all members within the next year on TUC affiliation. The EETPU was expelled three years ago for failing to carry out TUC instructions to withdraw from two single-union deals. Mr Gavin Laird, AEU general secretary, and Mr Eric Hammond, his EETPU counterpart, said yesterday that they would ask other unions in manufacturing to join them in a union that could counter the growing power of multinational corporations. They would also ask the Engineering Employers' Federation for national negotiating rights for a white-collar section to be formed after a merger. Voting in the ballot will last all this month, with a result expected early next month. If approved, the new union would initially have an executive combining equal numbers of AEU and EETPU leaders. The final constitution would be drawn up within four years. If the vote is in favour, Mr Laird would become general secretary for two years. He would be succeeded by Mr Paul Gallagher, EETPU general secretary-elect, who would hold office for up to two years.</p>

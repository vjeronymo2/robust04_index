			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Medelln seeks change of image: A look at efforts to rescue a city from the shadow of drugs AFTER years of being known as the world's cocaine capital, Medelln is trying for a change of image. Business has joined local government and some 400 non-government organisations to try to pull the community out of drug-related social disintegration and violence. Some 30,000 young people have been murdered over the last decade, according to Medelln's former mayor, Mr Omar Florez, but tensions have eased considerably since the last big bomb in January and there are signs that a few factions of the neighbourhood militia groups are prepared to disarm. Rumours of another 'imminent' surrender by trafficking chief Pablo Escobar circulate constantly, reflecting the assumption that he has lost so much of his support structure that he cannot evade capture indefinitely. An anti-drug campaign has been launched with the slogan 'Medelln, world prevention capital'. But there is so much more to Medelln than drugs, gunmen and Escobar that the slogan does it no justice. Located in a deep valley at the heart of the rich agricultural and mining region of Antioquia, Medelln became Colombia's leading textile centre early this century. Migrants flooded in from the countryside, yet somehow public services kept pace with the poor communities stretching up dangerously steep hillsides, and more than 95 per cent of the city's 1.8m inhabitants have water, electricity and sewerage. Antioquia's textile industry was thoroughly modernised during the 1980s, and clothing is the country's top manufacturing export. Although Medelln businessmen agree that it was essential to open up the economy, they criticise the government's inability to control cheap, cocaine-funded contraband and the lack of a coherent import policy - textile and tobacco industries are having a particularly rough time, which could push unemployment up again. 'The image of Medelln abroad is such that foreign investors don't even come here - but we do need foreign capital to bring in new technology. The next phase of industrial development will have to be in electronics, services. Our regional companies have been very closed against outsiders to protect themselves from drug trafficking money. Now we'll have to look outwards,' says Mr Juan Guillermo Jaramillo of the ProAntioquia group. Employment and education are usually singled out as the key factors in the violence equation. 'Secondary school places have been increased by 10,000 but another 40,000 are still needed, as well as technical equipment, libraries, laboratories. . . We have to provide training opportunities at the same time so school leavers can get jobs,' says Mr Jorge Orlando Melo, the presidency's special counsellor for Medelln. 'There have been a lot of small-scale projects and people feel the municipality is doing something, relations with the authorities have improved - people are animated and involved.' High on the mountainside above the centre, trucks grind up through the neighbourhood of La Primavera with passengers perched on the bumpers - the uphill fare is 250 pesos (21 pence) and the fare down only 150 pesos. A United Nations-backed social programme aims to help this and other substandard neighbourhoods by strengthening community organisations, improving housing and consolidating infrastructure, especially schools, recreation facilities and roads. The densely packed small brick houses have to be shored up with stone walls because of geological instability. In 1987 more than 400 people were killed in a mud avalanche a few hundred metres from La Primavera. Many of the city's hillside communities are reached by stairways rather than streets, and rubbish-filled gullies complicate communications. Great hopes are fixed on the Metro, which, after long delays and financing hiccups, is due to start operating in 1995. It is forcing a re-think of Medelln's transport system, as well as creating openings for land use changes and new developments around stations. In the meantime, though, street sellers, thieves and rubbish recyclers mill under elevated sections in the city centre and buses clog the streets. Medelln had one of the first development plans in the continent and the local administration is considered unusually efficient and honest. In order to decentralise and encourage community participation, the municipal government is building up a network of subcentres where services and taxes can be paid, documents processed and legal advice sought. Industry has already begun to decentralise and the Metro will speed the process by pushing up land values along the central corridor. New plants and flower farms have sprouted in the upland valley near the airport but one of the city's limitations is its poor road connections to Bogota and the Atlantic and Pacific ports. Some Antioquenos joke that cocaine trafficking is just another aspect of the region's much-vaunted pioneering spirit and money ethic. Others, such as Mr Jaramillo, recognise that a crisis had been looming for some time, and drug trafficking was simply the 'detonator'. Although the economy of Antioquia grew faster than the national average last year, three top export earners - coffee, bananas and gold - are seriously affected by world price and quota problems. Medelln's industry is also highly concentrated and unemployment cycles tend to be relatively deep and stubborn. But Mr Jaramillo undoubtedly reflects regional spunk when he says: 'We're not resigned here - new paths are always opening up.'</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVIEWS OF TODAY'S AFI FILM FEST  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'Mapantsula'  </P> <P> South Africa/Australia/Great Britain, 1988, 106 minutes  </P> <P> 6:40 p.m.  </P> <P> A taught, affecting drama about a man caught between two cultures, both of  which reject him: Panic (Thomas Mogotlane), a black petty con man, is dismissed  by the men and women involved in the anti-apartheid struggle as a traitor and  thug; the brutal police officers who want to use him as an informer despise  him. Director and co-writer Oliver Schmitz makes the cruel, amoral Panic seem  comprehensible, if not sympathetic, by exposing the social conditions that  produced him. "Mapantsula" ("thief" in Zulu) has been banned in South Africa.  RECOMMENDED. CHARLES SOLOMON  </P></p>

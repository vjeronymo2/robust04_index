			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUC ADOPTS UTILITY DISCOUNTS FOR NEEDY  </P> <P> The California Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday voted to create a  program to provide low-income residential utility customers with discounted gas  and electric rates, as ordered by a state law passed earlier this year.  </P> <P> The commission's vote set eligibility requirements for customers to qualify for  the discounts, which are expected to become effective Nov. 1, the beginning of  the winter heating season.  </P> <P> The commission will decide the actual amount of the discounts at a meeting in  September, a spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> To qualify for the discounts, a customer's household income cannot exceed  certain levels. For most utility customers, eligibility would be limited to  households with an annual income of no more than $13,000 for one to two people,  $15,200 for three people, $18,300 for four people and $3,000 more for each  additional person.  </P> <P> Utilities will begin notifying customers of the program in August and September  bill inserts.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, 27 May (TANJUG) -- The Muslim side has  not allowed a representative of the republic of Srpska army to  take part in the inspection of cargo at Tuzla's Dubrave airport.  The cargo is for UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] units and  reportedly it also contains humanitarian aid for the Muslim  side, it was learned today in circles of the republic of Srpska  army.    It has been agreed with UNPROFOR's mediation that one  representative of the republic of Srpska army will inspect every  plane cargo. However, since the agreement was cancelled, cargo  has continued to arrive by planes with no control. No one has  said anything about what will happen to the agreement. This  example shows how much the Muslims care to substantiate the  assurances that no military equipment is being shipped to Tuzla  airport, that is, how much goodwill there is to take part in  peace processes, the republic of Srpska army circles say.</p>

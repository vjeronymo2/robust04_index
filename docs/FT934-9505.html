			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Muramoto creditors warned MURAMOTO, the Japanese construction company which last week filed for court protection with debts of up to Y590bn (Dollars 5.5bn), yesterday warned that creditors might recover only a small part of their cash. Leading bank lenders could get half of their loans back, if Muramoto, Japan's largest post-war financial collapse, was put into liquidation, said Mr Katsusuke Amano, a lawyer representing the group. Low priority creditors might retrieve less than 1 per cent of their cash in the case of a liquidation, warned Mr Amano, who is helping the group to persuade the courts to agree to a restructure rather than liquidation. A meeting of about 400 suppliers in Nagoya, one of the main towns in the region where Muramoto is based, heard that the group owned property and land valued at about Y300bn in its books. Mr Amano warned the market value was lower, due to the fall in asset prices which preceded this recession. Mr Toyohiro Muramoto, group president, presented a ritual apology to the meeting and begged for suppliers' understanding. 'I could not overcome this situation, but we still hope to keep the company going,' he said. Suppliers were unsympathetic and questioned Muramoto executives for more than two hours in a hotel conference room on payments. Suppliers would from now on be paid in cash, subject to authorisation by court officials, said Mr Amano. Employees have been asked to continue work on the group's 535 outstanding contracts. Muramoto has Y10bn of cash in hand, which should enable it to complete 80 per cent of that work, said Mr Amano. Muramoto is awaiting the decision of a court in Osaka, the regional capital, on whether it should be restructured and turned into a going concern, or made bankrupt and liquidated. The court's investigators will take three to six months to make up their minds, said Mr Amano. If allowed to stay in business, Muramoto would take 10 to 15 years to recover, he said. Muramoto, Japan's 24th largest contractor, filed for protection from creditors after banks withdrew support. Estimates by Teikoku Databank, a leading credit research group, that the group's debts totalled Y590bn were probably too high, said Mr Amano. He calculated group debts at Y466bn, of which Y290bn was owned by the parent company and Y176m by subsidiaries. The final figure would depend on the results of the court investigation and the market value of Muramoto's property, he said.</p>

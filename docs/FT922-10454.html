			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (12): A model for many other countries - Singapore ACCORDING to Singapore government statistics, the average speed of vehicles on the island republic's roads during peak hours is 30kph. The equivalent figure for Hong Kong is 16kph, London is 15kph and Bangkok's is a mere 5kph. There is no doubting Singapore's success in creating an infrastructure which is not only the most efficient and comprehensive in Asia, but is unrivalled in most of the rest of the world. Singapore has achieved a glowing reputation for its road network, its port handling facilities and its telecommunications network. Changi, Singapore's futuristic airport complex, has consistently been awarded the title of the world's best airport. Yet things could have been very different. Singapore covers an area of only 573 sq km. As the republic's economy rapidly expanded, serious congestion of limited land, sea and air facilities could have occurred. But since Singapore's emergence 27 years ago as a fully sovereign independent nation, its leaders have anticipated and planned for future growth in a way which other countries have failed to do. Changi airport was opened in 1981. A second terminal, costing SDollars 650m, opened in late 1990. Now, in anticipation of further increases in passenger traffic, a third terminal is being planned while other facilities are being extended and refurbished. Singapore rivals Hong Kong for the title of world's biggest container port. In 1990, some 44,606 ships called at Singapore, a 14.5 per cent increase on the 1989 figure. Recently Singapore has become one of the first ports to be fully integrated into the 'Tradenet' computer system of export-import documentation. Ships' officers who once had to deal with up to 20 government departments and take two days to clear documents can now, through the 'Tradenet' computer, accomplish the same job in 15 minutes. According to Singapore officials, the system - financed with SDollars 20m from the government - has paid for itself very rapidly. It has also cut traders' costs by saving time and has increased export-import volumes. Perhaps Singapore's greatest infrastructure success has been with the roads. The country's planners realised some time ago that increased car ownership was a natural result of economic growth. At first, heavy reliance was put on a number of fiscal disincentives to vehicle ownership - making cars in Singapore among the highest priced in the world. Despite these measures, vehicle ownership continued to grow albeit at a slower pace than in other Asian cities. In 1974, Singapore had 142,000 cars on its roads. It now has double that number. In the same period, the car population of Taipei, capital of Taiwan, has risen from 60,000 to nearly 400,000. Since 1990, Singapore has brought in a vehicle quota system to directly control the number of vehicles on its roads. Within three years, the republic will have an electronic road pricing system in operation, through which each vehicle will be charged according to the use of roads in congested areas. Over the years, massive amounts of government funds have been ploughed into the infrastructure sector. The expenditure has reaped considerable dividends. Pharmaceutical companies have invested in Singapore because, among other things, the republic has clean water and reliable electricity supplies. Electronics companies rely heavily on Singapore's ultra-modern and cheap telecommunications system. Singapore does face some difficulties. It has to rely on its neighbours for some supplies of water and power. While its own infrastructure might be very efficient, onward economic growth could be hampered by bottle-necks caused by shortcomings in the infrastructure of Malaysia to the north and Indonesia to the south. But for many years to come, Singapore's infrastructural development is likely to remain a model for many other countries in the Asian region.</p>

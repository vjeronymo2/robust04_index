Elias] </F>   [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA -- The routing of the  Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance  Movement] from Bophuthatswana left the homeland's defence force  in control of the territory on Friday [11 March]. By Friday  afternoon, however, it was not clear if the Bophuthatswana  Defence Force [BDF] was in control on behalf of besieged  President Lucas Mangope, or whether it was siding with the rest  of the civil service which has rejected Mr Mangope's policy of  continued independence.    Civil servants and people working for parastatal  organisations have been on strike for the past week demanding  the homeland's re-incorporation into South Africa and  participation in the April elections. On friday afternoon, Mr  Mangope announced his intention to participate in the elections.    The country was left in a state of chaos on Thursday when  police decided to join the rest of the public sector and refused  to work. Within minutes of their decision people took to the  streets singing and dancing and shouting that they had  overthrown the Mangope government.    However, the AWB, with the knowledge of the BDF, began  entering Bophuthatswana in convoys of cars, minibuses and  bakkies [pickup trucks] filled with the khaki-clad and heavily  armed men. Estimates of their strength ranged between 1,500 and  5,000.    By early Friday morning the AWB was deployed around  strategic  buildings in Mmabatho, including government offices and the  looted Mega City shopping centre.    By noon the BDF had chased the AWB contingent out of  Mmabatho  and a bloody skirmish occurred in the Mafikeng central business  distrcit between the BDF and the AWB militants. They eventually  left the area, but South African Police [SAP] at Rooigrond, a  part of South Africa about 20km outside Mafikeng, said only  about 20 cars and bakkies had passed through a roadblock set up  by the SAP.    It was not known whether the AWB chose another route out of  the homeland or whether they were still in the area.</p>

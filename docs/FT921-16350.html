			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Barclays sells Danish operation to Alm Brand BARCLAYS has sold its Danish car, farm, and business financing and leasing operation to Alm Brand, a Danish banking and insurance group. Barclays Danmark has a portfolio totalling DKr530m (Pounds 47.8m), but the farm financing operation will be transferred to a separate business which will be managed by Barclays in London. It accounts for about half the total business of the subsidiary. The price has not been disclosed. The Danish group plans to concentrate on the car financing business, which makes up most of the remainder. Barclays said that the bank had sold the business because it did not fit in with its core activities. In some respects the sale of Barclays Danmark resembles the disposal of parts of the Mercantile Group last year. Barclays, the British bank which has made the deepest inroads into European markets, has no plans to alter its overall European strategy.</p>

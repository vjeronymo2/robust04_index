			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Polls show growing support for peace accord SUPPORT among Israelis and Palestinians for the peace agreement signed in Washington is steadily growing, according to a number of opinion polls published yesterday. Latest polls show that 62 per cent of Israeli Jews and 65 per cent of Palestinians support the 'Gaza-Jericho' peace accord although an even larger majority on both sides of the 'Green line', which divides Arab and Jew, support the holding of referendums on the agreement. In Israel a poll conducted by the Guttman Institute of Applied Social Research among Israeli Jews found that 62 per cent are in favour of the Gaza-Jericho deal, a marked increase on last week's 52 per cent. However, 66 per cent would like the government to hold a referendum or new elections. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, has ruled out holding new elections but said his government might call a referendum if the deal failed to get sufficient parliamentary support next week. Mr Rabin has repeatedly said the peace accord must get majority support in the Knesset without relying on the five Arab votes which make up his majority. At least ten other Jewish members of the Knesset, including six MPs of his coalition partner Shas and one member of the right-wing Likud Party, are currently wavering between abstention and support. The Guttman Institute poll found many more Israeli Jews support handing over the economically decimated and violence-plagued Gaza Strip - 81 per cent - than favour giving up the West Bank town of Jericho, which is backed by 59 per cent. Furthermore, on sensitive issues likely to dominate future negotiations over a permanent Israeli-Palestinian settlement, the poll showed Israeli Jews were much less compromising. Only 11 per cent favour concessions over the status of Jerusalem as a united city under Israeli jurisdiction and only 20 per cent think Israel should cede all or part of the rest of the West Bank. Only a slim majority of 54 per cent believe Jewish settlement in the occupied territories should be stopped. However 63 per cent are satisfied with the government's handling of the peace process. In the occupied territories a substantial opinion poll of more than 1,200 Palestinians conducted by the Nablus-based Centre for Palestine Research and Studies found 65 per cent supported the Gaza-Jericho agreement and 81 per cent favoured holding a Palestinian referendum. The survey found 45 per cent felt the agreement would lead to a Palestinian state and achieve Palestinian rights, 34 per cent did not think so. Opinion over ending the intifada - the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation - was split with 46.5 per cent in favour and 42.6 per cent against. The poll also found that since mutual recognition between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation was concluded last weekend, approval of the PLO as the legitimate and sole representative of Palestinians had increased, a large majority were in favour of amending the PLO's founding covenant which calls for the violent destruction of the Jewish state and a massive 80 per cent were in favour of democratic dialogue rather than violence. Both polls were taken before the upsurge in violence in the occupied territories which left three Israeli soldiers and a bus driver dead on Sunday after attacks by Islamic fundamentalist opponents of the peace agreement. The right wing sought to whip up Israeli fears. The Likud party said: 'The Israeli surrender to the demands of the murderous PLO won't bring peace to Israel but will only incite more terrorism and bereavement.' However, the government sought to exploit Palestinian violence against Israelis as proof of the necessity of the peace agreement which provides for Palestinian policing of Gaza-Jericho. 'These events strengthen the need for an agreement which will oblige the Palestinian population to join in putting an end to such attacks and punishing perpetrators,' said Mr Moshe Shalal, police minister.</p>

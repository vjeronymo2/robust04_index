			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 19 -- Prof. Krystyna Kersten on  Tuesday told the Sejm constitutional accountability committee  that Soviet archival materials, conveyed to the Polish side by  President Boris Yeltsin, are very incomplete and selective and  they do not allow for forming an unequivocal stand on whether  and in what circumstances the Warsaw Pact forces could have been  engaged in Poland in the years 1980-1981 and whether Wojciech  Jaruzelski "had rational premises to seriously take into account  the possibility that the Hungarian and Czech scenarios of 1956  and 1968 may come true" in Poland.    According to her and other historians, experts of the  committee, the archival materials do not make it possible to  reconstruct a coherent picture of intentions and activities of  the then Soviet authorities towards Poland. Experts opinions  were presented on Tuesday to the committee which is examining an  initial motion to bring to constitutional accountability persons  responsible for the imposition of martial law on December 13,  1981.    Prof. Andrzej Werblan expressed the opinion that the  entirety  of documents should be presented if one thinks of achieving  historical goals and not political ones. In his opinion,  Yeltsin aimed at political manipulation and interference in  Poland's issues.    General Wojciech Jaruzelski, testifying on Tuesday before  the  committee, said that the threat of external intervention had  been real but it corresponded to Poland's internal situation and  the then international situation. He also said that martial law  would not have been necessary if "Solidarity" had decided to  start talks with the government on setting up a council of  national reconciliation, if it had not violently opposed the  government's motion to limit the right to strike and if it had  recalled a large demonstration scheduled for December 17, 1981.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Can pay, won't pay I HAVE AN endowment policy soon to mature. It was taken out on my life and was issued in trust for my four (now adult) children. The life company will pay out to me. I asked if it would pay out to my four children but, as I am alive, it said no. Since the policy does not form part of my estate, I feel I can divide it between them with no restrictions. But my accountant tells me I cannot do this as it will be over the Pounds 3,000 I can give away in a year as an inheritance gift. Who is right? It would appear from your letter that the proceeds of the policy will be payable to you. But the policy contains life assurance so that, should you die during its term, your children would receive the benefit of the insurance cover. Once you survive the redemption term, the proceeds will be payable to you. As regards the amount which can be gifted, you are able to give Pounds 3,000 during the year to April 5 1994. This will be a fully-exempt gift if you have made no others in the year. If you made none in the previous tax year, then you can give Pounds 6,000 from the proceeds of the policy. If the proceeds exceed Pounds 6,000, then the balance will be potentially exempt on any gift you make and will become taxable only if you die within seven years from the date of the gift. Even then, however, the gift might fall within your nil rate band. Therefore, it is quite possible that no tax would be payable on the gift. But if you do not survive for seven years, then, assuming that the gift falls within the nil rate band, the remainder of your estate could become taxable if it exceeds the nil rate band of Pounds 150,000.

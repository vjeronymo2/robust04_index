			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Referendum pits Mubarak against apathy EGYPTIANS are likely today to guarantee Mr Hosni Mubarak's presidency to the end of the millennium, by endorsing in a referendum the 65-year-old leader's candidacy for a third six-year term. The state-owned Akhbar el-Yawm newspaper yesterday published opinion polls indicating Mr Mubarak would win backing from 93.7 per cent of voters, with an 80 per cent turnout. However, independent surveys last week showed only 30 per cent of voters had bothered to register for the poll - which offers a straight yes or no vote on Mr Mubarak's unrivalled candidacy. Although there is no alternative candidate, and the result has been a foregone conclusion since the National Assembly rubber-stamped Mr Mubarak's candidacy for the referendum in July, the government has been straining to portray the exercise as one of 'deepening citizenship and the concept of participation'. TV commercials, posters and banners have assaulted the Egyptian public for weeks in an attempt to whip up the democratic spirit. But the campaign appears more to demonstrate the depth of official concern that few Egyptians will see the point in appearing at the polling stations. If a carefully stage-managed 'Yes to Mubarak' rally this weekend in the poor Zenhom district of Cairo is any guide, it is a real fear. Organisers put the crowd at 10,000, but it was no larger than an end-of-season, mid-table third division soccer match - 2,000 at most - and about as enthusiastic. Repeated attempts by the speakers to raise pro-Mubarak chants, or songs praising the president, fell flat and the crowds began drifting home half an hour into the two-hour event. Mr Mubarak has even shown a glimmer of embarrassment over this east-European style campaign. In a recent interview he conceded he did not wish to receive a 99 per cent endorsement. 'I do not like it, because perfection belongs to God alone,' he said. 'The most important thing is that every citizen goes to the polls, because democracy grows by practice.' For a growing number of critics of the present government, however, today's referendum is the wrong sort of practice - one which results from a constitution drawn up in 1971 on essentially east-European socialist lines. Moreover, although the former air force general who replaced President Sadat in 1981 cautiously introduced a modicum of democratic opening into the system during his earlier term, he has also ruled the country under a 12-year-long state of emergency. 'The essence of democracy is choice,' said one liberal intellectual. 'This right is totally abolished under our present system. Is it any wonder people lose interest?'</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Elderly 'face cost difficulty on care' ELDERLY PEOPLE are unlikely to be able to meet the cost of residential care by selling their homes, a study for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an independent research body, has found. The report by Mr Ian Gibbs, of York University, says that only half of pensioner households are owner-occupiers and just one in five lives in a house worth more than Pounds 40,000. Care bills can cost nearly Pounds 10,000 a year and nine out of 10 home owners aged 75 or more could not afford the fees from their existing income. Even if they sold their properties, seven out of 10 would still be unable to afford the fees. Payments would involve spending capital as well as investment income.</p>

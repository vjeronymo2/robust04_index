Today, the main task for the Republic is actual security of  economic and political independence of Latvia, said Ivars  Kezbers, the fund's adviser on external relations. According to  the conception, concrete events will be executed in order that  juridical institutions daily and actually take care of security  of Latvia's population and guarantee people human rights and  freedoms. According to the conception, all structures fighting  against crimes should be united in the institution of state  police.    In correspondence to the conception, only one department of  counterintelligence and one department of intelligence service  are necessary in Latvia. These two services should not be split  into various other state institutions, as it is at present. In  addition, one more special service is necessary in the Latvian  Ministry of Defense. This service will deal with military  counterintelligence.</p>

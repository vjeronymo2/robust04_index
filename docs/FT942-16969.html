			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: Rothmans, Vendome to join indices - Indications would put companies in Mid 250 index Rothmans and Vendome Luxury Group will be included in UK stock market indices next year under a rule approved yesterday by the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices Committee. Shares in the two companies, formed last October through the reorganisation of the tobacco and luxury goods empire, had initially been excluded from the FT-SE indices, although Dunhill, their former incarnation, had been included. On current indications Rothmans would be included in the Mid 250 index, while Vendome could be on the borderline of the Mid 250. The two groups each have a complex corporate structure, with one UK company share and one foreign company share traded in 'stapled units'. Only the UK company share is eligible to be included in the UK indices, and the problem lies in determining the proportion of the stapled unit accounted for by the eligible company. The companies' weightings in the indices will be based on the percentage of the total assets which the eligible company is entitled to, calculated from the audited accounts. After Rothmans and Vendome lost an appeal to have their shares included last December, a working party was set up to look at the question of the treatment of such complex cross border structures in the indices. An adviser to the two companies, who was involved in pressing for their inclusion, said yesterday of the committee's decision that he was 'happy they have changed their thinking.' However, he thought there could still be subjectivity in the value given to companies in indices if they had significant intangible assets. Under the new rule, SmithKline Beecham units will remain in the indices.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Steel groups hit by fall in demand TWO big European steel groups - Thyssen and Usinor Sacilor - made results announcements yesterday which underlined the weakness of demand within the industry. Thyssen, a German industrial and trading group as well as a significant steel producer, reported a 14 per cent fall in sales for the first quarter of this year, as it steel divisions suffered dramatic losses caused by falling demand and low prices. Incoming orders for the first quarter fell by 12 per cent to DM8.2bn (Dollars 5.4bn). Mr Heinz Kriwet, president, blamed the setback on the continued decline in the steel side which reported a 16 per cent fall in turnover for the quarter. Mr Ekkehard Schulz, president of Thyssen Stahl, said he did not expect results in the steel divisions to improve significantly in the second quarter of the year. Thyssen Stahl recently lost a contract with Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors, for 30,000 tonnes of steel products to a consortium of steel producers including Klockner, the west German producer, Ecostahl of east Germany, Arbet of Luxembourg and Cockerill of Belgium. For the year ended September 1992, net profits for the Thyssen group tumbled to DM350m from DM520m a year earlier. Sales for the period were 2 per cent lower at DM35.7bn. The steel divisions lost money last year, but the group's other two main business showed improvements. Sales for Thyssen Industrie, Budd, the US subsidiary, and Wulfrather Gruppe climbed by 6 per cent to DM12bn for the year. Losses at Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steelmaker, last year fell to FFr2.4bn (Dollars 452m) from FFr3bn in 1991, the group estimated yesterday. The loss, which came on a 10.8 per cent decline in sales to FFr86.7bn reflects a continuing decline in steel demand and prices, said Mr Francis Mer, the chairman. Usinor Sacilor had trimmed output to adjust the fall in demand, but did not expect its result to improve in the first half of this year. However, it did expect to feel the benefits of price rises for flat steel products from the second quarter of 1993, said Mr Mer. The group reduced its workforce by just over 7,000 last year to 90,800. Of this, 4,400 were job losses in France, among the biggest workforce reductions in the French public sector and a serious worry to the government.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said  the resolution of the Kashmir issue is vital to complete the  charter of the Pak-India partition plan. She was addressing a  news conference in Kathmandu this afternoon prior to her  departure for home. Replying to a question on plebiscite in  Kashmir, the prime minister said:    [Begin Bhutto recording] (?Already) Pakistan made its demand  for plebiscite. And you know who else agreed to plebiscite?  Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India. And you know who  else agreed to plebiscite? The entire international community  in the United Nations. So what we are saying is that why this  subcontinent gives rapt attention just because India and  Pakistan cannot deal with the problem which we have inherited  from partition. [sentence as heard] So, we are saying let us  solve that. Let us solve that under the Simla agreement and let  us in the light of UN resolution (?if we cannot do it  bilaterally). So let us do it multilaterally, but let us find a  political solution. I noted the Indian scene that this is the  Pakistani inspired uprising. But that is not so. There is no  difference in this uprising than the difference wherein the  people of Nepal rose up against the Rana rulers, for instance.  So nobody can quench the desire of freedom because it is the  part of the way I think; it is the people of a country or the  people of a society. [sentence as heard] If they rise up,  nobody can do anything about it. [end recording]    To another question, she said her visit to Nepal will herald  a new era of cooperation between Pakistan and Nepal.    A warm send off was given to the prime minister when she  left  Kathmandu today for Islamabad. The Nepalese prime minister, Mr.  Girija Prasad Koirala, bade farewell to Ms. Benazir Bhutto at  the Tribhuvan Airport. Also present to see off the prime  minister of Pakistan were members of the Nepalese cabinet, the  mayor of Kathmandu, senior officials of the government,  diplomats based in the Nepalese capital, and members of the  Pakistani community. An impressive guard of honor was presented  to Ms. Benazir Bhutto. National anthems of the two countries  were also played on the occasion. Before boarding the aircraft,  the prime minister and members of her entourage deeply thanked  the Nepalese prime minister and other officials of his  government for the warm hospitality during their stay in  Kathmandu.    The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, called on his  majesty  King Birendra of Nepal at Narenhiti Royal Palace in Kathmandu  last night. The talks between his majesty and the prime  minister lasted over half an hour. Later, King Birendra hosted  a dinner in honor of Ms. Benazir Bhutto at the palace. The  dinner was also attended by Queen Aishwarya; the prime minister  of Nepal, Mr. Girija Prasad Koirala; and members of the prime  minister's entourage.    The prime minister is now back in Islamabad.</p>

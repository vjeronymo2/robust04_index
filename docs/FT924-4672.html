			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: First merger in Polish banking completed BANK IG, one of Poland's larger private banks, yesterday took over the lossmaking Lodzki Bank Rozwoju (LBR), the first merger in the sector since the government began reforming the industry three years ago. LBR, a private bank set up in 1988, was heading for bankruptcy, with a loss over the past two years of 191.7bn zlotys (Dollars 12m). The central bank, which took LBR back under its control in November 1991, approved the merger. It said other small and weak private banks which had sprung up since 1989 should also merge. Bank IG will pay 29bn zlotys for a new issue of LBR shares, giving it 99 per cent of the voting rights. Bank IG is one of two banks in Poland whose shares are quoted on the Warsaw stock exchange. It will be taking over LBR's 24 branches and a 1,118bn zlotys loan portfolio of which 903bn zlotys is overdue. Deposits are valued at 1,021bn zlotys. Poland's central bank has given the Pioneer First Polish Trust Fund, the country's only foreign-owned mutual fund, permission to invest 10 per cent of its assets abroad. Pioneer First Polish is part of the Pioneer Group which is based in Boston in the US. Previously, it invested Poles' savings in local Treasury bonds and stocks on the fledgling Warsaw stock market. The move provides Poles with their first opportunity to legally invest their savings abroad. At the moment, private capital investment by individuals abroad requires special permits from the central bank. Foreign insurance companies such as AGF and Commercial Union who have joint ventures in Poland are still waiting for permission from the central bank to invest some premium income abroad.</p>

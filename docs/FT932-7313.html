			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / US Senate approves nomination of Achtenberg by 58 votes to 31 - the nomination of Ms Roberta Achtenberg as assistant secretary of housing and urban development. She thus becomes, it seems, the first openly declared lesbian to be confirmed in a senior US government position, reports Jurek Martin. Conservative senators, led by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, had directed their attack on her sexual orientation, not her qualifications for the job, which is to administer the laws on fair housing.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Hospital trust fined Pounds 7,500 THE Anglian Harbours Hospital Trust, at Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, was yesterday fined Pounds 7,500 for keeping filthy kitchens at two hospitals. It is thought to be the first time a National Health Service trust has been prosecuted since changes in hygiene regulations. The trust admitted before Great Yarmouth magistrates to 22 charges under food hygiene regulations and one under the Food Safety Act. Mr Malcolm Savory, for the trust, said the fine would have to be paid from money earmarked for patient services.</p>

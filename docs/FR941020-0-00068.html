			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Existing 30 CFR 816.49(a)(5) is redesignated as 816.49(a)(6). In redesignated &sect;816.49(a)(6)(i), OSM is conforming the scope of this provision to the other paragraphs in this section by adding the phrase, ``Class B or C for dams in TR&hyph;60, or'' to the final sentence. The final version is identical to the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing 30 CFR 816.49(a)(8) redesignated as 816.49(a)(9). OSM revised as proposed redesignated &sect;816.49(a)(9)(ii) by redesignating &sect;&sect;816.49 (a)(9)(ii) (A) and (B) to be &sect;&sect;816.49 (a)(9)(ii) (B) and (C), respectively, and adding as proposed the spillway requirements for impoundments meeting the SCS Class B or C criteria for dams in TR&hyph;60 as new &sect;816.49 (a)(9)(ii)(A). Two commenters believe the spillway hydrograph requirements are not consistent with TR&hyph;60. Specifically, they felt the ``freeboard hydrograph'' from Table 2&hyph;5 should be used instead of the ``emergency spillway hydrograph'' in &sect;816.49(a)(9)(ii)(A). The commenters asserted that the emergency spillway hydrograph is not to be used to determine capacity of the spillway, but is used to proportion the spillway to ensure safe water velocities. The commenters also asserted that it is the freeboard hydrograph that is to be used to set the spillway capacities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees with the commenters. OSM intends the freeboard hydrograph and the emergency spillway hydrograph to be used as they are defined by SCS. The ``emergency spillway hydrograph'' is the hydrograph used to establish the dimensions of the emergency spillway. The ``freeboard hydrograph'' is the hydrograph used to establish the minimum settled elevation of the top of the dam. It is also used to evaluate the structural integrity of the spillway system. OSM disagrees with the suggested change to &sect;816.49(a)(9)(ii)(A) and believes it has already appropriately referenced the ``freeboard hydrograph'' in the citation at &sect;816.49(a)(5) and it would go beyond the requirements of TR&hyph;60 to also reference it in &sect;816.49(a)(9)(ii)(A). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters suggested that 30 CFR 816.49(a)(9)(ii) (A) and (B) be clarified to ensure that structures meeting SCS Class B or C criteria and the MSHA size criteria are designed and constructed to safely pass the precipitation event specified by SCS and not the 100-year 6-hour event. OSM does not agree that clarification is necessary, because the rule is clear that impoundments meeting MSHA criteria must be designated and constructed to MSHA requirements and impoundments meeting the SCS Class B or C criteria, regardless of size, have to be designed and constructed to safely pass the emergency spillway hydrograph specified in &sect;816.49(a)(9)(ii)(A). Therefore, OSM is issuing the final rule as it was proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As proposed, existing 30 CFR 816.49(a)(10) is redesignated as &sect;816.49(a)(11). OSM revised redesignated section &sect;816.49(a)(11)(iv) to clarify that impoundments meeting the SCS Class B or C criteria for dams in TR&hyph;60, like those meeting MSHA criteria, may not be inspected by a qualified registered professional land surveyor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing 30 CFR 816.49(a)(11) is redesignated as &sect;816.49(a)(12). OSM revised redesignated &sect;816.49(a)(12) to add the requirement that impoundments meeting the SCS Class B or C criteria for dams in TR&hyph;60 be examined in accordance with the requirements in 30 CFR 77.216&hyph;3 of the MSHA rules. In the preamble to the proposed rules (June 28, 1991 (56 FR 29777)), the word  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  was left out of a sentence and reversed the intention of a part of the discussion. The sentence should have read ``OSM agrees with MSHA's proposed revisions to 30 CFR 77.216&hyph;3 but does  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  need to modify its proposed regulatory text for 30 CFR 816.49(a)(12) to be consistent with the MSHA proposal at this time.'' Three commenters submitted their opposition to OSM's apparent adoption of the proposed MSHA regulations without adequate public comment. OSM did not intend to adopt MSHA's proposed rules. OSM regrets this misunderstanding. However, on March 2, 1992, MSHA published its final rules for 30 CFR 77.216&hyph;3. These final rules are incorporated by reference through OSM's redesignated 30 CFR 816.49(a)(12). The last sentence of the final version &sect;816.49(a)(12) is reworded for clarity from the proposal. There was no substantive change only grammatical improvement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter opposed the requirement that impoundments meeting the SCS Class B and C criteria, but not the MSHA size criteria, be examined in accordance with the requirements of 30 CFR 77.216&hyph;3 of the MSHA rules. OSM disagrees with this comment because the hazard associated with impoundments meeting the SCS Class B or C justifies the examination requirements of the MSHA rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM revised 30 CFR 816.49(c)(2)(i), dealing with requirements for temporary impoundments, by adding the requirement that impoundments meeting the SCS Class B or C criteria for dams in TR&hyph;60 as well as impoundments meeting the size or other criteria of 30 CFR 77.216(a), shall be designed to control the precipitation of the probable maximum precipitation of a 6-hour or greater event specified by the regulatory authority. Two commenters suggested rethinking the allowance of storage based impoundments where failure could cause loss of life or serious property damage. They believe there should be requirements to have onsite personnel to insure structural integrity. OSM disagrees with this comment because existing design, performance, inspection, and maintenance requirements of the regulations provide adequate safeguards. OSM believes this allowance is useful for those impoundments where the runoff area is small, or where pumps or a decant structure would be used to control the water level in the facility. OSM believes that current, prudent, engineering practice requires that at least 90 percent of the water stored during the design precipitation event be removed within the 10-day period following the event. OSM also recognizes that the safety of such structures can be reasonably assured by requiring that they meet especially stringent design precipitation event requirements. 30 CFR 816.49(c)(2) (i) and (ii) reflect this philosophy by requiring such stringent requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM revised 30 CFR 816.49(c)(2)(ii) as proposed by referencing paragraph (c)(2)(i) and thus identify which impoundments must meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, OSM revised &sect;&sect;784.10 and 816.10 which contain data on the information collection requirements for Parts 784 and 816, respectively. These revisions update the data contained in the sections by including the estimated reporting burden per respondent for complying with the information collection requirements previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

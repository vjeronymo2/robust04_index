			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, May 6.    A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court today initiated  suo motu "contempt of court" proceedings against  Acharya Giriraj Kishore, joint general secretary of the banned  Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), Mr. G.K. Mahajan, editor, printer  and publisher of Kabardar India (Hindi weekly) and  Mr. Ravi Thakur, reporter of the weekly for publication of  certain statements reportedly made by Acharya Giriraj Kishore  (on the Apex Court) in the edition of the Hindi weekly dated  April 11 to 17.    The Bench, which made these orders after perusal of the  affidavits concerned, however, said that there was no  justification for proceeding against Mr. Vishnu Hari Dalmia,  leader of the banned VHP.    The Chief Justice, Mr. M.N. Venkatachaliah, Mr. Justice A.M.  Ahmadi, Mr. Justice J.S. Verma, Mr. Justice G.N. Ray and Mr.  Justice S.P. Bharucha were on the Bench.    The Bench in today's orders said that appropriate notices  shall be served on all the "accused" by the court registry  fixing the next date of hearing for their personal appearance  before the court to hear "charges" against them.    The Bench, adverting to publication of certain statement  attributed to Acharya Giriraj Kishore in Indian  Express (Delhi edition dated April 10), said that, as  regards printer and publisher, editor and reporter of the daily  (respondents 4, 5 and 6), it (the court) proposed to examine the  question -- whether in the matter of a proper balance of  fundamental right (of free speech and expression including  "freedom of press") under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution  on the one hand and the need to protect the authority and  dignity of the court on the other -- it (the Bench) should  initiate similar proceedings against these three respondents  particularly in the light of the fact that the respondents had  carried out the publication pertaining to "press interview"  along with a "caveat" commenting on the "impropriety" of such  statements followed by an editorial condemning such conduct.  This would be examined separately.    The Bench appointed, Mr. Dipankar P. Gupta,  Solicitor-General  as a prosecutor.    Earlier, Mr. F.S. Nariman, senior counsel appearing for  Indian Express, contended that "An Editor/Publisher  does not scandalise the Court when he reports accurately and in  good faith what public figures say in public." He also submitted  that it was important that the "right of citizens to know" what  public figures said in public should "not be inhibited by the  law of contempt" so long as "what is reported is accurate and in  good faith".    To balance the interest of a "free Press" and a "fair  administration of justice", it was necessary to lay down as a  principle flowing from Article 19 (1) (a) read with the  provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 that a publisher,  printer and editor "do not themselves render liable for the  criminal contempt of "scandalising" the Court where "what they  do is merely report the public statements of a public figure,  and where such a report is published with a caveat commenting  upon the impropriety of such statements."</p>

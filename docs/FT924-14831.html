			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Big Indian sell-off next week THE Indian government said yesterday it would go ahead with the sale of shares in eight state companies next Wednesday. The sale, through open auction, is the second phase of a privatisation programme expected to raise Rs35bn (Pounds 730m). The eight include some of India's best performing government-owned enterprises - the Steel Authority of India, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (formerly Esso Eastern), Bharat Petroleum (earlier Burmah Shell), and the high-precision manufacturer Hindustan Machine Tools. Shares in 31 state enterprises were sold last year, in the first phase of Indian privatisations. According to Mr Suresh Kumar, an official in the industries ministry, shares in 12 more state enterprises will be sold in this financial year, ending March 1993. The open auction system is meant to ensure a more open and broad-based method of privatisation, say officials. Last year, the government offered random blocks of shares to mutual funds; this year, individual company shares will be auctioned. The government has stipulated that each share application not be less than Rs25m (Pounds 520,000) for the current tranche. The government is selling 5 per cent of the total paid-up capital of the eight enterprises, totalling Rs400m, to companies, financial institutions and individuals, through sealed tenders to be opened on Wednesday. The face value of each share is Rs10. The sale, officials say, is being phased, in view of the size of India's capital market relative to the assets of the public sector. Market circles maintain that the government put back the auction from October 6 to October 14, fearing an inadequate response. Individual investors, expecting the introduction of direct public offers soon, are unlikely to make bids at the current auction. The minimum amount of Rs25m to be offered is also too high for individuals, stockbrokers and private sector financial companies, say market sources. The cautious approach to buying is also related to investors not expecting high profits on their investments, at least in the short run. An indication of the poor response is that certain public sector shares already on the market have plummetted in the last week. Hindustan Petroleum shares fell from Rs1,200 to Rs650 this week, those of Bharat Petroleum fell from Rs1,275 to Rs750, and Steel Authority of India shares slipped to Rs65 from Rs85. When the government first decided to mobilise resources through privatisation in July 1991, it envisaged privatising loss-making companies which were a drain on the central budget. However, the government was forced to offer some of its most profitable enterprises because it feared there would be no takers for loss-making concerns, and that the fiscal adjustment programme required by the International Monetary Fund would be in danger.</p>

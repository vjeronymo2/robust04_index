South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said in  Pretoria that the group was analyzing the situation and had  initiated multiparty negotiations. He said differences between  the opposing military factions appeared to involve more than a  dispute on salary increases. A report is to be submitted to the  governments of the working group countries this weekend, and the  foreign ministers of the three countries will probably meet on  Monday to discuss the report.</p>

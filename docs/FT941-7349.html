			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Rules set for price-sensitive data The Stock Exchange yesterday released guidance for companies to use in communicating price-sensitive information to the marketplace, intended to aid compliance with the insider-trading rules in the new Criminal Justice Act. The rules take effect next week. The exchange said it would discuss with the Treasury a more specific definition of what constitutes creating a 'false market' for share dealing, because market participants believe the current definition is too broad and vague. The guidance was developed by the exchange and a panel that included representatives of shareholder groups, securities analysts and the 100 Group of finance directors. Mr Martin Hall, the exchange's director of policy, said: 'This is not a clampdown of information. It is intended to improve the flow of information into the market.' Mr Hall said the panel took the view that the faster price-sensitive information was made available to the marketplace, the less the opportunity for insider dealing. He said the exchange did not intend to take steps to see to it that companies followed the guidance. 'We are not obliging people to observe this,' he said. The exchange hoped that 'people should observe the spirit of this and it should not be seen as a bonanza to lawyers'. The panel stopped short of forming a definition of what constituted price-sensitive information, saying that it would have to include too many variables to come up with a consistent standard. The panel also considered, but rejected, suggestions that companies be required to issue quarterly trading statements similar to those required in the US. Mr Hall said: 'It is not part of our scheme of things to present a push towards quarterly reporting. There was very strong resistance to another formal regulatory burden.' Companies are, however, urged to make statements about trading conditions at regular intervals. The exchange clarified what a company's obligation is to analysts who make forecasts about profits. There is no obligation to tell individual analysts that their forecast is wrong and if companies do so they must immediately inform the markets generally. An analyst hearing such a forecast is required to inform the Stock Exchange which, in turn, will ask the company to make a statement. Companies ought, however, to make public announcements quickly when they realise their own forecasts of sales or profits are misleading.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              MAIN POINTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Companies should have a consistent procedure for determining what information is sufficiently significant for it to be price-sensitive and for releasing that information  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Companies should consider making their internal communications policies known publicly  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Companies should make arrangements to keep price-sensitive information confidential until it is announced, and must not allow this information to leak  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Companies are urged to have a structured communications plan with regular updates on their trading position and immediate prospects  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Where companies issue lengthy releases either to shareholders or to the market as a whole which include comments or future trading prospects, this information should be given due prominence  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- A holding announcement should be used where a company and its advisers believe that there is a danger of information about an unexpected or significant event leaking where the facts cannot be confirmed  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- If price-sensitive information is inadvertently released a company should take immediate steps to ensure that the whole market has access to the same information  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- A company should correct a public forecast as soon as possible if the outcome is significantly different  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Companies should not be drawn into correcting incorrect price-sensitive information or assumptions  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Companies should be prepared to give a 'no comment' answer where journalists are pressing for price-sensitive information. Where there is a risk that sufficient price-sensitive information has been collected for a story to be broadly accurate, a company should ensure the proper information is widely available  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

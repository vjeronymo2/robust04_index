			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: United Newspapers United Newspapers' shareholders have waited a long time to see how their company would spend the Pounds 190m raised in last July's rights issue. But the acquisition of a US periodical publisher is unlikely to disappoint. The Dollars 100m purchase price may seem a lot to pay for a Dollars 70m-turnover business. But Harmon will usefully complement United's existing US periodicals business. There appears scope to double Harmon's current operating margin of 9.6 per cent. Moreover, United will be able to exploit a wrinkle in the new US tax code which should ensure the deal will enhance earnings. By buying Harmon's assets rather than the outright business, United will be able to amortise the goodwill over 15 years, writing it off against tax payments. That effectively gives United some Dollars 6.5m of tax-free income a year considering that goodwill accounts for some 97 per cent of the purchase price. Shareholders may remain puzzled why United was in such a hurry to raise money last summer, especially since the sale of Extel for Pounds 74m in December added more to the acquisitions pot. But at least they will be patient in the knowledge that United's shares are now 48 per cent higher than the rights issue price.</p>

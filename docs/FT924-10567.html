			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Leading Article: One cheer for the chancellor AFTER THE collapse of its economic policy on September 16, it was necessary for the government to start afresh. It had to do so in the worst possible circumstances: a discredited chancellor, a slump at home and dismal economic conditions abroad. Everything that has happened since then has made the task more difficult and more important. With his new monetary targets and indicators, first set out in early October, yesterday's 'Mansion House' speech and the Autumn Statement, which is to be delivered on November 12, the chancellor is setting out the government's new stall. The question is whether he will manage to deliver either a plausible economic policy or a credible policy framework. What he has given so far suggests that he will succeed only up to a point, the problem being more with what he has not said than with what he has. The chancellor's position on fiscal policy is persuasive. It would be a mistake to embrace too naively the prejudice that so-called current spending is bad and so-called capital spending good. But Mr Lamont is right to propose a separation between capital and current spending for the first unified budget, due in December 1993. He is also right to insist on the maintenance of economically valuable capital spending in a recession, both for the short-term boost it can give to employment and for the long-term support for economic growth. Sustainable growth The monetary policy framework is more worrying. The key sentences are those in which the government's old emphasis on reducing inflation and its new one on growth are reconciled: 'the goal of the government's macro-economic policy has never been simply to defeat inflation. Low inflation is not just an end in itself; it is also the means to sustainable growth and secure employment . . . But just as prosperity can be jeopardised by too lax a monetary policy and too high a rate of inflation, so too, we have always recognised that policy can become too tight.' Loosening can be justified. The danger is that, probably too slowly and too late, loosening will go too far and last for too long. The host of monetary indicators the chancellor has chosen allows a discredited government machine too much discretion. Confirmation that the exchange rate still matters is, given past experience, not enough of a comfort. That the inflation target is prospective inflation, though rational in itself, also has its worrying side, in view of the uncertainty surrounding all forecasts and the unavoidable lags between policy and outcomes. Stop-go cycle The main bulwark against yet another deeply damaging stop-go cycle must be institutional reform. The chancellor proposes a new forecasting panel. The idea is good enough, though how much forecasting has to offer is unclear. The question now is who will be on the panel. Will it include mavericks such Liverpool's Patrick Minford and Cambridge's Wynne Godley and perhaps some foreign forecasters as well, or just the great, the good and the habitually wrong? The chancellor has a few other sensible notions: a new monthly monetary report, fuller justification of interest rate changes and, potentially more interesting, a regular report from the governor of the Bank of England on how far the government has progressed towards its inflationary objectives. Where has Mr Lamont failed? On policy, he has not made the fundamental point that if a devaluation is to work, prices of tradable goods and services must rise in relation to wages. Temporarily higher overall inflation than otherwise is how the reduction in the real cost of labour will in practice occur. But the combination of the needed reduction in the relative price of labour with the aim of low overall inflation demands far lower increases in earnings than those a supposedly desperate corporate sector continues to grant to its employees. No less important is the chancellor's continued failure to understand how deeply damaged is the credibility of both the government and of the whole government machine. What is needed is comprehensive reconsideration of the roles of the Treasury and the Bank of England. Mr Lamont wishes to persuade the world that the citadel on Great George Street still knows best. It does not, as the whole world now knows all too well.</p>

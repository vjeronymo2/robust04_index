Maslennikov: "Economy Taken Hostage By a </F> Shortsighted Policy"]    [Text] Simferopol -- And so Crimea has made its choice. At  his first press conference, Republic of Crimea President Yu.A.  Meshkov named three basic causes of our problems and anxieties  today: the collapse of the economy, paralysis of authority, and  rampant crime.    Indeed, the "market" we have allegedly built more closely  resembles a wild flea market. This is happening because our  economy has fallen victim to the shortsighted decisions and  actions of woeful politicians who have ruined a unified country  and a unified national economic complex built over decades.  After all, it is absolutely essential that political concepts  coincide with the functioning of objective economic laws. The  introduction of Ukraine's own currency--the karbovanets--has  resulted in nothing but chaos for the financial system and has  sharply undermined the standard of living of the populace,  putting many of us on the edge of extinction. Only the various  kinds of profiteers and bureaucrats can feel free under the new  conditions as they line their pockets with the distribution of  all the people's assets.    Task number one for the first president of Crimea is to put  a  tight lid on profiteering and so-called "grab-it-ization."    The new Government of the Republic of Crimea must draw  conclusions from the negative experience of "the Bagrov team"  and further to the greatest possible extent restoration of the  economic ties with Russia and other CIS countries which were  destroyed. And in order to diminish at least in some way the  grave consequences of the current collapse of ties, we must  utilize local conditions and resources more fully. We might  consider as an example in this regard the reforms of the Vrangel  government, and indeed--NEP.    A proper resolution to issues in the development of  agriculture and sectors of the processing industry would not  only help resolve the food problem which is so painful for us,  but would also enable us to accumulate funds to treat social  needs. But it is my deep conviction that our most important  source of wealth--the land-- cannot constitute the object of  buying and selling. It must belong to those who will cultivate  it conscientiously.    It is also necessary at the state level to examine questions  pertaining to increased housing construction (last year only  8,600 apartments were built in Crimea) and assistance to Crimean  resort areas. Of course, these tasks will not be accomplished  while proceeding along the path of Kiev's current isolationist  policy. We need decisive steps to be taken towards economic  sovereignty, especially in the conduct of Crimea's financial  (budgetary and tax) policy.    We must reform our tax system, especially since Crimea will  henceforth be conducting a tax policy independent of that of  Ukraine. Taxes must be levied for the budget based on one  indicator of production or production realization. This will  lead to improved accounting and control, and will downsize  financial organs. In such event, it would be advantageous to  unite the finance and tax departments of Crimea into one  institution.    In order to overcome the current paralysis of power and the  rampant crime related to it, we must elect to the Supreme  Council of Crimea and to local organs of authority as many  honest and decent people as possible, true professionals who  have not sullied themselves either in shady dealings in the  sphere of "grab-it-ization" or links with our state-trade mafia,  in other words--with that very environment that engenders crime  on the state scale.</p>

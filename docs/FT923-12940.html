			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Beijing connection should prove to be just the ticket - Cathay Pacific's share sale to Chinese companies underlines a growing trend THE purchase by Chinese companies of a further 10 per cent of Cathay Pacific underlines a growing trend in Hong Kong for owners of business franchises to seek a mainland partner. China National Aviation Corporation, a subsidiary of China Aviation Administration Corporation (CAAC), and China Travel Service each bought a 5 per cent stake in the airline from Hongkong and Shanghai Bank for nearly HKDollars 3.4bn (USDollars 440m). The deal was not about forging an all-China aviation and travel alliance, but about Cathay safeguarding its post-1997 future. Although both companies approached Cathay about purchasing a stake in the airline, it was more than willing to act as go-between for them and Hongkong Bank. It was singularly well placed to do so as its chairman sits on the bank's board. In spite of the Swire group's generally good relations with Beijing, Cathay  -in which Swire Pacific owns a 51.8 per cent interest - has had more than its fair share of problems with CAAC. CAAC resents Cathay's pre-eminent position in Hong Kong and would dearly love to have aviation rights which would allow it to operate out of Hong Kong. CAAC is a very powerful corporation in China, with important contacts in China's military. It is believed to be behind the difficulties the British and Hong Kong governments are having with China over the ratification of air service agreements with third countries. However, as one senior Cathay executive noted this week, the company hoped that CAAC's 5 per cent holding would improve co-operation and communication between the two. 'We hope that it will help CAAC to accept that a successful Cathay Pacific is in their interests,' he said. Cathay's post-1997 future is underwritten by the Joint Declaration on Hong Kong which the UK and China signed in 1984. It provided for Hong Kong remaining a 'centre of international and regional aviation' and said that airlines incorporated in Hong Kong 'may continue to operate'. The company's fortunes depend, therefore, on the way China manages Hong Kong after 1997 and the extent to which it observes the letter and spirit of the Joint Declaration. But Swire does have good connections in China, and Cathay has forged an alliance with Beijing-controlled Citic Pacific to run Dragonair - a small carrier plying the profitable China routes, in competition with CAAC, and now branching out to Thailand, Vietnam, and southern Japan. To many of the colony's leading businessmen there is no better way of safeguarding Hong Kong's future than by China having a direct commercial stake in the place. That stake is large, and growing. It has been estimated that the mainland has invested USDollars 10bn directly in the colony. That figure does not count its exposure to the stock market which, while unknown, is believed to be great. Next to US and British investors, mainland interest have been leading players in taking the Hang Seng index to above the 6,000 level. In spite of the colony's free-wheeling image, many aspects of its economy are tightly regulated by the government - a government which in five years' time will be part of the People's Republic of China. Keeping on the right side of government has therefore added piquancy in Hong Kong. Many of the old British companies in the colony are dependent on the continuing goodwill of the Chinese authorities for their survival. Ever since Jardine Matheson shocked Hong Kong in 1984 with its decision to move its domicile to Bermuda, the large and not so large of the colony's businesses have sought refuge from an uncertain future through various ways, many involving tie-ups with Beijing-controlled entities. Part of the reason for the Hongkong Bank's acquisition of Midland Bank was to diversify its asset base away from Hong Kong. Its headquarters are now in London and its lead regulator is there. Others have had to make their accommodations on the ground in Hong Kong. In early 1990, Cable and Wireless sold 20 per cent of Hongkong Telecommunications - the colony's monopoly supplier of telecoms - to Beijing-owned Citic Hong Kong. In 1987, it acquired 12.5 per cent of Cathay Pacific, which it sold last year to its listed subsidiary, Citic Pacific. Citic Pacific is run by Mr Larry Yung, the son of Citic's chairman Mr Rong Yiren - known as China's 'red capitalist'. Operators of Hong Kong's container terminal have seen it in their interests to involve mainland partners in their business. In April, Modern Terminals Limited, arranged for China Merchants to take a 15 per cent interest in the company at a cost of USDollars 175m. In 1989, Hutchison Whampoa sold China Resources a 10 per cent interest in Hongkong International Terminals for HKDollars 1.32bn. Only the electricity and gas industries have been immune from this trend. Neither Hongkong Electric, which is controlled by Hutchison Whampoa, nor China Light and Power (CLP), which is controlled by the Kadoorie family, have felt the need to involve China in a direct equity participation. However, CLP has given China something it needs: technology transfer. It was instrumental in building China's first commercial nuclear power plant with Electricite de France at Daya Bay, north-west of Hong Kong. It also supplies Guangdong with electricity generated by its thermal power plants.</p>

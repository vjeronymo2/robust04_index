			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Specialist bodies set to dispense lottery profits PROCEEDS from the planned national lottery are likely to be dispensed by a number of specialist bodies, the government said yesterday. The lottery, which is planned to be running by 1994, will raise money to benefit the arts, sport, heritage and charities, and create a fund to celebrate the millennium. Mr Robert Key, national heritage minister, said consultations and a study of top lotteries suggested that it would not be sensible for a single body to regulate the lottery and distribute the profits. Mr Key disclosed to the Charities Aid Foundation annual conference in London some of the details of how Britain's national lottery, which he said would have a top prize of Pounds 1m, will work. The government plans to introduce its Lottery Bill by the year-end, with the award of a contract to a private company to run it next year. Mr David Mellor, the former national heritage secretary, hoped the lottery would raise up to Pounds 1bn a year. Mr Key said distribution of money would require efficiency and speed, accessibility to large and small organisations, and experience so that decisions could be made. 'We need to distribute the riches of Croesus with the wisdom of Solomon,' he said. 'To me that suggests some degree of specialisation is necessary.' Although the government is clearly leaning towards giving specialist bodies the responsibility for distributing money, no decisions have yet been taken about the basis on which funds will be allocated. Lottery proceeds will be taxed, but probably at less than the 37.5 per cent paid by football pools. Mr Key said the government was considering clarifying laws for small lotteries 'to make charitable lotteries potentially more attractive', and raising the limits on prizes for small lotteries. The national heritage minister also questioned the view that the national lottery could hit charities' income. Research for national heritage suggested that the lottery would compete with newspapers and sweets rather than charities.</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> HEARING SLATED ON GUEST-HOUSE PERMITS  </P> <P> The Ojai City Council will hold a public hearing Tuesday to consider extending  a temporary ban on guest-house building permits for 10 1/2 months.  </P> <P> Planning Director William Prince said his staff needs more time to research how  to prevent illegal guest-house rentals.  </P> <P> Complaints from residents about increased density in their neighborhoods led  the council to adopt a 45-day moratorium last month. The temporary ban was  established to allow city planners to determine how many guest homes are in the  city, begin a public information program on their proper use and consider a  zoning amendment or other ways to crack down on illegal conversions.  </P> <P> "We think that getting out the proper information is laying the groundwork for  enforcement," Prince said. "At this point, we're still brainstorming ideas on  how to deal with this."  </P> <P> Although guest-house applicants have to agree that they will not install a  kitchen or allow the structure to be occupied for more than 30 days at a time,  city officials said it is fairly easy to convert the units to permanent  rentals. Prince said records show that the city has granted about 50 permits in  the past 20 years for guest houses or accessory dwellings with plumbing. Eleven  were issued in the past year. "We're preparing a letter to all the owners  reminding them of the appropriate use of the structures," he said.  </P> <P> The city has also started running a classified advertisement in a local  newspaper to alert potential renters that it is against the law for homeowners  to rent guest houses.  </P> <P> "A lot of people who rent these do not appreciate that it's not a bona fide  rental," Prince said. "The sewers or septic systems may not be designed for the  additional load, or the electrical system may not be able to carry more  appliances." THIA BELL  </P></p>

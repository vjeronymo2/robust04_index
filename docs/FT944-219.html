			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Tide of interest faces many locks - Why takeover talk in the water industry is tinged with caution When Big Ben strikes midnight on December 31, the revellers in Trafalgar Square's fountains will not be the only ones with water on their minds. January 1 1995, heralds the expiry of the government's 'golden share' in nine of the 10 regional water and sewerage companies in England and Wales. The 'golden share' was devised to offer protection from hostile takeovers after privatisation in 1989. Its expiry means the nine could become vulnerable to bids. Welsh Water enjoys legislation providing greater protection. Takeover talk started bubbling well ahead of the deadline. This month's hostile bid by Trafalgar House for Northern Electric, one of the regional electricity companies, has sent speculative ripples into the water sector. Investors have reacted to the apparent similarities between the two, such as solid earnings and relatively high dividends. Companies in both sectors also enjoy tax advantages. Share prices in the water and sewerage groups have risen, after a period of underperformance, in sympathy with the recs. Northumbrian, Southern, South West and Wessex, the four smallest water groups - seen as the most vulnerable - have outperformed the sector by about 3 per cent this month. Speculation has been heightened by some previous activity in the sector, albeit on a small scale. While the 10 big water and sewerage groups have not changed since privatisation, consolidation has thinned the ranks of the smaller 'water only' companies to just 21, from 29 in 1989. The smaller companies have been attractive targets, mainly because they lack the vast spending commitments, linked to sewage treatment, of their larger brethren. The Trafalgar-Northern battle has shifted the takeover spotlight from the minnows to the bigger fish. 'I wouldn't be surprised. I'm positively expecting takeover activity,' says Mr Andrew Stone, water industry analyst at Daiwa Research Institute in London. Many analysts are already trying to pick the bidders and targets. Northumbrian and Wessex top most lists. Northumbrian's small size makes it relatively affordable in spite of its high share price. It also stands out for strong earnings, according to Mr Nigel Hawkins, the industry analyst at Hoare Govett. The company's decision to raise its interim dividend by 16 per cent may have been a pre-emptive move to butter up shareholders and fend off possible predators. Wessex could be either a target or a bidder. Its deal to sell up to 20 per cent of its shares to Waste Management International, the UK arm of America's WMX, the world's leading waste group, has raised questions over its long-term independence. However, having a strong ally such as WMX could give Wessex a fatter wallet to fund acquisitions. Bristol Water, a small 'water only' company inside its territory, could be the first target. Other possibilities include mergers between the bigger water companies, a takeover of a water utility by an aggressive rec, or vice versa. Despite all the takeover talk, some observers are cautious. 'One doesn't hear a lot about this among the companies,' says Mr Don Ratledge of the Water Services Association, which represents the 10 water and sewerage companies. 'I don't expect any bids or mergers immediately. Possibly around the end of the decade, or later,' reckons Mr Bill Dale, the water industry analyst at SG Warburg. Their scepticism stems from the fact that the similarities between the recs and the water companies are superficial. Unlike the cash-rich recs, virtually all of the water companies have negative cash flows. Even those, such as Wessex, which have more cash than borrowings, will have to take on debt to finance the investment needed to improve water and waste standards. Mr Dale predicts that the water companies will spend between Pounds 6bn and Pounds 7bn to meet tougher EU environmental rules. Such heavy spending will hold back earnings growth for years to come. New legislation poses an additional risk. A future Labour government, or the European Commission, could tighten environmental standards further. Many also fear that Labour could impose a windfall profits tax. Regulatory regimes also differ. Mr Ian Byatt, the water regulator, has kept the industry on a much tighter financial leash than Professor Stephen Littlechild, his opposite number in electricity. Many analysts believe the recs' fat profits derive largely from a relatively generous regulatory environment. Life in the water sector has been tougher. A merger or takeover would also face a virtually certain referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Mr Byatt has given few clues of his views on deals. However, he has implied he would expect any deal to offer substantial advantages to customers. Analysts think he would oblige any bidder from within the water industry to pass on most of the expected cost savings to the consumer. That would strongly discourage intra-industry deals and, in any case, the companies are so physically bound to their regions that operational savings would be limited. That leaves takeovers from outside bidders. The disincentives are strong, however. The bidders would not be able to achieve the immediate cost savings of combining utility businesses, and yet would still have to fund the costly capital spending programme. Even deals between water and electricity companies could be difficult to justify. There is no strong reason for either grouping to expand into another heavily regulated area. 'The uncertainty in the water sector means it isn't attractive for outsiders,' says Mr Dale. So while investors may be preparing for further shocks among the recs, speculation among the water companies may turn out to be a damp squib.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: A sophisticated endowment EGEPT is the acronym for the latest investment trust to specialise in with profits endowment policies. The trust will be run by Exeter Asset Management, best known for split capital investment trusts. The trust has a complex structure. As well as ordinary shares, the trust will issue a zero coupon debenture. This will pay no interest in the conventional sense, but will be repaid at a much higher level than its issue price. The plus point is that the roll-up in the zero's value is tax-deductible. To take advantage of this, EGEPT (which stands for Exeter Geared Endowment Policy Trust) will invest in the income shares of split capital trusts, as well as in endowment policies. The trust can offset the tax it pays on the income shares against the zero roll-up. Thus, it will be able to receive gross dividends from the income shares. Furthermore, the trust will use the revenue from the income shares to fund the payments on the endowment policies it buys. EGEPT will have a 15 year life and will concentrate on policies maturing around 2008. Full details will be available next week. Meanwhile, reader Roger Honey has written with a timely reminder of the dangers faced by individuals when they invest in second-hand endowment policies. In November 1991, he bought a Scottish Amicable policy for Pounds 16,493 from market-maker Policy Portfolio. At the time, Policy Portfolio gave an illustrated maturity value in May 1993 of Pounds 21,568. The illustration was prefaced with the warning 'Future bonuses cannot be guaranteed as past performance is not necessarily a guide to the future.' As it happened, Scottish Amicable cut its terminal bonus rate from 53 to 20 per cent. The final payout from the policy was just Pounds 16,585.23. After Honey allowed for the additional premiums he had paid, he had suffered a loss on the deal. He complained, and although Policy Portfolio said the information it gave was of 'meticulously correct', the FIMBRA consumer arbitration scheme awarded Honey Pounds 2,377. Finally, market-makers are pushing to eliminate the use of the term 'second-hand' to describe these investments. The Association of Policy Market Makers wants the phrase 'traded endowment policies' used instead.</p>

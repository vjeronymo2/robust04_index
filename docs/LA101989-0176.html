			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSING STARTS DECLINE 5.2% TO 7-YEAR LOW  </P> <P> New home construction fell by a surprising 5.2% in September to the lowest  level since the depths of the 1982 recession, the Commerce Department said  Wednesday, heightening concern about the health of the economy.  </P> <P> The seasonally adjusted September drop left housing starts at an annual rate of  1.26 million units, the lowest since the October, 1982, rate of 1.17 million  units.  </P> <P> "Frankly, I think it's scary. The number gave me a bit of a chill when I saw  it," said economist Dave Seiders of the National Assn. of Home Builders.  </P> <P> The department also increased its estimate of August's decline to show a 6.2%  drop instead of the previously reported 5% decline.  </P> <P> "Home building is getting down to recessionary levels," said economist Richard  Peach of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. "But we remain confident that later this  year and in 1990, we will see a modest recovery."  </P> <P> The weak housing starts figure, a barometer of residential building in the  United States, was the second piece of poor economic data this week. The  government reported Tuesday that the nation's trade deficit rose by 31% to  $10.8 billion in August to a peak for the year.  </P> <P> Economists are now beginning to question the health of the current expansion,  since industrial production has declined, construction has weakened and factory  unemployment has risen, while exports have stalled.  </P> <P> "Housing has traditionally been a part a leading indicator for the economy,  weakening before the rest of the economy," Seiders said.  </P> <P> "I think the Fed (Federal Reserve) now has room to ease interest rates," he  added.  </P> <P> The September decline left housing starts far below expectations by Wall Street  economists, who projected a 2.2% rise to 1.38 million units.  </P> <P> In a disturbing sign for future construction, building permits issued in  September also fell by 2.4% in September, reversing a 3.7% August gain.  </P> <P> Housing starts have been weak since last spring because of high interest rates,  but they showed signs of strength in June and July. The summer gains then  dwindled in August, and the decline accelerated in September.  </P> <P> Long-term mortgage rates are now about 9.95%, compared to a high of 10.22% at  the beginning of September, and that has spurred some home buyers to enter the  real estate market. But interest rates have not fallen enough to renew building  activity.  </P></p>

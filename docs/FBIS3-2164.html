			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, March 5 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton's top White House legal counsel Bernard Nussbaum  resigned here today.    Nussbaum, a 57-year old New Yorker, said in a letter to  President Clinton that his resignation would take effect April 5  to assist the President "in arranging for an orderly transition  in the counsel's office," White House sources said.    In a letter of reply, Clinton said that he accepted  Nussbaum's resignation "with deep regret" and praised his  efforts, the sources said.    But reports showed that the President in recent days made no  effort to defend his counsel against mounting criticism from  U.S. Congress and federal officials investigating an Arkansas  real estate project which has links with the Clintons.    The lawyer's resignation is viewed here as a casualty of  turmoil over the Clinton administration's handling of questions  related to the real estate project.    The White House lawyer told President Clinton about his  decision to resign late Friday night as he and five other senior  White House officials were subpoenaed by the special legal  counsel, Robert Fiske, investigating the project.    President Clinton met with Nussbaum in the Oval Office late  last night.    The project, the Whitewater Development Corporation, was  half  owned by the Clintons and was connected with the failed Madison  Guaranty Savings and Loan.    The failed Madison cost the U.S. taxpayers 60 million U.S.  dollars and federal officials are investigating whether Madison  improperly diverted money to Whitewater or to Clinton's 1984  re-election campaign when he was governor of Arkansas.    The Clintons have denied any wrongdoing over the matter,  saying instead that they lost 69,000 dollars on the real estate  project in the 1980s.    The subpoenas have brought the Madison case directly into  the  White House, a bitter blow to the President and his aides.    The five senior White House officials who received subpoenas  were White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, Hillary  Clinton's Chief of Staff Margaret Williams, White House  Communications Director Mark Gearan, Senior Adviser Bruce  Lindsey, and Hillary Clinton's Press Secretary Lisa Caputo.  Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman and three of his senior  aides also received subpoenas.    In addition, a second subpoena calls for the White House to  produce all documents or memoranda on any meetings,  conversations or contacts on Madison between any White House  staffers and officials of Treasury Department.    Treasury Department officials twice informed the White House  last fall of the status of a federal investigation into the  failed Madison.    All the subpoenaed officials were ordered to appear before a  federal grant jury in Washington on March 10 when the documents  must also be produced to the jury.</p>

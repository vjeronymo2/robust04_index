			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> KANGAROO DIES AFTER PACEMAKER SURGERY  </P> <P> Skippy, a 7-year-old red kangaroo from the San Francisco Zoo that received a  pacemaker during a first-of-its-kind operation earlier this month, has died.  </P> <P> Zoo officials said the animal died Wednesday at UC Davis Veterinary Hospital,  where she had been transferred after the March 5 surgery. A team of  cardiologists led by Dr. John Langbert of the UC San Francisco Medical School  performed the operation. "We had done everything we could here," said San  Francisco Zoo Director Phil Arnold, "but Skippy's energy had not returned and  she was not responding to medical care, so we asked for help." Arnold said that  even with the pacemaker, Skippy's heart contractions weren't strong enough to  move blood through her body.  </P></p>

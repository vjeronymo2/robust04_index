			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Cheap and cheerful foreign exchange - In A Nutshell The cost and time taken in making small-value money transfers across borders has long been a source of annoyance to business. Eleven European co-operative banks have joined up to establish a system which they claim will halve the cost of cross-border payments to small businesses and personal customers and provide agreed completion times. The new grouping, known as TIPA (Transferts Interbancaires de Paiements Automatises), claims that TIPA-NET is the first Europe-wide payments network compared with the more limited hub-based systems operated by some other banks. New services and payment instruments will be added as the system develops. TIPA members say they will quote a price to customers and there will be no additional charges. The new service is designed to appeal to customers making payments below the level at which the banks' SWIFT transfer system becomes cost-effective. TIPA's members comprise co-op banks in Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany (four), Italy (two) and the UK (The Co-Operative Bank) but talks are taking place with potential members elsewhere in the European Community and in the US.</p>

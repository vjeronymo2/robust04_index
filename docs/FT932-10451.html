			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: UB wanted again The market's appetite for a bid for United Biscuits shows no signs of abating, with continued talk of a predator emerging over the weekend. Once again Cadbury Schweppes was being tipped as the chief suspect, although food manufacturing analysts continued to cast doubts on the speculation. Other names being mentioned included Associated British Foods and old takeover favourite Hanson. The UB price zoomed ahead again, closing up 8 to 429p. Turnover was a healthy 6m shares. Cadbury slipped 10 to 443p on rights issue fears, AB Foods added a penny to 471p, while Hanson rose 1 1/2 to 231 1/2 p. Another name attached to UB in recent days, Grand Metropolitan, was also rumoured to be a potential target by a US foods group. Dealers said that there were reports of preliminary fund-raising being undertaken in New York. GrandMet shares surged 6 1/2 to 429 1/2 p on good turnover of 6.5m.</p>

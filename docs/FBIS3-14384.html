			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid stressed that the 101st session of the  Arab League Council was eventful and was characterized by the  very high-level presence of foreign ministers. He added that  the session dealt with a number of political, economic, legal,  and financial issues that concern Arab countries.    Speaking at a news conference tonight following the  conclusion of the session, he said that this two-day session was  held at a very sensitive and critical time dominated by the  consequences of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid underlined the Arab League's desire to  give  impetus to the comprehensive and just peace process in the  Middle East. He also underlined the Arab League's commitment to  the Arabism of Jerusalem and said that this issue will never be  relinquished.    He explained that the Arab League Secretariat General issued  a statement several days ago expressing concern over reports  about new U.S. statements that Jerusalem is Israel's capital.  He noted that the U.S. Embassy in Cairo has denied these  statements and stressed Washington's firm stance on the  Jerusalem issue.    The Arab League secretary general said that the issue of  amending the League's charter has been postponed because of the  differences in the views of the member states on this issue. He  explained that identical views were required on the concept of  the amendment proposed by the Arab League's secretariat general,  but this does not mean that the amendment has been rejected. He  called for respecting the views of all the Arab parties, adding:  Differences in views do not spoil an issue.    Regarding his initiative on Arab reconciliation, Dr.  'Abd-al-Majid said that it is now being studied. He added that  he got the feeling from the ministers participating in the  session that they accept the reconciliation proposal but that  the matter will require more time because the Iraqi invasion of  Kuwait in August 1990 has left a painful wound.    He said that he raised the following question: Since we are  facing an Arab-Israeli reconciliation, hasn't the time come for  holding an inter-Arab reconciliation?    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid urged patience on the issue of Arab  reconciliation and expressed his belief that it will happen in  the future. He noted that no one spoke about Arab  reconciliation a year ago but it is now on every tongue and has  become a theme of a number of intellectual seminars. He said  that the Egyptian paper AL-AHRAM will soon host a seminar on  this issue.    Regarding the Arab League's stance on the Libyan-Western  crisis, the secretary general said that the seven-member  committee charged with discussing this crisis met on the  sidelines of the council's session and discussed the  developments. He added that the council felt Libya's desire to  find a solution that will be compatible with international law  and preserve that country's dignity and sovereignty. He said  that the Arab League Council backed the Libyan proposal that the  two suspects in the Lockerbie incident be tried before the  International Court of Justice in the Hague with Scottish judges  sitting on the bench and Scottish laws, which are more flexible  than British ones, applied.    He described this proposal as practical and emphasized  Libya's flexibility in solving the crisis, adding that no  country hands over its citizens to another country to be tried  there.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the council decided to lift the  boycott imposed on Liberia because of its dealings with Israel.    He said that the League Council decided to draw up a  comprehensive Arab concept on setting up a zone free from  weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East region, which  will be submitted to the League Council at its 102nd session  scheduled to be held at Arab League headquarters.    He said that the Islamic Republic of Comorro asked that the  next session be held there, but no decision has been made on  this matter.</p>

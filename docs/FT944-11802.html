			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Grade says ITV wants Channel 4 privatised Mr Michael Grade, the Channel 4 chief executive, yesterday accused a number of ITV companies of trying to persuade the government to privatise the channel. He told a media conference in Brighton that a number of companies had suggested to the Treasury that the privatisation of Channel 4 could raise Pounds 1bn for the government while also providing additional money to reduce the levy that all the ITV companies must pay to the Treasury. He said if the government tried to privatise Channel 4 'I will resign'. He insisted the government had made it clear that it had no intention of privatising the channel.</p>

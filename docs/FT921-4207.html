			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television There is little doubt about where the ratings will go tonight: there is another lorryload of Inspector Morse at 8.00 (ITV) and so far I seem to be the only person in Britain to have grown tired of this (and every other) computer-brained, eagle-eyed, all-too-human detective with odd habits. Tonight's case involves murder among the rich, not one but two. How do they think up these plots? It will be well made, Oxfordshire will look positively edible, and tomorrow everyone will say how fantastic John Thaw is. He is, in fact, a goodish actor who in this series has received a gift for which any Equity member would get down on his knees every night for a decade. In Timewatch General Basilio Lami Dozo, a member of the Argentine junta which made war over the Falklands, speaks out for the first time (8.10 BBC2). The food faddists are on the march again in Food File, wagging their fingers and crying woe, warning us that if we don't change our diet pdq we shall all die. I have news for them: they will die too, but without the fun that we sybarites have had with our cream, pork crackling, and pot au chocolat (8.30 C4).</p>

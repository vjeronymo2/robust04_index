			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shell doubts Interim results from Shell Transport proved a substantial disappointment to the market, with dealers focusing on worse than expected figures from the company's exploration and production division which were only partly offset by good numbers from the chemicals and downstream operations. 'The market obviously got too carried away thinking that Shell's performance would match that of BP announced at the start of the month,' said one specialist. Strauss Turnbull, however, adopted a more positive view, increasing its year-end forecast of replacement pre-profits to Pounds 4.6bn and raising its dividend forecast to a top of the range 26.6p 'The market will be pleasantly surprised by the dividend, which will be boosted because of the weakness of sterling against the Dutch guilder,' said Mr John Toalster, oil analyst at Strauss. Shell fell 12 to 718p.</p>

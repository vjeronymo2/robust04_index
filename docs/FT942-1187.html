			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Court backs investors: Higher payouts demanded for debt-ridden victims of poor advice Elderly victims of poor financial advice which saddled them with enormous debts are entitled to more compensation, the Court of Appeal ruled yesterday. The court ruled that the Investors Compensation Scheme was wrong in using its discretion to limit compensation to investors in home income plans. It may have to pay an extra Pounds 20m in addition to the Pounds 22.5m compensation it has already paid to more than 1,800 investors. The ICS is expected to appeal to the House of Lords. It said yesterday the ruling would force it to change from a low-cost, fast, informal compensation scheme to a lengthy and highly legalistic one, where legal precedents would have to be set for each new type of case and claimants might need legal representation. 'While today's group of investors will benefit, we think ultimately investors will suffer,' said Mr David Cresswell of the ICS. Those affected by the appeal ruling are unlikely to receive additional compensation until all legal channels have been exhausted. Home income plans were widely sold during the housing boom of the late 1980s. They enabled householders, often elderly, to mortgage their homes and invest the proceeds in income bonds, which were supposed to pay the interest on the mortgage and provide an additional income. Some plans used roll-up mortgages, which added the interest to the total debt. A combination of falling house prices, rising interest rates and declining investment returns left many investors, who had not been warned of the risks, with huge debts and no means to pay the interest. Some have lost their homes. Many of the financial advisers who sold the plans are no longer in business, so investors turned to the ICS for compensation. Yesterday's ruling was on an appeal brought by lawyers Barnett Sampson, on behalf of two representative investors. It covered three main points: Whether the ICS had discretion to reduce compensation to what it considered fair. Whether the ICS could deduct from the compensation any money received from the plan and spent by the plaintiffs. Whether the ICS could lawfully limit compensation for solicitors' and accountants' fees to Pounds 500. The Court of Appeal ruled against the ICS on all three points. The judgment's wider implications are that it requires the ICS to take all relevant factors into account for each case, in the same way that a court would. The ICS would no longer have discretion to set a formula for compensation, or set limits other than its standard overall limit of Pounds 48,000. The ICS is funded by a levy on the insurance and financial services industry. Extra payouts on home income plans would probably come from an insurance policy covering 1991-92, when most of the firms selling home income plans collapsed. Since 1992, the ICS has not been able to obtain insurance.</p>

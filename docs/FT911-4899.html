			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sri Lanka beats India as top tea exporter SRI LANKA beat India to become the world's biggest tea exporter in 1990, exporting 216m kg of tea compared with Indian exports of slightly less than 206m kg, writes Mervyn de Silva in Colombo. The local tea trade attributes Sri Lanka's performance to a substantial rise in sales to Jordan, in spite of the disruption of shipping to the Middle East, which accounted for 26m kg more in 1990 than in 1989. Sri Lanka also maintained regular supplies to Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Sri Lankan tea exports to Iran nearly doubled while Indian tea sales dropped sharply. The Soviet Union also continued to be a substantial buyer. Tea production last year at 240m kg compared with the previous record of 229m kg in 1965. The sharp increase in the production of 'low grown' teas (teas grown below 2,000 feet) was an important feature, according to the Sri Lankan tea commissioner.</p>

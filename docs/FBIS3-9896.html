			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marianela Samper] </F>   [Excerpts] FBI sources in Miami have reported that  representatives from the FBI and the Attorney General's Office  will meet to determine whether or not the paramilitary group  Alpha-66 should be investigated regarding several threatening  letters circulating in Miami. In the notes, Alpha-66 warns that  they will regard as military targets anyone, anywhere in the  world who visits Cuba, negotiates with the Cuban Government, or  expresses support for this country. [passage omitted]    Orestes Joubert, Cubanacan deputy manager in Granma  Province,  reports that Alpha-66 has threatened Canadian tourists who made  reservations at the new Farallon del Caribe Hotel last year.    [Begin Joubert recording] As we all know, this hotel was  inaugurated in November after considerable hype. The number of  reservations made in Canada in October was large. A large number  of tourists were expected after November. Nevertheless, we found  that this number had been greatly reduced because requests for  visas for 40 percent of those who had made reservations had been  turned down. We wondered about the situation. Through some  Canadian papers we learned that a counterrevolutionary  organization called Alpha-66 had unleashed a campaign against  Cuba through newspapers and radio and television stations. Much  to our satisfaction, however, this situation lasted only a few  days. Since late December, 90 percent of the hotel rooms have  remained occupied. [end recording]    This is new evidence showing that Alpha-66 attempts to  prevent everyone from coming to Cuba with the specific purpose,  in this particular instance, of blocking one of the country's  leading development sectors. They did not prevail, but this  attempt can be added to the long list of actions against Cuba  when an inquiry is opened.</p>

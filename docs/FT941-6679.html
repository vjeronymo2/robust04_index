			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Customs to fight EU duty challenge Customs and Excise said yesterday that it would fight any attempt by the European Commission to overturn UK excise rules and allow British consumers to order cheap alcoholic drinks and tobacco from across the Channel by phone. Since the advent of the single European market last year, UK shoppers have been able to bring back as much alcohol and tobacco as they want from EU countries for personal use - within certain generous guidelines - without paying UK excise duty. But anyone buying and transporting goods on behalf of someone else still has to pay excise. The European Commission plans to challenge that rule, saying that, provided duty is paid in the country of purchase, imports do not have to be transported by the buyer in person to avoid excise. That would allow UK customers to place orders for alcohol or cigarettes with commercial couriers or mail order operators, which would transport goods on their behalf. 'The commission's opinion is that if you pay for the transport of the goods it's as if you were transporting them,' the commission said yesterday. It is expected to make a proposal in May or June clarifying its directive 92/12. The UK argues that the directive means shoppers must physically transport the wine themselves. 'We will continue to apply our interpretation and fight it in the courts,' Customs and Excise said yesterday. If necessary, it added, it would go to the European Court. Any further relaxation of restrictions on alcohol imports from continental Europe could devastate the UK brewing industry. The Brewers and Licensed Retailers' Association said personal imports of beer reached 1.8m hectolitres last year - equivalent to 15 per cent of all beer drunk at home. When wine and spirits imports are added, drinks retailers in the UK are estimated to have lost business worth Pounds 700m, while the government has lost Pounds 300m in excise and value added tax.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (10): Size is the critical factor: Avionics - A look at the move by companies to restructure operations The twin forces of recession and cuts in defence spending have forced consolidation and restructuring on the world's avionics and component suppliers. The end of the cold war led western governments to reduce military spending. In civil aviation, the prolonged recession, and the Gulf War not only decimated the tourist industry sharply reducing passenger numbers, but coincided with a glut in airliners coming off the production lines. Although airline traffic has started growing again, several hundred aircraft remain parked in the desert. It was thus only a matter of time before manufacturers of components and avionics, the next tier down in the supply chain, would be forced to share the burden. Customers have not only been pushing for cost reductions among the suppliers but have been demanding more sophisticated products and reducing the number of suppliers with which they have to deal. The sector's response has been consolidation and restructuring which some say is similar to one seen in the automotive industry a decade ago. Much of it has taken the form of mergers and acquisitions though strategic alliances have not been far behind, bringing together once bitter competitors, with cost and risk sharing being a prime mover in the drive for market leadership. Examples of companies moving in that direction include Smiths Industries of the UK which formed an alliance with its competitor Rockwell International Corporation of the US three years ago, to provide full flight integration system. Some saw this as an attempt by the new group to compete with Honeywell, the US electronic control systems group which is the market leader in that field. Honeywell has in turn formed an alliance with two UK companies; one with Racal on satellite communications systems and another with the GEC on the fly-by-wire systems. But not all proposed alliances have been carried through and this year the biggest disappointment has been the failure of the proposed merger between France's Sextant-Avionique and Allied Signal of the US. The deal would have made the combined group number three in its field. But where a merger or alliance has been successfully carried out, manufacturing improvement initiatives have been introduced and new technologies developed. The restructuring in the sector began in the United States, the world's biggest aerospace market, and the first to face the chill winds of recession and the first wave of defence cuts. Deals by prime contractors such as Martin Marietta's acquisition of General Electric's aerospace division in 1992 and General Dynamic's sale of its missiles subsidiary to GM Hughes in the same year were cited as the trigger for a similar shake-up or 're-engineering' among the suppliers. The search for market leadership has usually been the driving force behind the consolidation attempts. Companies with product lines in third or even fourth place in their chosen market place have been forced to either quit the field or seek an alliance in an attempt to strengthen their market position. Mr Paul Saleh, vice-president and treasurer at Honeywell, which is a supplier to both the military and civil aerospace markets, said: 'What we have seen over the last few years is a need for each supplier to be a leader in its specialised field. You have to be a leader in technology with a reputation for delivery and have the trust of the customer.' He acknowledges that size has become the critical factor, and says it is not only useful in terms of economies of scale but also suggests it is the bigger companies that can afford the ever increasing development costs. 'This is a global market that is becoming more competitive and there is little room for marginal participants,' he said. Mr Saleh highlighted a new move in the restructuring process, that of 'out-sourcing' of a complete part of the production process, to the supplier. This he believes will become increasingly prevalent among suppliers to the civil sector in which change has been slower than on the military side, due in part to the small number of big manufacturers, McDonald Douglas, Airbus, and Boeing. Earlier this year, Boeing provided the biggest example of 'out-sourcing' to a supplier with its decision to hand over the complete manufacturing and integrating of the flight deck system on its new 777 airliner to Honeywell. The move was not only seen as an attempt to meet customer induced cost cuts but was hailed as a first in 'working together with the customer' by suppliers. It is also seen as a possible indicator of the next level of restructuring as Honeywell attempts to push costs of its suppliers lower. European companies have been no less ready to meet the challenge of the new harsh environment and analysts have pointed to possible cost benefits of between 10 and 20 per cent from restructuring the industry. Lucas Industries, the automotive components and aerospace group, is cited as an example of a company that is attempting to become a world leader among European suppliers. Mr Frank Turner, managing director of Lucas Aerospace, said: 'We took a look at what was happening in the industry and at ourselves and decided we had to do something if we were to remain in the game.' The company has gone all out to transform itself from a component supplier to the aerospace industry into a systems integrator. As part of that plan it paid Pounds 18.9m a year ago to acquire TI Group subsidiary Dowty's fuel control business and in June signed a joint venture agreement to establish a repair and overhaul facility for engine and flight control systems in China. But it is 1993's merger between Dowty and Snecma's Messier Bugatti of France to form a world leader in landing gear that many have pointed to as the clearest example of the restructuring that is taking place among component suppliers in Europe. Mr Tony Edwards, chief executive of Dowty Aerospace, said: 'We wanted to be a world player in landing gear so we align ourselves to achieve that goal. We sold those businesses where we could not be a global player.' However, analysts say similar deals will be more difficult to achieve. They point to nationalism - the wish to retain a particular industry in a country  -and sensitivity to national defence interests as two factors that may act as a brake on restructuring. Thus alliances, rather than straightforward mergers, may be the route for European companies wanting to compete with the giants of the US. But Mr Paul Compton, aerospace and defence analyst at Credit Lyonnais, believes joint ventures are of less benefit than full mergers as national interests tend to intervene especially on decisions such as a reduction in staff numbers. Thus, he said, the very nature of a joint venture was likely to create inefficiency. He concluded: 'The US sector is almost twice the size of that of Europe and what is more it is homogenous and thus does not suffer from nationalistic barriers. Europe will have to decide whether its nationalistic differences can be forgotten in a bid to form global companies or it will be left behind in a key world industry.'</p>

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Baker to face election inquiry MR William Barr, the US attorney general, has been obliged to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate whether senior White House aides broke the law in the examination of the passport files of President-elect Bill Clinton before last month's election. US newspapers yesterday reported that Mr James Baker, the former secretary of state who moved in August to become White House chief of staff, was among those to be questioned, along with two of his long-standing assistants, Mrs Margaret Tutwiler and Ms Janet Mullins. All three, according to the New York Times, have hired lawyers to represent them in the course of the investigation. Mr Barr is a vigorous opponent of the independent counsel statute, which was enacted in 1978 for a five-year period and twice renewed but which expired last Tuesday. But evidence presented to Mr Barr by his own Justice Department was reported to have found possible wrongdoing in the White House, forcing his hand under of those provisions of the act covering senior appointed officials. He approached three federal appeals court judges, who met on Monday, and appointed Mr Joseph diGenova, a former federal attorney, to the job. The Clinton passport affair came to light a month before the presidential election, when it became known that Mrs Elizabeth Tamposi, a political appointee at the State Department in charge of consular affairs, had authorised searches of Mr Clinton's files in Washington and at the US embassies in London and Oslo, for any evidence that he had considered renouncing his US citizenship during the Vietnam war. No such evidence was unearthed, but testimony to a subsequent state department investigation suggested White House interest in the search.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / International Company News: Banco di Sicilia chairman quits MR Guido Savignone, chair-man of the Banco di Sicilia, the leading financial institution on the island, has resigned following sharp criticism of the management by the Italian treasury. The treasury's attack on the failure of the bank's management to improve results after a shake-up two years ago represents a significant toughening in the authorities' attitudes towards the operations of those financial institutions in which the state has stakes. The treasury has a 14 per cent share in Banco di Sicilia, the remainder being held by a foundation controlled by the island's regional government. The bank is understood to have just balanced its books in 1992 but in 1993 the institution risks running a loss. Some L3,000bn (Dollars 2bn) of bad loans are reported. The bank is undergoing an inspection by the Bank of Italy. Until this is completed, its demands to increase its capital are unlikely to be met.</p>

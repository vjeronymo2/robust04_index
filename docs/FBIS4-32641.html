			<p>BFN     [Text] The censure motion [against the Vacaroiu  government] presented today during the joint session of  Romania's Parliament by the opposition condemns the economic and  financial policy promoted by the executive, which leads to the  perpetuation and deepening of the crisis. Similarly, the  censure motion points out that the policy of the Nicolae  Vacaroiu government runs counter to national interests by  deliberately ignoring the developing of certain strategic  sectors, which has disastrous consequences for the future of the  country. The government is also accused of not observing its  own government program.    As a consequence of all this, the signatories of the censure  motion appeal to all senators and Chamber of Deputies members to  join them and express by vote their lack of confidence in the  current government. The censure motion was signed by 141  senators and Chamber of Deputies members.    Immediately following the presentation of the text of the  censure motion and of the list of the parliamentarians who  signed it, the parliamentary faction of the Liberal Party 1993  [PL-93] suggested that the Thursday [30 June] debates on the  censure motion should be carried live by national television.  They suggested this because the permanent bureaus of the two  chambers of Parliament had expressed an contrary opinion.    Submitted to vote, the PL-93 parliamentary faction's  proposal  that the Thursday debates of parliament should be carried by  television was rejected by 138 votes against, 160 in favor, and  41 abstentions, as the proposal was not supported by a majority  of the 407 parliamentarians who attended today's session, our  correspondent reports.</p>

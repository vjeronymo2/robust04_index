			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Chile resumes its grand sell-off: David Pilling in Santiago details the new state assets coming under the hammer The minister was adamant. 'What business does the state have running an airline? The devil can buy it, for all I care.' The Chilean government is a little more discreet in public, but the minister's remark is an eloquent reminder that Chilean state assets are again going under the hammer. The privatisation process, all but stalled under the four-year democratic transition, has been revived by the new administration of President Eduardo Frei, which has promised to 'open up opportunities for the private sector' by selling off state companies on a 'case-by-case basis'. Mr Frei says he does not share the 'simplistic notion. . . that the modernisation of the state entails the stripping of all its power and authority'. But private participation is to be encouraged in areas needing 'high levels of investment', or where, 'given a competitive market, the private sector can operate more efficiently'. Given new spending priorities - specifically a commitment gradually to raise investment in education to 7 per cent of gross domestic product from 5 per cent now - the government is keen to unload some of its spending burden on to the private sector. The process has already begun, albeit modestly, with the sale of 23.8 per cent of Lan Chile airline for Dollars 10.8m (Pounds 6.9m). Over the coming months, stakes in electricity, shipping and railway companies will be auctioned off, swelling treasury coffers by some Dollars 200m. 'Today there is a different atmosphere surrounding the subject,' says Mr Felipe Sandoval, head of Corporacion de Fomento (Corfo), the state holding group. Attitudes about the role of the state, which once separated opponents of the military regime from supporters, have begun to merge and the topic has lost much ideological heat. First on the privatisation list is Edelnor, the northern power utility. The government will sell off its 48.5 per cent stake in stages, with 12-32 per cent due to be divested this year. Mr Sandoval says each 12 per cent tranche should be worth about Dollars 30m. The government also intends to raise Dollars 50m of private sector funding for Colbun, the state power utility, in need of investment capital. The full privatisation of Colbun, valued at Dollars 400m, will be considered when the government is satisfied that adequate anti-monopoly regulations are in place, Mr Sandoval says. Empremar and its container unit Transcontainer, which handle about 5 per cent of overseas transport, are also to be sold, pending change of a law restricting private ownership to 35 per cent. A previous attempt to sell the loss-making company, estimated to be worth Dollars 20m, failed because of lack of interest in taking on a minority stake. Various Chilean groups, including forestry companies seeking cheaper access to ports, will in October bid for 51 per cent of Ferrocarriles del Pacfico, the railway cargo division. The winning company, which could pay up to Dollars 100m, will inherit 90 locomotives and 5,000 wagons. It will rent use of track from state railway company EFE. Elsewhere the government is studying partial privatisation of the water and sewerage systems, still inadequate in many districts, and expects to publish recommendations in October. The government has already begun, with only limited success so far, to entice private funds into big road-building programmes through a system of concessions and tolls. Mr Eduardo Aninat, the finance minister, has pledged to extend private sector participation to ports and airports. Separately, Corfo intends to sell Dollars 550m of its non-performing debt portfolio - 'a reflection of bad loans made in the past' - for which Mr Sandoval expects to raise Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m. Some state companies such as Enap, the oil group, and Enami, the smelting agency, are off limits - for the moment at least. More controversial still is Codelco, the world's largest copper company, and still considered the heart and soul of the Chilean economy. But even here, the government is pushing through reforms which have been labelled by opponents as privatisation by stealth. Codelco recently announced plans to sell a majority stake of its power plant, Tocopilla, valued at Dollars 500m-Dollars 600m. The group argues that the constitution, which enshrines the nationalisation of Codelco, only covers core mining activities. Committed both to tight fiscal policy (even more than its prudent predecessor) and to improving education and alleviating poverty, the new administration is refocusing its spending priorities. Part of that strategy involves a diminishing role in projects that smack of big spending - such as roads, power and sanitation - given that the private sector appears willing to bridge much of the investment gap. This, so the theory goes, will allow the state to divert funds to schools, hospitals and deprived regions, where private money is less forthcoming.</p>

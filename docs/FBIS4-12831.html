			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F> Group]    [Text] The martyr-seeking attack by Palestinian mujahidin  on a bus carrying Zionists in the Hadera area of Tel Aviv, the  capital of the usurping Zionist regime, shows again the firm  determination of the Palestinian uprising to continue the  struggle until the occupied territories are liberated. The  attack, which left over 30 dead and wounded Zionists, is the  second martyr-seeking operation within a week and comes within  the framework of a promise of five attacks by the Islamic  Resistance Movement, Hamas, to avenge the blood shed unjustly by  the worshippers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in al-Khalil.    Political analysts believe that two major processes have  been  reigning over the Palestinian crisis. The first is the process  of compromise between the politically bankrupt organizations  abroad and the Zionist regime, a process that entered a new  phase six months ago with the signing of the Gaza-Jericho  self-rule compromise. This compromise is part of a greater plan  based on bilateral and collective talks between Arab governments  and the Zionist regime, which started two years ago in Madrid  and are continuing in Washington.    The second process that reigns over the Palestinian crisis  is  the Intifadah, which is based on expanding the collective  struggle of the Palestinian Muslims inside the occupied  territories. In this all-aspected jihad, the Muslim  Palestinians resort to various methods of struggle and retaliate  against the suppressive and terrorist methods used by the  aggressive and usurping Zionist regime.    The same political analysts add that the process of  compromise that rules the Palestinian and Middle East crisis has  faced extensive problems because it is imposed and illogical.  The Madrid-Washington talks, which, according to their  engineers, should have yielded results within two years, have  achieved no perceptible result even though four months have  passed since the deadline and they are at an impasse. 'Arafat's  compromise with the Zionist regime is facing a similar fate and  the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho self-rule plan, which was  to start with the withdrawal of the aggressive Zionist forces  from these areas, has thrice been postponed.    Because of its roots in the Palestinian territory and  nation,  the intifadah has intensified such that the Zionist leaders no  longer hide their concern. The success scored by the Muslim  Palestinian combatants in planning and carrying out jihad  operations shows that contrary to what the Palestinian and Arab  compromisers think, the equation that rules the Middle East  crisis is not unilateral and that if a nation insists on its  rights, the enemy must inevitably surrender.</p>

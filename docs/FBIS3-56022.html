Karasin expressed his regret about several interruptions in  the Israeli-PLO talks on specific measures to implement their  declaration on principles, signed in September of 1993.    "In our contacts with both Israeli and Palestinian  representatives we always point out to them the necessity of  concentrating maximum constructive effort and good will on  overcoming differences and following the spirit and the letter  of the September agreements", the Russian representative stated.</p>

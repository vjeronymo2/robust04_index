Four months  have passed since you took over the administration of the  oblast. Have you been able to make plans for the tasks you plan  to accomplish? What have investigations of the present status of  the oblast economy shown.    [Aqymbekov] It is true that time moves on. A great deal of  time passes before you know it. Present difficulties are  well-known to the people. We cannot say that the economic crisis  in our country has left our oblast untouched. Conditions are in  truth nothing to feel at ease about. During the last seven  months, production of industrial products declined by 4.8  percent compared to the same period in 1992. Conditions in  agriculture are likewise poor.    [Mukhametshe] The primary wealth of the oblast lies in  cattle  and crops. These two sectors are also in difficulty. Increases  in livestock and production are below 1990 levels. What is the  reason?    [Aqymbekov] This is a good question. The smaller increases  in  livestock and in production are alarming us. In particular,  during the last year 15,800 fewer large cattle, 86,300 fewer  sheep and goats, 3,200 fewer horses, and 30,300 fewer pigs were  produced. These are not good signs. When we talk about  agriculture, we must not forget that, above all, this is the  sector which provides food to the people. If the economic crisis  continues, it is doubtful that we will be able to get out of our  circle of difficulties. Today complacency and irresponsibility  have become endemic. There is no profit where there is no order.  This being the case, what should we do? We must put our efforts  into unwavering fulfillment of the edicts of the president of  the Republic of Kazakhstan. We must do this if we are going to  put a forceful halt to the deficiencies and the inadequacies  which have arisen in our society. We, for our part, are not  sitting on our hands: we have taken in hand some specific  measures for the development of animal husbandry. We are in the  process of carrying out important measures in the delivery and  the storage of agricultural products. It will not be possible to  put things to rights in a single day. We are thinking in terms  of gradually restoring balance. However, it is important that  the economic independence of agriculture and industry be  protected. We will need the active assistance, above all, of  organizations protecting rights in dealing with questions of  order.    [Mukhametshe] It would seem as if you have formed your own  shadow government in the area of agricultural management: rural  areas are now managed simultaneously by the Agricultural  Inspectorate and by the Awyl Industrial Corporation. Just how  efficient is this?    [Aqymbekov] At one time everything was in the hands of a  totalitarian system. At that time the administrative organs were  the support of a command system. Now times have changed.  Property has gradually moved from state supervision into the  hands of labor organizations and of individuals. Giving orders  to them as was once done by administrative organs is contrary to  law and is not much needed. We must change and reform  administrative organs in accordance with the needs of the times.  Based upon just this principle, we divided the former  agricultural administration into two parts at the beginning of  the year. We went over to an oblast agricultural administration  and an oblast inspectorate for the agro-industrial complex. A  second structure, the Agro-Industry Commercial Corporation,  provides services to enterprises and is involved with organizing  their work. Such changes in organizational efforts will  certainly be producing results soon. In any case, a great deal  depends upon the carrying out of economic reforms.    [Mukhametshe] We think that the primary way of getting out  of  the economic dead end which is exhausting us is the market  economy. However, we are encountering managers who are taking  advantage of the difficulties for their own benefit. When others  are lacking for housing, such people have colluded, purchased  houses, and rushed out to buy foreign cars. In particular, they  seem to have taken advantage of the first stage of privatization  for all kinds of tricks among the people...    [Aqymbekov] The requirements of law were not completely  observed during the first stage of privatization. It is now  becoming clear what kinds of deficiencies there were. Due to a  shortage of financing and a lack of building materials,  construction of residential housing by the government was halted  entirely. Residential housing was privatized. However, some  persons in managerial positions got control of many goods at  that time. If there were managers concerned about the people,  they were in difficulty and unable to look after themselves. It  is not proper to be extremely smug and to say that this is what  was involved in privatization. There is always a need for a  sense of civil honor, humanitarianism, and humane intentions. Do  not our people say: people live with people.    [Mukhametshe:] In order to raise the level of the oblast  economy we have no choice but to carry out exchanges and trade.  In this connection, what can you say about external economic  connections? Are there goods which you can export?    [Aqymbekov] We must systematize our external economic  connections. With this goal in mind a special coordinating  committee has been formed in our oblast. There are now  functioning in the oblast 26 consolidated industries. We are in  the process of establishing profitable and effective  relationships between our oblast and countries such as China,  Turkey, Korea, and Italy. There are some enterprises which have  emerged as a consequence. Specific plans are being drawn up  regarding various projects, including the construction of a  paper combine in Taldyqorghan City. One thousand hectares of  sugar beets were planted this year using advanced French  technology, 600 hectares were planted using German technology.  Likewise, we plan to grow grain on 15,000 hectares using  Hungarian methods. Great assistance is being rendered on the  part of the government of the Republic with regard to the  introduction of advanced technology designed to increase  agricultural productivity.    Our oblast in economic terms has an agrarian character. For  that reason, we import much more than we export. There are  outstanding export products. Among the various kinds of  products, demand for storage batteries and sugar beets is the  greatest. We can meet, at certain levels, demand for onions,  meat, and milk products. We are seeking new channels of  communication in our efforts to deliver needed goods and  implements to the people of the Zhetisu, utilizing all our  existing resources.    [Mukhametshe] It is proper that foreign investors have been  brought in. However, Taldyqorghan is a border oblast. It is  possible that among those flowing into the oblast from outside  are certain other persons along with those with friendly ideas.  In particular, the people have been extremely alarmed by the  news that many from our great neighbors to the east are settling  in the oblast.    [Aqymbekov] We must rely on foreign investors for the  development of the oblast economy. The geographic position of  the Zhetisu is very convenient for external relations. We must  utilize this productively. I understand that there are things  alarming the people. However, should we fail to take advantage  of favorable circumstances? There are the appropriate  authorities: they will look into the circumstances of the  question. There are rumors that persons from a neighboring  country have been entering illegally. This is not true. To be  sure, there are people entering the country. Most of them are  involved in commerce. In short, we are looking into this  question carefully. It is proper to avoid raising the alarm  among the people or stirring things up with idle words and  lending credence to every rumor we hear.    [Mukhametshe] There is another question which I am dying to  ask. In recent years our relatives and kinsmen in foreign  countries have migrated. Among them are masters of various  specialties. However, we have been unable to place those  newcomers in their chosen specialties. Why have they been sent  out to herd sheep? Is there no other possible occupation for a  Kazakh than herding sheep?...    [Aqymbekov] It is to be sure a joy that our kinsmen in  distant places are returning to the homeland. What Kazakh is  there who is not rejoicing about this when they encounter one  another? Is there not the proverb: if one extra sheep is born, a  little bit more wormwood will grow?... Since 1991 more than 850  families have moved to our oblast from Mongolia and the CIS  countries. Just recently 126 families from Iran have settled in  the Zhetisu. We are doing everything we can to help them. We are  providing them aid in the form of housing, livestock, material  goods, and money. We are providing a work placement for our  migrant kinsmen. We try to place them in area of their  specialty. Placing those with the specialties of teacher or  doctor is not very difficult. However, it is not easy to place  our relatives with specialties in the agricultural sector.  Second, everywhere workers are being laid off in connection  withthe transition to a market economy. For that reason we have  taken in hand the retraining and preparation of our migrant  kinsmen in needed specialties. Just now 76 persons are acquiring  new specialties in the oblast. As for sending them off to herd  sheep: herding sheep is our traditional occupation. Have we not  for generations, when asking how are you, first about the cattle  and then about the person. It is not proper to denigrate this  occupation or to detract from it. You understand that your  question is out-of-date. In those days did we not scare a child  who was poor at his school work with the occupation of  herdsmen?.. In my view there are no good and bad jobs.    [Mukhametshe] In any case, when the president named you  governor, he gave you all [necessary] powers. The new governor  has the right to form a new administration. You are working with  the old apparatus. Are you satisfied with their work? What  changes have you made in cadre matters?    [Aqymbekov] I was born in the oblast. I knew from before not  only the circumstances in the Zhetisu region and the state of  the economy, but most of the cadres in the administration. The  spirit of the times and the changes taking place require  competence from managers and specialists, new thinking and a  carefully considered citizenship. For that reason, in choosing  and in placing persons to govern the nation, my first priority  was whether or not they embodied such characteristics. During  part of last year I held an official post in Almaty. It is now a  time of rapid social change. During these times the lives of  most of us and out views of life have changed. During the time  that I have been governor of the oblast, I have looked with very  critical eyes on some serving with me. I wanted to determine  what kinds of changes had taken place in themselves, in their  views, and in their work styles. I noticed that many cadres were  unable to work at levels demanded by life. In any case, it seems  as if some citizens have not put down their foundations distant  from what is old. For that reason it is clear that changes are  being made in the composition of cadres. Relying on those able  to meet the demands of the times, I am making an effort to  fulfill the great tasks which stand before me. I am putting new  thinking young people into the positions of cadres who learned  their lessons from yesterday.    [Mukhametshe] You are a regular reader and regular author of  YEGEMEN QAZAQSTAN. You have given many interviews. You have  written articles on specific problems. We thank you for your  activism. As you know, there is the rubric in the paper: Be a  Governor Close to the People. Do you like these words?    [Aqymbekov] If I can go a little more deeply into your  thought: a governor is only a person who holds a leading public  office. But how far from the people is that official personage?  Only after becoming part of the people was he named governor.  Thus, I think it natural that a governor should remain close to  the people. From that point of view, I think that I am never far  from the people. However, everything else depends upon the  person in power. For example, are we not products of the trials  of life along with such characteristics as thought, knowledge,  ideas, humanitarianism, and control. I think that your papers  rubric aimed at a new time, at a new point of view.    [Mukhametshe] Governor Aqymbekov, what should the  Kazakhstans  state ideology be like? Recently we have become embroiled in  history and are taking all periods into consideration. Whatever  the circumstances, Kazakhs are divided into clans and are  endeavoring to praise their ancestors. What do you say to this?    [Aqymbekov] It is a social law that there should be a  national state ideology for a sovereign country. However, what  should this ideology be like? If we begin the discussion of the  question from this point of view, and, if we look primarily at  the past, we will commit a great error. This is the same as not  tying up the lattice work of a felt yurt and letting an old tent  rot. For that reason our national ideology must develop from our  Constitution, from the supreme law of the land. If we are unable  to establish a new national-state worldview, if our thoughts are  full of a hodgepodge of ideas, it is possible that we will  encounter a spiritual crisis. If we do not think now about  future generations, then our struggle for independence, and all  our good intentions, will be in vain. The riches of Kazakhstan  are not just for present generations. They must become the  property of future generations too. A Republic of Kazakhstan  ideology will open the way for universal Kazakhstan feelings of  pride. To this end, it is right to support properly all of those  with good intentions in the formation of ideas.    We must know our history. Our wise people have said: if a  horse is driven away, it is the enemy; if it pounds, it is the  wind. For that reason, we must reject division into clans and  put effort into making our independence constant. There were not  a few occasions in the past when we were divided from one  another. Let us somehow become a powerful nation with strong  unity. For that reason it is proper that we devote our entire  lives to this goal.    [Mukhametshe] Thank you!</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Alexander &amp; Alexander trade halted Shares in Alexander &amp; Alexander, the US-based insurance broker, were suspended from trading in New York yesterday pending what it promised early in the day would be a 'significant corporate announcement', writes Richard Waters in New York. By late afternoon, though, the company's board, which had been convened for a special meeting, remained locked in debate and had failed to make any public statement. The company's recent financial difficulties, and the nature of its announcement in the morning, prompted widespread speculation that it had become the subject of a takeover approach. Its shares have slid from Dollars 22 1/4 on February 3, the day before Federal Reserve action to raise US interest rates hit all financial sector stocks, to Dollars 14 in mid-May, before recovering slightly to Dollars 16 3/8 by the end of last week. The world's second largest insurance broker behind Marsh &amp; McLennan, Alexander &amp; Alexander's earnings have consistently failed to match stock market expectations in recent periods. The company has also suffered big losses in liability insurance. In January, the company's board acted to replace long-time chairman and chief executive Mr Tinsely Irvin.</p>

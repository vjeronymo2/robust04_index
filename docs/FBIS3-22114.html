Last March when the Ministry of Trade and Industry was  preparing material in advance of a government decision on the  Temelin plant in southern Bohemia, the ministry clearly had  information that a study on the economic feasibility of the  plant had been commissioned from the Belgian company Tractabel  Kuzvart said.    Part of the report studied the possibilities of energy  saving  and concluded that energy saving procedures would cost the  country less than the production of electricity by any method.  By 2010, the report stated, 3,500 megawatts could technically  be saved, it would be economically advantageous to save 3,000  megawatts but the feasible saving by that year is only 1,200  megawatts.    The study shows that the amount of energy saving possible is  six times higher than Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir  Dlouhy announced, Kuzvart said.    Other government offices and constitutional officials had no  information about this section of the study before the decision  was taken to complete Temelin, as is shown by Environment  Minister Frantisek Benda's proposal that a study be done  including energy sources and needs and assessing the realistic  energy saving potential, Kuzvart said.    The government could only have made the announcement that,  with coal power plants cutting production, a new source  producing around 2,00 megawatts had to be found, if the  Tractabel study had not been taken into account, he said.    In the interests of averting looming environmental damage  construction at Temelin should not have been resumed before new  discussions, Kuzvart said.</p>

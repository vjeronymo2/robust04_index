			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sean Feely] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 22 SAPA -- African National  Congress President Nelson Mandela interrupted trading activities  on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange [JSE] on Friday [22 April],  assuring members of the bourse there would be economic stability  under a new government. "It is our concern to restore economic  stability in the country," he said in a 15 minute speech. "We  have called on our people to end mass action."    Mr Mandela said the ANC's Reconstruction and Development  Programme [RDP] would seek to meet the needs of the people, who  were forced in the past to resort to mass action to ensure their  demands were attended to. He said the RDP was a massive  programme but would go a long way towards securing stability.  Business had a vital role to play in this programme and  building the country's future strength economically. The  government would create a legislative environment based on free  enterprise so commerce could thrive. "The JSE has an important  role to play in the reconstruction and development of our  country. We say the economy of the country must be built on  sound market principles. If you look at our programme there's  not a single sentence about nationalisation," he told the 300  brokers on the JSE floor.    Mr Mandela's speech was greeted by muted applause from the  traders, despite his assurance the market was vital to raising  new and substantial capital. However, on his way to the  executive offices of the JSE to meet with JSE President Roy  Andersen, the ANC leader was cheered by brokerage messengers and  other staff.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Orlando Sierra] </F>   [Text] Colonel Alvaro Antonio Romero Salgado, chief of  Presidential Staff, yesterday testified before Lower Court Judge  Jesus Martinez Suazo that the much-publicized plot to  assassinate President Carlos Roberto Reina never existed. This  information was learned in the capital's courts.    Given this, the judge will have to release Luis Rodolfo  Hernandez Sosa due to lack of evidence.    Hernandez Sosa, 33 years old and a native of Danli, El  Paraiso, turned himself in on Thursday [14 April] after  realizing he was the Police's and Army's most wanted man because  he was presumably the man who masterminded the plot.    "I will reveal absolutely nothing because that would be a  violation of the law," Martinez Suazo said as he left Romero  Salgado's office in the Presidential House.    He said the decision on whether Hernandez Sosa would be  imprisoned or released would be made today. He added that he  would only take into consideration what is on the record.    "I would never take part in any foul play," he said. He was  accompanied during his statement by Special Judge Roy Medina and  Prosecutors Eidelman Mejia and Omar Borjas.    He explained that conspiracy in Honduras is punishable by  two  to four years in prison. However, he stressed he has yet to  identify the crime that the alleged plot leader may have  perpetrated. "The investigation will determine whether a crime  was committed," he added, noting that there are legal limits on  the time allowed for such an investigation.    He noted that reports published by different media prompted  the court to order the necessary investigation.    Regarding Hernandez Sosa's situation, the judge added: "We  will either issue an arrest warrant or release him, based on the  evidence uncovered during the process."    Martinez Suazo did not rule out the possibility of  questioning President Reina and Armed Forces Chief General Luis  Alonso Discua Elvir.    As Martinez Suazo heard Romero Salgado's declaration,  Hernandez Sosa underwent a blood test in the Legal Medical  Department.    He claimed that he had requested the test. "This is all a  farce. If the Nicaraguans have already testified, there is no  need for me to do so," said the visibly angry prisoner.    He said he is confident he will win his freedom, and,  although he promised to "reveal all" to the media, he did not --  claiming the media had denigrated him.    "It was you, rather than the authorities, who reported  something you should not have. The people I thought were with  me were really against me," he said.    Because of this, he said he does not want to say anything  else about his problem. "You have hurt me very much, and  newspaper reporters have treated me the worst. People behave  like Judases, and you intimidate me simply to make a good  impression on your bosses," he said defiantly.    He said he was surprised that newspapermen had published so  many things against him because he did not deserve those  commentaries.    Referring to the president, he said that Reina can do  nothing  against him because he has told the whole truth. "I am involved  in nothing, and I chose to turn myself in because I feel free,"  he stressed.    He said that as a man he does not lend himself to anything.  Therefore, he has nothing to hide. "I am not into drugs and  that is why I requested this test," he said.    He said Abdala Gianini, owner of El Millon department store,  is a Judas. "I knew him as all employees know their own boss,"  he said, when stating it never crossed his mind to burn down a  paint factory.    [Panama City ACAN in Spanish at 2330 GMT on 12 April  reports:  "Luis Hernandez Sosa, implicated last week in a plot to  assassinate Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina, was  released Tuesday [12 April] due to lack of evidence. The lower  court in Tegucigalpa issued a temporary release order for  Hernandez Sosa, who had turned himself in on Friday claiming he  was `innocent' of the crime with which he was being charged."]</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE IN OUR ENTREPRENEURS  </P> <P> The entrepreneur, the much ballyhooed hero of U.S. business in the 1980s, is in  for tough times in the years ahead and, in fact, hasn't had it too good lately.  </P> <P> The flow of seed money that wealthy families and corporate pension and  development funds invest in new companies declined last year to $2.6 billion,  according to Venture Economics, a Wellesley Hills, Mass., research firm. That  was down from a $3-billion-plus average for 1983 to 1988 and well down from the  $4.2 billion of 1987 -- the year the stock market crashed.  </P> <P> The crash clobbered small company chances. Only 203 new companies sold stock to  the public in 1989, according to the trade magazine IPO Reporter, down from  almost 700 companies in 1986. And the decline in enterprise extends to private  companies. Openings of new businesses are probably down 20% from the mid-'80s,  according to an informal estimate by Dun &amp; Bradstreet.  </P> <P> The outlook is not optimistic, say venture capital firms nationwide. "It's  tough to raise money," says Eric Schiffer, a partner in Los Angeles' Oxford  Partners, which helped launch computer retailer Businessland in the early '80s.  </P> <P> So what? So plenty. Entrepreneurial companies are what this system thrives on.  In small business of every variety, some 250,000 new companies spring up each  year -- with perhaps one company in 25 surviving. Yet out of that teeming  activity come most of the new jobs in the U.S. economy.  </P> <P> And venture capital-backed entrepreneurs hold special honor for creating not  simply companies but whole new industries, from electronics in the 1970s to  biotechnology in the 1980s.  </P> <P> That there's less money around for such heroes today is ominous for the  economy, casting a shadow on expectations of strong new growth in the 1990s and  reflecting a worrisome lack of confidence in the present.  </P> <P> It's not really that risks have changed in venture capital; it has always been  a reach for the brass ring. An entrepreneur raises an initial stake from family  and friends -- or a second mortgage on the house. And venture capital funds  help at the next stage with money and expertise to develop the young company's  product or service. If successful, the fledgling may be acquired by a larger  firm or it may sell stock to the public. Either way, the initial backers win  big: Venture capital funds such as Boston's 22-year-old TA Associates have  earned 25% to 30% a year compounded. That is, one or two winners out of the 10  or 12 companies that they back each year more than offset the losers.  </P> <P> A big winner is the kind of payoff that Pathfinder Venture Capital Funds of  Minneapolis had when it backed Advanced Cardiovascular Services (ACS) with  $700,000 in 1981. ACS developed balloon angioplasty, a life-saving method of  keeping veins and arteries open in heart attack victims. The company was  immediately successful and was acquired by pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly in  1984, with ACS' venture capital backers getting a $10-million return on their  $700,000 investment and three times that much if they held on to the Eli Lilly  shares that they received in the buyout.  </P> <P> So why, with gains like that, isn't everybody rushing to back new companies?  Lack of confidence dating to the crash of 1987.  </P> <P> The crash scared investors more than has been generally acknowledged in the  past two years as the big institutions have put money back into stocks and the  market has recovered. But in that recovery, investment has favored the big  companies, even though big firms declined as much as small ones two years ago.  Why is that? Because big companies, as well as having size to weather economic  storms, also tend to have large numbers of shares outstanding -- meaning that  investors can sell quickly if necessary. So the tendency has been to invest  with an eye on the exit door, not to invest with confidence.  </P> <P> Similarly, though money has been scarce for venture capital funds, it has been  available until recently for spurious investments -- like the leveraged buyout  takeover funds of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Such schemes promised venture  capital-type returns without the effort needed to develop new products or  create new industries. Instead, they steered money to seemingly risk-free, if  wasteful, activities like splitting whole companies into parts and selling them  -- as butchers do with pigs and chickens.  </P> <P> Now LBOs and junk bonds are failing -- and good riddance. But their collapse  may only cause investors to further avoid venture capital and small business  investments.  </P> <P> So what can be done to revive support for the entrepreneur? "Pass capital gains  tax reduction," says Howard Cox, partner in Greylock Management, a Boston-based  venture capital firm. And to be sure, a cut in the capital gains tax has  spurred new business before.  </P> <P> But a tax measure won't be enough to do it. What U.S. business, and government  and society, too, must do is recover confidence -- easier said than done -- and  a sense of priorities. A recognition that an investment in angioplasty is  inherently more valuable than one to break up a tobacco company might be a good  start. A recollection that it was real scientific knowledge and commitment --  not card-shark investment banking -- that gave us advances in electronics and  biotechnology would be helpful, too.  </P> <P> But needed most of all is a renewed willingness to take risks for the kind of  rewards that only entrepreneurial ventures can bring. The country of the  entrepreneur, in short, needs to recover the spirit of enterprise.  </P></p>

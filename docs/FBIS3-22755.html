			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Raquel Stenzel from Brasilia] </F>   [Text] The Brazilian Government is willing to comply with  the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) guidelines. In an  official document, the government admitted that the  implementation of the MTCR guidelines does not imply any sort of  limitation on special national programs or harm international  cooperation in such programs. In addition, the government  commits itself to complying with export control rules compatible  with the MTCR guidelines as soon as draft bill No. 2535/92 takes  effect.    This decision, which was announced 11 February, befits the  efforts made by the Brazilian Government in the last few weeks  to show the international community that the country is  contributing to preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction and that its nuclear and aerospace programs have  strictly peaceful objectives. Thus, the government believes it  has taken one more step toward obtaining sensitive technology.</p>

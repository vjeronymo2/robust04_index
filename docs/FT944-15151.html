			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (6): A grudging declaration of victory - Industry and the economy This summer, Luxembourg's Industry Federation, Fedil, somewhat grudgingly declared victory in the battle against recession. Order books were filling and margins improving, the federation conceded, although it cautioned that the recovery would not be fully evident until 1995. Why the reluctance? For Fedil, the downturn has been a useful stick with which to beat the government for what the industrialists see as its failure to tackle the structural problems of the Luxembourg economy, which they view as a threat to the country's long-term competitiveness. To drive home the point, the federation sent an elegantly-produced 'memorandum' to the 60 MPs elected in the June 12 general election, entitled The Economic, Social and Environmental Policy Stakes. The document called for a series of measures to assist economic development in general and industry in particular, including a reduction in the overall level of corporate taxation, greater state assistance in cash and kind for the creation of new enterprises, the abolition - or at least modification - of the automatic system of salary indexation, and greater flexibility in employment regulations. At the top of the hit-list of Fedil and other employers' groups is the cost-of-living indexation of salaries, which they say fuels inflation and keeps Luxembourg producers at a disadvantage vis a vis competitors abroad. 'We must stimulate the spirit of enterprise and entrepreneurship,' says Mr Marc Assa, the federation's president. 'The enterprise is the basis of a nation's prosperity and well-being, and we must not allow this reality out of our sight.' For years, Fedil has been arguing that unless the authorities take action, Luxembourg risks the displacement of its industrial activity to countries with lower costs. But the trend in industrial investment seems, if anything, to belie that. Certainly, Sommer Allibert, the French industrial group of which Mr Assa is chief executive, does not seem worried about Luxembourg's future competitiveness. In September, the group inaugurated two new factories at Eselborn in northern Luxembourg to manufacture vehicle components and floor coverIngs, an investment totalling nearly two billion francs. Mr Assa used the occasion to announce that Sommer had decided to invest a further billion francs in the Grand Duchy for the development and introduction of new products geared to meeting tougher European environmental standards, as well as the creation of a research and development centre. This decision, he noted, was due in part to the advantageous economic environment. Although no new large-scale, multi-billion-franc projects have been announced in Luxembourg recently, several have come on line, such as Guardian's automotive glass products facility near Grevenmacher in the east, or are being implemented, such as a toy factory for the US Rubbermaid group in Differdange and a wood products plant for Austrian company Kronospan in Sanem. The jobs created by the American and Austrian investments, in an area of southern Luxembourg which 20 years ago was almost entirely dependent on the steel industry, illustrates the success of the policy of industrial diversification pursued by successive Luxembourg governments. The policy, backed up by extensive construction of infrastructure and a package of tax incentives, has been aimed at small projects as well as large, and made the Grand Duchy an exporter of composite materials for Formula 1 cars and of Japanese mushrooms as well as of glass, aluminium foil and videotapes. Meanwhile, Luxembourg's steel producer, Arbed, is resurfacing after a big downturn which brought group losses of LFr5.7bn last year. The group now says it hopes to be back in the black for 1994. In the early 1970s, Arbed employed more than 27,000 people in the Grand Duchy. By the end of 1996 this figure will be nearer 6,000. But the company is in the middle of a LFr18bn modernisation programme which involves the installation of electric arc furnaces and continuous casting facilities at three Luxembourg sites and one in Thuringia, Germany. The group's confidence was emphasised earlier this year by its decision to acquire a controlling interest in the struggling Bremen-based Klockner Stahl through its Belgian subsidiary, Sidmar of Ghent. The deal makes Arbed Europe's third-largest steelmaker after France's Usinor-Sacilor and British Steel. Arbed's steady shedding of manpower has been achieved without any significant increase in unemployment. The jobless total peaked in January at some 4,800 and now seems to have stabilised at about 4,000, some 2.4 per cent of the workforce. That figure is double the average unemployment figure as recently as 1990, but it must be set against an increase in total employment between 1990 and 1993 of some 19,000 jobs. Of the total 187,000 employees in March 1993, more than 47,000 were cross-border commuters from Belgium, France and Germany. Together with resident non-Luxembourgers, foreigners have accounted for a majority of jobs since 1992 and last year they occupied nearly 53 per cent of jobs. The steady increase in employment (or at least of foreigners - the number of Luxembourgers has been falling in absolute terms since 1991) has slowed in the past couple of years, reflecting an economic downturn which bottomed out at 0.3 per cent growth last year. Only in the first quarter of 1993 did the economy actually contract - by 0.3 per cent. The official forecasts of growth of 1.5 per cent this year and 2.6 per cent next are already being overtaken. Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, finance minister, presenting his draft 1995 budget to parliament in September, said he was calculating on growth of 2.9 per cent. The downturn has left its scars, however. The number of bankruptcies has risen from 100 in 1991 to 233 last year and 125 in the first four months of this year. But there is at least one sector where recovery is already being celebrated. Commercial property, which was the first to hit the doldrums, now seems well set to grow, According to property brokers Jones Lang Wootton, the amount of empty office space fell by about 35 per cent last year as demand picked up. Office blocks which stood empty for months are filling up as firms, particularly in the financial sector, take the plunge into new premises. New developments are under way in the Luxembourg City suburbs of Kirchberg and Gasperich, and a business park near the city's airport is now full, practically to the last square metre.</p>

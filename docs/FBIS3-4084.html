It was issued jointly by the People's Bank of China, the  Bank  of Industry and Commerce, the Agricultural Bank and the Bank of  China.    It urged that steps should be taken to give priority to the  supply of working capital for farm production necessities such  as chemical fertilizers and pesticides.    The banks should provide the working capital in good time  for  the producers and suppliers of fertilizers and pesticides who  have adequate resources and production environment and whose  products have gained favor with farmers.    Priority should be given to the money supply, including  foreign currency, for imports of such products approved by the  State Council.    To ensure that farmers can carry out their seasonal work,  loans to them should also be distributed in good time, the  circular stated.</p>

A constitutional amendment panel under the Eighth National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference (CPPCC) has submitted a revised CPPCC constitution  (draft) to the CPPCC plenary session that opened here this  afternoon.    The panel says in its explanation to the session that the  revision aims to make the CPPCC constitution conform better to  the latest amendments to the constitution of the People's  Republic of China and to the tenets of the 14th National  Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC).    The panel notes that the revised constitution will highlight  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,  CPC's basic line of taking economic development as the central  task and the multi-party cooperation system under CPC  leadership. The constitutional revision is designed to improve  CPPCC's status and role in the political life of China, it says.    According to the panel, since the major principles and basic  framework of the 1982 constitution have remained correct, it has  recommended only a necessary and partial revision. It suggests  that issues which have a bearing on the work of the CPPCC but  are beyond the limits of the CPPCC constitution be handled  through state legislation and other channels.    According to the panel headed by CPPCC Chairman Li Ruihuan,  the revised CPPCC constitution (draft) has been approved by the  Standing Committee of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee and is  being submitted to the general session for examination and  adoption.</p>

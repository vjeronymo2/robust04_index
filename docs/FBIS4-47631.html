			<p>SUMMARY                                              In what appears to have been intended as a conciliatory gesture  to the legislature, President Boris Yeltsin has signed into law  legislation on the prerogatives and perquisites of lawmakers even  though he has challenged the Federal Assembly on the  constitutionality of some of the bill's provisions and requested  specific amendments.  Yeltsin is primarily challenging the bill  for ascribing to deputies significant oversight functions that he  contends exceed their constitutional role as legislators.  By  declining to veto one of the first pieces of legislation passed  by both parliamentary chambers, Yeltsin appears to be trying to  choose his political battles carefully, but the chances for a  successful legislative-executive compromise will depend on  whether lawmakers are willing to accept Yeltsin's narrow view of  their powers.                                       END SUMMARY     Suggesting that he is not interested in engaging the legislature  in political battles at this early juncture, Yeltsin signed the  law "On the Status of Federation Council Deputies and the Status  of State Duma Deputies" despite expressing serious concerns about  the constitutionality of some of its provisions.  (See Note 1)  In a letter to both chambers of the Federal Assembly, Yeltsin  indicated that the decision to sign the law was "difficult"  because it "contains obvious juridical imperfections and  inconsistencies with the Constitution."  At the same time, he  noted that the law "as a whole" is necessary for "effective  legislative work" and portrayed his decision to sign it as a  "step toward fulfilling the treaty on social accord."  Nevertheless, he attached a lengthy memorandum recommending  amendments to the law and "inviting" the legislature to "suspend"  those provisions he claims are at odds with the constitution  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 May).     (Note 1)  Yeltsin's decision to sign the law reportedly came  despite contradictory advice from his advisers.  According to  Izvestiya's parliamentary observer Sergey Chugayev, an edict for  a veto had already been drafted at the behest of Presidential  Administration leader Sergey Filatov, but Georgiy Satarov,  Yeltsin's adviser on legislative affairs who counseled Yeltsin to  sign the bill, prevailed (Izvestiya, 12 May).     Objections to Oversight Functions     At the heart of Yeltsin's objections to the law are its  provisions granting deputies extensive oversight functions that  he says violate the constitutional role of lawmakers.  Showing  particular sensitivity to parliamentary intrusion in executive  affairs at all levels of government, Yeltsin has challenged  provisions in the law granting deputies broad access to inspect  government bodies and state enterprises and requiring state  officials to respond in timely fashion to requests for  information from deputies:     Access.   Article 5 of the law states that a deputy is entitled  to "visit without hindrance all organs of state power and organs  of local self-government . . . and enterprises, institutions,  organizations, military units, and public associations."  Yeltsin  argued in his letter that such unrestricted access "is in no way  connected with the legislative process" (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12  May).     Right to Information.  Several articles in the law concern the  deputies' right to demand information from state and local  officials and to receive the requested information in a timely  manner.  In his memorandum, Yeltsin argued that the constitution  does not grant the Federal Assembly an "all-embracing monitoring  function with regard to other state institutions." (See Note 2)  He claims that deputies will use broadly formulated oversight  functions to "interfere in the activity" of state and local  governments and enterprises.  It is less clear, however, whether  Yeltsin is also challenging the practice, described in Article 14  of the law, whereby deputies are entitled to question any member  of the federal government during parliamentary sessions.  While  he wrote that "Articles 13-17 indicate that the deputy will  possess powers to interfere actively in the activity of all other  bodies of state authority and local self-government," he has not  previously objected to ministers' participation in the Duma's  weekly "government hour" session to report on an issue and answer  deputies' questions.  For example, Acting Finance Minister Sergey  Dubinin and Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko addressed  the Duma on 4 February on the enterprise payment crisis and  budget issues (ITAR-TASS, 4 February).  Similarly, Minister of  Internal Affairs Viktor Yerin reported to the Duma on the crime  situation on 11 February (ITAR-TASS, 11 February).     (Note 2)  The only oversight function explicitly granted to the  Federation Council and the State Duma under the constitution is  the right to monitor implementation of the federal budget through  the parliamentary Comptrollers Office (Article 101).     In challenging these parliamentary oversight functions, Yeltsin  has demonstrated his intention to consign lawmakers exclusively  to a lawmaking role.  In his memorandum Yeltsin noted that  Article 1 of the bill "correctly" defines a deputy as the  "people's elected representative, authorized to exercise  legislative power in the corresponding chamber of the Federal  Assembly."  Moreover, according to Yeltsin, the legislative  function is the deputy's "sole" constitutional function.  He  argued that the oversight functions prescribed in the law are "in  no way connected with parliament's legislative activity" and  violate the constitution's separation of powers by combining  "legislative, executive, and monitoring functions."  According to  Yeltsin, the law's oversight provisions demonstrate that deputies  continue "as before" to view themselves as an "individual state  official . . . and possessor of extensive independent powers"  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 May), an oblique but obvious reference to  broadly empowered Supreme Soviet deputies.     Yeltsin's Strict Constructionism     Yeltsin appears to be basing his view that deputies should  function exclusively in a legislative role on a narrow  interpretation of the constitution.  While the constitution  contains no explicit language on the role of legislators, Article  94 defines the Federal Assembly as the "representative and  legislative organ of the Russian Federation" (Rossiyskaya Gazeta,  25 December 1993).  By contrast, Article 1O7 of the previous  Russian Constitution--based on the 1978 RSFSR Constitution-  -explicitly gave deputies a significant oversight role by  defining the Supreme Soviet--the standing parliament--more  broadly as a "legislative, directive, and supervisory body of  governmental authority" (Konstitutsiya Rossiyskoy Federatsii,  1992).     Opposition From Deputies     Predictably, Yeltsin's narrow interpretation of lawmakers'  functions has already met with opposition from some deputies who  want to see the legislature more broadly empowered to  counterbalance the executive.  Vladimir Isakov, chairman of the  Duma's Legislation, Judicial, and Legal Reform Committee and a  staunch Yeltsin foe, has complained that a narrow legislative  function turns deputies into "a minor official with a large  wage," whose only right is to "press the voting button" to vote  on legislation.  According to Isakov--who may be articulating the  position of a significant number of opposition deputies,  particularly those who served in the old Supreme Soviet--a deputy  is a "plenipotentiary representative of his voters" and the  "guarantor of the rights and freedoms of his own electors."  Isakov has vociferously supported the right of deputies to  question any state official, arguing that "in a rule-of-law state  any citizen has the right to appeal to any official and any  official is obliged to answer" (Trud, 11 May; Sovetskaya Rossiya,  17 May).  Isakov also claims that Yeltsin wants to do away with  the legislature's practice of questioning members of the federal  government--" the most important institution of democracy since  the birth of the parliamentary system"--charging that Yeltsin's  intention is to turn the Federal Assembly into a mere "democratic  adornment" (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 17 May).     Duma's Response Cool     Although under no legal obligation-to amend a signed law, the  Duma has signaled some receptivity to Yeltsin's proposals by  forming a conciliation commission to review the legislation and  also addressing Yeltsin's proposals in plenary sessions.  The  commission's chairman, Valentin Kovalev, a deputy chairman of the  Duma and Communist Party (CPRF) representative, has indicated  that the Duma is "favorably disposed" to Yeltsin's proposed  amendments, but he cautioned that there is no procedure allowing  the Duma to suspend selected provisions of a bill (ITAR-TASS, 12  May).  Suggesting that Yeltsin may have a difficult time selling  his proposals to the deputies, an attempt by Ruslan Orekhov, head  of Yeltsin's State-Legal Directorate, to represent the  president's position reportedly met with a cool response from the  deputies on 13 May (ITAR-TASS, 18 May).  The administration's  next chance to defend Yeltsin's proposals will come at an  upcoming plenary session of the Duma, when Filatov is scheduled  to answer further queries from deputies (ITAR-TASS, 18 May).     Because media reports have not been observed to report the vote  total when the Duma passed the bill, it is difficult to gauge the  level of support for the law in its current form.  In an  indication that deputies may be reluctant to make significant  modifications, a press report noted that the Duma passed the law  "practically without debate" (Kommersant-Daily, 14 April), and  Isakov claims that deputies "stood and applauded" when the law  passed (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 17 May).     Implications     The issue of parliamentary oversight may prove difficult to  resolve because it rests on widely diverging interpretations of  the constitution, but deputies may seek to compromise with  Yeltsin on his less contentious objections to the bill.  The  significant differences between Yeltsin and some members of the  Duma on lawmakers' constitutional role may spur passage of  legislation to reconstitute the Constitutional Court--potentially  the final arbiter of the dispute.  If, as Isakov contends,  Yeltsin is in fact challenging the Federal Assembly's practice of  questioning members of government at its sessions, Yeltsin  appears to have embarked on a collision course with the  legislature despite having signed the law.

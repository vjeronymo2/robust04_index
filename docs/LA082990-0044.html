			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIGGER SITE APPROVED FOR CRAFT MUSEUM;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: CITY COUNCIL OKS RELOCATION TO EXPANDED SPACE IN A NEW MIXED-USE  TOWER ON THE MIRACLE MILE.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved a Miracle Mile  development that would move the Craft and Folk Arts Museum into a proposed  22-story building shared with shops and about 60 condominiums.  </P> <P> The $47-million project, at Wilshire Boulevard and Curson Avenue, will provide  about 57,000 square feet to the multicultural museum, which now operates out of  temporary quarters in the May Co. department store on Wilshire Boulevard.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley hailed the project as an "innovative approach" to mixed-use  development, which he has strongly advocated. Bill Chandler, the mayor's press  secretary, said Bradley "feels it is an excellent mixed-use project and that  the public would benefit from the (expanded) museum."  </P> <P> The Miracle Mile tower is to be designed and built by the Ratkovich Co.  Ratkovich officials expect to begin construction in the spring of 1992.  </P> <P> Museum officials said last year that the project would offer them much  additional space in which they plan to establish an education department, a  library, a storage and conservation area and a theater.  </P> <P> The Craft and Folk Arts Museum, known for its exhibits of hand-crafted objects,  has had a somewhat peripatetic history. Before taking up residence at the May  Co. last year, the museum spent more than 30 years on the first and third  floors of a combined restaurant and art gallery on Wilshire Boulevard, across  from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.  </P> <P> Visitors to the museum often fueled their stroll through the exhibits by dining  at the Egg and the Eye, the upstairs restaurant whose name served both itself  and the gallery until the latter was rechristened the Craft and Folk Arts  Museum in 1973.  </P> <P> In June, 1989, the museum closed at that site and moved to its present  location. The May Co. provided the 9,000-square-foot space, rent free.  </P> <P> The council has recently been encouraging developers to design mixed-use  projects in order to reduce traffic and smog.  </P></p>

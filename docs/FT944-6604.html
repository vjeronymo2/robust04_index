			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / People: Davidson Kelly quits Lasmo Lasmo, the oil explorer which earlier this year repelled a hostile bid from rival Enterprise Oil, yesterday announced the surprise departure of its charismatic corporate development director, Norman Davidson Kelly. Davidson Kelly, described by colleagues as possessing a 'certain bounce and flair', is expected to receive a pay-off of less than Pounds 500,000. Davidson Kelly was widely acknowledged to have been the architect of most of Lasmo's largest deals in the past few years. He arrived through Lasmo's 1979 takeover of Oil Exploration Holdings and joined the board in 1986. Joe Darby, Lasmo's chief executive, says Davidson Kelly's departure came as a result of an organisational review following the Enterprise bid. 'The bid helped us to focus on what we needed to do in the future,' says Darby. This included 'clarifying reporting lines and responsibilities'. Davidson Kelly's responsibilities included finance, investor relations, and developing new business opportunities. These functions would now be divided between Paul Murray, appointed general manager,corporate finance, who will report to the recently appointed finance director, Dick Smernoff, and a new business team comprising Peter Nolan, general manager, and Tom King, director. Davidson Kelly kept a low profile during the bid, with many observers feeling he could have been a potential weakness in the target company's defence. He had been closely associated with arranging several of Lasmo's controversial acquisitions, including Ultramar. However, a close associate says that, while Lasmo was acknowledged to have paid far too much for Ultramar, its best assets are those which were acquired in the deal. Davidson Kelly, whose annual salary was in the region of Pounds 180,000, was on a three-year rolling contract.</p>

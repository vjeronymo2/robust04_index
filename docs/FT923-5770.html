			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Afghanistan ceasefire hopes are raised PAKISTAN was yesterday awaiting confirmation that a temporary ceasefire between rival Afghan mujahideen factions had come into effect before a high-level government delegation left for Kabul to negotiate a settlement. The delegation, led by the Pakistani minister of state for foreign affairs, Mr Siddique Khan Kanjo, will be part of Islamabad's latest effort to end three weeks of fighting, which left at least 2,000 dead. A government announcement in Islamabad said the rival factions led by dissident leader Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and the government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani had agreed to a 72-hour ceasefire, after Pakistani contacts with both sides. Pakistan hopes to use the temporary lull to begin negotiations on peace talks. However, bitter rivalries remain in the war-torn country. Mr Hekmatyar has been demanding the expulsion of Uzbek militiamen from Kabul as a pre-condition to peace talks, on the grounds that the militia leader General Rashid Dostum is closely allied to former communist-backed President Najibullah. But Mr Rabbani's government has refused to accept that demand, which triggered the latest fighting on August 6. The Afghan government is widely believed to fear that the expulsion of the Uzbeks would tilt the balance of power strongly in favour of Mr Hekmatyar, allowing him to send his troops to take over the capital. On the other hand, Mr Hekmatyar is also pressed for time. His fighters, deployed on hill-tops outside Kabul will have to move when the winter snows begin.</p>

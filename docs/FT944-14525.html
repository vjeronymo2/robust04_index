			<p>941022 FT  22 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Simple ID card would make for simpler life Sir, To my chagrin, my Spanish wife can enter and leave the UK with no more than a credit card-sized ID card. Furthermore, in many countries ID cards are essential for day-to-day business purposes, such as entering clients' offices. Passports have to be carried in lieu of ID cards. To avoid the hassle of carrying a passport while abroad I have made myself an ID card. While consulting in South Africa last year, I stuck a photograph on my UK driving licence and my client over-stamped it and signed it. I have had no problems with my 'official' papers within and without the EU, though I have not yet tried it at a frontier. May I suggest a cheap and speedy low-tech ID card - the back cover of the EU/UK passport. The blank reverse could contain the holder's signature, driving licence and National Insurance details.

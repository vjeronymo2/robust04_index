			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLTS COME BACK FOR 17-14 VICTORY;  </P> <P> AFC: GEORGE SHOWS IMPROVEMENT, BIASUCCI'S 38-YARD FIELD GOAL WITH 1:46 LEFT  BEATS JETS.  </P> <P> Indianapolis rookie Jeff George continued his progression as an NFL quarterback  Sunday against the New York Jets.  </P> <P> George, the No. 1 pick in the 1989 draft, passed for a season-high 249 yards  and two second-half touchdowns to lead the Colts to a 17-14 comeback victory.  </P> <P> Dean Biasucci provided the Colts (4-6) with their winning margin by kicking a  38-yard field goal with 1:46 left.  </P> <P> "He is taking giant steps forward," Indianapolis Coach Ron Meyer said of  George. "The thing he gives you is a striking ability. Down, 14-0, you're not  out of the game."  </P> <P> The Jets (4-7) took a 14-0 lead on four field goals by Pat Leahy and a safety.  </P> <P> But George, who completed 14 of 22 passes, including eight of 13 in the second  half, overcame a defense that held the Colts to 88 yards rushing.  </P> <P> It was a team-record 10th consecutive game the Colts failed to reach 100 yards  on the ground.  </P> <P> "We struggled in the first half," George said. "It seemed we couldn't run or  pass, but once we learned their defensive schemes, we seemed to move the ball  better in the second half.  </P> <P> "Once the momentum started going our way, everything worked."  </P> <P> The momentum swung when Erik McMillan intercepted a pass by George and then  tried to lateral the ball while he was being tackled. George recovered at the  Jets' 43. On the next play, George connected with Jessie Hester on a 43-yard  touchdown pass play.  </P> <P> The Colts tied the score with 7:22 left when George connected with Stanley  Morgan on a three-yard touchdown pass.  </P> <P> The Jets managed only 13 yards on their next possession, and a 33-yard punt  return by Clarence Verdin gave the Colts the ball at the Jets' 41.  </P> <P> The Colts reached the eight, but a holding penalty and sack forced them back to  the 23, where Biasucci kicked the go-ahead field goal.  </P> <P> Jet quarterback Ken O'Brien, who completed 25 of 35 passes for 272 yards,  sustained a concussion in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Tony Eason replaced O'Brien and took the Jets to the Indianapolis 33 in the  final minute.  </P> <P> An offensive pass interference penalty cost the Jets 10 yards, and after a  five-yard pass to Johnny Hector, a fourth-down pass was incomplete.  </P></p>

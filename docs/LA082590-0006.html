			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURBING HIGHWAY UGLINESS;  </P> <P> BILLBOARD-CONTROL MEASURES TO ADVANCE ROADSIDE BEAUTY  </P> <P> Spring has sprung, the grass has riz, where last year's careless drivers is.  </P> <P>  -- Burma Shave road sign, circa 1950s.  </P> <P> Billboards sort of went straight downhill from there, as did the politics of  "outdoor advertising": A loophole in Lady Bird Johnson's pet project, the 1965  Highway Beautification Act, has so far fed $200 million from public coffers to  billboard owners.  </P> <P> Pending federal legislation would bring the law more into keeping with Mrs.  Johnson's original beautification goal.  </P> <P> The act was intended to stop the proliferation of billboards along federally  funded highways. The signs are supposed to be restricted to commercially zoned  areas. But owners of illegally positioned boards must be reimbursed by the  government for the cost of the sign and lost potential income when they  relocate them.  </P> <P> Worse yet, until recently, billboard owners, whether in compliance with the act  or not, were free to cut down trees growing on public land that clutter the  motorist's view of their advertising.  </P> <P> Many of the doomed trees were planted with tax dollars in accordance with the  very same legislation!  </P> <P> But now there are bills before both U.S. and California lawmakers to  permanently halt tree-cutting for the exclusive purpose of making billboards  more visible. And dozens of U.S. legislators have endorsed measures to end the  Byzantine imbroglio. Both the House Billboard Control Act and its Senate  counterpart, the Visual Pollution Control Act, prohibit new signs along certain  highways and interstates and would give local governments control over removing  existing billboards.  </P> <P> They should consider the technique of amortization, the standard procedure used  for compensating advertisers until 1978: Sign owners would be allowed to leave  a billboard in place long enough to earn back its cost and some profit.  </P> <P> We are paying advertisers not to block our view of America's natural wonders.  It's time to rescue both Mrs. Johnson's dream of uncluttered scenery and  millions of dollars in public funds.  </P></p>

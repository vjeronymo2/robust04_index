			<p>BFN     [Text] Full details have emerged on the items that the  European Union (EU) has demanded that the Japanese Government  deregulate. There are 32 items in all, including: 1) revising  the current Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law,  which restricts direct investment by foreign corporations in  some areas of business to make corporate acquisition in Japan  easier; 2) introducing a permit system for mutual acceptance of  foreign inspection standards for electronic equipment and to  promote imports; and 3) expanding the access of foreign capital  to pension operations. Demands on deregulation in the area of  finance are nearly the same as those from the United States. On  31 May the Japanese Government and the EU began a working-level  exchange of views regarding the demands.    The 32 items of the EU's demands were classified into five  areas -- investment promotion, information and communications,  import promotion, market liberalization, and distribution. The  EU and the Japanese Government are supposed to exchange views on  them item by item in order to probe for points of compromise,  and on 31 May, five government agencies concerned -- the  Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries,  the Economic Planning Agency, and the Management and  Coordination Agency -- conducted negotiations with officials of  the EU individually. The Japanese Government wants to  incorporate what are agreed in the discussions into the  deregulation plans to be formulated by the end of June.    Regarding corporate acquisitions, the EU is demanding the  amendment of the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law,  which is viewed as "granting a veto over the acquisition of  Japanese corporations by foreign corporations." The law at  present provides that foreign corporations making direct  investments in Japan can do so in most areas of business by  making ex-post-facto reports but must file advance reports for  government review and approval in four particular industries:  oil, agriculture, leather, and mining. The EU considers the  exceptional measures on these four areas of industry as barriers  to investments.    For import promotion, the EU wants the standards and permits  for electric equipment mutually recognized between Japan and the  EU, thus saving time taken in import inspections and enabling  the EU-approved product specifications to be accepted by Japan  automatically. In addition, the EU requests simplification of  import inspection procedures for television sets and video  cassette recorders. With respect to customs service, the EU  seeks reduced commission rates, simplification of quarantine  procedures, and 24-hour customs office operations of major  seaports and airports.    Its demand in the financial field is the same as that of the  United States--the easing of rules on pension operations.  Whereas at present only the trust banks and life insurance  companies are allowed to deal with public pensions (welfare  pensions and national pensions), the EU requests that Japan open  this business to investment consulting companies. The scale of  public pensions in operation ran to about 20 trillion yen at the  end of 1993, and European and U.S. investment consulting  companies have been raising their voices to demand that Japan  open this area to them.    Regarding pensions, the EU wants Japan to ease the  regulation  on ceilings which are put on the amount of money used on  operations of private businesses' pensions, and to raise the  ceilings.  <H5>  Items for Which EU Is Demanding Deregulation </H5>   Measures for promotion of investments:     -  Making land available for industries and businesses    -  Improving bidding qualifications in public works projects    -  Ensuring transparency of the bidding system    -  Revising the veto right on foreign corporate acquisition of  Japanese corporations     Measures in the area of telecommunications:     -  Liberalizing by stages the provision of services     Measures for import promotion:     -  Accepting safety standards for electric equipment    -  Expanding the household products for acquisition by those  using  government loans    -  Simplifying inspections for color television sets    -  Mutually recognizing permit standards for medical equipment    -  Accepting foreign laboratory certification in textile  inspections    -  Changing requirements for foodstuff labeling so that only  expiration dates [not production dates] can be shown    -  Changing rules on food additives    -  Improving warehousing facilities at Narita Airport    -  Operating major custom houses on an all-day basis    -  Improving efficiency in government procurement procedures     Measures for market liberalization:     -  Easing standards on drug residue in meat products    -  Importing fruits kept at low temperatures on ships    -  Adopting the same plant quarantine system as used in Europe  and  the United States    -  Opening the investment trust business    -  Expanding the definition of the word securities in the  Securities and Exchange Law    -  Being flexible in classifying banking activities    -  Expanding the participation of foreign securities firms in  pension fund management operations    -  Changing the prior approval system in the insurance area    -  Allowing insurance agents to represent more than one company    -  Allowing life insurance companies to engage in nonlife  insurance businesses    -  Easing restrictions on the activities of foreign attorneys     Measures in the area of distribution:     -  Investigating the monopolistic positions of the National  Federation of Agricultural Cooperative Association [Zenno] and  the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives [Zenchu]    -  Abolishing the Large-Scale Retail Store Law    -  Correcting the problem of medical organizations giving  priority  in using Japanese products    -  Abolishing the existing system of booking vessels    -  Increasing the number of seats for foreign aircraft companies    -  Deregulating the trucking industry</p>

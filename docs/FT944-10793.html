			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Arts: Chase Manhattan boost for BM The British Museum yesterday announced the first step in its ambition to renovate its galleries to celebrate its 250th anniversary in 2003. Chase Manhattan Bank is giving Pounds 1m, spread over five years, to pay for a new gallery of North American ethnic art. At the moment the BM's ethnographical collection is housed in the Museum of Mankind, off Piccadilly. The aim is to return it to Bloomsbury to fill the space left by the departure of the British Library to St Pancras. It will also occupy some of the additional square footage the BM will gain if Sir Norman Foster's Pounds 50m plan to enclose the inner courtyard comes to fruition as a millennium funded project. The BM has one of the finest collections of ethnographical material from North America in the world, with around 20,000 objects, few of which are currently displayed. The artifacts of Innuit and Indians, from northern Canada to southern California, are well represented, with confirmed datings of items stretching back to 1702. This will be Chase Manhattan's first major sponsorship in Europe, although it has a reputation for backing contemporary art in the US. The new gallery will open in 1997, even if the British Library has still not moved out.</p>

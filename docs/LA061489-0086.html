			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'DOG PARK' MOVES TOWARD EXTENSION  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday moved toward extending the operation of  the city's only official "dog park" for a second year.  </P> <P> In April, 1988, the City Council approved an ordinance that allowed dogs to run  without leashes in the mornings and evenings in Laurel Canyon Park on the  city's Westside. The park is in an affluent hillside neighborhood off  Mulholland Drive above Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley, and has since  attracted hundreds of dog owners and their pets every week.  </P> <P> The city's initial ordinance allowing dogs to run free in the park expires on  Aug. 31. On Tuesday, council members voted in favor of ordering the city  attorney to draft a new measure so the program can be continued for another  year. The hours of operation, from dawn until 10 a.m. and from 3 p.m. until  dark, will remain the same.  </P> <P> Once drafted, the new ordinance must be approved by the council and Mayor Tom  Bradley.  </P></p>

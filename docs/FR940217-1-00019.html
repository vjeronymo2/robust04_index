			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reproposed rule would retain the proposed LTID assignment system <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and would modify the duty of large traders to disclose their LTIDs and accounts to broker-dealers. The reproposed rule also would require similar disclosures of information to custodians or nominees and large traders that control transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Upon filing Form 13H a large trader would be assigned an LTID by the Commission. See Proposing Release, 56 FR 42553, at text immediately following n. 37.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reproposed paragraph (b)(2)(i) would require a large trader who controls a fully disclosed account or the custodian or nominee for an omnibus account to disclose its LTID and accounts to the carrying broker-dealers. Hence, under the reproposed rules, each large trader account should have only one LTID number associated with it, namely the LTID number of the controlling large trader or of the custodian or nominee large trader.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission notes that the reproposed definition of control states that an account would be controlled by the owner of the account. Consequently, if an account is controlled only by its owner, then the owner would be required to disclose its LTID to the carrying broker-dealer. This duty also would apply to fully disclosed accounts of small or otherwise infrequent traders whose accounts are controlled by large traders, even though these accounts would not be listed on the reproposed Schedules to Item 7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(2)(i) of the reproposed rule would effectively eliminate the majority of situations where multiple LTIDs would be disclosed to a broker-dealer for a single account. The Commission believes that the only situation where more than one LTID would be disclosed to a broker-dealer for a single account would be where more than one large trader controls transactions in an account that is fully disclosed as to ownership. These situations would include fully disclosed accounts controlled by their owner and another adviser or such accounts controlled by two or more advisers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reproposed paragraph (b)(2)(ii) would require a large trader who controls omnibus accounts to disclose its LTID or ID System number to the broker-dealer or large trader acting as the custodian or nominee for such account. Similarly, reproposed paragraph (b)(2)(iii) would require a large trader that owns accounts but has delegated full or limited discretionary investment authority to another person to disclose its LTID or ID System number to such person. These duties are coordinated with the filing requirements for Schedules 7a, 7b, and 8 to reproposed Form 13H. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 44 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 44 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See supra Section III.A.2.b., for a discussion of the omnibus account identification and disaggregation duties that attach to the filing of Schedules 7b and 8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission acknowledges that reproposed paragraphs (b)(2) (ii) and (iii) may cause multiple LTIDs or ID System numbers to be disclosed to custodian or nominee and controlling large traders, respectively. The Commission believes that these required disclosures of large trader status would not be overlapping or unnecessarily burdensome and would utilize existing ID System practices and procedures. The Commission also believes that these disclosure requirements would minimize the amount of communication among members of an investment complex that would be necessary to complete Form 13H. Moreover, these changes to the proposed rule would conform with the various rules and regulations that require financial institutions of all types to identify the beneficial owners of accounts, confirm trades, and maintain possession and control of customer funds and securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that the revisions to the reproposed rules for disclosure of large trader status incorporate many of the recommendations made by the commenters and reduce the burdens imposed on market participants. The Commission solicits comment on this use of the ID System and whether other ID System procedures or information would further the purposes of the Market Reform Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Inactive Filing Status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Proposing Release, the Commission specifically solicited comments on various means of minimizing the impact of the proposed rule on small or otherwise infrequent traders. The Commission received many comments in this respect and all were supportive of minimizing the impact of the proposed system on small or otherwise infrequent traders. Many of the commenters suggested that an annual activity threshold could be used to limit the impact of the proposed system on infrequent large traders. The commenters did not identify any common trading objectives or characteristics of small or infrequent traders that may inadvertently become large traders, other than those suggested in the Proposing Release. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 45 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 45 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Proposing Release, 56 FR 42551, at nn. 12&hyph;14 and accompanying text.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reproposed rule would implement a new ``inactive filing status,'' pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of the reproposed rule. This new paragraph provides that large traders whose aggregate transactions during the previous full calendar year, which do not reach the identifying activity level and an aggregate calendar year total of 2,000,000 shares or fair market value of $30,000,000, shall become inactive upon filing Form 13H. This threshold would incorporate the identifying activity threshold and would add an ``aggregate calendar year activity threshold.'' Aggregate calendar year activity would be computed in accordance with the rules for aggregation of transactions found in paragraph (c)(2) of the reproposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reproposed Instructions explain that this new inactive status would be invoked by checking the appropriate box on the cover page when filing an annual Form 13H for the calendar year in which the large trader was inactive. Once a large trader has made an ``inactive filing,'' he would be exempt from the reproposed annual filing requirements contained in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) and the LTID disclosure requirements of paragraph (b)(2). However, if an inactive large trader subsequently effects transactions that reach the identifying activity level, then the large trader again would be required to reactivate its large trader status by filing Form 13H within 10 business days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reproposed Instructions indicate that such ``reactivated large traders'' would retain the LTID initially assigned to them by the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that this new inactive filing status would eliminate the burdens of the identification requirements on small or otherwise infrequent traders and, therefore, would accomplish the objectives of the Market Reform Act. Nevertheless, the Commission solicits comments on whether this new provision would adequately reduce or eliminate the impact of the reproposed rule on natural persons that infrequently effect large trades. The Commission also solicits suggestions for other means of eliminating the burden of the reproposed rule on natural persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Hostels may prove deadly flashpoint: Next week's ANC-led strike OF THE many potential flash points in the week of industrial action that gets under way in South Africa on Monday, none is more volatile than the single-men's hostels scattered around the industrial heartland of the Witwatersrand. Present are all the ingredients for violence - ethnic and political tensions, living conditions that are often wretched, and competition for jobs in an economy now in the third year of a recession. The hostel dwellers  -or 'inmates' as they are often called - are mainly, though not entirely, Zulu and supporters of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party. Last week Chief Buthelezi angrily condemned the African National Congress (ANC) call for a two-day general strike starting on Monday and called on his followers to assert their 'right to work'. Confrontation thus seems inevitable, and it is likely to involve around 25 'problem' hostels in the region around Johannesburg which have been linked to more than 260 attacks over the past two years, claiming 1,200 lives and causing injuries to 3,700 people. The massacre last month of 42 people in the township of Boipatong thrust the hostel issue to the forefront of national concerns, for the attackers were said to come from the nearby Kwamadala hostel. Boipatong, however, was merely the latest in a gruesome series of attacks which have left hostels such as Madala in Alexandra township and Nancefield and Jabulani in Soweto as bywords for violence. It prompted renewed calls, however, for measures that seemed long overdue - fence the hostels, monitor access points and confiscate weapons, increase police patrols in the area, and begin a longer-term programme to phase out hostels and replace them with family accommodation. 'Fine in principle, but try putting it into practice,' complains a senior government official whose job is to resolve the problem. Although the government adopted a hostel upgrading strategy in October last year, and voted R294.6m (Pounds 55.6m) in the 1992/93 budget to finance it, it has been the object of criticism for not having shown greater resolution. Most hostels are in the public sector, run by black local authorities or provincial administrations, but there are also private hostels, mostly in the mining industry. Professor Dan Smit of the University of Natal, Durban, who has done research into the hostel system, calculates that there are at least 380,000 public and private hostel beds in South Africa which are used by more than 1m migrant workers during the course of a year. The average hostel probably houses about 2,000. The conventional image of hostels has them as squalid and over-crowded seats of crime, dominated by Zulu-speaking Inkatha supporters, mostly unemployed, who are invariably the aggressors in situations of township conflict. While there are hostels which conform to this stereotype, many more do not. As pressure to deal with the hostel problem has escalated, so it has become clearer that any quick-fix solution, premised on the belief that all hostels are 'bad', is inappropriate and unfeasible. The government's strategy of either upgrading or converting hostels into family units first requires consensus between interested parties - principally, the residents, civic associations, neighbouring township dwellers and the local authorities who own most hostels. While progress has been made in some areas, it has been difficult to get parties around the table where there has been violence. Mr Johan du Plessis, director of urbanisation at the Transvaal Provincial Administration comments: 'Trying to reach consensus in the Witwatersrand is virtually impossible.' The authorities face an unenviable task. On the one hand, there is recognition of the urgent need for change to be seen to be taking place on the ground. On the other, this change can only commence when there is consensus, at individual hostel level, about the way forward. In more troubled areas this is a distant dream. Further complicating matters is that despite being an artificial, primitive and inadequate form of accommodation, many residents wish to preserve hostels, which are a preferable alternative to squatter camps. While housing would obviously be desirable, apartheid and unrest have so disrupted the housing delivery process in townships that there is no effective housing market and the state simply does not have the funds to meet the housing backlog itself. Hostels have their origin in the migrant labour system, whereby working men living in outlying rural regions or neighbouring countries came to the cities to seek work on the mines or in industry. The apartheid system regarded these men as 'temporary sojourners' in urban areas. As such, they left their families in the 'homelands' and moved into hostel accommodation, designed for single men. Research conducted by Lauren Segal of Wits University indicates that before violence came to the Transvaal townships in July 1990, hostel-dwellers and township residents co-existed reasonably. Hostel dwellers had always been 'social enclaves', perpetuating the more traditional value and authority systems found in rural areas but it was only with political mobilisation during the late-1980s that a wedge started to be driven between them and township residents. Union and youth movements called for work stayaways and boycotts without consulting hostel dwellers who fiercely resisted them. Ms Segal quotes one resident: 'No one will stop us from going to work. We come to Johannesburg to work, not for anything else.' Hostel dwellers with their more traditional values were also deeply alienated by what they regarded as the lawless young comrades found at the helm of youth movements. Even so, it was only when serious township violence started in mid-1990 that relations deteriorated dramatically with ethnicity becoming an important factor. Hostel dwellers, perceiving a common threat, based on their identification as Zulus, banded together for support. In many cases they drove non-Zulus out of the hostels and turned to Inkatha for support.</p>

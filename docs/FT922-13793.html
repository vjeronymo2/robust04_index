			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Stylo shares dive 30p on Pounds 9m deficit LOSSES AT Stylo, the footwear manufacturer and retailer, continued to build up through the second half and for the year to February 1 totalled Pounds 9.06m at the pre-tax level. The deficit, which compared with sharply reduced profits of Pounds 1.67m for the previous year, was incurred from turnover of Pounds 91.9m (Pounds 87.5m). Losses per share emerged at 42p (4.07p earnings) and the annual dividend is cut to 2.5p (9p). The shares fell 30p to 143p. Mr Arnold Ziff, chairman, blamed the loss on a number of factors, including the increase in VAT. He explained that as all of the company's shoes for the summer and autumn seasons had already been purchased and because of competitive pressures it was unable to pass the rise on to customers.</p>

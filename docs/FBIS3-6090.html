			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 12 March Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The "Japan-France Club," where Japanese and French  businessmen discuss measures to strengthen ties between Japan  and France, ended its two-day 10th general meeting on 11 March  at a hotel in Tokyo. At the meeting, businessmen of both  countries agreed on the view that both countries should  cooperate with each other for economic development in such areas  as the Asia-Pacific region. They also confirmed their  understanding that both countries need to firmly maintain a free  trade system without falling into protectionism.    During discussions at the meeting, Dietman Koji Kakizawa  pointed out that "Japan and France should contribute to economic  development in the Asia-Pacific region and other areas by  expanding cooperative ties between the two countries." Alan  Berune [name as published], advisory editor of the French  newspaper LE FIGARO, stated: "Europe and Asia need to develop  perfect trust (in the post-Cold War world)."    Regarding the Super 301 provision (designed to identify and  retaliate against unfair trade partners and acts) of the Omnibus  Trade Law, which the United States has revived, French  businessmen expressed their concerns one after another. On the  other hand, Japanese attendants disclosed their views, saying  that "although we are against managed trade, it is necessary for  Japan to reexamine Japanese business practices to see if there  are some things which are unacceptable to international  society," (according to Junichi Miyako, director of the Japan  Comprehensive Research Institute).    On future ties between Japan and France, Akira Arai of NIHON  KEIZAI SHIMBUN stressed: "The problems the world is confronted  with now are peculiar to a changing period of history. Japan  needs to cooperate with France and other countries to solve  environmental, population, AIDS, and other issues."</p>

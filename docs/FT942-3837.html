			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Observer: Going begging Nice to see Lady Margaret Colville made Companion of the Royal Victorian Order in the latest honours list. As 'Extra Woman of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother', she no doubt deserves it. And something for below stairs, too: Royal Victorian Medals (Silver) to  - among others - Henry Charles Bynoth (roofing contractor), Christopher Arthur Chiverton (trapper, Great Park, Crown Estate, Windsor) and Peter Horace Matthews (senior sous chef, Buckingham palace). Nothing for the corgis?</p>

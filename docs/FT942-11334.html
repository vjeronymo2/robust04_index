			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Call for tighter derivative regulation The activities of all US companies which use derivatives should be subject to close regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to the draft of a long-awaited report due to be published on May 18. The proposal, from the US's General Accounting Office, would impose new rules on many of the US's biggest companies, which use derivatives to manage exposure to interest rate, currency or other risks. The GAO report is likely to add to pressure in Washington for early legislation on derivatives - financial instruments whose value is based on some underlying asset or market. The rapid growth in the use of such instruments has caused concern among regulators and policy makers. Industry trade groups, derivatives exchanges and other interested parties were this week given a brief opportunity to read the 200-page draft report. According to one person who read it, the tone of its conclusions was 'unremittingly negative'. The report's main conclusions are believed to be that regulation should be extended both to companies that use derivatives, and to the unregulated subsidiaries of securities companies, among the biggest traders in such instruments. The report is understood to propose that companies which use the instruments report their derivatives exposures to the SEC, and that the SEC lay down requirements for boards of directors to control their activities in this area.</p>

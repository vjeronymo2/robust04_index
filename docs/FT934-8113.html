			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Arts: Too much buzz about Wasps - Theatre Lawyers are people who help you get what is coming to them. They have long been satirised, and nowhere better than in Aristophanes' Wasps, now at The Place Theatre. The production makes a gloriously energetic and confused hash of the original, but manages in parts to be so enjoyable that it matters little that the catch-all satire fails to catch very much. The action centres on Procleon, an old juror devoted to the Athenian system of civil courts. In this litigious society where the greatest power is the power of the attorney, he basks in his position as civil arbiter, 'it makes mere wealth pale by comparison.' His son, Anticleon, is convinced of the corruption in the system, and tries to distract him from the courts first by urging him to try cases at home, and then by luring him out to society dinners. Fifth-century Athens and its legal system is so remote that the action sometimes seems baffling. There is, however, a universal and rooted dislike of lawyers. Perhaps the world of Wasps is more like that of the Think Tanks on Capitol Hill or the non-executive directorships in the City: 'It's an achievement,' admits Anticleon, 'not to be held accountable.' And if Athenian law was reason free from passion, Aristophanes is quick to turn the event into more of a competency hearing than a trial. The company, Aquila Productions, has tackled Clouds and Frogs and has performed Off Broadway and at Delphi, so it should know how to create the best Aristophanic chaos and match it to the venue. At The Place Theatre, the actors roam throughout the audience, and a middle seat is no hedge against enforced participation. There is an incomprehensibly sung jazz and blues score delivered by two musicians at the back of the open stage. The show's best touches are also American: a revivalist preacher comes to give the play's message, wandering amongst the audience crying 'Lemme hear ya say Shame '; and the home trial of two dogs brings on 'Butch' from Tom and Jerry growling 'Dat's ma boy]' The six actors, and some of the audience, race around at breakneck speed, so I hope theatre is insured against liability suits from distressed theatregoers. Still, theatre is cheaper than court. The show runs for 90 minutes; take the cost of the ticket from the cost of 90 minutes with Counsel and have a week end in New York on the difference. At The Place Theatre, WC1 (071 387 0031) until November 27</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Booth Industries slips to Pounds 677,281 Pre-tax profits of Booth Industries, the structural steelwork and engineering group, declined by some Pounds 306,000 to Pounds 677,281 in the year to end-March. Turnover fell from Pounds 32.5m to Pounds 30.8m. Mr James Booth, chairman, said demand for structural steelwork continued at a much-reduced level, affecting both margins and volume. However, offshore investment had continued at a satisfactory level with prospects of a number of sizeable projects proceeding. Earnings per share fell to 10.58p (15.99p) but an unchanged final dividend of 2.5p is recommended maintaining the total at 3.2p.</p>

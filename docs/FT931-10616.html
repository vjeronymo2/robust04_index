			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (6): A sudden flurry of alarmist warnings - Defence THE eight-year war between Iran and Iraq offered much satisfaction to strategic planners anxious to prevent either country achieving a clear military superiority in the region. Few tears were shed in western capitals, particularly Washington, when President Saddam Hussein sent his forces across the border into southern Iran in September 1980. A conflict which absorbed and eventually came close to exhausting Iran's Islamic revolution was not to be discouraged. When Saddam's troops were eventually thrown back across the border and Iraq became locked in a six-year defensive battle, the pro-Baghdad tilt in the west became more obvious. Initially, at least, there was no confusion about the type of regime run by the Iraqi leader, or about the solely pragmatic need to keep Iraq out of Tehran's clutches. If, after the 1988 ceasefire, commercial greed got in the way of political perspective it was brought to a sudden halt by Saddam's decision to invade Kuwait. The invasions of 1980 and 1990 rested on the mistaken assumption by Saddam Hussein that his forces were superior to anything likely to be sent against them. Neither adventure would have been attempted before the Iranian revolution when the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's armed forces enabled Tehran to impose conditions on Baghdad - such as the 1975 Algiers agreement covering the Shatt al-Arab waterway. The sudden flurry of alarmist warnings about the military ambitions of Iran indicate that for some people the pendulum may now have swung back too far in the direction of Tehran. Since being ejected from Kuwait in February 1991, Iraq has not posed a serious military threat to its neighbours. The recent response by the western alliance to Iraq's challenges to the air exclusion zones underlines how greatly reduced Baghdad's military capacity has become. It can defy UN Security Council resolutions and threaten its own people, but the quantity and sophistication of allied equipment in Saudi Arabia, the Gulf and Kuwait offers considerable reassurance to Iraq's smaller neighbours. Iran may once more be militarily stronger than Iraq, but both are considerably weaker than they have been. Tehran points out that it has never attacked anyone but has several times been the victim of aggression. It insists that it has no territorial ambitions, no intention to acquire nuclear weapons technology, and has a very limited arms-buying budget, especially when compared with that of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Officials say that rebuilding the economy has a higher priority than developing the armed forces. Some of its recent purchases have nonetheless caused public concern in the west, most particularly the arrival in Iran late last year of its first Russian-built Kilo-class submarine. Privately, military analysts are far less worried and dismiss suggestions that one or more submarines will have much impact on the military balance in the region. 'In effect it will be easy to track, probably poorly operated, and can be dealt with swiftly if ever there was a need', said a former naval officer with long experience of the region. Iran has also taken advantage of Russia's need for hard currency by acquiring a number of Mig-29 aircraft and T-72 tanks. China has sold Scud missiles to Iran, together with F-7 jets which are modernised versions of the ageing Mig-21. But as Mr Akbar Torkan, minister of defence, makes clear, Iran's overwhelming need is spare parts for equipment bought from the US before 1979. Even given modest success in buying spares, Iran's military capacity will remain substantially below the levels attained 15 years ago. Tehran also has to face a growing technological gap, not just in weaponry but in command and communications equipment. It was this deficiency which contributed to its inability to score a decisive breakthrough on the southern front during the war with Iraq. Another weakness, probably still not rectified, is the command structure of the armed forces and the extent to which the regular army and the Revolutionary Guards Corps is capable of working harmoniously together. The regular army is unlikely ever to enjoy the same level of confidence among the country's senior clergy as that bestowed on the Revolutionary Guards Corps which is said still to be allowed the pick of new weapons. The picture painted by some intelligence agencies of a more belligerent Iran, bent on military expansion, is also difficult to square with the political mood in the country. The shocking casualty list caused by nine years of revolution and war has contributed to a weariness with conflict which will not easily be overcome. There is no doubt that the regime will fight vigorously to protect the revolution if challenged, but there is little evidence to suggest that there would be much popular backing for foreign conflicts. On the contrary, the regime is constantly demonstrating that it believes supplying the domestic market with consumer goods makes better political sense than re-arming on a large scale. The US and its allies wish to avoid repeating the mistakes they made in assessing the intentions of President Saddam Hussein. But, by being so noisily suspicious of Iran, there is a danger of focusing excessively on the military threat when it is the battle of ideas which could more seriously damage western interests throughout the Middle East.</p>

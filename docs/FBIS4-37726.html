			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Kuwait City, 22 June, (KUNA) -- Kuwaiti Oil  Minister Dr. Abd al-Muhsin al-Mid'ij today said "Kuwait will ask  for a new production quota when OPEC examines the subject of a  higher production ceiling," which could be discussed owing to  the stability of the oil market and increasing oil prices.    In an interview with KUNA, al-Mid'ij pointed out that Kuwait  would ask for the quota allocated to her before the tyrannical  Iraqi invasion -- 2.2 million barrels a day. Minister al-Mid'ij  attributed this Kuwaiti demand to two reasons: first, that  "this is the minimum of our rights since they should be equal to  those of other states"; second, that Kuwait's production  capacity is estimated at 2.4 million barrels a day.    Al-Mid'ij also said he hoped Kuwait's request would be  granted. [passage omitted]    Concerning the foreign participation in the oil sector, the  Kuwaiti minister said "it is still under review and we expect to  reach a final idea about it by the end of this year."    Al-Mid'ij commented on a KUNA question about the resentment  of South Korean oil-consuming companies from a Kuwaiti demand to  increase the prices by $2 per tonne for the contracts of the  second part of 1994. He said the issue of prices was among the  issues open for discussion in connection with any commodity and  at any time "as long as we have not violated the condition if  there was an agreement between us and any other side. It is our  right to offer our commodity at the price we think suitable, and  it is the right of any side to buy or refrain from buying this  commodity."    He pointed out that "for us, the issue of prices should not  be interpreted on the basis of making it impossible and  difficult for them, because this is a commodity on offer, and  when we are convinced that this is [indistinct word] and this is  its cost [indistinct words]."    In the course of his statement, he pointed out that the  level  of (?oil) stockpile in the industrial countries has started to  decrease in an usual manner, a matter that would lead to  increases in oil prices.    Al-Mid'ij stressed that if the technical and political  situation of oil continued until next December, there would be  an increase [indistinct word] in oil prices estimated by two  dollars. [passage omitted]    He dealt with the penalties which any of the OPEC member  countries could face if they did not adhere to their quotas. He  pointed out that this would take the form of sending messages to  the countries violating this agreement, in addition to  subjecting their oil quotas to deductions in the near future.</p>

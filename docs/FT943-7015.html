			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Sandvik acquires over 50 percent of MKTS shares Sandvik said yesterday it had acquired more than 50 per cent of the shares in Russia's largest cemented carbide company, Moskovskij Kombinat Tverdih Splavov (MKTS), writes Christopher Brown-Humes. The move, which builds on a 20-year co-operation between the two companies, is designed to boost Sandvik in an important market, said Mr Clas Ake Hedstrom, chief executive. He said: 'Russian industry, as well as industry in the other countries of central and eastern Europe, is on the verge of a comprehensive modernisation of metal-cutting machining.' The group intends to increase its ownership stake further. Moscow-based MKTS has 1,200 employees and annual sales of SKr200m (Dollars 26.33m) spread throughout the Commonwealth of Independent States. It manufactures and markets cemented carbide for machining tools, rock-drilling tips and wear parts.</p>

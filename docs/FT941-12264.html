			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: A period of consolidation in prospect This morning sees the start of a new two-week trading account on the London market and if some of the signals being transmitted by the market in recent days are to be believed, could herald a period of consolidation. Share prices are viewed by many observers as beginning to show signs of running out of steam. Turnover levels began to subside last week, compared with the virtually record levels achieved the previous week. Many old market hands said they had carried out more customer business during that five-day period than ever before. The Stock Exchange confirmed that recent activity approached all-time records. So a tapering off of turnover levels would seem to indicate that the big UK and international funds may have, for the time being at least, carried out much of their new year reshuffling of portfolios. Another potential indicator that the market may have topped out is the ratio of call/put activity on the FT-SE Option which, according to Smith New Court, the securities house, has seen call volumes rise sharply since the November budget, while put volumes have declined. Sentiment, says Smith, has swung from extreme pessimism in October/November to the unusually optimistic; 'This suggests that we should not be expecting a big move up in stock prices just yet, since everyone is already a bull.' International influences have also been at work; worries about the German economy have been translated into a weak Bund market, which translates into a weak gilts market and in turn into weak UK equities. While adopting a more cautious view of UK equities, most strategists do not foresee a great downwards correction in the market, where there remains substantial underlying support. But the view of the head of trading at one of the leading UK integrated securities houses is that share prices are in for a period of consolidation. February is viewed as a crucial month for the market as the results season gets fully under way. Any significant disappointments in profits and dividends will have a substantial impact on sentiment. The spectre of some large-scale fundraising via rights issues accompanying the results flow in February, should also be borne in mind. NatWest Securities has forecast Pounds 8bn-worth of rights issues this year to take advantage of high ratings and liquidity in the equity market, compared with the Pounds 11.3bn total for 1993. The broker says this total will be easily swallowed by the cash-rich institutions and will have little effect on the overall market. One area which could provide fresh upside impetus in share prices could be in the takeover arena, virtually bereft for many months. In recent weeks the electronics and composite insurance sectors have been alive with talk of imminent bids. The two-week trading account brings results from two of the market's top five stocks, BT and BP. Any disappointments and the market will be unforgiving.</p>

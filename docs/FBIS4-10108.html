			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Wilfer Pulgarin] </F>   [Text] Defense Minister General Rafael Montero Revette  defended the appointment of his predecessor, Vice Admiral  Radames Munoz Leon, as adviser for Venezuelan military purchases  in the United States. At the same time, Montero reported that  said appointment has the president of the Republic's blessing.    Montero Revette had avoided making statements on the matter  on Tuesday. But, speaking this Wednesday at the Miraflores  presidential palace, he made extensive comments on this matter  at the conclusion of a regular Council of Ministers meeting.    The defense minister justified that appointment of Munoz  Leon, recalling the admiral's military career, indicating that  he came to this position without having missing one promotion:  "He held the post of chief of the Navy's staff, chairman of the  joint chiefs of staff, and he was defense minister; therefore he  has enough experience in the military field."    Montero added: "He was going to be living in the United  States anyway on his own account. I asked him to be an ad  honorem adviser; he will not draw a salary. He will advise, on  an ad honorem basis, four departments that we have in the United  States on military purchases. He has a great deal of experience  in the military field, and he can advise us because he knows all  of the organization's problems."  <H5>  Questions for the Minister </H5>   Reporters asked the minister several questions.    [Reporter] Is there no one else with the same knowledge in  the military field?    [Montero] I would like to know if there is. Previously, when  he was defense minister, even before he was defense minister,  hardly anyone ever questioned him. Maybe he was questioned about  some things he said during his seven-month tenure, but Munoz  Leon's military career cannot be criticized. Besides this is an  ad honorem post.    [Reporter] Why was he given a diplomatic passport?    [Montero] He was given a diplomatic passport because the  Defense asked for one.    [Reporter] Where in the United States will he live?    [Montero] I do not know exactly where.    [Reporter] It is not clear why he has a diplomatic passport  if he is not a member of the Venezuelan diplomatic corps in the  United States.    [Montero] He is a member of the diplomatic corps in the  United States because he has an ad honorem post as a Defense  Ministry adviser in military organizations through which we  trade with the United States.    [Reporter] Are there other advisers with diplomatic  passports?    [Montes] No, we have not issued any during my tenure. I do  not know if other ministries have done so.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister: The Foreign Service law establishes  that the members of a diplomatic mission, in order to perform  their duties, are accredited by one nation to the other. If  Admiral Munoz Leon is an ad honorem adviser and not a  representative of a mission, why is he then issued a diplomatic  passport?    [Montes] You could say that he is an ad honorem adviser  because he will not draw a salary. Nevertheless, I do need him,  with his contacts--he even took the Inter-American Defense  course--to give us a lot of advice because he knows about the  problems. It is easier for him to travel to Venezuela to report  to me on what is going on over there than to have officials from  there come back here.    [Reporter] Is he going to be a member of the diplomatic  mission?    [Montes] He is a member of the diplomatic mission.    [Reporter] Excuse me, Mr. Minister, he has said that a split  had occurred in the FAN [National Armed Forces] over the  president's decision not to appoint him defense minister. How  could this appointment possibly have occurred?    [Montes] Look here, listen to the following; I am going to  repeat myself. Maybe--you know him--he made this remark on the  spur of the moment because he was not appointed defense  minister. It is not that he was not appointed; he was not  reconfirmed. I spoke to him subsequently on several occasions.  He is aware that what he said was a rash reaction, but he does  have position within the military. He is an officer with almost  30 years of experience. He knows the organization, he knows the  organization's problems, he has run the organization. Therefore,  I appointed him, having taken this into account.    [Reporter] Former Commander Chavez confirmed MAS [Movement  Toward Socialism] and Radical Cause's charges about the defense  minister's alleged plan to stage a coup. Doesn't this contradict  the appointment somewhat?    [Montes] When anyone here attacks a military man, they  accuse  him of planning a coup. If Commander Chavez, who was detained,  has hard evidence that a coup was being planned, let him present  the evidence to the court. It is very easy to talk. I want  evidence because I am not going to fall into the trap of  believing everything that many people like to say, just to talk.  Gentlemen, evidence must be presented.    [Reporter] Does the appointment have the president of the  Republic's blessing?    [Montes] Of course it does. I must submit every appointment  to the president of the Republic for approvel. I requested this  appointment.  <H5>  No Millions To Equip the Fan </H5>   Meanwhile, the defense minister denied information to the  effect that in going over the accounts with the president, he  asked that 86 billion bolivares be earmarked for the FAN's  equipment.    It was also reported that all the officers who returned from  Peru had decided to accept a court martial.    Montes also said he will not get involved in "tit-for-tat  bickering" with former Commander Chavez Frias, although he said  it is wrong to think, as the coup leader said, that armed  struggle is a valid means of attaining power.    He noted: The nation wants peace, tranquillity, and  progress.    As far as patrolling the Gulf of Venezuela--reported by his  colleague Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas--he said the physical  presence that has always existed will be reinforced in a more  organized fashion.</p>

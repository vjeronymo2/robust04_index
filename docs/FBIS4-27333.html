			<p>BFN     [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which had boasted  of its cohesiveness, is now in disarray after former Economic  Planning Agency Director General Koichiro Aino, who as director  of the Committee on Rules and Administration of the House of  Representatives, on 19 May criticized Shinseito Secretary  General Ichiro Ozawa in his article in a weekly journal; the  "Cold War" relationship between Keiwa Okuda, chairman of the  Committee on Rules and Administration of the House of  Representatives, and Mr. Ozawa has surfaced. Other parties have  continued their criticism of "the relationship between Ozawa and  Yuichi Ichikawa" who is secretary general of the Komeito [Clean  Government Party], and now some Shinseito members are  criticizing Ozawa as "too self-righteous."  <H5>  Uproar Over Dismissal </H5>   Hajime Funada, secretary in charge of policy affairs for  Shinseito, notified Aino of his dismissal as director of the  Committee on Rules and Administration. His dismissal, however,  was decided as part of a series of shakeups in Shinseito two  weeks ago. Mr. Ozawa was discontent with the way that both Okuda  and Aino, who attached importance to cooperation with opposition  parties, ran the Diet. Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general  of Shinseito, did not notify Okuda of Aino's dismissal out of  consideration for Okuda. Kozo Watanabe did not let Okuda know  about the dismissal of Aino, who is known to have been "Mr.  Okuda's protege for 17 years," for fear of intensifying the  rivalry between Ozawa and Okuda.    In his article in the weekly journal, Aino accused Ozawa of  forming the parliamentary group "Kaishin" and claimed that its  formation was "Mr. Ozawa's mistake" that resulted in the  minority government. Aino, who is strongly reacting against his  dismissal, is claiming Ozawa dismissed him in retaliation for  his criticism of Ozawa. Aino is increasingly making critical  comments about Ozawa, saying: "It is not permissible to send Mr.  Funada to me to notify me of my dismissal. Mr. Funada was a  junior legislator just like my younger brother when we belonged  to the Takeshita faction." Junior legislators in Shinseito are  siding with Aino, asking, "What is wrong with speaking of Mr.  Ozawa's mistake?"  Party Reform [subhead]    Shinseito was been able to overcome the crisis arising from  Aino's dismissal after Kozo Watanabe and Toshihiro Nikkai,  secretary in charge of general affairs, succeeded in calming  Okuda. Aino nonetheless is stressing the need to reform the way  that Shinseito is run under Mr. Ozawa's top-down style, saying,  "It is necessary to promote intraparty communication." Some  junior lawmakers are arguing: "The secretary general of our  party holds the exclusive right to manage our party's personnel  affairs. If our party were run by a bottom-up style, it would be  unable to deal with this uncertain political situation."  Explaining what Ozawa thinks, a senior lawmaker in Shinseito  says: "Mr. Ozawa has always made decisions with all things taken  into consideration. He has managed our party's personnel affairs  with potential media criticism taken into account. It is  regrettable that nobody understands the way he gets things done."    A senior legislator in Shinseito says, "We support Mr. 's  reformist policies, but all things have not gone the way Mr.  Ozawa hoped." Whether or not Ozawa is able to reform Shinseito  while listening to intraparty opinions is likely to determine  the future of Shinseito.</p>

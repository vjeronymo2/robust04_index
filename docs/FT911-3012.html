			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7): It may be time for a fixed-interest mortgage - In the High Street / Look for a loan at 11% cent or less, over three to five years IS THIS the time to be going for a fixed-rate mortgage? Yes, say an increasing number of mortgage specialists. They believe that interest rates will soon bottom out, and that there is no likelihood of a return to the sort of interest rates seen in 1988. 'The underlying rate of inflation in the UK suggests to me that mortgage rates will climb back above the 12 per cent level not long after the next election,' says one foreign lender in London. 'This means that the current generation of fixed mortgages is close to being as low as they are likely to get.' Mortgage brokers report that fixed-rate and capped-rate mortgages make up most of the business they are doing at the moment. Bargain offers go fast when they appear on the market. A mortgage from Portman Building Society, with interest of 11 per cent fixed for two years, was sold out in five days this spring. More typical is a three-year fixed-rate mortgage at 11.75 per cent (APR 12.59 per cent) from Scarborough Building Society, available until the end of April or a two- or three-year fix at 11.45 per cent from Girobank. The sort of mortgage to look out for in the months ahead is one with an interest rate of 11 per cent or less for an extended period, three to five years. They may not compare very favourably with the sort of mortgages on offer in the spring of 1988, but they are probably all that can reasonably be expected from the UK market in the foreseeable future. If you contemplate switching to a fixed mortgage, ask what the annual percentage rate is - on the Girobank mortgage quoted above it was 14.6 per cent, for example. Also enquire what hidden or additional charges there may be; and whether there are substantial early-redemption penalties if you repay the mortgage early. Most reputable lenders will not make you pay redemption penalties if you stay with them when moving house and getting a new mortgage. But some have been making good money in a difficult market over the last few years by stinging their other customers for early-redemption penalties averaging around three months interest. The justification for this is that lenders are committed to funding at a pre-agreed price for the life of a fixed-rate mortgage, and that if the customer redeems early because interest rates have fallen, the lender may be left with expensive funds on its hands. This month John Charcol, the mortgage brokers, put a two-year fixed-rate mortgage on the market at 11.75 per cent (12.6 APR) which is especially flexible: not only can it be a repayment or an interest-only mortgage, as well as one of the endowment variety, but it has no redemption penalties, though there is a Pounds 195 administration charge on completion of the mortgage. Ian Darby, John Charcol's managing director, points out that 11.75 per cent is well below the average mortgage interest rate of the last 10 years. Some home-buyers will hold on until election time - when we may expect base rates to fall. But it is wise to remember that lenders are already able to tap the advantages of expected future base-rate falls and offer them to their customers through fixed-rate and capped mortgages. If you are planning to make a move in the mortgage market and wait too long, you could find you have left it too late. Paying off the mortgage? - page 10</p>

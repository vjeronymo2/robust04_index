			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: ACT shares fall 33p on warning Shares in ACT Group, the Birmingham-based computing services company, fell by almost 20 per cent yesterday after the group warned that trading this year would be adversely affected by the restructuring of its financial products division and increased product development expenditure. The shares closed 33p lower at 136p even though ACT, which has reorganised its operations substantially over the past five years, also announced a 39 per cent increase in pre-tax profits. They rose, in line with forecasts, from Pounds 20.5m to Pounds 28.5m during the year to March 31. Mr Roger Foster, chairman, said trading would be affected, mainly in the UK, by the decision to integrate its three financial software operations from April 1 in order to consolidate the worldwide sales operations, maximise the long-term synergy benefits and ensure a clear focus for the group's development effort. In addition, he said the group was planning to spend 13 per cent of its revenue on product development this year, a Pounds 3m planned increase on previous years. A large part of this expenditure would be used to invest in banking software and a new version of the group's Quasar investment management product. The pre-tax line was struck on turnover up 64 per cent to Pounds 250.6m (Pounds 152.9m). Acquisitions, including the BIS Group which was bought for Pounds 93.5m in July last year, contributed Pounds 73.4m while discontinued non-core operations accounted for Pounds 61.4m (Pounds 46.5m) of the total. Operating profits, including a Pounds 9.96m contribution from acquisitions, increased by 51 per cent to Pounds 28.7m (Pounds 19.1m). Three discontinued businesses, which were sold generating cash proceeds of Pounds 28m, contributed profits of Pounds 4.61m (Pounds 5.53m). The disposals marked the end of ACT's hardware related activities and completed its transition to a highly focused financial software products business - the group's financial software products division now accounts for 72 per cent of group turnover and 96 per cent of trading profits from continuing activities. The pre-tax result was after net interest costs of Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 1.4m receipts). Earnings per share increased by 14 per cent to 12.15p (10.63p) and a final dividend of 3.5p is proposed making a total for the year of 5.25p (5p). COMMENT Despite the market's reaction yesterday to the surprise profits warning ACT's management deserves credit for transforming the group in recent years. ACT is now firmly established as one of the 20 largest software vendors in the world and its particular niche - financial software - is one of the fastest growing market segments. Forecasts for pre-tax profits this year were downgraded by about Pounds 7m to Pounds 27m because of yesterday's warning. But this would still give earnings of 10.5p which puts the shares on a prospective p/e of just under 13. Given the longer-term prospects, the shares are cheap.</p>

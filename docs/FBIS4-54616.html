			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 2 (CTK) -- The economy ministers  consider that the gradual reconstruction of the V-1 unit of the  nuclear power plant in Jaslovske Bohunice, west Slovakia, can be  carried out so that it will not close until after the year 2002,  announced Economy Minister Peter Magvasi. "The decision comes  from the recommendation of the International Agency for Atomic  Energy (MAAE) [IAEA], which rates highly the technical state of  the V-1 reactor in Bohunice. The agency recommended such action  as would allow for V-1 to operate until the year 2002," he said,  adding however that the cabinet had yet to decide the issue.  Earlier it was said that if not reconstructed, the plant would  have to close down in 1995. A Franco-German consortium and the  EBRD are making the provision of a 1.3-billion mark loan for the  uncompleted nuclear energy plant at Mochovce, west Slovakia,  conditional on the closure of the V-1 plant.</p>

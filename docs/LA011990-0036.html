			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Mural Wins Approval: The board of the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment  Agency voted unanimously Thursday morning to allow the Museum of Contemporary  Art to go ahead with a plan to install a 218-foot-long mural on a wall of the  Temporary Contemporary in Little Tokyo. The mural, designed by the noted artist  Barbara Kruger, has a red, white and blue flag-like design emblazoned with a  series of politically provocative questions. Plans to create the mural were  stalled last year when some Little Tokyo residents and organizations objected  to an original design that included the wording of the Pledge of Allegiance in  the work.

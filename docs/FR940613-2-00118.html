Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to gain greater insight into the vacancy problems of the PHAs required to participate in the Vacancy Reduction Program, the Department sent a survey form on April 2, 1993, to all PHAs that, based on HUD data bases, were troubled or mod-troubled on January 1, 1993, or had a vacancy rate that exceeded 15.9% on that date. Of the 400 identified PHAs, 345 responded to the survey. These PHAs reported a total of 56,324 vacancies, about half of the total vacancies nationally. The responses showed that additional funding was necessary to cure only half of the vacancies in the inventories of the responding PHAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of those vacant units whose occupancy was not dependent upon additional funding, the reasons for and percentages of the total vacancies were as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ready, awaiting leasing_5.7%;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;No demand (defined as few or no persons on the waiting list)_3.5%;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Undesirable (defined as requiring 4 or more offers to obtain a tenant, but not requiring funding)_2.0%;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Funded under a modernization program_29.7%;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In litigation_6.5%; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Other reason not requiring funding_3.2%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of those units in which vacancies could be eliminated with additional funding, the reasons for and percentages of the vacancies were as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Awaiting demolition_5.4%;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Needing modernization_30.0%;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Needing repair_12.8%; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Other reason requiring funding_1.1%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the vacant units that would benefit from additional funding, the estimated costs of rehabilitation (exclusive of any costs for lead-based paint testing and abatement) and percentage of total vacancies were as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Up to $5,000_4.8%;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Familiar theme launches Bush's re-election bid PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday officially launched his bid for re-election and moved to counter his main rival from the Republican party. Asking for four more years to complete the job he took over in 1989, he told an invited audience of supporters in Washington: 'I came here to do important work and I finish what I start.' As he set about trying to restore his electoral fortunes, the president said his message had not changed since he became vice-president in 1981. 'I believe government is too big and it costs too much, and I believe in a strong defence for this country, good schools, safe streets, a government really worthy of the people,' he said. The president's candidacy has been no secret. He has already raised more than Dollars 11m (Pounds 6.1m) in campaign funds, and his name is on primary ballots in 26 states. But yesterday's declaration was more than a formality. It reflected a change of gear by Mr Bush, who just weeks ago had expected to cruise triumphantly through next Tuesday's New Hampshire primary. He is now seeking to restore his fortunes in the recession-battered north-eastern state. At the start of this year, Mr Bush's campaign managers ex-pected to leave most of the New Hampshire campaigning to Mr Dan Quayle, vice-president, and other members of the Bush cabinet. Faced with the prospect of a large protest vote for the right-wing commentator Mr Patrick Buchanan, this programme has been beefed up with presidential visits yesterday and this weekend and radio and television interviews. Mr Bush criticised the isolationist views of Mr Buchanan who different polls give between 22 per cent and 28 per cent of the vote. This is not enough for the Bush campaign to be unsettled seriously. Some Republicans are worried, however, by the appearance in some opinion polls of Mr Jim Lennane, a Republican businessman who founded a computer company in California. They fear he could prove a more palatable alternative for voters who find Mr Buchanan's hanging-and-flogging rhetoric too strident and so further erode Mr Bush's vote. Mr Buchanan is thought to be unlikely to do enough damage to Mr Bush to force him to withdraw as Senator Eugene McCarthy did to President Lyndon Johnson in 1968. However, Mr Bush's political strategists want to eliminate Mr Buchanan from the primaries as soon as possible. If the Buchanan campaign stays alive until June it could force Mr Bush to adopt a more right-wing stance than he would like in California, the most populous state and one of the last to hold a primary. In turn, this could complicate the president's campaign strategy in the November general election, when some politicians believe the Democrats could win California for the first time since 1964.

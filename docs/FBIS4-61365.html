			<p>BFN     [Text] Kazan, April 30, RIA -- According to Tatarstan  President Mintimer Shaymiyev, he had negotiated with Russian  President Boris Yeltsin after signing the public-accord  agreement in the Kremlin. the two leaders had discussed ways of  making the Russian-Tatarstan treaty more effective.    A high-brow board is to examine compliance with specific  bilateral contractual commitments, Shaymiyev went on to say.    Yeltsin and I had talked about greater Tartar economic  independence within the framework of the agreements signed, the  republic's president added.    The republic gets much more from the federal budget than it  deducts into it, Shaymiyev pointed out, adding that it had  received a 60-billion rouble credit for the spring-time sowing  campaign, deducting about 6 billion roubles into the Russian  budget.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Clinton's Visit To Italy"] </F>   [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton, Thursday midnight, 2  June, arrived in Rome to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the  D-Day, the allied forces' landing in the Normandy during the  second world war. The trip to Rome is the first phase of the  U.S. President's one-week tour of Europe.    During his symbolic stay in Italy he is due to meet with the  Italian leaders, including Prime Minister Berlusconi and Pope  John Paul II, the leader of the world's Catholics, in Vatican.  Informed politicians say Clinton is considering two issue in  the visit. One is to establish closer economic and political  relations with the present rulers in Italy. And the other is to  reinforce the significance of the American role in the existence  of contemporary Europe as well as propagating U.S. capability in  aiding the European countries in solving their problems.    Informed politicians believe that at the time when the  presence of neofascists in the Italian cabinet has caused  worries, the U.S. is trying to persuade the EU [European Union]  members, excluding Italy, that it would be able to control Italy  and keep away the danger of neofascists. This way, giving a  bigger role to America in Europe will be propagated.    After the end of the cold war era, with the potential danger  of Soviet Union dying away, the EU member states, especially  France and Germany, have regulated the policies based on the  expansion of economic and trade cooperation among the European  states. They have, however, paid little attention to the  interests of the countries on the other side of the Atlantic.  It seems that the continuation of such policies will undermine  the role of the U.S. in dealing with the issue.    Presently the U.S. is involved in a trade war with Japan and  to isolate that country the U.S. seriously needs the backing of  the European countries. In fact another objective of Clinton's  visit to Rome, and later on to London and Paris, is to bring  about coordination among the Group-7 states. But whether  Clinton would be able to have the support of the European  countries of Group-7 to confront the trade policies of Japan  will depend on the outcome of his meetings with the leaders of  France and Britain.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRANDO'S RELEASE ON BAIL DELAYED BY LOST  PASSPORT  </P> <P> Actor Marlon Brando's son, Christian, facing trial in the slaying of his  half-sister's boyfriend, will remain jailed until his passport can be found and  surrendered to authorities, his lawyer said Wednesday.  </P> <P> A judge on Tuesday set Brando's bail at $10 million, with the condition that he  give up his passport to help ensure that he does not flee to avoid prosecution.  </P> <P> Brando's family has the option of posting the bond -- believed the highest  amount in Los Angeles County history -- in either cash, property or a  combination.  </P> <P> But Robert Shapiro, Christian's lawyer, said he and the family have been unable  to locate Brando's passport and that Brando will remain in jail "until we find  it."  </P> <P> Brando, 32, a welder, is next scheduled to appear in Superior Court in Santa  Monica Aug. 7 to enter a plea to charges that he murdered Dag Drollet, 26, the  Tahitian boyfriend of Cheyenne Brando and father of her child, born in June.  </P></p>

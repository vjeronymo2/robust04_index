			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. ALLEGES MOB CONTROLS CASINO UNION;  </P> <P> CRIME: THE BRUNO-SCARFO FAMILY HAS USED KILLING AND EXTORTION TO CONTROL THE  ATLANTIC CITY LOCAL, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS.  </P> <P> A union representing Atlantic City casino workers is controlled through mob  killing, extortion, embezzlement and bribery, the Justice Department said in  court papers filed today.  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said at a morning news conference that the  local has been controlled for 20 years by the Bruno-Scarfo organized-crime  family, which controls Philadelphia and southern New Jersey.  </P> <P> "Through their brutal and often deadly acts of violence and intimidation,  members of the Bruno-Scarfo families have destroyed the integrity of the union  and its leadership," Thornburgh said.  </P> <P> Nicodemo (Little Nicky) Scarfo has been controlling the local from prison,  where he is serving a life sentence for his 1988 conviction on Racketeer  Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act charges, according to the complaint.  </P> <P> In a suit filed in U.S. District Court, the Justice Department is seeking to  take control under civil racketeering statutes of the 22,000-member Local 54 of  the Hotel Employees Restaurant Employees International Union. The local  represents hotel, bar and restaurant workers in Atlantic City casinos and in  other southern New Jersey cities.  </P> <P> The suit seeks court-ordered control of the local, the restriction of the  union's international president from the local's affairs, the removal of the  local's president and five other officials and the forfeiture of illegally  obtained profits.  </P> <P> Also named was Edward Hanley, president of the Washington-based international  since 1973. The suit said he was an associate of senior members of the  Chicago-based organized-crime family.  </P> <P> Citing alleged dealings with organized-crime figures in New Jersey, New York  and Las Vegas, prosecutors are seeking to bar Hanley from further association  with Local 54.  </P> <P> Thornburgh said the organized-crime families earned perhaps hundreds of  thousands of dollars through sweetheart contracts and kickbacks.  </P></p>

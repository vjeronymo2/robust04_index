			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Russia and Baltics set up own bank system THE Russian Federation is setting up an alternative banking system with the Baltic republics in an attempt to replace the edict of the Soviet central bank. Mr Georgy Matyukhin, the chairman of the Russian central bank, said in an interview with the weekly Rossiskaya Gazeta yesterday that the Soviet central bank had to be dissolved. He invited other republics to join with the Russian bank, and the banks of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, in developing the alternative council of republican banks. His comments come at a time when Mr Victor Geraschenko, the Soviet state bank chairman, has won government backing for his call for tighter control over the republican banks. Hitherto, they had functioned merely as local branches of the Soviet state bank. Mr Matyukhin said the Russian government would soon pass a law prohibiting the 'confiscation' of foreign currency earnings from enterprises and banks on Russian territory - the main source of the union government's hard currency earnings. Such a law would run counter to the government's anti-crisis plan, which explicitly foreshadows harsh measures against republican institutions which withhold funds from the centre. The buying and selling of hard currency by Russian enterprises and citizens will be permitted under a further law, Mr Matyukhin said. 'This will help introduce partial convertibility of the rouble. Foreign currency regulation on the territory is an inseparable part of Russia's sovereignty'. 'Accounting centres' were being established in Russian cities, he said, which brought together commercial and savings banks and insurance offices. 'The successful functioning of the banking system will depend on them. The money flow will be horizontal between them, not vertical between each of them and the centre.' Mr Matyukhin said control of the new commercial banks by the central banks would be on the western model, and a law would be adopted to reflect the new conditions. 'We are studying American, British and German experience in this field. Supervision should not be perceived primitively. We are not going to breathe down their necks and shuffle their papers'.</p>

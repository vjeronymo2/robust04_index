			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Managers in scramble to minimise risk AS STERLING sank further yesterday, foreign exchange dealers were not the only professionals active in the market. Fund managers and corporate treasurers with exposure to sterling have had a busy couple of days. 'It was a case of trying to minimise the risk in a portfolio,' said Mr Terence Prideaux of Kemper Investment Management, a US investment house. 'Given the size of the currency flows, any prudent investment manager would have had to explore the question of currency exposure.' Another fund manager, who said he had taken a position against sterling 'at the margin' to protect a portfolio already heavily weighted against the pound, said: 'You knew, as soon as 15 per cent interest rates were announced, that it wasn't sustainable. It was just a non-starter.' Dealers said that there was activity from a wide range of fund managers, with Swiss and US managers particularly quick off the mark. While some fund managers moved assets between markets, others tried to hedge currency exposure within their existing portfolios. 'The main focus was hedging currencies against the D-Mark,' said Mr Axel Benkner of DWS, the German fund management group. Corporate treasurers, while still assessing the long-term effects of recent events on their businesses, were also active in moving against potential short-term exposure in recent days. 'There has been a fair amount of activity' among corporate treasurers, said Mr Tony Rice, group treasurer at British Aerospace. 'Those of us with dollar exposure have had to sit on our hands for a while. Today was an opportunity to put cover in place at much lower rates.' However, a number of fund managers and corporate treasurers complained that the volatile market conditions eroded liquidity, just when they most needed to get their business done. 'The problem we were up against is that in times of such uncertainty banks are unwilling to commit themselves in the forward market,' he said. 'This morning the long-dated forward foreign exchange market disappeared and the sterling swaps market was gone for several hours.' Even in the spot foreign exchange market - the world's most liquid market, trading became more difficult, as the margin between buy and sell prices on the dollar/ sterling rate, normally between 3 basis points and 10 basis points, went up to 50 basis points. In those conditions, some treasurers decided that discretion was the better part of valour. 'We were reluctant to deal in a disorderly market,' said one corporate treasurer at a UK company, 'so we decided to stay on the sidelines until things calmed down.' Corporate treasurers and fund managers often hedge exposure in the options market. However, the recent level of volatility - and growing demand as sterling came under increasing pressure in recent weeks - pushed prices up to extremely high levels, which makes it uneconomical to hedge using options. Instead, activity has been concentrated in the forward foreign exchange market and even in the spot market, contributing to the pressure against the pound. The surge of volume in the foreign exchange market, coupled with the widening of spreads (essentially, the fees charged by banks) will substantially have boosted trading profits at banks. But the biggest source of profits for foreign exchange traders, at least on Wednesday, was that, in spite of tumultuous market conditions, they found themselves with a one-way bet, as the Bank of England proved an unlimited buyer of sterling throughout the day. Total central bank intervention on Wednesday alone may have topped Pounds 20bn. A senior executive in one of London's moneybroking firms, which are reckoned to handle around 40 per cent of foreign exchange business on a typical day, said that the leading broking firms alone had handled more than Pounds 10bn of sterling purchases by the Bank of England on that day. As the Bank intervened in the market, offering to buy sterling in minimum amounts of Pounds 30m - compared to a normal market size of Pounds 5m-Pounds 10m - it found a succession of banks and corporate treasurers willing to sell. 'Every bank around the world had taken a position against sterling,' the broker said.</p>

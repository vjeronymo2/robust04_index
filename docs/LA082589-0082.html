			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> DELAY URGED IN ASSIGNED RISK CAR POLICY RATE  </P> <P> Staff attorneys of the state Insurance Department urged Thursday that a  proposed 112.3% average increase in auto insurance rates for more than a  million drivers insured under California's assigned risk plan be indefinitely  delayed pending a restructuring of the plan to include a special rate for  low-income drivers.  </P> <P> The call for delay in implementing even part of the increase came after  representatives of a coalition of 15 minority groups testified at a Los Angeles  hearing that, if it were adopted, rates as high as $2,187 a year for minimum  liability insurance in south, east and central areas of Los Angeles could  require many families to pay more for insurance than they do for food. The  statewide average rate would be about $1,500.  </P> <P> Such "exorbitant" charges would force as many as 400,000 people to drop their  insurance and run the risk of a jail term if they later had their licenses  suspended for failure to comply with the state's mandatory insurance law and  still continued to drive, said Robert Gnaizda of Public Advocates Inc.,  representing the minority coalition.  </P> <P> Insurance Department attorney Judith Mulroy said the department staff concurs  with the minority coalition that implementing such a high rate would defeat the  original purpose of the California Assigned Risk Plan, which is to serve as an  insurer of last resort for those who cannot find coverage elsewhere. She said  it would drive the cost of such coverage beyond the reach of many.  </P> <P> Mulroy assailed the Assigned Risk Governing Board, a group made up mostly of  insurance company executives that administers the plan, for failing to come up  with any creative solutions to deal with this problem.  </P> <P> She suggested that a low-lifeline rate be established, similar to that in  telephone service. Unless such "fundamental changes" are instituted, she said,  "a doubling of the rates is not justified."  </P> <P> Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, who was present at the hearing, did  not directly react to the staff suggestion. In an opening series of comments,  the commissioner said the assigned risk system is "riddled with problems" that  the governing board has done nothing about. "No one is at the helm of the  plan," she said.  </P> <P> But at the same time, she said, she feels obligated to represent the majority  of the state's policyholders, who through their regular policies are paying now  to subsidize losses in the assigned risk plan. Attorneys for the insurers  suggested Thursday that this subsidy may run as high as $75 per car this year.  </P> <P> Under the assigned risk system, insurers doing business in California are  required to accept a quota of drivers who either cannot get insurance or who  choose not to buy regular coverage. The quotas are linked to how much auto  insurance business each company does in the state. If the companies lose money  on these policies, then their other customers may be required to pay higher  premiums to pay for the losses.  </P> <P> The insurers' attorneys claimed Thursday that the statewide deficit on assigned  risk coverage will amount to $600 million in 1989.  </P> <P> For several years, Gillespie, aware that pushing assigned risk rates too high  would cause many motorists to do without insurance, has been holding these  rates down in the urban areas. In Los Angeles, the result has been that  assigned risk coverage is often less expensive than regular coverage. Gillespie  has routinely cut way back on rate increase requests, and in the present case,  delayed even hearing the request for more than six months.  </P> <P> All this has led both to a swelling of the numbers of assigned risk customers  and of the insurers' claimed losses on such customers. Meanwhile, a whole  industry of brokerage firms that sell only assigned risk policies has been  spawned. There have been allegations also of rampant fraud in assigned risk  claims.  </P> <P> Both Gillespie and Gnaizda, the minority coalition attorney, accused the  Assigned Risk Governing Board on Thursday of putting in for its 112% average  rate increase (it would be 137% in Central Los Angeles) without any regard for  the social ramifications. But Gnaizda put it more dramatically than Gillespie.  </P> <P> "This proposal comes from archaic actuarial charts, not from human hearts,"  Gnaizda stated. "It is callously and socially irresponsible. It will wreak  human havoc."  </P> <P> And, he went on, the worst is yet to come. If actuarial projections are borne  out, the insurers will be asking permission to charge $6,000 a year to Central  Los Angeles drivers by 1994 and $16,000 by 1999, he declared.  </P> <P> If even the current rate increase is granted, "you will face a public revolt  that will make Propositions 103 and 13 pale by comparison," Gnaizda told the  hearing. Proposition 103 was the landmark insurance initiative approved by the  electorate last November. Proposition 13, the Jarvis property tax cut, was  approved in 1978.  </P> <P> "Just say no," Gnaizda urged Gillespie.  </P> <P> The insurers' attorney, James R. Woods, by contrast, insisted that it is  against state law to do anything but make the plan self-sufficient. He said,  however, that the assigned risk board had held its rate increase request below  what is now needed to make that happen.  </P></p>

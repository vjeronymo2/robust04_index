			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / World Trade News: EU cautious on S Africa aid The European Union is on the brink of approving a package of trade benefits to South Africa which falls short of promises to offer generous support to the new post-apartheid regime headed by President Nelson Mandela. The niggardly offer stems from French-led efforts to protect the European market against potentially competitive South African products, particularly in the paper and agricultural sectors, according to British and German officials. A second factor appears to be concern that South African penetration of European markets may be at the cost of francophone Africa, as well as former Portuguese colonies in Mozambique and Angola. The EU-South Africa negotiations are seen as a test case because the new regime in Pretoria sees itself as the prototype of a new developing country eager to use trade rather than aid to reduce income disparities and compete in the world economy. Britain and Germany have successfully pressed France to be more forthcoming during negotiations on the trade package, which was promised before the first free elections in South Africa last May. French hesitation aroused resentment in Brussels because President Francois Mitterrand insisted on being the first European leader to visit Mr Mandela after his inauguration. Negotiations involve the EU giving South Africa access to its generalised system of preferences which grants tariff advantages to developing countries to help them export to the EU market. The first European Commission proposal on GSP was estimated to be worth Ecu260m (Dollars 317m). The GSP debate this week has been conducted at EU ambassadorial level in Brussels, with the central questions turning on which manufactured products should be included on a list eligible for GSP. Processed fruit, where South Africa has a distinct competitive advantage, is not on the list because of Mediterranean objections. Under a compromise, the EU is considering removing some sensitive products from the GSP list and subjecting them to a 'tariff free quota' as well as surveillance mechanisms. Among these are wood and furniture (Italy), metal furniture (Portugal), manganese oxide (Belgium) and paper (France). EU diplomats hope for a deal in the next week which could go into effect under a fast-track written procedure, without ministerial approval. But this requires unanimity. The present trade package is due to last until the new year, when member states are due to approve a revised GSP system which will encourage developing countries to improve labour and environmental standards. The next step will be to conclude a deal between South Africa and the EU which may include offering the Pretoria regime something like the Lome Convention, the privileged status accorded to former European colonies in Africa.</p>

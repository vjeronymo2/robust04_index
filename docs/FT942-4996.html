			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Girders fall back into place: Lionel Barber says Europe's rescue plan for the steel industry may be revived in a more acceptable form The European Commission must make up its mind tomorrow whether its rescue plan for the steel industry is dead, alive, or in suspended animation. Three weeks ago, the answer seemed clear. Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner and co-architect of the plan to cut surplus steel-making capacity, confessed to failure. 'We have fallen well short of our target,' he declared. 'The plan is dead.' Mr Van Miert's pronouncement spread confusion through Europe's steel industry. In spite of his outburst, the Commission has since worked hard to rebuild the shattered girders of its steel policy. For without a guiding hand from Brussels, officials believe the industry has few incentives to cut the EU's surplus of 19m-26m tonnes of steel products a year. Officials insist that the EU rescue plan is the best hope of preserving Brussels' controls on state aid. 'Without this political framework plan, we risk a free-for-all on state aid in a market which remains extremely fragile,' says one Commission steel expert. Inevitably, questions are being raised about Mr Van Miert and his motives for disavowing a plan with which he was intimately associated. The answers reveal much about the inner workings of the Commission as the 10-year reign of Mr Jacques Delors as president draws to a close. Mr Van Miert, a protege of Mr Delors, has tried every trick to cajole steel-makers into making cuts, but he has struggled to overcome the resistance of the state-owned and private sector, which can usually count on national governments for support: In Spain, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez extracted a high price for closing capacity in the volatile Basque region, winning approval from Brussels for the construction of a modern steel plant at Sestao. In Italy, a reluctance by the Commission to undermine a reform-minded government slowed down capacity cuts in 1993. Today, efforts to eliminate steel mills in the northern Bresciani region remain sensitive for the new Berlusconi government and its Northern League coalition partners. In Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has fought to protect the Ekostahl plant in former East Germany. In West Germany, the failure to close the loss-making Klockner works near Bremen last year was a hammer blow to the EU plan. In the more liberal camp, the UK and the Netherlands have remained sceptical about the effectiveness of the Commission's role, partly because information on closures and state aid from member states is inadequate. Private companies such as the British Steel Corporation insist that the Brussels plan is tilted in favour of the state-owned sector. This mutual suspicion formed the background to last December's meeting when EU industry ministers finally put their seal on a deal which offered a total of Ecus 7bn in subsidies to state-owned companies in Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal. The main quid pro quo was an agreement by the companies to close 5m tonnes of capacity, an end to state aid, and a new deadline of September 1994 for meeting the total 19m-tonne reduction in capacity. Somewhat ruefully, Mr Van Miert now admits that there was always an element of creative fiction and mutual bluff involved in the plan. Yet this was inevitable from the moment that the Commission stepped into the crisis. Both Mr Van Miert and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, have consciously adopted a different approach from the early 1980s when Brussels cast itself in the role of organising the steel market under the so-called 'Davignon plan'. The plan - named after Mr Etienne Davignon, then industry commissioner  - allowed Brussels to dictate individual company's production quotas, impose protectionist trade measures, and endorse subsidies and price cartels. This time, the Commission used a lighter touch. It offered market supervision through quarterly 'recommendations' for forward production and delivery volumes; but it encouraged privatisation to take out excess capacity. The aim was to balance state aid for restructuring with monitoring of plant closures. After a fashion, it worked. By spring this year, the Commission had notched up real and promised cuts totalling 11m tonnes. But in his search for the extra 8m tonnes, Mr Van Miert overstretched. The first signs of trouble appeared at a meeting in Strasbourg early last month when Mr Van Miert delivered an ultimatum to European steel industry bosses: failure to find the extra cuts would bury the rescue plan and terminate his role. Two weeks later, the Belgian commissioner put forward to a full Commission meeting new proposals for approving Ecus 415m of Italian state aid in return for the closure of capacity in the Brescia. There was one snag: no actual company would close, only a portion of the plants. Mr Van Miert pleaded for a flexible interpretation of rules on steel aid, noting that the amount of subsidies was modest compared to aid already authorised. But Sir Leon Brittan demolished his arguments, claiming the subsidies were legally dubious and undermined the EU position in negotiations with the US on a multilateral steel agreement. The meeting ended in disarray. Only four commissioners, including Mr Delors, stood by Mr Van Miert. It was the worst row inside the Commission since the 1991 bust-up over the US-EU Blair House accord on agricultural subsidies which ended with the (temporary) resignation of Mr Ray MacSharry, Irish agriculture commissioner. Mr Van Miert staged his own walk-out the next day, pinning the blame on Sir Leon and proclaiming the rescue plan dead and buried. He still rejects charges that he was bending the rules. 'It is totally unfair. I was asked to find a solution, and I can't see what I could have done otherwise.' In retrospect, several lessons can be drawn from the affair. Mr Van Miert admits he should have put more pressure on the steel industry to deliver cuts in capacity before he offered concessions such as pre-financing for closures. 'Van Miert is a socialist turned liberal,' agrees one observer. 'That does not make a good combination.' Second, many of the commissioners were caught unawares by Sir Leon's intervention, suggesting either a lack of homework or an unhealthy reliance on their own Cabinet staff who had backed the Van Miert plan overwhelmingly just two days before. Mr Bangemann's own involvement has been sporadic. He was in Estonia when the crucial Brescia vote took place in the Commission. Third, Mr Van Miert appears to have become obsessed with hitting the 19m-tonne target. 'He made it seem that the Commission was responsible for finding the cuts in capacity, rather than industry. That was a fatal mistake,' says one official. Fourth, the Commission may be underestimating the interest of steel companies themselves in finding market solutions to the crisis. A slowly recovering steel market coupled with new governments in France and Italy committed to privatisation may offer new possibilities, says one official. These possibilities could include new transnational alliances, with companies choosing to eliminate specific capacity in return for reciprocal equity stakes and investment. Arbed, the Luxembourg steel-maker, has led the way in Europe in cross-national joint ventures. Some believe that British Steel may pursue a similar approach, possibly in France. When the Commission revisits the steel crisis tomorrow, it seems likely that it will approve a repackaged version of the Van Miert plan. The onus in the new version will be on Berlusconi's new government in Italy to show that state aid to the Bresciani plants does not violate EU rules, and the blame for failure will be shifted to the industry rather than the Commission. So, the steel plan looks set for the greatest comeback since Lazarus. But it is far from clear whether it will meet Mr Van Miert's own demands for at least 'a minimum amount of political and intellectual coherence'. His vote will be worth watching.  -------------------------------------------------    EU STEEL INDUSTRY: RESCUE PLAN RESUSCITATED  ------------------------------------------------- Steel                                   tonnes  ------------------------------------------------- Total                                    170m capacity Express capacity                                  30m Target cuts                           19m-26m Cuts pledged or begin implemented         11m  -------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Motor World shares hit 275p Trading in Motor World Group, the car parts and accessories retailer, got off to a racing start yesterday when the shares jumped to 275p, a substantial premium to the 210p at which 45.3 per cent of the group's equity had been placed. Beeson Gregory, the stockbroker, placed 5.97m ordinary shares, valuing the group at Pounds 27.7m, but last night's close gave the group a market capitalisation of Pounds 36m. The shares started trading at 259p, and dealers said interest from private clients was behind the heavy turnover. Motor World now has 180 outlets.</p>

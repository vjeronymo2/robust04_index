			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SENATE REJECTS CHOICE OF CASON FOR NATURAL RESOURCES POSITION  </P> <P> The Senate today returned to the White House the nomination of James Cason for  a top natural resources job in the Agriculture Department, marking its first  rejection of a presidential appointment since John Tower was denied  confirmation as defense secretary.  </P> <P> "I can see the handwriting on the wall," Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas  said in asking that the Senate not act on the nomination.  </P> <P> Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), who led the opposition, said Cason would have  been defeated by a 20-vote margin, including more than five Republicans, if a  confirmation vote had been taken.  </P> <P> Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said he would strongly urge  President Bush not to resubmit Cason as a nominee or appoint him during the  congressional recess as a means of circumventing the confirmation process.  </P> <P> Cason, who has been a high-ranking official at the Interior Department since  1982, was nominated to be assistant secretary of agriculture for natural  resources and soil conservation.  </P> <P> Leahy and other opponents say his record at Interior shows a preference for  private development interests over environmental concerns.  </P> <P> Later, the White House said it has no intention of withdrawing the nomination.  </P></p>

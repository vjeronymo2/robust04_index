			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vika Uzdina: "Will New Revenues Compensate for </F> Expenditures?"]    [Text] In keeping with the prognosis of the receipt  of revenues into the municipal budget during the second quarter  of this year, it is suggested that only 50 percent of the costs  of the municipal economy be financed in May.    In May 97.1 billion rubles [R] will be spent on the needs of  the city. This was announced at yesterday's meeting of the St.  Petersburg Government by the chairman of the Committee on  Economics and Finance, Aleksey Kudrin.    In June the rough limit on financing for the distributors of  credit (committee chairmen, administration chiefs, local  administration heads, etc.) was set in the amount of R125.1  billion. This money is intended to fully satisfy the needs to  pay wages and to finance all the city's sociocultural expenses.    Aleksey Kudrin emphasized that the reduction of the volume  of  financing of the municipal economy was brought about by the  reduction of the revenue side of the budget. In the second  quarter of this year the projected revenues for the city budget  will be R3,535,205, which will in no way compensate for the  expenditures on maintaining the municipal economy. In all  probability certain programs for social protection of disabled  persons will be suspended in May (provision of transportation,  payment for gasoline, etc.). The reduction of financing for the  housing and municipal sphere will make it impossible to conduct  prompt repair of 46 city streets which are in unsafe condition.    In order to somewhat improve such a pathetic situation, the  city authorities intend to look for additional sources of  revenue. For example, just increasing rents and introducing new  methods of settlement for certain categories of lease holders  could bring R53.8 billion into the city budget (during the  period from 1 May through 1 January 1995). By increasing the  rates of the land tax and paying for plots of land into the  revenue side of the budget during the period from 16 May through  31 December it will receive an anticipated R67.3 billion. (The  draft of the corresponding directive from the mayor, which will  be approved, establishes the average rate for land tax in the  amount of R735 per one square meter.)    In the opinion of Deputy Mayor Vladimir Yakovlev, it is  necessary to draw up a kind of target program for financing the  city economy which will determine not only the priority areas  for financing but also the deadlines for allotting funds.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Paris gives fresh veto warning on oilseeds FRANCE yesterday warned the European Community that it would veto the draft US-EC accord on oilseeds if the deal was put to a vote at next month's farm ministers' council. The warning followed a European Commission proposal to put the oilseeds deal  -an integral part of the US-EC farm accord in the Gatt trade talks - on the agenda of the foreign affairs ministers' meeting in Brussels on March 8. Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, French farm minister, said he had authorisation from Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, to veto the deal if it were put to the vote. The draft accord is also expected to be on the agenda of the EC farm ministers' council on March 16-17. Mr Soisson is to attend the meeting, where there is greater sympathy for France's position than among foreign affairs ministers. A spokesman for the Danish presidency of the EC said in Brussels yesterday that a vote could technically take place; but he echoed the view of other EC officials involved in the Gatt talks that ministers were unlikely to force the oilseeds issue two weeks before French parliamentary elections. The one notable exception is Mr Rene Steichen, the new EC farm commissioner from Luxembourg, who said he would like the oilseeds deal put to a Council of Ministers vote to show the US that the EC could 'stick to an agreement'. Mr Steichen added it was possible the US might start back-tracking on the farm export subsidies deal agreed in Washington last November if there was continuing uncertainty. 'It is a good issue for the EC to have calm on farm exports and oilseeds.' The European Commission yesterday launched a vigorous defence of its new banana import regime in response to criticism from Latin American producers and Germany, the EC's largest banana consumer. Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, said the agreement would generally mean lower or stable prices in the EC and guaranteed protection for Community banana growers and generous support for the traditional African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) producers. Germany and the Benelux countries opposed last week's deal which set an EC quota for Latin and Central American (dollar-zone) banana-producing countries of 2m tonnes, effective from July 1, at a duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 82.60) per tonne. Bananas above the 2m quota face a duty of Ecu850 per tonne. Germany plans to lodge a formal complaint at the EC Court of Justice in Luxembourg, claiming the deal approved by qualified majority infringes its banana protocol under the 1957 Treaty of Rome.</p>

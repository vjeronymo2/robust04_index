			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> CONTROLLED BLAZE JUMPS FIRE LINES  </P> <P> A controlled fire Thursday in Emerald Canyon jumped fire lines and blackened an  area that was scheduled to be burned today.  </P> <P> "Dryness of the soil and the severe fire hazard, as well as a little wind,  caused the fire to jump over lines we had set for (Thursday's) burn," Orange  County Fire Department Capt. Hank Raymond said.  </P> <P> The wind-whipped fire burned about 50 acres more than was scheduled for  Thursday's operation. "But the area . . . is still well within the total  500-acre controlled burn site," Raymond said.  </P> <P> Fire officials summoned 10 more fire engines to the scene -- a contingency plan  that is implemented when flames jump fire lines, Raymond said.  </P> <P> Smoke from the fire was visible over a wide area of the South County, Raymond  said, prompting many calls to the Fire Department.  </P> <P> Raymond said the major part of the controlled burned will take place today if  the weather and the winds permit.  </P></p>

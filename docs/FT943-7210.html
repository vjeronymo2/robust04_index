			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices jump as buyers find supplies tight Buying interest from coffee manufacturers and a shortage of supplies drove coffee futures prices sharply higher in London yesterday. The second position robusta contract rose Dollars 156 to close just below the day's high at Dollars 3,570 a tonne, giving a two-day rally of 7.7 per cent. Prices on the London Commodity Exchange were helped by a strong performance in New York on Monday, which continued yesterday. The December arabica contract was 7.5 cents stronger in afternoon trading at 197 cents a pound. The rally took London prices back to the levels of two and a half weeks ago. But November futures were still about Dollars 500 off the peak reached in the wake of the second frost in Brazil in early July. 'At the lower levels of the past two weeks there has been significant interest from roasters to accumulate and extend their cover,' said Mr Robert MacArthur, head of tropical trading at Merrill Lynch in London. 'Selling by growers is restricted because they don't want to be too aggressive in selling at these lower levels.' Continued dry weather in Brazil has encouraged the bulls, since it is likely to hamper the flowering season, which begins next month. The US Department of Agriculture warned last week that rainfall was now needed for a 'favourable' flowering season. Some traders were expecting trade demand to increase in the run-up to the important winter roasting period, but they hesitated to predict how much prices might recover while the true extent of the frost damage in Brazil was still unclear.</p>

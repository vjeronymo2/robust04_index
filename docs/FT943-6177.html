			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right price for Euro electricity Sir, The frustration of the Germany city which is not allowed to buy cheaper electricity from the Netherlands is understandable ('Sparks fly over attempt to break power barrier', August 25). I have met commercial users of electricity who, having secured lower prices through supply competition in Britain, wonder why their outlets in other parts of Europe are not allowed a similar choice between electricity suppliers. Competition between producers and the right to choose a supplier will drive down electricity prices and help to make Europe more competitive. Unfortunately, that prospect does not appeal to many of Europe's electricity monopolies, which are resisting liberalisation. There is no shortage of companies waiting to provide competition - many of them British - but it will not come about until more of Europe's electricity customers insist on choice. They should stand up and be counted. David Porter, chief executive, Association of Independent Electricity Producers, 41 Whitehall, London SW1A 2BX</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Time Warner turns in 12% advance TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment group, yesterday reported a 12 per cent rise in its first-quarter 1993 operating profit, before interest and depreciation charges, to Dollars 630m. The performance, struck on revenues 10 per cent higher at Dollars 3.3bn, reflected strong profits from each of the group's five main divisions - music, publishing, filmed entertainment, the Home Box Office (HBO) programming division and the cable operating subsidiary. The first-quarter result was also helped by the redemption of some Dollars 3.2bn of preferred stock issued at the time of the merger of Time and Warner three years ago and by other significant steps toward debt restructuring taken by Mr Gerald Levin, the new Time Warner chairman. Mr Levin noted yesterday that progress continued during the quarter as preferred stock was replaced by lower-cost and long-term debt. He said work on lengthening the maturities of debt and reducing financing costs would continue during 1993. Until more of the preferred stock is redeemed Time Warner will still have a net loss after paying dividends on the preferred paper. For the first quarter, this loss was Dollars 124m, down from Dollars 150m a year before. Time Warner's publishing division showed an operating profit before interest and depreciation charges that was 27 per cent improved at Dollars 56m. Revenues were Dollars 731m, up from Dollars 672m in the first three months of 1992. The music division had Dollars 160m of operating profits before interest and depreciation, a rise of 13 per cent year-on-year. Revenues were Dollars 795m, against Dollars 764m. The Warner Brothers filmed entertainment business recorded Dollars 104m operating profit on the same basis, up from Dollars 96m a year ago. Revenues were Dollars 898m, compared with Dollars 777m. The HBO business achieved record operating earnings of Dollars 55m, against Dollars 52m. HBO's revenues were Dollars 359m, up from Dollars 351m. The Time Warner cable operating subsidiary, which is engaged in building an inter-active and multimedia network in Orlando, Florida, had 12 per cent better profits of Dollars 255m. Revenues were Dollars 546m, up from Dollars 511m. Capital Cities/ABC, the media and publishing group that controls the ABC Television Network, turned in first-quarter operating income of Dollars 140.9m, up from Dollars 97.9m.

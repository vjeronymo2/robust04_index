			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Hopes for Daf contract THE MINISTRY of Defence is putting pressure on the Department of Trade and Industry to try to ensure Leyland Daf is able to complete a key contract to make military trucks. Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, yesterday confirmed that a senior MOD official had written to the DTI to argue that the taxpayer's interest would best be served if the order was completed by the company, which collapsed into administrative receivership last month.

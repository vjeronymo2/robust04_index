			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Russians prepare for Iraqi oil trade go-ahead A consortium of Russian oil companies is developing plans to invest in Iraq in anticipation of the possible lifting of United Nations trade sanctions. The Russian consortium, consisting of Lukoil, Mashinoimport, and Zarubezhneft, has been talking to Iraqi officials for several months about developing existing projects. Zarubezhneft, which handled overseas oil projects in the Soviet era, has had previous experience of working in Iraq. Mr Vagit Alekperov, Lukoil's president, has fleshed out plans in recent meetings with senior officials from the Iraqi oil ministry. Lukoil, one of the new generation of privatised Russian oil companies, plans to exploit the western Kurna and northern Rumeila fields in northern Iraq. It is reported to be willing to negotiate initial investments of Dollars 800m (Pounds 516.1m) to Dollars 1bn but would need a total of Dollars 2.3bn for oil prospecting and equipment supplies. Lukoil said it would be possible to finance most of the project through private investment although, like all other Russian energy companies, it has faced cash-flow problems because of the build-up of inter-enterprise debts. Lukoil has been trying to offset these by developing its activities outside Russia to increase its hard-currency earnings. Weekend reports from the Iraqi News Agency said Iraq and Russia had signed a Dollars 10bn trade agreement to take effect after the lifting of the four-year oil and economic embargo. The news agency said the agreement covered industry and oil projects, but did not elaborate. Iraq has outstanding debts to Russia of more than Dollars 10bn. Moscow is continuing to press for a lifting of the international embargo on trade with Baghdad which was imposed after the Gulf war in 1991. Other foreign oil companies, including Elf Aquitaine and Total of France, have also been jostling to take advantage of any relaxation of the trade embargo with Iraq, according to Russian officials.</p>

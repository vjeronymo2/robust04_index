			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Great deal of value for young 'volunteers' Sir, David Goodhart portrays the Commission for Social Justice's 'Citizens' Service' scheme as compulsory ('Army of volunteers may be called up', June 2). Compulsory volunteering is a contradiction in terms; such a scheme would undermine and devalue the genuinely voluntary spirit which was celebrated last week in the course of Volunteers Week '94. The scheme proposed by the commission, however, is far from compulsory. It differs from other schemes in both its scale - it proposes involving 150,000 participants - and in its accessibility. Unlike existing schemes, it would not be targeted solely at the unemployed, but would aim to harness the energy of young people across the social divide. The aspirations of a scheme such as this, to provide education for life for a wide range of young people, in addition to vocational experience, are to be welcomed. The thousands of young people who are, and who have been, volunteers have gained a great deal of value from their experiences, as well as benefiting the community in the process. The extent to which such a scheme would be 'truly voluntary' is likely to vary from project to project, and even from participant to participant. Perceptions are all-important; someone who feels themselves to be a volunteer, carrying out a service to the community, may well find themselves alongside someone else attracted by the extra Pounds 10 or Pounds 20 a week. The key is that personal development is of equal value to the task being done, that the tasks themselves are meaningful and worthwhile, and that the choices, opinions and feedback of participants are respected. If this is done successfully, many of those participants on schemes will become volunteers for life.

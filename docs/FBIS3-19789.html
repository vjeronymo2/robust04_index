According to MEPs, the European Union should tend, moreover,  towards establishing an international and universal control  system of the "complete cycle" of uranium, plutonium and  possibly thorium, for civilian purposes. In addition, MEPs  consider that, in the cooperation agreements with third  countries, the Union should include clauses on the  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Finally, MEPs took an  explicit stand in favour of establishing a denuclearised zone in  the Near East.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by King Husayn at the opening ceremonies for the </F> signing of the Yemeni document of pledge and accord at the Royal  Hashemite Court in Amman -- live]    [Text] In the name of God, and peace and prayers be on his  honest prophet. Your Excellency the chairman of the  Presidential Council; Your Excellency the vice chairman of the  Presidential Council; dear brothers: God's peace and mercy be  upon you, the creme de la creme of the Yemeni people; our people  and beloved ones, may you enjoy God's protection, and may he  guide us to what pleases him.    You and Yemen, like every remote and wondrous destination  that can only be reached after one has travelled a distance  toward it -- a distance we covered over five long months in  response to the call of duty to brotherhood and to safeguard  unity and all the hopes and ideals and values that reside in the  hearts of all the Arabs. Our hopes have been drawn to Sanaa and  Aden, to the men who have made unity and carried the burden of  protecting it so it can be a vanguard and contribution to a  comprehensive Arab awakening in the face of fragmentation,  divisions, and territorial parochialism -- a reawakening founded  on freedom and democracy, justice, brotherhood, purity,  confidence, and complementarity. We began this reawakening  years ago, when we met as brothers in Arabism and Islam and rid  ourselves of any parochial benefit or regional sense or minor  objective, as we went about setting up the Arab Cooperation  Council with our cousins. We called for the introduction of a  new age among ourselves, armed with awareness, patience, and  content. We argued for a joint march seeking good for all the  Arabs and a mobilization of the nation's energies on the road of  unity and dignity. We have wanted it to be a march that  branches out like a blessed tree -- one that does not bow unless  to offer its bounty to all of us.    Let the tree's march be to the heights, in the name of the  generations that dream of the nation and the Arab message, in  their human dimensions and awareness, in the shadows of which  flourish books, universities, schools, banners, cities, and  villages, where human rights and human dignity are respected,  and where dreams are nurtured, in the manner of our  grandfathers, the leaders of the Great Arab Revolt, when they  surprised the world with the great dream of a united Arab state  extending from the source of wisdom in Yemen to the sunset of  'Uqbah Bin-Nafi', standing at the shores of the ocean of darkness    If today there is a dream to achieve Arab integration and  to open new fields of sincere and good cooperation for and among  all Arabs, let this be in accordance with God's saying: Help  you one another in righteousness and piety but help you not one  another in sin and rancor. [Koranic verse]    When the Gulf crisis occured and our nation suffered from  its  pains, we tried, before it took place, to find an Arab remedy to  Arab wounds. We acted with all the power and capability we had  to avert this national catastrophe. Our only objective was to  please God and satisfy our conscience. But, events took a  different turn than what we wanted. Despite the divisions and  the rubble it left behind, we did not despair that a new dawn  would break after a long dark night, returning the water to its  course, pure and limpid in the great and boundless river of our  nation.    Brothers, kin folks, and beloved ones, Amman is happy to  have  you meet in it. It lost sleep over the disagreement and the  confrontation that took place between the brothers. Amman is  also losing sleep over the starvation of the children of the  nation who are besieged, by the illiteracy of some of its  generations, by the dryness of some of the nation's trees, and  by the squandering waste of many of its resources.    In this homeland, we have struggled in the face of gloomy  and  regrettable surprises. Free Arabs have struggled in many  locations in this homeland so the image of unity can remain  vivid in the minds and so our nation can remain, as God almighty  has wished it, the best of peoples evolved for mankind [Koranic  verse], rescuing those in distress, justly treating the wronged,  feeding the hungry, protecting borders, and reassuring the  frightened.    We have sought unity formulas. The Arab League formula was  not the first of these unity ideas. The first of these ideas  was an Arab government in Damascus at the time of Faysal  Bin-Husayn. We welcomed all pan-Arab initiatives. We called  for establishing a new Arab order. We stood against all foreign  interference, in the hope that our efforts would succeed in  healing our Arab wounds, from which we all suffer. We tried to  prevent any estrangement of the brothers.    We still take the same position. If the world around us  changes, let us change for the better, under the guidance of God  almighty. This is natural. What does not change are the  principles firmly embedded in the consciences of men who once  built the Ma'rib Dam, men who spread the message in and outside  the peninsula, and their grandsons who rebuilt the dam, upheld  the edifice of unity, and championed the banner of amity among  the sons of the one homeland, in the realization of the dream  that the enemnies of the nation try to shatter and to send into  oblivion.    The document of pledge and accord, drafted by a good group  of Yemen's sons representing various trends and views,  demonstrates real national unity and proven the success of the  principle of pluralism within the framework of unity. It  demonstrates a comprehensive vision for the subjects under  discussions by the Yemeni people.    The document fixes dates for implementation. It presents  plans for all of the Constitutional, political, security, and  legislative fields. It defines general fundamentals and  principles for building the new state, its central and  decentralized establishments, and its laws and bylaws. The  document demonstrates all of this in a comprehensive, accurate,  and systematic way that will lead, God willing, to an advanced  model of the state of law and institutions, to sound relations  between authorities.    Dear kinsfolk: You are starting on a difficult road of  comprehensive reform. This will require all your efforts and  time, as well as the purest images of purity and fraternity the  revolution can have. It will require the highest spirit of  satisfaction and strength, so we will see no dark sea or gulf,  so no blood will be shed at the hand of a brother who is unaware  of the consequences of such action.    Therefore, we view your agreement as a resumption of the  unity march and an enhancement of your democratic march. So you  have the glory. Peace be upon you while you unleash the spirit  of unity so it will waft across the entire Arab nation's land  with its good scent, demonstrating your generosity -- known  since the dawn of our history -- and drafting a Yemeni epic with  Arab objectives and vision.    Brothers: We do not call our concern for your situation a  mediation, because we do not consider the spirits of brothers to  be separate. We, together, have been aware of our historic  responsibilities. We have been engaged in the battle for  freedom, democracy, and unity. We have been calling for the  power of knowledge, awareness, and culture. We have been  dreaming of a pan-Arab awakening that will light the streets of  the nation's cities and liberate them from oppression, slavery,  greed, fear, sedition, starvation, civil war, and alien cultures.    It is an honor for us that you came to us and chose us  because of your confidence in us. We view this confidence with  much gratitude. We are eager to serve your best and great  objectives so we will continue to be Arab brothers, with the  honor of serving their brothers and kinsfolk, at the start of a  new road for dealing with all Arab issues within the Arab  framework, and in a spirit of brotherhood and duty, hoping to  carry out this duty fully with God's help.    Esteemed kinsfolk: We do not conceal our happiness over  the fact that you are among us. Jordanians believe their guests  are the grandsons of the Ghassanides who built this land, who  carried the banners of conquest to the whole world, becoming  history's masters, knights, and creators, and who carried the  nation's concerns and stretched their struggle to all its causes  and places. Let us advance together as one nation that supports  the weak, feeds the poor, the orphans, and the prisoners, and  reminds the world of great 'Umar Bin-al-Khattab's [second  caliph] call: How can you enslave people who are born free?    Let us open the windows of freedom and the doors of the  future for our new generations. Let us call for returning the  right and restoring the Arab land's youth, strength, power, and  memory. Let its awakening be based on science, construction,  factories, and universities so no hungry, grieved, or sad man is  left out.    Our hands are stretched out toward your hands. The Arab and  Islamic sanctities in the holiest city, Jerusalem, are a stone's  throw away. We urge that no side, except God, should have  sovereignty over them. Let the faithful compete for fearing,  worshiping, and respecting God. Palestine can be seen with its  minarets and domes. We are defending the Palestinian people's  rights in response to their's and the nation's demand and in  accordance with international legitimacy.    Let us depart from the clouds of hesitance in this troubled,  changing world and come up with a vision based on an  intellectual foundation, on our tolerant values, on our great  message. Let us follow the road of the righteous human  intellect and awaken the pan- Arab sense of honor and vigorous  will. Let the pledge and accord document on which you are  unanimous be a landmark on an irrevocable comprehensive movement  that reaches its unionist goal and sees Yemen emerge as an Arab  peak that connects what has been cut in the march of our great  history.    Blessed be your effort, o our kinsfolk in Yemen. Be happy  with the unity you have achieved and with the road you have  chosen. Let new joys prevail in Sanaa, Aden, al-Hudaydah,  Hadramaut, and Ta'izz over unity and the spirit of brotherhood.    Let the nation awaken like Yemen, which has decided to be at  the forefront. Let the joy be Yemeni, the satisfaction Arab,  and the talk free and unionist. Let us read in the holy Koran:  Seest thou not how God sets forth a parable? A goodly word  like a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches  reach to the heavens. It brings forth its fruit at all times, by  the leave of its Lord. So God sets forth parables for men, in  order that they may receive admonition. [Koranic verse]    O dear kinsfolk, you will return to Yemen after agreeing to  what is good. You will resume the Yemeni unionist march. I  beseech God to grant you success and guide your steps on the  right path and to help you shoulder your great responsibilities  toward your homeland and your nation. Peace and God's mercy be  upon you.</p>

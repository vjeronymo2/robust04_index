			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses rise on renewed rate-cut hopes STRENGTH in the dollar, and a reawakening of interest rate hopes helped to bring senior bourses back to life, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS closed the October trading account with lift-off on expectations of an early interest rate cut, a strong bond market and a firmer dollar. The CAC-40 index ended up 35.67 at 1,766.41, just off the day's high of 1,770.72, for a rise of 6.1 per cent on the week. Turnover of FFr3.1bn was heavy for a Friday and reflected end-account activity. Interest rate-sensitive stocks led the rally, with Michelin adding FFr11.60 or 6.4 per cent to FFr191.90 in heavy trading. Suez rose FFr12.30 or 5.4 per cent to FFr239.80 and Saint-Gobain put on FFr27.90 or 5.9 per cent to FFr494.90. FRANKFURT, however, reflected buying from DTB futures traders as the DAX index rose 16.71 to 1,526.82, 4.5 per cent better on the week. Among the heavyweights which the DTB focuses upon, Allianz rose DM38 or 2 per cent to DM1,908 while Daimler put on DM15.50 or 2.8 per cent to DM561. An analyst said that Allianz might be looking a touch oversold, while the climb in the dollar to over DM1.53 yesterday favoured major exporters. Among second liners, Bremer Vulkan jumped DM2.90 to DM69.40, lifted from its 1992 low by a newspaper report that the company will win an order for four container ships to China worth DM800m. MILAN was propelled higher in active trading amid hopes that interest rates would be cut this weekend. The government's progress on efforts to curb the public sector deficit also encouraged the market. Buying was predominantly domestic, though there was a report of a large foreign buy program. The Comit index rose 4.77 to 417.19, flat on the week, in turnover estimated at more than L200bn after Thursday's L144.8bn. The state-controlled financial services and real estate holding company Sifa led the market higher, with its ordinary shares rising L100 or 7.7 per cent to L1,395, on news that Sifa would officially merge with Finmeccanica, which is also state-controlled. Trading in Alcatel Cavi was suspended ahead of news that its parent Alcatel Cable of France was offering to buy out minority shareholders. lt was offering L3,700 per ordinary share and L2,730 per savings share. The ordinary share last traded at L2,800. AMSTERDAM recovered some ground towards the close on short covering and the CBS Tendency index finished 0.2 lower at 104.3, down 1.13 per cent on the week. The financial sector continued to improve on hopes of lower European interest rates with ABN Amro up 20 cents at Fl 50.10 and ING 50 cents higher at Fl 49.90. Fokker, besieged by rumours throughout the week, denied another which claimed that Dasa was offering Fl 25.50 per share as part of its deal to acquire a 51 per cent stake. The Dutch group said recently that it expected the price to be nearer Fl 40 per share. The shares closed at a new year's low, down Fl 1.00 at Fl 15.80. DAF was another 70 cents lower at Fl 10.80, a loss of 18 per cent on the week, after deferring payment of its preference dividend on Thursday. MADRID's general index put on 1.13 to 201.18, a rise of 3.7 per cent on the week. BBV, which reported a 20 per cent fall in third quarter earnings lost Pta10 to Pta2,215 but the sector was generally firm with Banco Popular up Pta60 at Pta9,680. Telefonica, in spite of recent presentations in the UK and Madrid, fell Pta15 to Pta950, while Cubiertas showed a rise of Pta245 to Pta3,825, up 21 per cent on the week. BRUSSELS closed higher as a strong recovery in Petrofina offset declines among some smaller industrial stocks. The Bel-20 Index was 11.28 higher at 1,132.96, up 3.5 per cent on the week. Petrofina closed BFr440 or 6.2 per cent higher at BFr7,590. STOCKHOLM ended the week 9.1 per cent higher, on lower interest rates. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 20.9 to 721.9 as turnover jumped to SKr616m from SKr459m. HELSINKI extended its rally to a ninth consecutive day, the Hex index closing 14.5, or 2.1 per cent higher at 690.3, up 11 per cent on the week and 14.3 per cent since October 12. Turnover was FM81.7m. A FM2.17bn trade surplus for September and lower domestic interest rates helped push the market higher. COPENHAGEN, conversely, had another bad day, writes Hilary Barnes, following the announcement of a big third quarter loss by Jyske Bank and Danske Bank's purchase of a large chunk of shares in Baltica Holding. Danske fell DKr9 to DKr209 and Jyske by DKr36 to DKr188 as the all-share index plunged 3.09 to 254.36.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- October 23                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open   11.30   12.00   13.00   14.00   15.00   16.00   Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack  100   1026.84 1026.21 1025.76 1027.92 1033.00 1034.37 1033.81 1034.38 FT-SE Eurotrack  200   1100.70 1099.42 1098.94 1099.51 1105.75 1108.09 1106.96 1108.83  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Oct 22    Oct 21    Oct 20    Oct 19    Oct 16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1021.53   1015.54   1021.70   1001.00   996.54 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1095.16   1087.95   1090.40   1063.18   1066.23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1036.03 ; 200 - 1111.79 Low/day: 100 - 1024.94  200 - 1096.25  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

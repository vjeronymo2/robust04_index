			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Pingxing (3769 1627 5281)] </F>   [Text] United Nations, 30 May (XINHUA) -- A presidential  statement adopted by the UN Security Council [UNSC] this evening  calls for immediate consultation between the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the DPRK on technical measures  for replacing the nuclear fuel rods of the latter's nuclear  reactor.    The statement urges the DPRK to replace the fuel rods of its  5-megawatt reactor "in a manner that preserves the technical  possibility of fuel measurements" as required by the IAEA.    The statement also urges IAEA inspectors to stay in the DPRK  to monitor the 5 megawatt-reactor.    Speaking during the UNSC consultations, Li Zhaoxing, China's  permanent representative to the United Nations, pointed out:  Because of their joint efforts, all parties concerned have  achieved a series of successes in handling the DPRK nuclear  issue. These hard-earned successes should be cherished.  Certain problems have now appeared with regard to the refueling  of the 5 megawatt-reactor, we hope the IAEA and the Koreans will  continue their consultations on the technical measures for  monitoring the refueling and make efforts to reach agreements as  early as possible.    Li Zhaoxing reiterated China's stand on this issue, saying  that the fundamental way to settle the DPRK nuclear issue is by  dialogue and negotiations through channels that have been  established. He said: China does not endorse any action that  may exacerbate contradictions. As a signatory of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, China, as always, does not support or  encourage nuclear proliferation. He said: "We have been  looking forward to a proper solution to the DPRK nuclear issue  through proper channels so that peace and stability can be  maintained in the Korean peninsula and so that there will be a  nuclear-free Korean peninsula. We are ready to make continual  efforts to attain this goal."</p>

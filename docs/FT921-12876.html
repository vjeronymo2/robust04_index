			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Bass chief warns about the costs of rationalisation MR IAN Prosser, chairman of Bass, the UK's leading brewer, warned shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting that rationalisation measures would involve further exceptional charges against profits. The group has already announced that it is to close breweries at Edinburgh and Sheffield. The meeting was told that the group was aggressively reducing its cost base and that this action was 'essential to strengthen further our market position amid intensifying price and brand competition.' Mr Prosser said beer sales to the free trade in the October-December quarter had increased by more than 10 per cent, with a particularly strong performance in the take-home trade. Total beer volumes were only 0.5 per cent down, having benefited from an increase of nearly 5 per cent in the final four weeks of December. 'We believe this means that our market share gains have continued in the new financial year,' he said. Christmas trade in the group's pubs had been 'more encouraging' than in the preceding weeks but beer volume per pub was 9 per cent below last year with a consequent loss of high marginal profitability. Another 389 pubs were sold during the quarter, fetching Pounds 69m and bringing the total sold to 1,899 against a disposal target of 2,740. New leases had been signed or agreed for 540 of the leased estate's 1,229 pubs. Mr Prosser said that in the Holiday Inn business, economic conditions in some parts of the US had continued to affect occupancies in company managed hotels but this had been almost offset by increased room rates. US franchise hotels' occupancy rates were similar to those in the same period last year.</p>

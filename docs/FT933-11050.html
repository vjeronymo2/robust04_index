The proposals range from complete deregulation of pensions, with employers specifically empowered to contribute to private pension plans, to building new flexibilities into the present uniform system. More than Pounds 33bn is invested in the Local Government Superannuation Scheme, more than 10 per cent of the UK pension fund industry.

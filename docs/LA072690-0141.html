			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEHMETORI GETS THERE ON TIME;  </P> <P> DEL MAR: BIG CROWD, PRINTERS SLOW THINGS DOWN ON OPENING DAY. FOREST GLOW WINS  SECOND HALF OF FEATURE.  </P> <P> On a day when the daily programs and many favorites were not known for their  timeliness, Mehmetori was a punctual arrival at the wire in the first half of  the Oceanside Stakes as Del Mar launched its 43-day racing season. Wednesday's  crowd was 25,684, and despite temperatures in the 80s, there was still a  blizzard -- of discarded parimutuel tickets.  </P> <P> Mehmetori's late-running victory by a head over In Excess was a breeze compared  to the second half of the Oceanside. Forest Glow, in front almost all the way,  held on to nose out Pro for Sure, who rallied from far back.  </P> <P> The finish was so close that the jockeys, Gary Stevens aboard Forest Glow and  Laffit Pincay astride Pro for Sure, lingered in front of the tote board until  the placing judges eyeballed the picture from the photo-finish camera.  </P> <P> Either way, the winner's circle was going to get a MacDonald. Forest Glow is  trained by Brad MacDonald, and Mark, his older brother -- by a year -- saddles  Pro for Sure.  </P> <P> Brad MacDonald, 32, got his first stakes winner at Del Mar, as did Richard  Mulhall, who trains Mehmetori. A $33,000 yearling purchase, Mehmetori could not  have won, in Mulhall's opinion, but for a canny, gritty ride by Julio Garcia,  who also was scoring his first Del Mar victory.  </P> <P> "He came between horses (in the stretch) and that was the difference," Mulhall  said. "If he goes around, I don't think my horse gets there."  </P> <P> Predecessor finished third, almost two lengths behind Mehmetori, with the 3-1  favorite, Robyn Dancer, running fifth.  </P> <P> Garcia failed to sweep the Oceanside when Kept His Cool, the 3-1 favorite in  the second division, finished off the board. After Forest Glow and Pro for  Sure, it was three lengths back to Bel Air Paster in third place.  </P> <P> The crowd was about 1,600 more than the attendance at last year's Del Mar  opener. The early-bird patrons, who can start betting at 8:30 a.m., were  frustrated when the track programs didn't arrive until almost an hour after the  windows opened. Just before the day's first post, there were long lines at the  stands selling programs.  </P> <P> "No matter how you prepare, something always seems to happen," said Joe Harper,  the longtime Del Mar general manager starting his first season as track  president. "The delay in the programs is one of the disadvantages of having  them printed in San Diego (about 25 miles away)."  </P> <P> More than 100 miles north of Del Mar, at Hollywood Park, where there was  satellite betting on the races here, the programs didn't arrive until 30  minutes before the first post.  </P> <P> Mehmetori was not tardy, although placed last after a half-mile in his 10-horse  field. He earned $40,575 for his owners, Jack Arnold and Bill Miller, running  the mile on grass in 1:35 2/5, and paying $9.40 for a $2 win ticket.  </P> <P> The victory was only the second in nine starts for Mehmetori, and his first in  four races on grass, and the win could trigger a good season for the Mulhall  barn, which hasn't had much success here in recent years.  </P> <P> Mulhall, 51, also trains Mohamed Abdu, who will be one of the contenders in the  Eddie Read Handicap later in the season, and he got good news even before  Mehmetori ran when Sawsan, a 2-year-old filly, worked five furlongs Wednesday  morning in a promising :59 1/5. Sawsan will be running in the Junior Miss  Stakes next Wednesday.  </P> <P> Forest Glow, bred and owned by John A. Bell III, ran in Kentucky as a  2-year-old and needed two races at the recently completed Hollywood Park  meeting before hitting his stride, winning an allowance race on July 4.  </P> <P> "This is my first stakes win anywhere, and I'm in a state of mild shock," Brad  MacDonald said. "I beat my brother by an inch. While we were waiting for the  photo, I asked him if he wanted to split (the purse) and he told me no."  </P> <P> Stevens, leading Del Mar rider in 1987-88, wound up with three winners  Wednesday. Forest Glow was timed in 1:36 and paid $25.40.  </P> <P> "I didn't know who won," Stevens said. "When I stood up two jumps after the  wire, the other horse was ahead of me. This course doesn't favor speed at this  time of the meet, but Brad said to just let him roll. That's his style, and I  wasn't supposed to fight him. I tried to steal away with a half-mile to go and  it worked, but it was a little closer than I liked."  </P> <P> Pincay thought that Pro for Sure had gotten up in the last jump. The five-time  Del Mar riding champion quietly walked off the track while Stevens and Brad  MacDonald gave each other high-fives in his wake.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Only one favorite, Saratoga Chill, won. The undefeated 3-year-old daughter of  Saratoga Six has won three races by a total margin of 19 lengths. . . . Laffit  Pincay, riding Old Alliance in the first half of the Oceanside, came out with  his colt, giving Julio Garcia and Mehmetori room to come through. . . . Del  Mar's on-track handle was up 10% compared to a year ago.  </P> <P> Great Communicator, who made his first start of the year last Saturday and  finished next to last at Hollywood Park, is scheduled to run in the 1 3/8-mile  Escondido Handicap at Del Mar on Aug. 11, according to trainer Thad Ackel.  "That race the other day was 1 1/16 miles," Ackel said. "That's like sprinting  for this horse." . . . Trainer Ron McAnally said he hasn't decided whether  Bayakoa will run in the Palomar Handicap on Saturday. . . . According to his  agent, Scotty McClellan, Chris McCarron's return to action has been moved up to  the end of August. McCarron suffered broken legs and a broken forearm in a  spill at Hollywood on June 3.  </P></p>

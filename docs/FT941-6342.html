			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unitary authorities should not be forced on public Sir, John Authers is right to point out 'Lack of consensus plagues councils shake-up' (25 February). I would like to clarify the Association of County Council's position. Where local people prefer the present structure they should be allowed to do so, and all available opportunities should be taken to make that structure work better. New unitary authorities should not, as the Local Government Commission has said, be forced upon a public which does not support them. When asked to make choices, more people have cited a positive preference for the status quo. The recent judicial review successes of Derbyshire and Lancashire County Councils mean that the status quo is a firm option. Change should only be proposed for any area with the full agreement of local people following a thorough review and consideration of the options. Your article assumes this case has been made in more areas than it has. In our view the review of local government should be conducted on a flexible and pragmatic basis. Where the case for change is made and locally agreed, the ACC believes that unitary authorities need to be large and powerful enough to have effective strategic capacity; they should also be able to avoid the unaccountable joint arrangements which would recreate a worse two-tier system. Small unitary authorities without any other tier between themselves and national government would lead to a fragmentation of local government and its main services.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "Hourly" column: "Time Is Running Out and No Way Out </F> Is Seen"]    [Text] Japan-U.S. negotiations on automobiles and auto  parts, which have become the centerpiece of Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks, are still deadlocked over the question of  setting "numerical targets" to measure the expansion of Japan's  import of foreign-made goods. U.S. Trade Representative Kantor,  who visited Japan to urge the Japanese to make a political  decision, met on 2 February with Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister,  and Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of the Ministry of International  Trade and Industry [MITI], but their meeting appears to have  failed to produce any agreement. The negotiations on the three  priority sectors of automobiles-auto parts, government  procurement, and insurance are set to be concluded prior to the  Japan-U.S. summit. With the summit 10 days away, however, no  way is seen to break the deadlock in the negotiations.  <H5>  The Government's Situation </H5>   The meeting between Foreign Minister Hata and U.S. Trade  Representative Kantor at the Foreign Ministry lasted one and a  half hours longer than scheduled. A meeting between Finance  Minister Fujii and U.S. Trade Representative Kantor has been  deferred until later. A Finance Ministry official angrily said,  "We managed to arrange a meeting for them despite our minister's  busy schedule, but he did not show up."    Originally, the Japanese were in no mood to welcome Kantor's  visit, saying: "Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are to be  concluded at vice ministerial talks. It is hard for us to do  anything even if he presses us." A senior MITI official  emphatically told a group of reporters on the evening of 1  February that "I hope he will meet with people he wants to meet  and then put forth a new policy after returning to the United  States."    The U.S. has not hidden its aim that Mr. Kantor was sent to  Japan to lobby Prime Minister Hosokawa and cabinet ministers for  Japanese trade concessions over the heads of Japanese  bureaucrats who are still poised to "reject the U.S. demand for  setting numerical targets." Japanese bureaucrats are fully  confident of dealing with Mr. Kantor, saying, "He will only  confirm that Japanese Cabinet ministers and bureaucrats share  the same view."    Of the three priority sectors of the government procurement  of telecommunications gear and medical instruments,  automobiles-auto parts, and insurance, the negotiations on the  automobiles and auto parts have been deadlocked and no way is in  sight to break the deadlock. It was once observed that "the  Japanese side will try to settle the negotiations by asking  Japanese automakers to work out plans to increase their purchase  of foreign auto parts," but MITI, in charge of the negotiations,  still sticks to its tough attitude against asking Japanese  automakers to do so, saying, "We cannot ask Japanese automakers  to work out plans that may be transformed into numerical  targets."    The present situation is that even if the Japanese  Government  decides to concede to U.S. trade demands, Japanese enterprises  could not accept such a decision. The Japanese automobile  industry, which is beset with unprecedented sluggish sales and  the restored competitiveness of the American automobile  industry, is in a situation where it cannot satisfy the U.S.  demand for increased purchases of American-made auto parts. A  senior MITI official says, "Even if aides to the prime minister  instruct Japanese automakers to seek a compromise, they cannot  move at all." The "bureaucrats" closet themselves in shells  only awaiting concessions from the U.S.  <H5>  The Situation of Politics </H5>   At a 30 January meeting with Toyota Motor Corporation  President Shoichiro Toyoda and other business leaders, Prime  Minister Hosokawa showed his irritation with the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks that have continued to face rough  sailing, saying: "It seems that bureaucrats from the two  countries have failed to smooth over their differences in the  talks."    The prime minister appears to have made the statement in  response to the U.S. criticism that "the Japanese bureaucrats do  not understand Prime Minister Hosokawa's aims for reform."  Officials close to the prime minister have yet to fashion a  blueprint for the prime minister to make a political decision.    Good prospects are seen for mapping out a new package of  stimulus measures that will be high on the agenda of the  upcoming Japan-U.S. summit and this is the only bright factor.  Commenting on the negotiations in the individual sector, MITI  Minister Kumagai has said: "The Hosokawa government's policy is  that it will reduce its intervention in enterprises' economic  activities." As a result, it would be hard for Prime Minister  Hosokawa to resort to a "political decision," which has been  used as a stereotyped means in past negotiations with the United  States.    As for the negotiations that are entering an impasse, the  Foreign Ministry has begun saying in an irritated tone: "An  accord should be reached in one way or another at the upcoming  Japan-U.S. summit on 11 February. We do not care about Japanese  bureaucrats being criticized as villains if the United States is  satisfied."    Japanese Ambassador to Washington Takakazu Kuriyama, who is  in Tokyo on a temporary visit, reported on 1 February to the  prime minister that "although the U.S. Government has a good  impression of the Hosokawa government, it is tough in the  negotiations with Japan." The above-mentioned senior MITI  official said: "We are a little bit concerned how Mr. Kuriyama  explained this to the prime minister." Delicate domestic  negotiations have already begun.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Patricia Munoz Rios] </F>   [Text] The United States and the PRC are the two countries  that conduct the most unfair trade practices in the Mexican  market. Together, they are responsible for 56 percent of all  cases of dumping reported in the current six-year period,  according to a study conducted by the Dumping and Subsidies  Investigations Directorate under the Unit of International Trade  Practices of the Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat  (SECOFI).    The document says that in the current six-year period,  approximately 108 dumping investigations have been conducted to  detect cases in which foreign producers are selling products at  lower than normal prices in the Mexican market, which hurts  Mexican industries so much that they are driven to the verge of  bankruptcy.    Of a total of 108 cases investigated, 43 have to do with  products coming in from the United States and 17 from the PRC,  followed by 12 investigations into Brazilian products and five  into German products.    Figures show that 39.81 percent of all investigations have  been conducted against U.S. products brought into the country  under unfair trade conditions, while 15.74 percent of all  investigations involve PRC products.    The countries that have committed the least number of unfair  trade practices against Mexico have been those from the Asian  bloc and from Latin America, but in the case of Latin American  nations, the document notes that trade with these countries is  very limited.    The analysis conducted by SECOFI reveals that most of the  countries with which Mexico trades have been the object of two  or more dumping investigations, but in the case of the United  States, the number of unfair trade practices committed in the  Mexican market is extraordinary.    Among the countries that in the past five years have been  the  object of only one dumping investigation by the Mexican trade  authorities are Argentina, France, India, Japan, Malaysia, the  Netherlands, Pakistan, and Chile. Belgium, the EC, Colombia,  and Taiwan have been the object of only two dumping  investigations each under the current administration, the  document states.    As for the products involved, the ones that "suffered" most  from unfair trade practices were those from the chemical  industry, oil byproducts, and rubber and plastic products, and  these comprised 40 percent of the dumping cases reported during  the current administration. These products are followed by  those from the basic metal industry with 17 percent of all  investigations and the textile sector with 12 percent of cases  of unfair trade. In the same order of importance, metal  industry products, machinery, and equipment -- including, among  other products, microcomputers, telephone adapters,  transformers, and tools -- account for 10 percent of all  investigations.    Toys, shoes, and electrical appliances, including  refrigerators, account for 7 percent of the total number of  registered cases. Nonmetal products -- fluorite, cement,  artificial corundum, and ceramic coating [recubrimiento  ceramico] -- account for 5 percent of the total number of  dumping cases, followed by products from the paper and printing  press industry.    Food products account for the least number of  investigations;  cases of unfair trade practices have only been reported in the  marketing of fish meal, beef, pork, and cationic starch.</p>

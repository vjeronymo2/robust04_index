			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Books: Naked truth about whisky WHISKY by Gavin D. Smith Carcanet Pounds 14.95 Once a firewater distilled in remote Scottish and Irish glens, whisky is now one of the top five UK exports. It is also a drink whose image has been carefuly nurtured with the help of such words as 'old', 'de luxe' etc; a 'craft' item rather than a 'factory' product - a drink that demands 'connoisseurship' of its imbibers if it is to be enjoyed to the full. In fact, the vulgarities have been refined away to such an extent that one of the principal purposes of drinking it - to get drunk, - has almost been lost to view. It is good therefore to be reminded of other, earthier ways of appraising its qualities - such as that old Gaelic toast, 'You are the prowler of the night to the beds of virgins. Oh God, what powers you have to gain kindnesses from girls.' The different vocabularies of drinking in the UK and the US are interesting. In Scotland, measures of whisky are the dram, the nip, the tot, all of which suggest something cosy, fraternal and unthreatening. In the US it is the belt, the blast, the slug - aggressive, macho words which suggest that a man walks tallest at the very moment when he is beginning to buckle at the knees. According to Whisky by Gavin D. Smith (Carcanet, Pounds 14.95), a marvellous new book which examines the rich, peaty and extensive vocabulary of whisky and its distillation, the secret of whisky-making was brought to Ireland from the Middle East in about the 6th century AD. For centuries, however, it remained a cottage industry. The first commercial blended whisky, Ushers OVG (Old Vatted Glenlivet) was launched in Edinburgh in 1853, and it was the blended whiskies that made the fortunes of Buchanan, Dewar, Walker and other legendary names that have now been absorbed into United Distilleries. Sales boomed because of the Phylloxera epidemic that virtually destroyed the French brandy industry in the second half of the 19th century. Whisky stepped in to slake the thirst of brandy drinkers. Whisky has caused some trouble in its time - the great American Whisky Rebellion of 1794, for example. The distillers up in furious protest against the first tax ever imposed upon spirits in North America. Excisemen were assaulted in the streets; there was a march on Pittsburgh. That Virginian distiller General George Washington marshalled a force of 13,000 troops to put the rebellion down. Down the centuries the distillers have always played a cat-and-mouse game with the exciseman. After the Act of Union in 1707, the avoidance of excise duties became a point of honour to the Scots, and illegal still sprang up in the most ingenious of places - one Scottish still was set up in a cave behind a waterfall, so that the smoke rising from it would be mistaken for spray by the untutored eye. If the success of blended whiskies in the mid 19th century helped to establish whisky's popularity once and for all, it has been the growth in the production of single malts in recent years that has raised whisky's profile as a drink fit for connoisseurs. The sale of malt whiskies represents only a tiny proportion of total whisky sales; but the profit on the sale of a bottle of Glenlivet - the best-selling single malt whisky in the US - is correspondingly greater because it is taxed at the same rate as the cheaper bottles. But for those who are not yet connoisseurs of malts - or even guzzlers of blended supermarket whiskies - a problem of etiquette remains: how exactly do you ask for a Scotch when in Scotland? Certainly not by asking for 'a Scotch'. No, ask rather for 'a whisky'. 'Not a single whisky' though. A 'single whisky' is not one measure of whisky, but a whisky made in only one distillery, and not blended with any from elsewhere. And if you want a single malt, do not on any account ask for 'a single malt'. Not to specify which particular single malt would be taken for a signal of woeful ignorance. And do not be crass enough to request anything other than water with the whisky. As the old adage runs, 'There are only two things a Scotsman likes naked, and one of them is whisky.'</p>

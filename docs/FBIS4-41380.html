			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Professor of Law Yuriy Brovka: "Once Again </F> About the Notorious Agreement"]    [Excerpts] Discussions regarding the supposed merger of  the monetary systems of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian  Federation are not subsiding these days. People are wondering:  Is this unification legal and to what extent is it expedient?  We will not discuss the economic aspects in detail. Experts  have already spoken about this issue. You have only to scan  such periodicals as the Minsk-published BANKOVSKIY VESTNIK,  NATSIONALNAYA EKONOMICHESKAYA GAZETA, DELO, BELORUSSKAYA  DELOVAYA GAZETA, BELORUSKIY RYNOK and the Moscow-published  EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN, DELOVOY MIR, and KOMERSANT-DAILY to realize  just how extremely critical most highly qualified experts in our  states are of this issue. Obviously, the unrecoverable losses  for each side will considerably exceed the rather dubious  advantages. Let us address the legal side of the issue.    No one doubts the fact that the agreement -- with additional  protocols attached to it -- signed in Moscow two months ago  seriously violates the new Constitution of the Republic of  Belarus. Only one issue is of importance: What conclusions  should be made? We know that the General Prosecutor's Office did  not find anything criminal in the work of our governmental  delegation. Well, let us assume that, indeed, there was no  crime in all this, there are no criminal cases to be  investigated, there is no one against whom legal actions could  be instituted for having committed intentional crimes.  Moreover, [Central Bank Chairman] S. Bahdankevich, one of the  members of our delegation, was cautious and officially disagreed  with those clauses of the agreement which were obviously  unconstitutional. Therefore, there is no agreement as such. In  a word, we can only speak about a sort of misunderstanding  prompted by the fact that our statesmen have inadequate  knowledge of their constitutional duties. We should not wonder  why. The times when the Constitution was less valued than the  statute of the Communist Party, or even any of the Central  Committee's instructions, did not go this far.    Having not sorted out this issue from the viewpoint of the  constitutional rights of our state, let us look at it from the  international-legal viewpoint. [passage omitted]    I can only add that international legal experts hold a  common  opinion that the norms "jus cogens" [internationally recognized  laws] are, first of all, the principles recognized by  international law. Among those principles, the principle  assuming the sovereign equality of all states is of top  priority. Therefore, what sovereign equality -- with regard to  the recent Belarusian-Russian agreements on financial issues --  can we speak about?! These agreements do not refer to the  introduction of a new currency, a new unified ruble, which could  be used in circulation as single legal tender with two equal  state emblems or without any symbols at all. These agreements do  not refer to the setting up of a unified state bank -- with the  right to print currency -- with two cochairmen adopting joint  decisions. These agreements do not refer to the use of single  tariffs to be introduced in accordance with special bilateral  pacts. No, the point is quite the contrary: To allow a foreign  state to exercise overall control over the national monetary and  credit system; to regularly plead for money with foreign  national symbols; to allow a foreign state and a foreign  legislature to adopt legal norms -- regulating tariffs, customs  duties, and so on -- to be observed by us. I do not know,  perhaps for Tatarstan -- fighting to be granted the status of  privileged autonomy within the Russian Federation -- such an  agreement could be a definite step forward, but as for the  Republic of Belarus, this, of course, is, no doubt, a step  backwards on the path to the so-called "autonomy" which was long  ago proposed by Stalin. Evidently, such agreements would not  raise the authority of either Belarus or Russia in international  arena. It is obvious that -- sooner or later -- such an  agreement will be considered illegal "ab initio" with all the  subsequent consequences.    One more thing: I cannot help but wonder, looking at those  people -- war veterans and representatives of the influential  directorial corps -- who support the so-called "socialist  choice." On what do they count? Do they really count on the  quick removal of Russian President B. Yeltsin and Russia's  return to the communist past? This hope is quite preposterous.  Russia would rather continue along the path of reforms. So,  what will directors and chairmen of unprofitable Belarusian  kolkhozes and sovkhozes or managers of bankrupt industrial  enterprises do then? Let us imagine that they will be able to  realize the dream of their life and include independent Belarus  into a Russian protectorate or make it a Russian province. Do  they believe that Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Chernomyrdin, Mr. Shokhin,  and Mr. Gerashchenko will hurry to issue them favorable credits?  Will these unlucky managers enjoy the same maneuvering room  they currently have? Will they be able to pay wages to their  workers when Russian miners and militiamen have been living  without wages for several months?    What fortified fraternity between the Belarusian and Russian  peoples could they -- all those who wish to turn Belarusian  workers into Russian parasites, such hanger-ons from the  viewpoint of a Russian Philistine -- speak about? As for our  Belarusian Philistine, he will blame all his mistakes and  failures on "Moscow's intrigues." Wonderful prospects! No, we  would do better to strive to develop mutually beneficial  cooperation with Russia, and other states as well. There are  objective conditions for that, we should only make proper use of  them.</p>

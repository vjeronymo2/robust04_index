			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: FKI profit falls 24% but sales picking up A LONG-awaited business strategy was revealed yesterday at FKI as the electrical engineering company revealed that recession in North America and the UK had sliced 24 per cent off pre-tax profits. The pre-tax return fell from Pounds 40.2m to Pounds 30.5m in the year to March 31, on sales 5 per cent down at Pounds 739.1m. About 87 per cent of FKI's business is in the UK and North America. Mr Bob Beeston, the former BTR executive brought in to revive FKI as group managing director, said the company would boost margins through price increases and cost-cutting, rather than chase volume. The aim was to get a 10 per cent return on sales, compared with a current 4 per cent. Mr Whalley was bullish about the group's prospects. He said there were signs that the US economy - which represents about 40 per cent of FKI profits - was beginning to pick up. Order intake in four of the group's five businesses - the exception being process control - was between 15 and 30 per cent ahead in the first two months of the current year. The final dividend is held at 1.3p. Added to the halved interim the total was 2.3p (3.3p). Earnings per share fell from 6.71p to 4.88p. COMMENT The addition of Mr Beeston and his BTR cohorts has done much to restore faith in this company. The revival of the US economy promises good rewards, with the hardware business sitting at the front end of the cycle, while President Bush's negotiations with the Japanese are already benefitting the transplant business. The cost-cutting programme should bring some Pounds 5m in savings next year, and help eliminate loss-makers. Forecasts are between Pounds 36m and Pounds 40m, which on yesterday's price of 77p leaves a p/e of 11 to 13 times. That looks pretty cheap considering the sector average of more than 14 times.</p>

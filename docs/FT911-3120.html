			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / The Property Market: Marginal rise continues OVERALL returns showed a marginal improvement for the second month running, according to the Investment Property Databank monthly index. Although rental and capital growth were both the same as in February, increased income lifted total returns to -0.4 per cent. As a result, returns for the March quarter were higher than those recorded over any of the previous four quarters. The opposite has been true of rental value growth, with a modest but continued deterioration in each quarter over the last 18 months. Estimated rental value growth was -0.3 per cent in the March quarter. Annualised total returns fell slightly to -7.9 per cent. Capital growth was  13.6 per cent and rental value growth now stands at a mere 2.5 per cent. Both the office and industrial sectors recorded a slight improvement in returns, whereas that of the retail sector worsened over the month. Offices remained the least successful sector for the month, the quarter and the year. Rental value growth remained negative at -0.3 per cent, bringing the decline for the quarter to -1.2 per cent. Total return for the quarter was -3.0 per cent, similar to the returns recorded for each of the previous three quarters. Offices annualised return of -11.1 per cent is lower than that for industrials (-3.7 per cent) and retails (-6.4 per cent). The industrial sector made a zero return in March - a slight improvement on February's results. The March quarterly total return of -0.4 per cent was the best recorded for any sector over the last year.</p>

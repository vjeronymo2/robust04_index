			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US agricultural exports forecast to more than double Agricultural exports from the US could more than double by 2005 to Dollars 8.7bn as a result of the Gatt deal, according to a report by the US Department of Agriculture. By 2000, the report expects US farm exports to rise by Dollars 1.6bn to Dollars 4.7bn, bringing higher prices and increased income for producers. Subsidised farm exports will begin to be replaced by the free market under the Gatt deal, changing world wheat markets fundamentally, the report says. 'Removal of subsidies will increase prices, dramatically for some countries, and reduce world trade in the first years of the agreement.' After that, world income will rise leading to an increase in demand. One of the important conclusions of the USDA's analysis is that the Gatt deal will be good news for world agriculture by raising income worldwide, which will lead to higher demand for farm products and an increase in prices. World prices will rise by 2 to 3 per cent for wheat and 7 to 8 per cent for feedgrains by 2005, the report predicts. US wheat output will rise and exports will be 150m to 200m bushels more than they would have been without a Gatt agreement. US farm incomes could rise by Dollars 1.3bn in 2000 and by as much as Dollars 2.5bn in 2005. This would help offset spending on farm support, reducing outlays by an estimated Dollars 2.6bn in 2005. And export-related employment in agriculture could rise by 190,000. The deal will encourage countries to keep open their markets for farm products. Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, explained recently to the House of Representatives committee on agriculture: 'Perhaps even more important for the future is the discipline the Uruguay Round will apply to countries that might otherwise choose the direction of closed markets, production-inducing internal supports, and subsidised exports.' He said this gave a signal to large US trading partners that remained outside Gatt - China, Taiwan and the nations of the former Soviet Union.</p>

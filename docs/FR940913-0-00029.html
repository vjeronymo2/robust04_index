			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are about 75 handlers of peanuts subject to regulation under the agreement, and about 47,000 peanut producers in the 16 States covered under the program. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers have been defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. Some of the handlers signatory to the agreement are small entities, and a majority of the producers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1993, the reported U.S. production, mostly covered under the agreement, was approximately 3.33 billion pounds of peanuts, a 22 percent decrease from 1992 and the lowest level since 1983. The preliminary 1993 peanut crop value is $991.65 million, 77 percent of the 1992 crop value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The objective of the agreement, in place since 1965, is to ensure that only wholesome peanuts enter edible market channels. About 70 percent of U.S. shellers (handlers), handling approximately 95 percent of the crop, have voluntarily signed the agreement. Under the agreement, farmers' stock peanuts with visible  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aspergillus flavus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  mold (the principal source of aflatoxin) are required to be diverted to non-edible uses. Each lot of milled peanuts must be sampled and the samples chemically analyzed for aflatoxin contamination. Signatory handlers who comply with these requirements may be eligible for indemnification of losses for individual lots of their peanuts which test positive to aflatoxin. Indemnification and administrative costs are paid by assessments levied on handlers signatory to the agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee, which is composed of growers and handlers of peanuts, meets to review the rules and regulations effective on a continuous basis for peanuts regulated under the agreement. Committee meetings are open to the public, and interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews Committee recommendations and information, as well as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the rules and regulations will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee met on March 15 and 16, 1994, and unanimously recommended clarifying changes to &sect;998.100 Incoming quality regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 998.34 of the agreement provides authority for the modification of the incoming quality regulation by the Secretary of Agriculture, if the Secretary finds that such modification would tend to effectuate the objectives of the agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

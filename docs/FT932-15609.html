			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Fiction: A Western thoroughbred - Andrew Clements is bewitched by a new giant of American fiction ALL THE PRETTY HORSES by Cormac McCarthy Picador Pounds 14.99, 302 pages ANYONE who has read any of Cormac McCarthy's previous novels, particularly Blood Meridian, his Odyssey through the badlands of the American West, will already know the frisson his writing can generate and the sheer force his imagery musters. Yet there is no prior knowledge that could anticipate the searing achievement of All the Pretty Horses. In a single giant stride it takes McCarthy to the forefront of contemporary American fiction. The origins of McCarthy's art, in William Faulkner and Hemingway, are easy enough to discern: his prose has a compulsive directness, a descriptive virtuosity which wastes not a single word. Now, though, comparisons and antecedents are made to seem irrelevant. The voice is manifestly a unique and powerful one, the world it inhabits has been made entirely its own. There is something almost transcendental about McCarthy's descriptive virtuosity, a compulsion to observe and record coupled with an awestruck sense of natural beauty which seems to link him more closely to the American nature writers - to Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiessen, even Annie Dillard - than to any of his novelist contemporaries. For if literature ceded the American West to the cinema three-quarters of a century ago, McCarthy is now reclaiming it. The evocations of the borderlands of Texas and Mexico in the late 1940s resonate around the protagonists of All the Pretty Horses until landscape and character, even speech, become the equal components of a seamless, endlessly variegated texture. John Grady Cole is the grandson of a Texas rancher, the last, losing generation of a dynasty that has seen its grip on the land progressively weakened. When his father, back from the war, opts to give up ranching for life in the town, John Grady escapes south to recover the cowboy life; with his friend Lacey Rawlins he sets off in search of the dream of the old America. As they cross into Mexico they meet up with a younger absconder, Blevins, the last issue of another old West lineage, the outlaw. After Blevins steals back his escaped horse the three youths are forced to split up and the older two find their way to a Mexican ranch which seems to be the very lost arcadia they had set out to find. The lyrical centrepiece of McCarthy's book is a loving description of the two boys' life on the ranch as working cowhands, luminous in its details of the enchanted world as the boys perceive it. When cruel reality intrudes again - Blevins is caught as a horsestealer and Grady and Cole are implicated too - the unblinking force of the book does not waver. The inhumanities of prison life are portrayed just as vividly as the lyric interludes. Grady emerges from his ordeal forcibly matured, yet clinging to his own moral code of loyalty and courage through which he can survive the institutionalised horror. Not the least considerable of McCarthy's achievements is to make the narrative as spell-binding as his descriptive flights. One remembers the harsh beauties of the book - the image of song birds impaled by a storm on the spines of a cactus, the hymn-like celebrations of the natural grace of horses in an unforgiving landscape - but also the corrosive tale and the moral imperative it conveys. Everything, too, is wonderfully proportioned; all the strands are perfectly integrated, without any spare flesh. For once a jacket blurb has got it absolutely right: All the Pretty Horses, it says, 'is indisputably a masterpiece'.</p>

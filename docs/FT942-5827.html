			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Philip Morris keeps the markets guessing - Food and tobacco group has made an about-turn over a spin-off Is Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, going to spin off its cigarette making operations? The stock market was left guessing after the unusual corporate turnabout that took place last week. Last week Philip Morris put out a terse statement after a six-and-a-half-hour board meeting saying it had decided to take no action on the possibility of separating the company's food and tobacco businesses. But how were shareholders to reconcile this with an announcement just six weeks earlier saying that a spin-off of the tobacco operations was being considered? In mid-April, Mr Hans Storr, the company's chief financial officer, said that Philip Morris was looking at the possibility of a spin-off as one option for increasing shareholder value. The move appeared to make sense. Philip Morris - like RJR Nabisco, the next biggest US food and tobacco group - had long believed its share price was unduly depressed because of adverse sentiment about cigarette manufacturing. The downward pressure increased last year when Philip Morris started a bruising price war to win back market share from low-cost brands. More recently, US cigarette makers have faced an unprecedented wave of attacks from the anti-smoking lobby, government officials and Congress. Meanwhile investors fear that, one day, someone will win a multi-million dollar lawsuit against US cigarette makers requiring them to pay compensation for suffering caused by smoking-related diseases. So far, the cigarette makers have successfully defended themselves against every action, but one success could open the floodgates. When the Financial Times reported Mr Storr's remarks, the company was flooded with requests from stock market analysts and the media for confirmation of a possible split. Philip Morris duly obliged, saying it was 'currently studying such a separation'. And during the next two weeks, as analysts sent out 'buy' recommendations to their clients, the stock price rose by more than 10 per cent. On April 25, Philip Morris said it was continuing to study a possible demerger, so when the board met last Wednesday, expectations for an announcement were running high. Instead, the company said the board had rejected a split - and the next day further dashed hopes by saying: 'It is not anticipated that this issue will be before the board in the foreseeable future.' Philip Morris declined last week to elaborate on its brief announcements, so analysts were left to speculate on the reasons for the turnabout. Some believed the plan was a dead duck; others thought it needed more work. But Philip Morris had always emphasised that a spin-off was only one of the options for enhancing shareholder value, and could involve problems. Among the difficulties that could have confronted the board were: A reluctance to overturn the logic that originally brought the tobacco and food operations together - that is, the idea that the cashflow from the tobacco operations should be used to fund the expansion of the food operations. Uncertainty that a split could protect the demerged food operations from a successful lawsuit against the tobacco operations if the courts saw the demerger as an attempt to circumvent liability. The possibility that a free distribution of shares in a demerged tobacco business would give shareholders an unwelcome tax liability. Fears of an adverse political reaction from the anti-smoking lobby in Washington to a move that could be seen as conferring benefits on the country's biggest cigarette maker. On the other hand, experience from other recent US demergers suggests that most of these problems could have been overcome. So analysts like Ms Becky Barfield of CS First Boston, the Wall Street investment bank, wonder if there is a simpler explanation for what happened. Clearly, the management favoured a demerger - because it would not have published statements saying it was being considered; equally clearly, the board was against the plan - because it turned it down. 'It sounds to me like there was a fight,' Ms Barfield says. Whatever the explanation, the debacle has done Philip Morris - and its languishing share price - little credit. But where does it go from here? One likely option is to boost earnings per share by accelerating the current stock repurchase programme. Another possibility would be to increase the proportion of earnings paid out in dividends. On the other hand, one positive outcome of last week's meeting was the elevation to the board of Mr Geoffrey Bible, head of Philip Morris's world-wide tobacco operations. Some analysts thought that could be a first, tentative step towards a future demerger - once the board felt it could decently come back to the plan without losing face.</p>

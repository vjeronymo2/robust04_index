			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALL IT APPEASEMENT  </P> <P> Does the United States still believe in anything? Does America still stand for  independence and freedom and human dignity? Evidently not. A half century of  brave words about "captive nations" has been shown as so much cheap talk as the  Bush Administration puts its stamp of approval on another "expedient solution,"  the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact that condemned the Baltic states to communist  enslavement.  </P> <P> Reports that President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III have  entered into a cabal with French President Francois Mitterrand, West German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to  strangle Lithuanian independence in its cradle give new meaning to Lithuanian  President Vytautas Landsbergis' charges that a new Munich is at hand.  </P> <P> Tragically, just when America's ideals have caused a worldwide resurgence in  democracy, the United States itself is undercutting its own legacy. The Bush  Administration has somehow gotten into its head the notion that appeasement is  now the best policy. Those who have tried to bring them to their senses, like  arms control negotiator Edward J. Rowny, have been eased out of power.  Agreement at any price is once again the order of the day.  </P> <P> Don't we ever learn?  </P> <P> We won the Cold War because of our principles. We may end up losing the peace  because of our lack of them.  </P></p>

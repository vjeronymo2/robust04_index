Russian economist  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy who is said to succeed Gaydar, in an  interview with IRNA here Monday described Gaydar as an  incompetent person for membership in the new cabinet.    He said that Gaydar always introduced the former speaker of  parliament Ruslan Khasbulatov as the main obstacle on the way of  economic reforms but during the past three months since the  dissolution of the parliament he did not carry out any  constructive measure.    Comparing certain members of the government with that of the  former Soviet Union, he claimed that some of them only thought  about having fashionable offices, modern cars and luxury houses  instead of paying attention to more important matters. He  reiterated that he would not accept the post of deputy prime  minister.</p>

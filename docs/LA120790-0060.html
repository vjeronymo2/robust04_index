			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> FOR LIONS, 'EVERY DOWN IS THIRD DOWN'  </P> <P> Dave Adolph, the Raiders' defensive coordinator, thinks the Detroit Lions'  run-and-shoot offense will present problems in Monday night's game at Pontiac,  Mich.  </P> <P> "It's something unique that you don't play against every week in the NFL,"  Adolph said.  </P> <P> "Every down you play against them is a third down and we have to approach it  that way."  </P> <P> Since the Lions use four wide receivers, will the Raiders employ an extra  defensive back throughout the game?  </P> <P> "Most teams play it with at least five defensive backs and possibly six,"  Adolph said. "I'm not going to divulge how we're going to play it. It's hard  enough as it is."  </P> <P> But the Raiders can't concentrate totally on stopping the Lions' passing attack  because of running back Barry Sanders, the NFL's No. 4 rusher with 905 yards  and eight touchdowns.  </P> <P> "You've got to be very alert for him running the ball because if there's a seam  (Sanders) will find it," Adolph said.  </P> <P> Lion injury update: Linebacker Dennis Gibson is out because of an ankle injury.  Cornerback Bruce McNorton will miss the game because of a broken left forearm  and wide receiver Aubrey Matthews has a bruised shoulder and is questionable.  CHRIS BAKER  </P></p>

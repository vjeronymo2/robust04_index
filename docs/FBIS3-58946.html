On his arrival at the venue--CSU  headquarters in Munich--Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber  criticized the CDU sister party. The CSU will ask at the  meeting, which is to deal with preparations for the election  campaign, "what position" CDU politicians such as Heiner  Geissler, [Bundestag President] Rita Suessmuth, and Friedbert  Pflueger, who will "block" decisions by Chancellor Helmut Kohl,  would have, Stoiber said.    He has also heard too little about how the CDU intends to  integrate "the democratic right," Stoiber added. In this  context, questions must be asked about the consequences of the  fact that, in the meantime, more than half a million work  permits have been issued to foreigners. "Unemployment is being  imported," Stoiber said.    Theo Waigel, CSU chairman and federal finance minister, said  the SPD [Social Democratic Party] was the main opponent in the  coming election debates and that the FDP [Free Democratic Party]  was a "competitor." He said the CSU will tell even the CDU what  it thinks when necessary. CSU General Secretary Erwin Huber  said he is confident that "a closing of ranks between the CDU  and CSU" will come about at the meeting.</p>

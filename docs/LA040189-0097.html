			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SOVIET MAKES DEBUT IN CALGARY WIN  </P> <P> Sergei Priakin made history Friday night at Calgary when he became the first  Soviet to play in a National Hockey League game.  </P> <P> Priakin, a 25-year-old right wing, failed to get a point in the Flames' 4-1  victory over Winnipeg, but was on the ice for one of the Flames' goals.  </P> <P> A crowd of 20,002 watched when Priakin jumped onto the ice 2:29 of the first  period. In the first 20 minutes he had five shifts and stirred up action on  each one of them. Once, he was knocked flat on a clean body check by Dale  Hawerchuk of the Jets.  </P> <P> Later, Priakin set up Tim Hunter in the slot. But Hunter mishandled the puck  and didn't shoot.  </P> <P> Bobby Smith of the Montreal Canadiens, the vice president of the National  Hockey League Players Assn., questioned the signing of Priakin.  </P> <P> "You have to wonder if Priakin wasn't allowed to sign just for the money. The  Soviets may just want to rake in our money," Smith said. "Putting him in  uniform this late in the season, cuts some player out of a job."  </P> <P> The victory gave the Flames a one-point lead over Montreal in the fight for the  best overall record.  </P> <P> Brian Mullen of the Flames scored his 50th goal, the first time he reached that  goal.  </P> <P> Minnesota 5, Detroit 1 -- Finishing third in the league's weakest division  might not be cause for a celebration, but the North Stars aren't about to  apologize.  </P> <P> Jon Casey stopped 33 shots, including a penalty shot, and Mike Gartner had a  goal and three assists at Detroit and the North Stars clinched third place in  the Norris Division at the expense of the division's best team.  </P> <P> "This gives us a little more confidence going into the playoffs," said Casey,  who is 7-3-1 in his last 11 games. "We've been playing well defensively, but  tonight we had some offense."  </P> <P> Petr Klima, pulled down on a breakaway at 7:21 of the final period, lost  control of the puck trying to fake out Casey.

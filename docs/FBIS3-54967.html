The reason is an article published in  EXPRESS KHRONIKA No. 45 regarding some actions of the Tiraspol  authorities last October, including the voyage of commandos to  Moscow to defend the White House. Although many Moscow  publications proved that Tiraspol was involved in the bloodshed,  it is the first time when Tiraspol authorities deny the  accreditation of a Russian journalist.</p>

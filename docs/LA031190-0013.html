			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: SPENCE + LILA BY BOBBIE ANN MASON (HARPER &amp; ROW: $6.95,  ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> A ruminative novel about the love and interdependence that bind a taciturn  farmer and his gregarious wife. When Lila has to undergo surgery for breast  cancer and arterial blockage, the sophisticated technology of modern medicine  forces the couple to confront the coldly mechanized world of the '80s, which  they have managed to keep at arm's length.  </P> <P> Their Kentucky farm has become a retreat to an older time and a mellowed vision  of agricultural life. But the pain of separation is more wrenching than the  sense of dislocation. Lila and Spence discover they are lost without each  other, a fact that their well-meaning children are unable to disguise. Bobbie  Ann Mason draws a warm portrait of two people joined by an enduring affection,  tempered by years of conjugal life.  </P></p>

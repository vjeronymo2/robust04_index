			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: AB Elect loss deepens AB ELECTRONIC Products Group, the components manufacturer, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.95m for the half year to December 31. The group warned that it would remain in the red during the second half of the year. The outcome, which compared with a loss of Pounds 2.02m, was struck after an exceptional Pounds 1.05m charge for redundancies and rationalisation. Sir Peter Phillips, chairman, warned: 'While demand in the electronics markets served by the group has, in general stabilised, there are no signs of recovery. The second half made a slow start. The continuing fall in turnover will prevent the group from returning to profitability in 1991-92.' Trading profit slumped from Pounds 4.52m to Pounds 2.76m on sales of Pounds 87.6m (Pounds 115.9m). Losses were 13.7p (6.2p) per share. The components side continued to incur sizeable losses - Pounds 1.46m compared to Pounds 1.51m. Profits from the automotive division fell from Pounds 679,000 to Pounds 202,000 reflecting falling orders from the UK luxury car market. The group blamed competitive conditions in the computer market for the fall from Pounds 1.45m to Pounds 686,000 in profits from the assemblies division.</p>

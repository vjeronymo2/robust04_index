			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams flew back  into Dublin today, straight into a protest by the Families  Against Intimidation and Terror group at Dublin Airport. He was  confronted by angry people, who have either suffered themselves  or their families have suffered at the hands of the IRA.  [passage omitted]    At the news conference, the Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams,  praised the U.S. President Bill Clinton for allowing him a visa  to attend a conference on the north. But first he was asked for  his reaction to the news that Sir Patrick Mayhew has a new plan  for a devolved government.    [Begin recording] [Adams] I have to get more information,  but we all know that that doesn't provide a solution; in fact,  as part of one of the main elements in the talks I had with Mr.  Hume, we agreed that an internal settlement was not a solution.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Adams, may I ask you, you went  to America looking, seeking help and support from the Americans,  from President Clinton. It really hasn't worked. He actually  did say, you know, you should go back and support the Downing  Street declaration. He's also knocked completely on the head  the idea of a peace envoy. What is your view of that?    [Adams] Well, first of all, Charlie, I went to the United  States because I was invited to attend a conference, which would  give me and others the opportunity to put across our views. It  was a rather unique opportunity. I think it worked very well.  It's a pity that the British Government wasn't there to put its  views. It's a pity that the two main Unionist parties didn't put  their views also. So I think all of that worked very well. I  didn't expect as the result of a 48-hour visit to New York that  the Clinton administration would change policy absolutely. I  think they did a very useful and positive thing when they [words  indistinct] and I have commended President Clinton for that.    [Reporter] Mr. Adams, you said you'd give your response soon  to the Downing Street declaration. How soon are we talking  about, can you give any sort of outline time [word indistinct]  for that response?    [Adams] Well, I have never set deadlines on this peace  process. And I think if you, if you watch what has been  happening for these last few months, you'll see the wisdom in  not setting a deadline. We're trying to unravel decades of  conflict, in fact centuries of conflict. We're dealing with  some very crucial issues. The core issues are being addressed,  but we need to move it all forward, and I think we have to be  patient, in the way that (?we're doing it).    [Reporter] Yesterday the Taioseach Albert Reynolds said the  time was coming for you to give the clarification, that he had  given an abundance of clarification.    [Adams] Well, I mean, a letter arrived in my absence, which  I will have the opportunity to consider within the next few  days. Well, I mean, I don't want to respond. I haven't been au  fait with the Irish and British press comment of anyone. I do  think that Mr. Reynolds has been taking a very common sense  attitude to most (?of these). I only wish the British would  follow his example.    [Reporter] But Mr. Adams, if he's been taking a common  sense approach to the issue, why don't you reciprocate, and at  least try and (?help him) to say yes, we will reach a conclusion  by some time? (?Is it) not unreasonable, unfair to ask you to  put some time limit or some time in the future when you hope you  can deliver an answer?    [Adams] The reality of the situation is that each party has  been given clarification by the British Government on issues  which they sought clarification on. The party which I  represent, which represents a quite significant section of  people in the north, has not been given that clarification.  Now, until we get that, we cannot give a definitive response.    [Reporter] (?Is) the peace process, in your view, advanced  at all by this visit or are things still the same, you're coming  back to the same position?    [Adams] Well, I don't know what the situation is here since  I left, but certainly I think that the climate has been  improved, that here we have a focus, as I said earlier, on the  issues, on the core issues. A framework has obviously been  identified of the two governments in consultation with everyone  else. There's a lot of jockeying going on, a lot of people,  maybe quite legitimately, trying to sort out their own  positions, so I think that the last 48 hours have been helpful  and (?all of it) certainly, certainly no harm has been done.  But I also think there are some parts of the British, you know,  establishment think that they still rule the world. They're not  content with interfering in Irish affairs, but they want to  interfere in North American affairs also. But more importantly,  they create the situation. Had I not been denied a visa because  of British pressure, who would have paid any attention? Who  would have noticed (?a) Gerry Adams going there, had we been  handled in a sensible way? So I went to the conference, it was  a good conference, despite the absence of some of the key  players. And people who didn't know the Republican view now have  at least had the opportunity, and an uncensored media, to  examine the Republican view.    [Reporter] So, how do you assess the chances of peace and  maybe an eventual yes to the Downing Street declaration from the  IRA?    [Adams] Well, I do, I do, and I've said this repeatedly, I  do have a very firm conviction that we are going to have peace.  The opportunity for peace was never more realizable. I think  that we're into a final phase of this conflict, but how long it  takes is something else again entirely, but we have moved, I  mean we're talking about peace, we're not talking about war.  (?It wasn't a) conference, I wasn't in the States talking about  bringing weapons to Ireland, talking about any of those war  activities, no one (?dealt) with that. We all talked about how  we end war. So I think it's all moving forward. [end recording]</p>

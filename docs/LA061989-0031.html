			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Four paintings and 114 prints by Andy Warhol go on the block tonight at 7:30 at  Butterfield &amp; Butterfield's new Los Angeles auction house, 7601 Sunset  Blvd. Two 1984 paintings of Michael Jackson are expected to bring the sale's  top prices of $300,000 to $500,000 -- a far cry from the record $4.07 million  paid last month at Christie's New York for Warhol's "Shot Red Marilyn." Next in  line at Butterfield are Warhol's paintings "Endangered Species: Bald Eagle,"  ($225,000 to $275,000) and "Blackglama (Judy Garland)" ($130,000 to $150,000).  Two 1967 silkscreens of Marilyn Monroe ($20,000 to $25,000) are the most  expensive individual prints offered. A 1974 suite of 10 floral silkscreens with  hand-applied watercolor is valued at $25,000 to $30,000. Estimates of other  prints, predominantly from the '80s, range from $2,500 to $20,000.

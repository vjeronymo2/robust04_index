			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MR. PRESIDENT, WATCH YOUR LIPS  </P> <P> When all is said and done, the foreign policy of the United States is what the  President says it is. Experts and advisers help define that policy and carry  out its goals. But it is the President who has the final word, whose voice is  given most credence at home and around the world. It is what the President says  that sets the course of U.S. international relations.  </P> <P> George Bush has been around Washington a long time, long enough to understand  that even the most seemingly offhand presidential comment can have significant  global consequences. In recent weeks he has not always remembered that.  </P> <P> Consider the continuing buildup of U.S. and other forces in the anti-Iraq  coalition and what flows from it. By common military estimate, those forces are  nearing a level where offensive action could soon be undertaken. By a  conjunction of events, this has occurred while Bush has been campaigning for  his party's candidates. Bush has alluded often in the campaign to what is going  on in the Persian Gulf area, in so doing implicitly describing American policy  there. But he has tended to do so using the emotional rhetoric of the stump,  not the carefully weighed sentences of statecraft. The results have been more  perplexing than illuminating, even to some of Bush's closest aides.  </P> <P> Saddam Hussein is a dangerous and evil man, and the United States has done the  right thing in opposing his expansionism. But the Iraqi dictator is not another  Hitler, let alone -- as Bush would have it -- worse than Hitler. At some point  there may be no alternative to using military power to repeal Iraq's aggression  and to punish the aggressor. It is useful and even morally necessary that  everyone concerned be alerted to that somber possibility. But the campaign  trail is not the place from which that message should be sent.  </P> <P> Ad-lib remarks made in a partisan context threaten to trivialize issues of  deadly seriousness. The shaping of U.S. foreign policy requires the most  careful thought. Expressing that policy requires equal care. Lately, Saddam  Hussein may have been left confused about what Bush has been saying. So,  unhappily, have many Americans.  </P></p>

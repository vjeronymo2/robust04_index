			<p>BFN     [Text] Justice Minister Dullah Omar says plans for a Truth  and Reconciliation Commission will go ahead despite opposition  expressed by the commissioner of police. Police Commissioner  General Johan van der Merwe has submitted a document to the  safety and security minister in which he warns that the  commission could bring about the downfall of top ANC members.    Johannesburg's BUSINESS DAY newspaper quoted Mr. Omar as  saying that the government was not worried about this  possibility and that it was no reason to suppress the truth. He  said the ANC accepted that its members might have to appear  before the commission.</p>

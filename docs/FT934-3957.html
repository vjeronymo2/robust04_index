			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UDM calls for pit sell-off cash The Union of Democratic Mineworkers is to press the government to pay redundancy money to every British Coal employee when the industry is privatised, regardless of whether they secure employment with successor companies. Mr Neal Greatrex, union president, said yesterday that if the remaining miners were given the same amount of money as workers being paid to leave the industry they could invest in a UDM-led bid to buy pits.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Alija Izetbegovic, president of the </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, by correspondent Senad  Hadzifejzovic on 11 May; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, commented on the Bosniak-Croat  agreement reached in Vienna for Bosnia-Herzegovina TV this  evening. His host was Senad Hadzifejzovic.    [Izetbegovic] I think that this is a good agreement. Of  course there were a lot of difficulties, particularly over the  issue of cantons, but my first impression is that this was done  well. I am particularly pleased by the solution envisaging the  Neretva and central Bosnia cantons which will be typical  cantons. Power will be shared in them and the Bosnian idea will  be preserved in a way. I think that this is the best quality of  the solution. Of course, the problem of implementation remains.  I am afraid we could again have the problem of finding a way to  implement the implementation [as heard]. I think that this  indicates the preparedness of both sides to establish the  principle of coexistence again.    [Hadzifejzovic] Most of the media attention is focused on  the  post of the president and the upcoming changes. How do you  comment on this as the current head of state?    [Izetbegovic] I remain president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency, a political body that should be a symbol of the  state's survival as a whole. This is not a problem. I said  yesterday and I sent a letter to our delegation in Vienna saying  that this issue must not be an obstacle to the agreement. If a  satisfactory agreement is reached in connection with cantons and  other, in my view, more important issues, then this issue is not  important. One also has to bear in mind that the president's  term is restricted to six months and that a Bosniak has to  become a president after the first elections. If elections are  not held within six months there will be a rotation. This issue  is not so important also because the vice president has great  powers, i.e., main decisions will be made by consensus.    [Hadzifejzovic] Does this mean that we will have the  existing  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency alongside the rotating president  and vice president of the Bosniak-Croat Federation?    [Izetbegovic] Yes, if you remember, the constitutional law  provides for this until the implementation of the new  constitution and the Federation. It is necessary to preserve  the Presidency as a political body that represents the whole of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We should not take a step in the wrong  direction by disbanding the existing state in favor of the  Federation. We still insist on the survival of the republic as  a whole and the existing Presidency represents the republic  [word indistinct]. The future president of the Federation will  represent only a part of the republic. This was already  envisaged by the constitutional law.    [Hadzifejzovic] Mr. President, in Bosnia-Herzegovina  television newscasts we have, on several occasions, dealt with  this question of the future organization of the federation as  opposed to the current organization. There will obviously be  state organs that will emerge following the first postwar  elections, while there will also exist the state organs that  stem from the agreement between the Bosniaks and the Croats.  Do you fear that there may also be some problems in these  circumstances?    [Izetbegovic] No, I do not. It is a fact that the Assembly  remains as a single entity. It has, however, as people say,  this assembly has four faces. Nevertheless, it is a single  entity. Sometimes it operates in one capacity; sometimes it does  in another.    There will be one government, not two. The presidency is to  remain. I believe there will be no major problems in this  respect if these powers are defined more narrowly. In other  words, this current presidency has had to remain as a body that  represents the republic.    The problem of the army, of course--this fourth  institution--the army is the most problematic issue. Hardly  anyone has managed to merge two armies into one. This is an  experiment we are going to try to carry out. I fear there will  be difficulties. This process is going to be far more difficult  than others. As for the rest, I do not think there will be any  major problems. This is particularly so because there will be a  single government.    [Hadzifejzovic] What is your comment on the U.S. role in the  signing of the Bosniak....    [Izetbegovic, interrupting] Their role was very positive and  stimulating. Believe me, I think that, in part, their help is  very direct. The fact that this took place in a U.S. Embassy  helped in resolving some things. I have to reveal something.  The negotiations were in serious crisis last night. Literally,  they almost collapsed. I was talking to our delegation, to all  the members. It was a long conversation, and the Americans  mediated in such a way as to prevent the negotiations from  stalling. Thank God, everything eventually turned out all right.    As for my talks with Mr. Redman, let me tell you that these  talks, relating to the next meeting of the contact group, are in  progress.    [Hadzifejzovic] Following this meeting, one can expect the  next stage in the implementation of the Bosniak-Croat agreement.  The position, the status, of Serbs in this future federation  has been outlined?    [Izetbegovic] First of all, the Serbs should accept this  federation. In other words, what is going to take place on  Friday at the meeting in Geneva relates mostly to the future of  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state and, of course, our relations with  the Serbs, as well as relations between the federation and the  regions populated by Serb majorities--most of which are  currently under the control of Karadzic's army. We will have to  do something conceptually in order to save the country's unity.  I believe that this is our priority interest: to preserve the  external borders of the country. This is, in a sense, our  interest. It will be our main goal on Friday.    [Hadzifejzovic] Will this require some concessions on our  part?    [Izetbegovic] I cannot figure this out at the moment. It  would not make sense if I were to reveal them at the moment.  [words indistinct] what kind of concessions. I want to say that  the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state will be the  top item on this list of priorities.</p>

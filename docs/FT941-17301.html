			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Arts: Bizarre saturnalia - Television When the social history of the world comes to be written, the saturnalia in late 20th century Britain will make a bizarre footnote. For two weeks in midwinter the nation closes down. Any days which are not weekends are declared bank holidays. Transport comes to a halt. Dustbins, though abnormally full, remain unemptied. Postal services cease. The streets are deserted. And what is the population doing? Watching television. As darkness falls at four in the afternoon visiting Martian sociologists patrolling the roads would observe flickering electronic light seeping from countless front rooms. Inside, in an atmosphere of pine needles, turkey soup, and family tension, people sit and watch for hour after hour as the entire history of American cinema is played out on the box: from the silent antics of Harold Lloyd, via the astounding insults of Groucho Marx, to the fin-de-siecle nostalgia of Michael J. Fox in Back To The Future III (actually a hymn to an idealised Wild West) and Kevin Costner in Field Of Dreams (an anthem to an idealised society where baseball provides the values that the English once projected onto cricket). The oddest thing is that this weird ritual grows longer every year, even though it is impossible to find anybody who claims to enjoy it.                          *      *      * Having long ridiculed the French for their xenophobic panic over 'American cultural imperialism' and their efforts to use the power of the state to force fellow countrymen to stop watching American films and programmes and watch French ones instead, it may seem odd, now, to start complaining about American content on British television. But what matters, surely, is the difference between coercion and persuasion. It is wrong to try to legislate against public taste but right to scold ITV for offering us such a cynical schedule on Christmas Day. Between 6.00 in the evening and 3.30 in the morning they screened four American movies, one documentary about an American songwriter, a half hour programme about American cinema, and 10 minutes of news. To make matters worse, the films were announced by a man with an American drawl who said 'Eye Dee Vee and Diet Coke pre-zent eh movie prer-mere' (to rhyme with 'revere'). Why? What is wrong with English? Perhaps the drubbing that ITV took from BBC1 in the ratings battle will persuade the commercial network to mend its ways. True, BBC1 did screen an American movie at 9.10, but the rest of the comparable period was all-British, from Only Fools And Horses to the mandatory repeat of The Morecambe And Wise Christmas Show.                          *      *      * And were there really no worthwhile original programmes during the great Christmas splurge? From Christmas week itself four were worthy of remembrance. The Wrong Trousers, Nick Park's second animated cartoon featuring Wallace and Gromit, not to mention a sinister penguin, will probably win as many awards as his brilliant first work Creature Comforts. Shown on BBC2 at teatime on December 26, it should and no doubt will be repeated ad infinitum. Guys, Dolls And D-Wing on BBC2 on December 29 was a white whale of a documentary: an account of events inside prison which was unlike all the other prison documentaries you have ever seen. Watching the pro-am production of a musical inside Wandsworth gaol, you suddenly realised that while sewing mailbags or listening to sociology lectures would never change these men, fulfilling the extraordinary requirements of a stage musical just might. It was tremendously heartening. On the same night Hookers, Hustlers, Pimps And Their Johns (C4) was disappointing even though it was so unusual as to remain memorable. Perhaps we were expecting too much because Beeban Kidron had done so magnificently well in directing Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit. Here, with her documentary review of sex-for-sale in New York, there was a lack of cohesion. It was brave and honest, and neither glamorised nor demonised the protagonists, but as a programme it might have worked better if the fat young pimp, 'Junior' (who did an amazing consumer survey of street walkers with the camera on the floor of the limo) had acted as host throughout. The Railway Station Man on December 30 was promoted as the film in BBC2's 'Screen Two' series which brought together Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland for the first time since their splendidly erotic bedroom scene in Don't Look Now 20 years ago. Both, though especially Christie, still looked good and, sure enough, there did still appear to be some sort of electric charge between them. The drama, scripted by Shelagh Delaney from a book by Jennifer Johnston, seemed deceptively slight, in the manner of William Trevor. A story of love, politics, and the baffling power of art, it keeps on growing in the memory.                          *      *      * And now, in the past few days, new series have begun to stream onto the screen. Health And Efficiency (nothing to do with monochrome photos of air-brushed nudists) on BBC1 on Thursdays is that rare phenomenon, a new British comedy which looks as though it may actually prove funny. The hospital setting is nothing new, but having marketing experts and a management gorgon at the centre of affairs is. No promises, mind, because opening episodes can be irritatingly unrepresentative, but this appears to have potential. On paper Broadway Stories (Channel 4, Saturdays) also looks like a winner, but not on screen. Mike McShane, the outsize Canadian known from Whose Line Is It Anyway and as Sandy Toksvig's partner in The Big One, narrates Damon Runyon stories. We know how effective the lone actor/narrator can be from Alan Bennett's unforgettable Talking Heads, and McShane has shown himself to be a gifted comedy actor and possibly even a talented comedian. Yet the first episode did not work. Having McShane cook himself up a hot drink in a freezing New York apartment while telling the story was oddly distracting. BBC1's new Sunday teatime serial, Smokescreen, may be popular, and it certainly has strengths: a reasonable budget by the look of things, Timothy West in a leading role, and an interesting milieu - early cinema in northern England. Unfortunately, like so many previous British costume dramas, this one appears to be in love with its period artefacts and locations. From the museum-condition vintage motors to the cobbles in the street, nothing is allowed to pass without a loving caress from the camera and a nudge to the viewers; after all, children may be watching and they need to have such things brought to their attention. This is British steam train drama of the most mannered sort . . . though the story may yet prove strong enough to distract us. It seemed odd for BBC2 to screen the two-part Art Of Conducting on BBC2 on Sunday and Monday so soon after the jokey and telling Omnibus on BBC1, 'Everything You Wanted To Know About Conductors', although this BBC2 offering was a more classic documentary. A veritable catalogue of clips showed how keen Hollywood and television have been on these artistic show-offs, and indicated again what a significant tool television has become in modern history. Here is one more subject where television is obviously far more powerful and useful than any book. The first episode of Auction (BBC2 again) was schemed in such a way that events inside Sotheby's were made to seem as exciting as, and not unlike, the proceedings at those Antiques Roadshow rallies. A Pounds 4.5m Goya with impeccable provenance was the centrepiece of a sale which also included a Dutch panel painting taken from under her bed by a woman in Stockport and sold, at Pounds 33,000, for twice its estimated value. More revelations about Sotheby's charges (one per cent of the hammer price and Pounds 500 catalogue charges to the vendor) would be even more interesting. It will be surprising if there is a better classic British thriller this year than A Dark Adapted Eye, shown by BBC1 on January 1 and 2. A story of secrets within a middle class family, of eccentricity bordering on madness, of suppressed emotion in rural communities, and hidden passion abroad, it was an outstanding example of what has become a strong tradition in British television. Yet again Celia Imrie, this time playing a quietly neurotic wife buried in a picturebook Suffolk cottage, gave a performance of great intensity and power. Though it broke no new ground, this production created an atmosphere and a sense of period that you could almost smell and feel. If there is as much good television in every other week of 1994 as in Week 1 we shall have nothing to complain about.</p>

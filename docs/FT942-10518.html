			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Jamaica sells 70% of state carrier The Jamaican government has sold 70 per cent of Air Jamaica to a consortium of local and Canadian investors for USDollars 26.5m. The disposal is the first of what is expected to be a series of sales of several of the Caribbean's loss-making carriers. A further 5 per cent of Air Jamaica will be offered to employees with the government retaining 25 per cent. The government will take responsibility for all liabilities which exceed the value of the current assets, said Mr P. J. Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister. 'Liabilities far outweigh assets and the government will be writing off a significant amount,' said a company official. The consortium taking control of Air Jamaica says that the carrier will be capitalised at Dollars 52.5m, and that the funds will be raised from Jamaican and Canadian sources. The government has been seeking a buyer for Air Jamaica for four years. The airline has recorded continuing losses, including a deficit of just over Dollars 20m last year. The deal coincides with a move by several other Caribbean governments to merge their airlines. They have invited British Airways to take a 25 per cent stake in the venture. Regional officials say that BA is carrying out a feasibility study of the scheme. The governments intend to start with the merger of the operations of Air Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago Airways, which runs BWIA International. The new regional company will later be expanded with the inclusion of Bahamasair, the Guyana Airways Corporation, and Leeward Islands Air Transport, an island-hopping commuter airline which is owned by several governments.</p>

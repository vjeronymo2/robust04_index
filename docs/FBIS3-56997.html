[Begin Nazarbayev recording, in Russian] During our  negotiations with President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk in Kiev  yesterday, and during our conversation with chairman of the  Dnepropetrovsk oblast administration Pavlo Ivanovych  [Lazarenko], we were saying how greatly our economic ties have  diminished in these past few years! Last year alone, the trade  turnover between Russia and Kazakhstan amounted to 1.650 billion  dollars. Experts believe it should equal 5 or 6 billion.    Kazakhstan used to have terrific ties with Dnepropetrovsk  oblast alone, and now they are reduced by 50 percent. What does  it mean? No goods are supplied to Kazakhstan while people are  losing jobs here. When no relevant products are supplied to us,  we are unable to launch a certain production line. Everybody  loses in the long run.    Now that we have recovered from euphoria and grasped the  situation, we must gradually set up horizontal ties. We must  all now think how we can bring people together, how we can lift  the border barriers, how we can establish freedom of movement,  and how we can help each other's economies find their feet  again?

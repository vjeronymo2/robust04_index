			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Canadians warned over No vote: Economic arguments grow louder ahead of referendum FORCES campaigning in support of Canada's proposed new constitution are warning of the economic cost of a No vote in next month's referendum. The economic argument has become more vociferous as opinion polls show increasing support for the No campaigners in Quebec and the western provinces of British Columbia and Alberta. According to a poll by Angus Reid Associates, half the voters in the two western provinces plan to vote No in the October 26 referendum, against 34 per cent who support the new constitutional proposals. In Quebec, opponents outnumber supporters by 45 per cent to 38 per cent. Supporters of the deal, including all three main political parties and premiers of the 10 provinces, are trying to convince voters that the proposals - though imperfect - offer the best way to preserve national unity and avoid economic uncertainty. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has also been underlining the likely economic cost of a No vote. Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, has painted a bleak picture of a break-up of Canada. The bank estimated in a detailed study that the growth rate of a fragmented country would average only 1 per cent a year over the next decade, compared with 3 per cent if the country stayed intact. Unemployment by the end of the century would be in the 10-15 per cent range, against 7-11 per cent in an undivided country. The bank said that 'uncertainty about political and economic changes would greatly reduce the availability, and increase the cost of, international capital to the Canadian economy and would undermine domestic investor and consumer confidence.' However, opponents of the constitutional deal, known as the Charlottetown Agreement, contend it will not bring political and economic calm. Led by Quebec nationalists - and westerners who argue that the deal gives away too much to the francophone province - they argue that the perennial tensions between French and English-speaking Canadians will remain unresolved. A large body of opinion in British Columbia, which has the fastest-growing population in the country, is especially upset at a provision guaranteeing Quebec 25 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons. Quebec separatists, on the other hand, claim the agreement fails to meet the province's demands for greater autonomy. Supporters of the deal remain confident of turning the tide of public opinion before October 26. Their highly organised and strongly financed campaign will only reach full pitch next week with a TV advertising blitz and pamphlets sent to every Canadian home. They are also pinning their hopes on a relatively large proportion of undecided voters who are said to be susceptible to arguments of the economic damage which might be caused by rejection of the Charlottetown deal.</p>

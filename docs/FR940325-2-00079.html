The meeting will begin each day at 8:30 a.m. and end at 7 p.m. on April 11 and at 12:30 p.m. on April 12. The Panel is a group of special consultants to the Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD), NIH, established to recommend guidelines for Federal funding of research involving the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex utero <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  human embryo resulting from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in vitro  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> fertilization or other sources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NIH received a number of applications for support in this area and in the related field of parthenogenesis. However, before proceeding with the consideration of specific human embryo research proposals for funding the NIH must address the profound moral and ethical issues raised by the use of human embryo in research and develop guidelines to govern the review and conduct of Federally-funded research. The Panel's charge is to consider various areas of research involving the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex utero  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> human embryo and provide advice as to those areas it views to be acceptable for Federal funding, areas that warrant additional review, and areas that are unacceptable for Federal support. For those areas of research considered acceptable for Federal funding, the Panel will recommend specific guidelines for the review and conduct of this research. Issues related to human germ-line gene modification are not within the Panel's purview. The Panel's final report will be presented to the ACD for review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During part of its first and second meeting, the Panel reviewed the wide range of scientific and human health benefits that could result from governmental support of research involving the human embryo. At the third meeting, Panel deliberations will focus on the following issues: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The competing ethical frameworks with respect to the moral status of the human embryo. The acceptability of human embryo research from the point of gastrulation (the beginning of the process that culminates in the formation of the primitive streak). Issues raised by research on human embryo that will not be transferred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethically acceptable sources of human embryo or eggs, informed consent requirements, issues raised by compensation of sperm/egg providers, and concerns regarding commercialization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The need for additional mechanisms for the review, evaluation, and monitoring of human embryo research at local and/or national levels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NIH continues to seek public comment on these and other issues raised by Federal funding of human embryo research and encourages interested individuals and organizations to share with the Panel their views and perspectives on these important matters. Those who wish to submit written comments of any length should forward these to Steven Muller, Ph.D., Chair, NIH Human Embryo Research Panel,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> c/o National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 1, room 218, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. To ensure that public input is available to the Panel during its deliberations, written comments should be received in advance of the Panel's fourth scheduled meeting, May 4, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As with previous meetings of the Panel, an opportunity is also being provided at the April meeting for interested individuals and organizations to make brief oral presentations to the Panel. To register to make an oral statement before the Panel, individuals and organizations should contact Ms. Peggy Schnoor at the NIH by telephoning 301&hyph;496&hyph;1454 or by sending a facsimile message to 301&hyph;402&hyph;0280 or 301&hyph;402&hyph;1759. Oral statements must not exceed five minutes in length, and a copy of the remarks should be forwarded to the above address one week in advance of the scheduled presentation date. Opportunities to present statements will be determined by the order in which requests are received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NIH will endeavor to provide seating for all members of the public who wish to attend the meetings. Individuals are, however, asked to notify the NIH of their interest in attending by using the telephone or facsimile numbers listed above. Individuals who require special accommodations are also asked to contact Ms. Schnoor at the above number. General questions about the Panel or future meetings should also be directed to Ms. Schnoor. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 18, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Ruth L.

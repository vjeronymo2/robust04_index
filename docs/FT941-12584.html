			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Title switch for Terry Venables Mr Terry Venables' job title when he takes over the running of the England football team will be 'coach' and not 'manager', the Football Association, the governing body of English soccer, announced yesterday. Mr David Davies, FA director of public affairs, said Mr Venables would not inherit the limited administrative and commercial responsibilities exercised by his predecessor, Mr Graham Taylor. The change in title reflects the FA's desire to emphasise that it is restructuring English international football following the country's failure to qualify for this year's World Cup. It is not a substantial change in the job. Mr Davies said yesterday's press conference at Wembley stadium to announce Mr Venables' appointment was 'the biggest attendance in English football for this sort of event'. Mr Venables said he intended to pursue both his action against Tottenham Hotspur for wrongful dismissal and to sue BBC TV for libel over a Panorama programme about his financial dealings.</p>

Or is he like King Canute who ordered the sea not to  make waves?  </P> <P> For as long as American servicemen live in a desolate and hostile environment  without beer, booze, female companionship, television, girlie magazines and  other things that relieve boredom, there will be a morale problem, Gen. Gray's  command notwithstanding.  </P> <P> VICENTE ABAD-SANTOS  </P> <P> Pomona  </P></p>

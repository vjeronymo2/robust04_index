			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Takeover hints boost Sun A SUDDEN burst of heavy buying interest in Sun Alliance, the composite insurance group, triggered a strong rise in the shares as the market responded to what was perceived as the whiff of stakebuilding, perhaps a prelude to takeover moves. The stock jumped 16 to 344p, within a whisker of the year's high of 350p. Takeover speculation flared after several abnormally large individual trades appeared on the Seaq ticker. Deals included 4m shares at 340p, 3.6m at 340p and 4m at 340 1/2 p. A block of 4m shares would represent around 0.5 per cent of the equity. Turnover finally totalled 16m shares, the heaviest day's activity since mid-September, when the insurance group sold its 60m share stake in Commercial Union. Before that, turnover in Sun Alliance had never topped the 14m mark since the mid-1980s. The strength of yesterday's buying interest led to stories of stakebuilding moves. Favourite names for a move against Sun Alliance included French insurance companies AXA, AGF and UAP and Germany's Allianz. Analysts doubted the likelihood of a bid from either Allianz or UAP but saw strong possibility that Eagle Star, subsidiary of BAT Industries, might strike. Heavy trade in Asda Food retailer Asda Group recorded its biggest ever daily turnover after turning in results well ahead of market expectations, prompting a welter of profit upgrades from analysts. Over 100m shares were traded, the price lifting 7 1/2 to 61p, as dealers reported good two-way business. Asda shares, which have risen from a low of 23p in early August, have generated consistent high turnover as investors have been split between those believing in the recovery potential and those deciding to take profits on last year's rights issue price of 35p. Yesterday it was the recovery story which found most favour following the turnaround in Asda'a fortune from a Pounds 68.8m interim loss into profits of Pounds 54.8m. The market had been expecting profits of around Pounds 40m. Analysts lifted full-year forecasts from around Pounds 105m to a range of Pounds 120m-Pounds 135m. However, while applauding the group's performance, analysts also struck a note of caution. Advising a hold on the shares, Mr Andrew Burnett at County NatWest said that the difficult trading conditions in the food retail sector would impinge on Asda's earnings growth potential over the next two years. Others warned that it was also likely to be affected by its relatively low capital expenditure on new stores. The Ofgas recommendation for a break-up of British Gas continued to stimulate demand for Gas shares which moved up 3 1/2 more to 276 1/2 p on 8.8m BP, meanwhile, were aggressively bought by US investors amid stories that a number of the leading US brokerages are about to issue strong buy notes on the company. American investors speak for almost 22 per cent of BP shares. US analysts see the company as one of the most highly geared recovery plays in the oil sector, although this is not the view adopted by many UK oil analysts. BP shares moved up 6 to 229p on heavy turnover of 12m. American buying spilled over into Shell where the shares rose 7 to 551p on 3.7m Burmah Castrol's strong run gathered pace with the recent BZW buy recommendation uncovering a stock shortage and driving the shares up 19 to 722p. Some sizeable switching operations, out of both classes of HSBC stock - because of the recent bearish news emanating from Hong Kong and the sell note from County NatWest - brought renewed pressure to bear on HSBC London-registered stock, down 7 at 459p and the Hong Kong registered stock, down 11 more to 442p. Standard Chartered also reflected the unease about Hong Kong and dropped 4 to 546p. Barclays marked time at 379p as analysts chopped current year forecasts. But Lloyds, 10 higher at 508p, and NatWest, 7 firmer at 406p, were beneficiaries of the switching, as were Royal Bank of Scotland, 11 higher at 210p. Rumours surrounding Sun Alliance prompted good support for Commercial Union, 10 up at 608p, and General Accident, the same amount higher at 570p. The building materials and contracting sectors of the market attracted buying interest as institutions responsed to analysts' suggestions that the turning point in the housing market could have arrived. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors has published a report suggesting a more promising outlook for the housing market. Blue Circle, boosted by a a mixture of takeover speculation and recovery hopes, jumped 15 to 201p. Strong buying ahead of an anticipated economic recovery was seen in British Aerospace. The shares jumped 14 to 167p. Selling in the traded options led to a fall in Rolls-Royce shares in the last half hour of trading. They fell 5 1/2 to 108 1/2 p, with sentiment further weakened by a profits downgrading from broker Williams de Broe. Discussions with analysts suggesting British Airways was unlikely to have a rights issue to pay for its 25 per cent stake in Australian airline Qantas led to strong demand for the stock. They jumped 15 to 296p, in trade of 4.7m. The EC agreement on banana imports sent shares in Geest soaring. One analyst estimated that earnings in the fruit producer could rise by as much as 50 per cent from 1994 as a result. The shares jumped 53 to 343p. Heavy trading in Queens Moat Houses saw the shares move forward as several houses turned buyer of the stock. The shares had been weak all week after BZW, the hotel group's joint broker, downgraded. However, after a series of presentations from the company, some felt the price fall to be overdone and yesterday Paribas, County NatWest and Hoare Govett were among those recommending the stock. The price rose 4 to 38p in turnover of 18m. The decision not to award the Channel 5 licence to Thames Television sent the shares reeling, down 22 at 158p. Carlton Communications was heartened by the news, adding 21 to 739p.

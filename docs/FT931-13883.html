			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Farmers reap rich public relations crop In recent years, farmers in the big industrialised countries have been responsible for some of the most successful public relations campaigns ever launched. In countries such as Japan, the US and France, the result has been an accumulation of political power and protection as well as economic and commercial clout on a scale out of all proportion to their relatively small numbers and the amount of money spent. In this special marketing report, FT writers look at some of the media and lobbying techniques that have been so successfully employed. Japan cultivates a culture WHEN Japanese farmers last month took to the Tokyo streets in tractors to show anger at proposed rice market reforms, each of the pre-selected 50 tractors was assigned a number and all were driven in an orderly formation along a pre-arranged route to ensure that there would be no unscripted inconvenience to fellow Japanese. In planning protests such as the tractor drive, the farmers' movement wants to highlight rice as the essence of Japanese culture and farmers as the protectors of that tradition. But the strategy generally does not include the shock tactics employed by European farmers, as such rowdiness is regarded as a threat to the image of the stoic farmer who braves the elements to fill the family rice cooker each evening and preserve a semi-spiritual ritual. Apart from fostering the folksy image, the defence of the rice market campaign also includes undermining the reputation of foreign rice. Consumer groups contribute to the cause, as some of these organisations have links with Japan Agriculture, the farmers' representative body, and regularly produce pamphlets warning that foreign farmers use dangerous chemicals in food production. A video, 'Imported Rice is Dangerous', was produced last year by the well-meaning if protectionist Japan Offspring Fund, whose members have links to farmers' groups. The video traces the tragic lives of weevils in three containers of rice, one housing the homegrown product, another filled with Australian rice, and the third containing American rice. A flourishing family of 50 weevils was added to the US rice and, allegedly due to the effects of insecticides, 10 of the weevils were dead within four days. The fate of the weevils in the Australian rice was worse, with all 50 weevils passing away within a week. Naturally, the weevils in the Japanese rice lived happily ever after. At the time of the beef liberalisation debate four years ago, a short film made in praise of Japanese beef depicted a typical family becoming physically ill after consuming imported meat. After criticism from the US and Australia, the film was shelved, and Japanese government officials advised agricultural groups to employ more subtle means in their campaign to protect markets. Officially, 6.7 per cent of Japanese earn their living through primary industry, down from 48.3 per cent in 1950 and 30.2 per cent in 1960, though the actual number relying solely on agriculture for income is estimated at 3 per cent. Convincing the rest of the population to subsidise these lifestyles through taxation and by paying six times more than the world price for rice has generally been made easier because rice is an important symbol for Japan. On JA billboards, farmers are pictured in muddy paddy fields or atop small tractors at harvest time, but the message remains much the same - these farmers are not merely raising a crop, they are cultivating a culture. To enhance that image for city slickers, most local farmers' associations conduct tours of rice growing areas and allow the urban man or woman to meet rural people. Most urban Japanese have rural roots, but the links have become more tenuous with each new generation. In an attempt to interest younger Japanese in the issue, farmers have embraced the 'environment' theme, arguing that the countryside would be devastated if the paddy fields were concreted and warning that flooding could become more common because of the change in the landscape. A 'bucket rice' campaign is designed to bring the joys of life on the land to those who must endure small apartments in Tokyo or Osaka. Farmers delivered rice seeds, fertiliser and instructions to 200,000 urban dwellers, who then raised their own small crop in a bucket. A JA official said the campaign educated children 'who don't know when a rice plant matures' and allowed city families to eat their own rice, re-establishing their link with nature. Fourteen rice producers' organisations have launched a Y700m (Pounds 3.7m) advertising campaign to make rice more appetising for Japanese youth, as national consumption has fallen annually by 1.5-2 per cent over the past decade. The idea of the campaign, one sponsor explained, is to convey a strong visual impression, so that when a young person is hungry they will immediately think of rice. US takes the message to heart ALTHOUGH weary of high taxes and wary of the budget deficit, Americans this year will pay out to their farmers subsidies worth about Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11bn), almost twice as much as in 1992. Outside Washington DC, where the federal budget cutters are frantic for new prey, almost no one will complain. Americans are likely to donate Dollars 1m-Dollars 2m to farmers down on their luck through Farm Aid in April, when country singer Willie Nelson and his friends turn out for their sixth fundraising concert. Americans are pre-disposed to revere the farmer, from the time they are children singing 'Old MacDonald' to their first picture books about Farmer Bill and his barnyard animals. A large number are still only one or two generations away from the farm. A romantic image has emerged of honest, hardworking farm families struggling against drought, blizzards and big government. For Americans fed up with the strains of urban life or the commute from the suburbs, the farmer remains a nostalgic symbol of times when life was simple. A CBS/New York Times poll, taken in 1986 at the height of the US farm crisis, found that 55 per cent of Americans would pay higher taxes to help farmers. 'Americans think farmers deserve special treatment,' the poll concluded. 'A majority think keeping small farms in operation is so important that the government should make a special effort to keep small farms in business. Relatively few blame the farmers themselves for their difficulties.' These perceptions persist today, and are aided and abetted by sympathetic journalists and movie makers, who are carefully cultivated by industry 'outreach' programmes. The State Association of Co-operatives, for example, promotes a Weekend at the Farm scheme for public officials, congressional aides and journalists. Besides the Four-H clubs and Future Farmers of America organisations, which promote farming-related activities in schools, funding from state and federal level and agribusinesses goes to Agriculture in the Classroom. The programme educates children in the cities and suburbs about farming. Communicating for Agriculture, a non-profit organisation with 80,000 members, is a powerful lobby for farmer interests at both state and national levels. It convinced 27 states to create insurance pools for farmers who cannot get catastrophic health insurance. It also brings foreign students to US farms and awards scholarships. The large agribusiness companies which dominate many sectors of US agriculture are reluctant to disclose details of their image-enhancing efforts. But they have been quick to capitalise on the family farmers' positive image in television advertising. 'Every year the importance of this land increases,' says the Archer Daniels Midland Company in one of its slick television spots. 'Because every year there are a lot more mouths to feed - over 95m more. Fortunately, the food ingredients that ADM makes from an American harvest can help feed people the world over.' It is not by coincidence, notes one farm lobbyist, that ADM is receiving subsidies for ethanol and price supports for the maize used in sweeteners. 'Commercials often promote a vision of agriculture that is beautiful and colourful,' said Jeff Smedsrud, a Communications for Agriculture official. 'But I'm not at all sure it is that accurate. The public has no clue about the reality of modern agriculture.' Carol Brookins, a Washington DC agriculture consultant, says the public receives a distorted view of farmers. 'There is not the perception that agriculture is a modern dynamic contributor to the US economy and a creative and innovative industry.' When it comes to marketing their products, farmers have shown they are by no means country bumpkins. The various commodity groups - ranging from beef and dairy farmers to watermelon producers - organise co-operative advertising and marketing campaigns. One of the most successful is the National Pork Producer Council's 'Pork, the Other White Meat'. It was launched five years ago, when concern over the high fat content of meat was depressing per capita consumption an average 4.5 per cent a year. Since then, sales have risen between 0.5 and 1 per cent a year with each 1 per cent gain representing an additional Dollars 200m in sales. It is compelling evidence that a group of farmers, who were thought to be an endangered species, can survive and thrive by harnessing modern marketing methods to an old-fashioned image. France blends shock with sweet reason FRENCH farming organisations have a misleading international image of resorting solely to organised disruption to get their message over to the public. Television images of manure-spattered town halls, mounds of burning produce and spectacular traffic jams caused by tractor road-blocks are perceived by many to be the stock in trade of France's irascible farmers, in their demonstrations against the production and price cuts imposed by reforms of the European Community's common agricultural policy. Certainly, the temperature has increased as the CAP reforms begin to bite, yet the French farmers' communications strategy is more complicated and subtle than that. Officially, the body responsible for shaping and delivering the agriculture industry's message to the public is the main union, the Federation Nationale des Syndicats d'Exploitants Agricoles (FNSEA). Yet holding a common line is hard for the FNSEA because it is a fragmented federation, including under its vast umbrella farming unions from France's 96 mainland departments, stretching from the rich cereal growing plains around Paris to the poor smallholders of the south-west. 'We are always debating within ourselves whether we should appeal to public opinion or, as many of our farming members would like, put our message over in a more challenging style,' explains Benedicte Caille, head of external relations for the FNSEA. FNSEA's official communications style is moderate, yet in practice it cannot control some of the more disruptive publicity stunts organised at local level. One example of the official marketing approach is when the Centre National des Jeunes Agriculteurs, the young farmers' union, decorated the Champs Elysees with a field of ripe wheat three years ago. A charm offensive was the purpose of the largest farming demonstration in France in recent years, when 200,000 farmers descended on Paris to protest against the CAP in September 1991. Departmental unions 'twinned' themselves with Paris arrondissements, making themselves responsible for setting up stalls with local produce, offering free food and wine tasting. 'The idea was to help Parisians rediscover their roots, to remind them that we represent an important part of their culture,' explains Caille. Another part of the FNSEA's charm offensive is a scheme launched two years ago to invite school children for educational visits to local farms. The scheme attracted 35,000 visitors in 1990, rising to about 200,000 last year, says the federation. In some ways, the FNSEA has to work less hard than other European farm unions to deliver its message. About a fifth of the French population owes some of its living directly or indirectly to agriculture and most national politicians carefully preserve a provincial power base. On top of this, the FNSEA has the rare privilege of being granted four free 10-minute slots a year on the two state-owned television channels, by the CSA broadcasting authority. Its latest production was clumsily made, with the pretty young narrator delivering her message perched on a bicycle which improbably appeared to be in the middle of a field of corn. Even so, it drove home the message of the friendly farmer, taking environmental protection as its theme. Yet the moderates do not always win the day in FNSEA debates on publicity strategy. Many farmers were so disappointed with the moderate tone of the big Paris demonstration in 1991 that they left the FNSEA to form their own splinter group, called the Co-ordination Rurale. The new organisation, which has about 10,000 members, represents the sharp end of farmers' protests and organised a series of successful motorway road blocks last summer, setting an example for the truck drivers, who used the same technique to bring most of France to a halt for several days last year. Another popular tactic by local farmers recently has been to dump truckloads of mud on the streets outside local government offices. This, says Caille, is designed to represent land that has been taken out of production under CAP rules. It is a stark contrast to the days of laying wheat fields on the Champs Elysees. UK goes against the grain BRITISH farmers are not given to concerted mass dumpings of cartloads of manure outside parliament as a means of persuasion. Many of them are angry - often with the plethora of marketing and promotional organisations supposedly backing their causes. But one of their main lobbying conduits, the 85-year-old National Farmers' Union, encourages a careful, regular lobbying of key targets in government, media and consumer groups as the best means of getting a fair hearing. The UK's 100,000 farmers are a heterogeneous bunch; the 1,000-hectare arable East Anglian faces quite dissimilar problems from the Welsh hill farmer with a few hundred sheep. But they share an uncertain future. EC legislation threatens to cut their incomes. Consumer suspicion over Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy scares in beef, salmonella disease in eggs, growth hormones, pesticides and battery farming has damaged the social standing of farming. During the second world war, British farmers were almost revered for feeding the nation in desperate times. That image has faded even as the economic desperation of some farmers has increased - 46,000 farmers, wives and their children left farming during 1991-92, according to government statistics. Organisations backing farming attempt to counter adverse public opinion. In 1992, the Meat and Livestock Commission spent about Pounds 1.5m on an advertising campaign aimed at the consumer, under the somewhat desperate-sounding slogan 'Meat To Live'. The MLC and its steadfast opponent, the Vegetarian Society, are fighting a propaganda battle in the country's schools, inundating them with free promotional materials. As for the NFU, their lobbyists have limited resources compared with some of their international sister organisations. While it runs a wide variety of events, newsletters and seminars supportive of farming, it has resisted generic 'buy British' advertising, both because such campaigns are already run by separate marketing bodies (such as the MLC and the National Dairy Council) and because, as Anne Dillon, head of public affairs at the NFU, puts it, 'there isn't a 'buy British' culture any more'. Dillon spends considerable time trying to persuade the farming community that the best public relations - and therefore increased chances of political success - today means tackling not just Westminster but also the general public. Dillon believes that to retain political clout, farmers must start at stubble level by regaining the confidence of consumers through a combination of relationship-building with important media and consumer bodies and by encouraging farmers to be more willing to take on an expanded role, promoting themselves as defenders of rural Britain and not just food producers. When she joined the NFU three years ago, Dillon initiated a three-stage public affairs strategy, developing links with the women's press - on the basis that women make most domestic food purchasing decisions - and paying greater attention to local media. What is ruled out is throwing bricks at police and starting bonfires in public highways: 'There is no evidence that setting fire to parking meters or peeing against trees in front of TV cameras - as has happened on the Continent - is any more successful than a realistic and sensible negotiation with the community that you live in or the people who represent you. 'We get much more success with the press by saying: 'You don't believe there are problems with incomes in farming? Here are three farming families, talk to them and make up your own mind.' If we said: 'Here are 350 farmers who are going to set fire to trees in Hyde Park' that would have been put down as typical farmers' bullying.' It may be the case that British farmers have little choice but to tread gently and carefully; they lack the numerical muscle and social esteem of their counterparts elsewhere. But they are listened to by government. David Naish, NFU president, has just been appointed by John Major, the prime minister, to head a special task force, one of the aims being to see how producers and retailers can meet each other's requirements with supplies of British food. But for Dillon, visibility is not commensurate with success: 'When last year the proposed terms for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy were first on the table they would have removed a great number of family farms in the UK. By the time we had finished negotiating with the government, and it in turn had finished negotiating in the EC, it was worth another Pounds 700m. That's not an inconsequential sum of money, without setting fire to parking meters.'</p>

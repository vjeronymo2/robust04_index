			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Nurdin &amp; Peacock ahead at Pounds 7m NURDIN &amp; Peacock, the cash and carry operator, said yesterday the second of its US-style cut price warehouses would open as planned next summer in spite of 'petulant' attempts to 'stifle' the project by a national retailer. The company faces a judicial review of planning permission, sparked by Sainsbury, which could push up costs at its second site, which is in the West Midlands. Mr Nigel Hall, finance director, said: 'We think this is a petulant attempt to stifle a project which is clearly in the consumer interest.' Announcing half-year underlying pre-tax profits up 4 per cent on sales down by a similar amount and volumes off 9 per cent, Mr Dickie Fulford, chairman, said the first warehouse was on schedule: 'The Cargo Club warehouse at Croydon is under construction and will open in March 1994.' Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 5.59m to Pounds 7.07m in the six months to July 2, flattered by one-off costs of Pounds 1.3m in the comparative figure. Turnover fell to Pounds 677.9m (Pounds 704.1m). Better control of costs and stock levels helped operating profit margins rise to 0.9 per cent (0.7 per cent). Mr Fulford said: 'The results reflect the continuing severity of the economic environment and the competition for the business of independent grocers and caterers. This has been offset by further improvements in operating efficiency.' The Glasgow trade and business centre, launched in 1992, continued to perform up to expectations. The company is extending its buying procedures and selecting merchandise ahead of the opening of the Croydon development. The company believed it had gained market share 'from all the other operators' in its core and carry business of 46 outlets mainly in the south-east. It also believed that the independent grocery sector had declined by about 10 per cent over the last 12 months as consumer spending switched to supermarkets and some rivals were forced out of business. It received Pounds 555,000 (Pounds 1.09m) in interest as rates fell. Earnings per share rose to 3.86p (3.08p) and the interim dividend is being increased to 2.06p (1.96p).</p>

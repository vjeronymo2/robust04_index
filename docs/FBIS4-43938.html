			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Carlo Maria Santoro: "Farewell to Little Italy"] </F>   [Text] The country has neglected its international affairs.  It can now play the role of a medium-sized power focusing mainly  on Europe. The author of this article is a professor of  international relations at the University of Milan's Department  of Political Science.    Foreign policy is back in the news after a long hiatus.  Immersed as we have been in the collective psychodrama of the  change of political system, the elections, and the new  government, the external world seems to have disappeared. When a  political system collapses and a new coalition is formed, with  new political forces, it is natural for attention to be focused  on domestic policy.    This is so true that the sole controversy to arise during  the  brief period of the forming of the Berlusconi government  concerned the designation of the minister of interior rather  than that of the foreign minister. On the other hand, the  tendency to neglect its foreign policy and concentrate on its  domestic policy is part of the Italian tradition dating back to  the postwar era. During that period, however, there was the  bipolar international system, which marginalized the role of the  weaker players and in any case guaranteed Italy's security. But  today, things are radically different, and for at least two  fundamental reasons. First, because Italy has a government made  up of a new political elite that has yet to demonstrate its  ability to project itself to the outside world. And second,  because the others are watching us, and frequently voice  criticism.    Regarding the first point, there is nothing to say or do but  await the testing of the new government, then evaluate its  performance. On the second point, however, there is much to be  said. It seems to us, in fact, that the reactions of some of our  allies and friends, in Europe and even across the Atlantic, have  been at the same time lively, somewhat conformist, but above  all, exceedingly of alarm.    The prime minister did well in Rome, as did the foreign  minister in Brussels and Washington, to reassure them and  emphasize the continuity of and the government's adherence to  Italy's alliances. Even so, it is evident that the new  government will have to change some things in foreign policy as  well. Not so much in substance, which seems to be the fear of  some abroad, as in style, which does not mean a nation's  external manners, but rather the synthesis of its political  behavior, or more precisely the image presented to the outside  world by a nation.    The style of Italy's foreign policy during the postwar  period  was essentially characterized by a low-profile approach; that  is, an approach lacking initiative or imagination. In substance,  its style expressed a way of being on the scene that was  conformist and flatly aligned with the decisions of its major  allies. This approach, rooted in ideology, translated  frequently into imitative decisions, and sometimes into flights  from reality.    Europe, for example, as an institutional plan of  unification,  is and remains, together with NATO, one of the two cornerstones  of Italian foreign policy. No thinking person today could make a  case for being against this concept of Europe, just as, for  years now, no political party except Communist Renewal has been  opposed to NATO. Indeed, the polls indicate that Italians are  the most Europe-minded of all. Why, then, should anyone be  worried? To succeed in changing for the better, it is probably  necessary to revisit some key concepts that have been buried in  oblivion by the dominant ideologies. The first of these should  be that of national interest, an indispensable prerequisite for  any European policy. Then there is the international role of a  country that has always confused its role with rank; that is,  settled for second best. And lastly, there is need to reflect on  the concept of Italy as a medium-sized power; that is, as a  national player operating in a geopolitical and regional  economic context in which, by the force of things, it will be  compelled to take a position. By habit, dating back to a distant  past, Italian foreign policy has been characterized  alternatively by either the frustrated and fanciful ambitions of  a great power, or the fears and excessive bashfulness of a small  power. To update its foreign policy, therefore, Italy needs to  recognize the fact that it is a medium-sized power, that it is a  player operating within a grid of international alliances made  up of autonomous actors, just as France, Great Britain, or Spain  are.    In other words, Italian foreign policy must recognize the  fact that, with the United States in the process of  disengagement, Germany aiming at a political rebirth, and a  Europe partly in trouble, Italy cannot once again decline to be  present in those areas in which none of its allies are  interested. It is therefore neither a question of contesting  alliances or revising boundaries, nor one of continuing the old  way of choosing ideologies, whereby political adversaries are by  definition mortal enemies to be demonized.    If these premises are taken as a basis, the principal lines  of Italy's future foreign policy can already be outlined. If its  style is made more incisive, and if the compass indicating the  direction of Italy's foreign policy points, as it always should  have, toward our national interest and recognition of our role  as a medium-sized power operating in a predetermined context of  alliances, it will no longer be necessary to respond to the  captious questions of our allies, and to the less elegant  caveats of our neighbors to our east and south.</p>

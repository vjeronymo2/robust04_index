			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luc Desmet: "Military Technology for Civilians"] </F>   [Text] Belgian Advanced Technology Systems (BATS) supplied  battlefield surveillance radars to the Belgian army and thus  developed expertise in signal processing. It now wants to enter  the civilian market.    At the request of the military market, BATS developed radars  which are linked to other sensors, for example Doppler devices  with video, infrared cameras, or image intensifiers. "The  integration of radar with image technology provides an entirely  different type of surveillance system," according to Gerald  Lejeune, marketing director of BATS in the Sart Tilman  technology park at Angleur near Liege. "The EUCLID (European  Cooperation for the Long Term in Defense) consortium is talking  about data fusion."    BATS is now expanding on its experience with the SCB-2130A  field radar. SCB stands for "Surveillance du Champ de Bataille"  [Battlefield Surveillance]. Since 1990, the company has  supplied 25 radars of this type to the Belgian Army. This radar  has a range of between 100 meters and 33.5 km. It can "see"  tanks at a distance of 30 km and people at 15 km, but also  registers low-flying helicopters and ULM [undersea long-range  missile] equipment. The practised eye of the operator picks out  every dot on the Barco [Belgian electronics company] color  screen. The entire surrounding area can be mapped out. The  radar can operate in a network, via a connection to the BAMS  field radio.    "What is known as the 33-km line of sight is virtually  impossible to find in Belgium. The original intention was to  use the field radar in Germany," says Gerald Lejeune -- in  particular with reconnaissance troops in Dellbrueck, where the  radar would be fitted on top of three M-113 tanks in each of  seven platoons. The restructuring activities implemented by  Defense Minister Delcroix have turned these into four platoons,  with the radar on three M- 133's and one UNIMOG.    BATS is also exporting its radar. It has found customers in  South America, the Middle East, and in Europe, but for a total  of fewer than 20 orders. Gerald Lejeune denies that a BATS  radar was exported to South Africa via Brazil.    In Europe and elsewhere the company has issued tenders for  an  export version of the battlefield surveillance radar and the  border surveillance radar. The price of the export version is  between 10 and 15 million Belgian francs, depending on the  configuration.    "After all, every customer has individual requirements. If  we adapt the software, the equipment is suitable for still more  applications. An operational coastal version locates shipping  movements. The radar can monitor airfields or register the  impact of artillery and assist in directing the fire."  <H5>  Civilian Market </H5>   Through the battlefield surveillance radars, BATS' expertise  expanded in the field of signal processing. "We developed  algorithms that were integrated into neural networks, fuzzy  logic, and artificial intelligence," says G. Lejeune.    Up until two years ago, the company directed its expertise  exclusively toward the military market. Since then, however, it  has been seeking out commercial applications in the civilian  sector.    An attempt to launch an ESA space project bore no fruit. As  a partner in the European ESPRIT [European Strategic Program for  R&amp;D in Information Technologies] program, BATS is now  developing  a transmitter and a receiver for a wireless local area network.  "In an industrial environment, the transmitter eliminates  disturbing factors such as heat, vibration, shocks, and  electromagnetic and other fields, using frequency hopping and  spread spectrum. Until now, these techniques had only been used  in military applications," explains G. Lejeune. This year, BATS  is demonstrating its local area network in the Cockerill steel  plant.    "We are also developing the "autoreverse." This is a small  ultrasonic device mounted to the rear shock absorber of a  vehicle, which gives out a warning when the vehicle comes too  close to an obstacle."    The appliance is ready for mass production and contacts have  been established in France and the United Kingdom. "We are  hoping that services can be developed in the civilian sector in  signal processing, microwaves, real-time software, quality  control, and project management," says Lejeune. "If civilian  activities expand, then a sister company will probably be set  up."  <H5>  Other Products </H5>   BATS' first product was a ground navigation system, for  which  Taman of Israel bought the production license.    This inertial system tracks the positions of the Belgian  artillery and the reconnaissance troops' M-113 tanks, as well as  the Netherlands Patriot launchers in Germany.    BATS has also spent three years working on a training  simulator to train field radar operators in identifying typical  signatures. The Belgian Army is buying one of these.    With assistance from EUCLID, the company is working on an  automatic target classification system, and is now also offering  its software knowledge as a supplier. "For example, we would  really like to take part in SEROS II, the Air Force program that  monitors traffic over Belgium," explains Gerald Lejeune.    As part of the CARAPACE program, BATS has been promised 300  million francs in indirect compensations. However, there is as  yet no contract. Talks with main contractor Dassault  Electronique are continuing. "We are confident," says Gerald  Lejeune.    Within the C-130 modernization program, BATS is building the  so- called hot bench for Honeywell, due for completion at the  beginning of 1994. This is a test bench for aircraft  electronics.    The company also receives direct compensations within the  scope of the BEMILDAT program, which was allocated to the  Canadian Northern Telecom. Until the end of this year, it will  manufacture the electronic cards that will be integrated into  the final product. BATS is also looking for a way into data  fusion systems engineering.  <H5>  Mixed Origin </H5>   In 1991, BATS and its 43 employees achieved a turnover of  425  million francs. Last year, that figure increased to 1.1 billion  francs. Via Innotech, BATS is a 49 percent subsidiary of the  Flemish Regional Investment Company. It belongs 51 percent to  Eltem-Holding in Amsterdam -- a company with no employees.    BATS was founded in September 1984. This was three months  after the Ministry of Defense allocated 1.14 billion francs for  the development and production of 25 ultra-modern battlefield  surveillance radars. "Defense decided to develop its own radar  from scratch, to satisfy specific operational requirements,"  explains marketing director Gerald Lejeune.    The development took three years. Elta of Israel, part of  Israel Aircraft Industries, contributed its experience in  hyperfrequency.    BATS, as integrator, used the services of, among others,  Barco for the monitor, Britte for the precision mechanics, EMG  for the support system and Electronic Apparatus for the  circuitry. By the end of 1992, BATS had delivered all the  systems and the logistics phase began -- supplying replacement  parts and documentation, training and maintenance courses. The  contract covered both the development and the production and  improvement of the device. Since then, the company has  concluded 14 follow-up contracts.</p>

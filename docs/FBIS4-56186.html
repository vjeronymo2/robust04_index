			<p>BFN     [Text] The spokesman for President Aristide, Jean-Claude  Martineau, has reacted to the antidrug operation led by the  Haitian military authorities. The initiative has come too late,  according to the president's spokesman. Martineau reaffirmed  that the Haitian military authorities are involved up to the  hilt in drug trafficking.    [Begin Martineau recording, in Creole] A big drug dealer  made  a series of statements before the U.S. Senate, perhaps one week  ago. He stated before a U.S. Senate committee that [Lieutenant  Colonel] Michel Francois [Port-au-Prince police chief] is  involved up to the hilt in drug trafficking. Obviously, it was  not necessary for anyone to come tell us about that to know it.  Besides, this is something that President Aristide has been  denouncing for some times. We have heard that there is an  operation aimed at arresting drug dealers in Haiti. Why are they  trying to arrest those involved in drug trafficking (?only)  after this accusation, when they knew about it previously? [end  recording]    This was the spokesman for President Aristide, Jean-Claude  Martineau.</p>

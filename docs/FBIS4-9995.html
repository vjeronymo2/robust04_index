			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 4 Apr (EFE) -- At least 10 convicts were  wounded, some of them seriously, during a knife fight between  two factions of the Shining Path at the prison of Huancayo City,  in the Central Andes Region. The bloody fight was the outcome of  an "ideological debate" between one faction which supports  Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman, who wants to make peace with  the government, and another faction which rejects the proposal  and insists on continuing the "popular war" that it declared  against Peruvian democracy in 1980.    An officer of the Huamanccacca Prison of Huancayo reported  that the confrontation began when the dissident group called Red  Path [Sendero Rojo], which rejects peace, launched a harsh  verbal attack against Guzman during a Shining Path meeting in  which the subversive chief's peace proposal was being discussed.  Prison personnel and police had to separate the two factions,  the source reported.    Shining Path is experiencing a prolonged crisis, which began  with the capture of Guzman in September 1992 and which became  even more critical one year later when the gang divided in to  two factions because of the leader's proposal, who acknowledged  the political and military defeat of his organization.</p>

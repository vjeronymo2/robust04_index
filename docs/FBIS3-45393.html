			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 17 (XINHUA) -- A new social  security system has taken initial shape in China following 14  years of reform and has begun playing a major role in social  life.    With the deepening of the enterprise restructuring, the  introduction and perfection of the social security system are  essential to the success of reforms in other areas.    In China, social security includes old-age pension insurance  for employees in manufacturing, government offices and other  institutions in urban and rural areas, unemployment relief,  medical insurance, birth insurance and insurance for industrial  accidents.    Under the old planned economy the state was responsible for  providing unemployment relief, and employers for covering  virtually all their insurance.    Practice shows that that approach has failed to meet the  needs of a socialist market economy and a modern enterprise  system.    The new social security system will free enterprises,  especially major state-owned ones, from the burden of "running  society" -- taking charge of all employees' welfare -- so that  they will able to participate in fair market competition.    The funds for social security will come from mutual  assistance funds and will be distributed by relevant government  departments. Mutual assistance funds will come from the state,  enterprises and employees.    An official of the Labor Ministry said that the pension  insurance system has already been instituted in the overwhelming  majority of urban businesses. The nation's funds for old-age  pensions, shared by the state, employers and employees, now  total 30 billion yuan a year, he said.    He said that most provinces in China have begun to institute  an unemployment relief system, considered an urgent reform  measure. Under that system, enterprises withhold 0.6 to one  percent of their employees' wages as mutual-assistance  unemployment insurance funds.    As a result, the country can use 900 million yuan in such  funds annually to assist workers who have lost their jobs, he  said.    He also acknowledged that the reform of the medical  insurance  system is the "most difficult" task and is still in the  experimental stage.    Nationwide, the bulk of medical costs for most urban workers  are now still covered by their work units. In a change from the  past practice, however, workers now have to cover a portion of  their medical costs -- ranging from five percent to 20 percent.    The official said that the distribution of unemployment  relief funds has begun. For example, such funds were granted to  900,000 unemployed workers in 1993.    Insurance agencies attached to government labor departments  will give such funds to jobless workers in line with  internationally accepted practices. Furthermore, they will  train such workers and help them find new jobs.    To date, China has set up 2,200 training centers and 9,700  job placement agencies, he said.    Medical insurance costs are set to be shared by the state,  work units and employees, he said. With the implementation of  the wage reform and the increase in wages, the ratio of medical  costs to be covered by individuals is expected to rise  gradually, he added.    According to the official, this year China will try to  expand  the coverage of social security to all urban workers and to  improve the functions of social security departments.    Following the revision, the labor law drafted by the Labor  Ministry and other central departments will be submitted to the  National People's Congress for approval, he said. The drafting  of China's social security law is well under way, he added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gonzalez's Government Crumbling: </F> Tide of Corruption Brings Down Agriculture Minister"]    [Text] Madrid -- Felipe Gonzalez will try today to curb the  disintegration of the government over the corruption cases by  means of a reshuffle involving two ministries (Interior and  Agriculture) and the acceptance of Carlos Solchaga's resignation  as parliamentary spokesman. Gonzalez intends to show in this  way that "we will go all the way, no matter who falls" and to  close the political crisis opened by the Roldan and Rubio cases.  These decisions satisfy the demands of Jordi Pujol who, after  rejecting another coalition offer Monday [2 May], warned  Gonzalez yesterday that an early election would be inevitable  unless he acts quickly.    Two resignations in five days. First it was Antoni Asuncion,  Saturday, over the "Roldan case." Then came Vicente Albero  yesterday, over tax irregularities and connections with the  office of Manuel de la Concha, the same one used by Mariano  Rubio. The announcement of Albero's resignation fell like a  thunderbolt yesterday in the midst of the political storm that  has been rocking the country for several weeks, though Felipe  Gonzalez will try today to take the opportunity to begin a  "recovery."    Since the escape last Friday of Luis Roldan, former director  general of the Civil Guard, Felipe Gonzalez has been immersed in  the most serious political crisis since he became prime minister  in 1983 -- a crisis which, rather than abating, has grown in  intensity in the past few days. Nevertheless, despite the  disintegration of the government caused by the corruption cases,  Gonzalez intends to close the crisis today by appointing  replacements for both ministers and by announcing his acceptance  of Carlos Solchaga's resignation as parliamentary spokesman over  his political responsibility in the "Rubio case."    Agriculture Minister Vicente Albero yesterday announced his  resignation over "fiscal negligence" with regard to the correct  procedure for treasury bonds found in Manuel de la Concha's  office. As he explained at a news conference, in 1983 he sold  his shares in Marie Claire (textiles), payment for part of which  he received in the form of mortgage bonds which he deposited  with De la Concha, as a stock exchange trustee, and which he did  not declare. Worried that this might affect the government's  image, Albero said: "I am one of the people that have  sacrificed their professional lives to devote themselves to  politics, and this has entailed economic sacrifices for me and  my family, but now, more than ever, openness is demanded on the  part of politicians," Cristina de la Hoz reports.    This resignation has forced Felipe Gonzalez to carry out a  more extensive reshuffle that he initially envisaged. After  receiving Albero in his office yesterday morning, the prime  minister informed his majesty the king of the changes he will  make, which he will explain to the media today.    Government sources indicated yesterday that Interior  Minister  Antonio Asuncion, who resigned Saturday over his "negligence" in  Roldan's custody, may be replaced by another minister (Juan  Manuel Eguiagaray or Juan Alberto Belloch) or by someone else  from outside the government, which would enable Gonzalez to  reduce the number of changes to two.    Although Eguiagaray's move would interrupt the work that he  has begun at the Industry Ministry, which is crucial to economic  activity, and although he is not liked by the PNV [Basque  Nationalist Party], despite his Basque origins, he is the  favorite candidate of the State Security Forces on account of  his past connections with the antiterrorist struggle.  Furthermore, he enjoys good relations not only with Gonzalez  but also with Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra and is a member  of the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] Executive  Committee.    According to government sources, one of the new interior  minister's essential tasks will be "to reorganize" the Interior  Ministry following the scandals over the award of contracts and  the use of reserved funds, and at the same time to ensure the  continuation of the antiterrorist struggle.    At the same time, Carlos Solchaga's resignation as  parliamentary spokesman will oblige Gonzalez to provide other  replacements. Sources within the Socialist Group indicate former  Minister Joaquin Almunia as the most likely replacement for  Solchaga, though this would force Gonzalez to seek a replacement  for him in the PSOE Executive Committee, in which he occupies  the post of research and planning secretary. According to  Socialist sources, Gonzalez will have to seek a "renewal  heavyweight" to fill the post.    In the midst of this crisis, the president of the Catalonian  Generalidad and Gonzalez's chief partner, Felipe Gonzalez [as  published; should read Jordi Pujol], warned him yesterday that  unless he acted quickly and vigorously, an early election would  be inevitable. However, sources within the CiU [Convergence and  Union] leadership indicated that Pujol does not want this to  happen, and that he also rejects a PSOE-CiU coalition government.    The CiU leader reaffirmed this rejection Monday at his  meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra, who conveyed to  him another offer from Gonzalez to this effect. However,  Pujol's rejection of such an agreement remains so strong that,  according to Socialist sources, he hardly allowed Serra even to  finish suggesting the possibility to him before resolutely  rejecting the idea that Gonzalez submit himself to a confidence  motion, since it would force him to be formally associated with  the prime minister, though he demands that the latter remain in  his post.    The main political trump card that Felipe Gonzalez has to  play at present is the obvious fact that none of the parties --  from CiU through the People's Party -- wants an early election  now, though this trump card could eventually turn against him.</p>

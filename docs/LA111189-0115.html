			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VALENCIA SHUTS OUT BREA-OLINDA TO EARN A SHARE OF LEAGUE TITLE  </P> <P> Valencia High School recorded its third shutout of the season Friday night,  30-0 over Brea-Olinda, to secure a share of the Orange League title, its  seventh in a row.  </P> <P> Valencia is tied with Savanna, which defeated Western Friday night, 14-13.  After a coin flip, Valencia was designated the No. 2 playoff representative.  Savanna is No. 1, and Western third.  </P> <P> Any playoff hopes for Brea-Olinda, (7-3 overall and 2-3 in league), were  squelched by the loss.  </P> <P> Much of the credit for the Valencia's success this season, and against  Brea-Olinda, was directly related to its defense, which has allowed just 46  points this season.  </P> <P> Valencia, (9-0-1, 4-0-1), forced Brea into turnovers on three first-half  possessions and held a 17-0 lead.  </P> <P> Senior running back Sergio Ortiz scored on a three-yard run on the second play  of the second quarter to give the Tigers a 7-0 lead. Senior defensive back Paul  Castillo set up the touchdown when he intercepted a pass by Brea-Olinda  quarterback Chad Marlow at the Tiger 41-yard line and returned it to the three.  </P> <P> Senior quarterback Richard Wells connected on a 31-yard scoring play to wide  receiver David Sanchez with 9:21 remaining in the second quarter to make it  14-0. That followed another Brea-Olinda turnover. Ryan Nicholson fumbled after  a 25-yard pass reception, and Ryan Roskelly recovered for Valencia.  </P> <P> The Tigers sealed the victory early in the fourth quarter when junior Mike Ehli  recovered Ortiz's fumble in the end zone to make it 24-0.

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Russians may not get funds this year RUSSIA is unlikely to receive further funding from the international financial institutions and the Group of Seven industrial countries this year, according to senior G7 officials. This is in spite of a strong push by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, for more aid soon. Introducing a new package of austerity measures yesterday, he said the second, Dollars 1.5bn tranche of the systemic transformation facility from the International Monetary Fund should be paid by the end of the year - as a much-needed sign of confidence in the reform process. However, foreign observers say inflation, at between 21-24 per cent in September alone, is not yet on a firmly declining trend, while the budget deficit will reach at least 10 per cent of gross national product this year in spite of efforts to trim it. The provisional budget deficit for the fourth quarter - set at Rbs5,200bn - is seen as unachievable because it would mean cuts to agricultural credits and other programmes which cannot be cut without grave damage to the country's economy. This means the IMF's second tranche is unlikely to be seriously considered until early next year, by which time a new government will be in place as a result of elections on December 12. Russia is pressing for a meeting with G7 finance and foreign ministers in Moscow in either December or January, to review progress.</p>

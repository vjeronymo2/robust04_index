			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar doubts The pace of economic recovery in the US was the focus of market attention yesterday, after the publication of weaker-than-expected US non-farm payroll data, writes Gillian Tett. This was partly tempered by an improved unemployment figure. But with market sentiment mixed about the strength of the US recovery, the dollar softened slightly, while the D-Mark made small gains. Publication of the US data had provoked considerable market speculation, after Mr Robert Reich, US labour secretary, broke with protocol on Thursday and predicted a disappointing figure. In the light of the dollar's recent bull run, his comment fuelled fears that the market might have been overly optimistic about the pace of US recovery. In the event, the non-farm payroll rose by 183,000 in December, compared to the market consensus of 215,000. Unemployment in December fell to a three-year low of 6.4 per cent, down from 6.5 per cent the previous month. The announcement triggered a small slide in the dollar against both the D-Mark and the yen. Though the dollar then bounced off technical support at DM1.7350, as markets reassessed the employment number, it finally closed at DM1.733, almost half a pfennig weaker than the previous day. It also slid against the yen, closing at Y111.8, down from the previous close of Y112.6. With market opinion divided about the speed of the US recovery, the dollar is likely to fluctuate within a narrow range in coming days, dealers said. 'A battle is going on between dollar bulls and dollar bears. It is not clear which side will win out,' said Mr Peter Luxton, of Barclays Bank. Consequently the publication of the US PPI and CPI figures on Wednesday and Thursday this week is likely to attract particular attention. As Mr Rob Loewy, head of Foreign Exchange at Midland Global Markets, points out, if this week's figures point to weaker-than-expected levels of inflation, hopes about the strength of the US recovery could be further damped. The D-Mark, by contrast, recovered slightly yesterday, after weakening on Thursday amid speculation that the Bundesbank's refusal to cut rates this week would force a cut later this month. The French franc closed at FFr3.403 per D-Mark compared to a previous close of FFr3.396. Sterling's recent advances against the D-mark were also halted and it closed at DM2.583, down from DM2.589. The key reason for the D-Mark's rise was a comment from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, on Thursday indicating that the bank had a steady rates policy for the time being. 'The Bundesbank is trying hard to dent market speculation that it might cut interest rates,' said Mr Ian Gunner, international economist with Chase Manhattan. The Irish Central Bank cut its short-term facility rate to 6.75 per cent from 7.0 per cent, and its overnight deposit rate to 3.50 per cent from 3.75 per cent. Although some dealers had earlier speculated that the Irish Bank would wait for a German before trimming its own rates, the move appears to have been triggered by the recent strengthening of the Irish currency which is currently by far the strongest currency in the EMS grid, above its pre-August upper limit against the D-Mark. The punt closed at DM2.474 down from DM2.482 the previous day. The Bank of England yesterday provided the UK money market with Pounds 1.41 billion of assistance, after forecasting a Pounds 1.4bn liquidity shortage.  ---------------------------------------             POUND IN NEW YORK  --------------------------------------- Jan 7            Close    Prev. close  --------------------------------------- Pounds spot     1.4930      1.4820 1 mth           1.4900      1.4791 3 mth           1.4854      1.4745 1 yr            1.4726      1.4630  ---------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Arts: Impressionists are back in fashion - Saleroom THERE WAS an air of tangible relief, approaching exhilaration, in the London auction rooms of Sotheby's and Christie's this week. The major summer sales of Impressionist, Modern and contemporary art, the backbone of the turnover  -and the profit - of both companies, had gone better than anyone dared hope. Barring some unforeseen mishap, the recession is over at the highest echelons of the art market. For almost three years now the auctioneers have stood at the rostrum, talking to themselves, while a stony-faced audience has watched impassively as good Impressionist painting has followed indifferent modern sculpture back to a disappointed vendor. But at Christie's on Monday night James Roundell experienced the breakthrough. 'Suddenly there were four raised hands in the room, all bidding for the same lot. They weren't prepared to chase each other up to ridiculous levels but there was definite interest again'. By the end of the evening Christie's had assembled Pounds 17.9m from 48 lots, with the 18 per cent unsold percentage by value its lowest in this sector for three years. The top lot says it all. A Renoir portrait of a young girl holding flowers, more subdued than many similar Renoir paintings, was estimated to make around Pounds 4.5m. It sold for Pounds 5.7m. In 1987, when the Impressionist market was moving towards its peak, the same work had sold for Dollars 4.8m. The message was repeated 24 hours later at Sotheby's, which recorded its highest total for a London Impressionist sale in almost three years of Pounds 20.3m with 14 per cent unsold. The improvement could be neatly charted. The first portents were visible in New York last December when a Matisse sold for Dollars 14.5m and a Monet for Dollars 12.1m. They had become tangible by May with Sotheby's amazing itself, and the dealers, by disposing of a Cezanne for Dollars 28.6m, way above forecast. London did not offer such impressive pictures, but it seemed as if the past month had added to confidence, with broader based bidding and more lots finding buyers. This week's prices still seem modest compared with the midsummer madness of New York in 1990 when, in three days, a Japanese industrialist, Ryoei Saito, paid Dollars 82.5m for a Van Gogh portrait at Christie's and Dollars 78.1m for a Renoir music hall scene at Sotheby's, but they are a significant improvement on the meagre Pounds 6.6m sale total raised by Sotheby's and the Pounds 10.3m by Christie's in December 1990 when the art market suddenly took the full force of the recession and the loss of nerve by buyers. This week Sotheby's and Christie's were confident that within the next year they will be able to bring out the champagne again. For although it is death, divorce and debt that mainly bring works of art on to the market, somehow these three seem capable of holding off when demand is non-existent and prices have nose-dived. Only rising values trigger the return of the masterpieces. 'Sellers can now feel more confident that if they have good paintings, with reasonable estimates, there is no reason why they should not go' says Melanie Clore, director of Sotheby's Impressionist department, who carefully packaged an auction of pictures fresh on the market and carrying attractively low estimates. It is the important works of art which bring out the big buyers, the world's richest connoisseur collectors, like Niarchos, Thyssen, Newhouse, Barbara Johnson and Anneberg, whose fortunes have hardly suffered during the recession. When one did become available in May, Van Gogh's 'Wheat field with cypresses', Annenberg stepped in smartly to buy it privately, only to present it to the Metropolitan Museum of art in New York. The enthusiasm of the ultra rich for buying art again somehow permeates down to the very lowest reaches of the market. Bidding at the week's auctions was an encouraging mix of dealers and private collectors, Europeans and Americans. Even the Japanese were back, but the serious Japanese dealers, not the speculative punters who were largely responsible for pushing the price of indifferent Renoirs, Monets and Picassos to unsustainable heights in 1989 and early 1990. Fortunately the hundreds of Impressionist and modern works of art in Japan stay locked away in the bank vaults ., often acting as collateral to loans. The owners seem content to wait for them to slowly regain their value. The success of the week has shattered one rapidly growing lobby, which argued that the prices reached in the summer of 1990 would not be repeated for a generation, and that Old Master pictures had regained their hold over the art market from the Impressionists. For not only were the best 20th century works selling: even the follow up, second division sales, where new collectors enter the fray by spending Pounds 100,000 or less on a work by one of the Henri's - Lebasque, Martin and Cross - did quite well. Of course demand is still selective and most works sell nearer the bottom of their estimate than the top, but a market has re-established itself, and late 19th and 20th century art remains the desirable collecting field for the rich.</p>

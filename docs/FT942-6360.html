			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Focus on training in Europe Judging by a recent survey of European business attitudes, the UK government is right to focus on training, the only area to receive significant new money as a result of last week's competitiveness white paper. But according to the latest Grant Thornton European business survey* 19 per cent of UK companies saw no need for training. Only 16 per cent of UK staff received training in the last year, about the same as the Germans and Dutch, behind the Austrians and Danes, but more than the Italians or French. Cost and time were the main reasons training was limited; lack of government support was seen as the least of the obstacles. Grant Thornton is running a conference on June 24 in London aimed at equipping companies with a practical understanding of the European market. *European Business Survey.

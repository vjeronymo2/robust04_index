			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Confusion over newspaper VAT plan THE government's intentions towards the extension of value added tax were shrouded in confusion last night after a Treasury minister gave an apparent pledge not to end the zero-rating on newspapers. In a letter to Mr Alex Carlile, the Liberal Democrat MP, Sir John Cope said he could assure him the government 'has no present plans or proposals to extend the scope of VAT to newspapers'. Sir John added: 'I hope that this helps to clarify the position.' The unusually reassuring tone of the letter prompted Mr Carlile to claim that the government had now ended weeks of speculation by making a 'categorical assurance' that newspapers would retain their present zero-rating. But amid some embarrassment at the Treasury, officials later claimed that the letter had done nothing to narrow Mr Norman Lamont's options for his Budget in March. The letter, dated January 6 1993, had been written before Mr Lamont began his official Budget preparations at a meeting in Chevening two days later. Any subsequent Treasury replies would include a standard statement that no comment could be made on possible tax measures ahead of the Budget. There was private acknowledgement, though, that Sir John's letter - framed months earlier in the light of the commitments given by Mr John Major in the general election campaign - would create political embarrassment for the government if the chancellor did choose to raise additional tax revenue at the expense of the newspapers. Mr Lamont will today give Mr Major the broad conclusions of his discussions in Chevening, setting out the option of extending VAT to areas such as domestic fuel and transport as well as to newspapers and books.</p>

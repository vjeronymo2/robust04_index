			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Kopper warning for German banks GERMAN banks may face a more difficult time in the second half of this year than in the first six months, according to Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman of Deutsche Bank. In an interview in today's Les Echos, the French financial newspaper, Mr Kopper says that economic crises tend to hit the banking sector with a six to nine-month delay and that he is 'not sure that German banks can repeat their good performance of the first half'. He added, however, that overall profits remained satisfactory in Germany's banking sector and that they should improve next year as a result of an expected 'very modest economic recovery'. He said that German banks had anticipated the problems arising from recession and that Deutsche Bank had already increased its provisions this year by about 50 per cent to DM1.4bn (Dollars 8.4m). Mr Kopper said that small and medium-sized companies often faced their most difficult financial problems at the end of recession and that even though the worst of the economic downturn was over 'we still don't know how many of our clients will be able to find their feet again'. The Deutsche Bank chairman also expressed confidence in a continued fall in German interest rates. 'There is no doubt that interest rates will continue to fall,' he said, forecasting that short-term interest rates would be below 6 per cent by the end of the year. According to Mr Kopper, the European central bank, which will be established as part of the process of European economic and monetary union, should be based in Frankfurt for 'psychological reasons'. He said it was necessary to reassure Germans worried that the D-Mark would disappear with the creation of a single European currency.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Loyalists may end killings if IRA agrees ceasefire Loyalist gunmen in Northern Ireland yesterday ruled out a unilateral ceasefire but held out the prospect of an end to killings if the IRA laid down its arms. The Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC), in its first response to this week's declaration by the British and Irish prime ministers, made clear the IRA must make the first move. In the absence of any response from the 'Provisional murder gangs', it would pursue its 'stated policy in retaliation to IRA violence'. The loyalist statement came as Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, fleshed out Dublin's proposal for a peace forum to pave the way for an early entry by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into dialogue. Mr Reynolds told the Dail (the Irish parliament) that the forum would initially draw together strands of nationalist opinion in both parts of the island. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, yesterday held out the prospect of lifting Ireland's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, if it accepted the peace initiative. The ban comes up for its annual review next month. Mr Spring said: 'I would like to feel we can arrive at a decision which will further promote and enhance the prospects of an open dialogue, in which everyone who accepts a democratic mandate can take part.' Mr Peter Brooke, UK national heritage secretary, is expected to report to Mr John Major on a review of British restrictions on broadcasting direct speech by members of terrorist groups in the province early next year. Downing Street officials sought to underline the degree of cross-party backing in Britain for the peace initiative by praising Thursday night's broadcast by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader. Their comments follow unease on the Tory backbenches over the extent to which they perceive the Downing Street Declaration as diluting the government's commitment to the Union and embracing the nationalist agenda. A further boost for the peace initiative came when Cardinal Cahal Daly, the all-Ireland primate for the Roman Catholic Church, said the declaration gave paramilitaries on both sides an honourable opportunity to halt their violent campaigns. As a poll suggested the people of Ulster were divided over whether the initiative was a first step towards peace, the CLMC said it was seeking clarification on certain aspects of the joint declaration. It would make a 'considered response' later. The CLMC - an umbrella group comprising principally the Ulster Freedom Fighters and the Ulster Volunteer Force - also called for a unionist forum 'to encompass all the loyalist and unionist political parties'. Mr Reynolds said the peace forum would pave the way for wider talks between nationalist and unionist parties together. Dublin aims at speeding Sinn Fein dialogue, Page 4</p>

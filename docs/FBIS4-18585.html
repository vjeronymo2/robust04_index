			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with newly elected Istanbul Mayor Tayyip Erdogan </F> and Ankara Mayor Melih Gokcek by Reha Muhtar for the "Firing  Line" program in Ankara; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Muhtar] I first want to congratulate you on  becoming the mayors of Ankara and Istanbul following democratic  elections. I will begin with you, Mr. Tayyip Erdogan. You are  now at the head of a big metropolis, Istanbul. Istanbul is the  capital of empires, a multilingual and multinational city. You  received 25 percent of the votes, despite 75 percent of the  populace opposing you. This could have been the case for any  other party such as the True Path Party or the Motherland Party,  but 75 percent of the population believes that your party is  ideologically different. As you yourself claim, the Prosperity  Party [PP] is the one that will change the order and the  population is apprehensive about what you plan to change.    [Erdogan] Firstly, I would like to thank you for arranging  this forum, as speculation is rife these days both regarding our  party and ourselves. There are also provocations. We regret  them. Only recently, it was 0200 in the middle of the night, I  held my head in my hands and started to weep. Are we not the  children of this country? We were also born and bred in this  country.    [Muhtar] What incidents are you referring to?    [Erdogan] Certain ugly things appearing in the media  genuinely distressed us. We have been elected mayor and the PP  is a party established within the framework of the country's  laws. In other words, we must discuss what we must do in this  office. A certain sector of the media, however, is driving our  people into a justified fear. We are sorry about this. There  is nothing to fear. We are not in a position to question  anyone's dress code. As I stated during many panel discussions,  the municipality will fulfill its duty respecting the existing  culture in Istanbul, regardless of opinions or faith.    [Muhtar] Are you saying that there will be no change in the  social life?    [Erdogan] This is our position as the municipality: We will  exercise our authority without resorting to bribery,  exploitation, or corruption. Let us look at Article 58 of the  Constitution. It is highly beneficial to read this article,  which protects our youth from bad habits. As the municipality,  it is up to us to control whether such institutions are  sanitary. I announced that if I go on an inspection tour, I  will not be the one to conduct the inspection. I will inform the  media and hand over the inspection file to the media and ask  them to conduct the inspection.    [Muhtar] Naturally, you do not have the authority to open or  close down certain places. Most restaurants or entertainment  places in Istanbul cannot be said to keep clean back rooms or  kitchens. This grants you extensive authority. If you wish to  close down certain places on the basis of your ideology, then  you can use public health as an excuse. One cannot truthfully  say that health conditions are exemplary in such places either  in Istanbul or Ankara.    [Erdogan] Are you saying that they should work in such dirty  conditions?    [Muhtar] No, this is not what I mean. Everything is below  the standard you cite. I am saying that there is such a fear.    [Erdogan] This raises another issue. It was not the PP that  determined this standard, but its predecessors.    [Muhtar] This is not a matter of standard, but one of  society.    [Erdogan] No. We may have set different standards, but the  current standards were set by other parties. Moreover, I am  saying that I will not be the one to control this standard. I  will invite the media and show them the inspection file, which  was not prepared by the PP. I will ask them if they are willing  to eat and drink in such places. We must be realistic. They  will say no. I will then ask them to apply the appropriate  sanctions. I will not be the one to apply them. We will show  what a participatory democracy is in this country. We will not,  however, accept bribes to look the other way. This we will not  do.    [Muhtar] In other words, you will consider only public  health and environmental aspects.    [Erdogan] We will only demonstrate our sincerity in  implementing the existing laws.    [Muhtar] I would now like to address you, Mr. Melih  Gokcek. You are the mayor of the capital of the country, the  seat of the republican ideology. Will the social life of the  citizens of Ankara change in any way?    [Gokcek] They will live as they wish, the same as before.  We will run the municipality. The citizens' personal lives  concern only them, not us.    [Muhtar] All the institutions of the Turkish Republic are  located in Ankara. You are member of a party in favor of  changing the order. Do you feel apprehensive about being in the  capital?    [Gokcek] Certainly not. I was born in Ankara.    [Muhtar] I was not referring to the citizenship issues. I  was referring to Ankara as the seat of the republican ideology.    [Gokcek] Why should we feel apprehensive? We were born and  bred here.    [Muhtar] What kind of policy will you pursue?    [Gokcek] As far as the order is concerned, there are  naturally aspects of which I do not approve. You would not  approve of them either. It is necessary to define what we mean  by the order in the country. For example, do you condone  corruption? Can you condone it?    [Muhtar] This is not what I meant.    [Gokcek] Corruption and bribery have become a part of the  order. I will change this order. This is inevitable.    [Muhtar] I was referring to the constitutional order.    [Gokcek] There are also aspects within the constitutional  order which must be changed. A constitution was drafted in  1924; another was introduced in 1960.    [Muhtar] You are mayor under the existing constitution.    [Gokcek] Those who come to power seem to change what their  predecessors have done.    [Muhtar] You are the two mayors under the current  constitutional order. There may be conflicts between your views  and the constitution. How will you act in light of this  conflict?    [Gokcek] One is obliged to abide by the laws. There is no  other way. I would exert every possible effort to change the  law if I do not approve of it as a member of parliament. As a  mayor, however, I do not have such authority or influence. As a  mayor, I have to accept and implement the laws handed down by  the Turkish Grand National Assembly. There is nothing else to  do, even if I do not approve of the laws.    [Muhtar] Recently the press has carried reports about PP  members, supporters, or more radical circles interfering in  women's dress code or forcing them off buses. Is this  post-election euphoria?    [Gokcek] These reports are false. A party member would  never do such things. Since we were elected into office, we  have appealed to the citizens to report persons who harass them  to the authorities. You will see that they are not members of  the PP, they are merely provocateurs. I have here in my hand  several faxes. One of them states: Women employees must be  discouraged from wearing short skirts, pants, shorts, or other  revealing attire. This fax was sent by the Halk Bank.    [Erdogan] I would like to issue a reminder. There are  attempts to create the impression that the PP is heading a  municipal authority for the first time. This party was in power  in 1974; it was a coalition partner in 1975 and 1976. Its  members were mayors in over 100 municipalities before the latest  elections, including bid cities, provinces, districts, and  townships. Do you believe that anything happened to trigger  these complaints?    [Muhtar] When you assumed office, you visited the Ataturk  Mausoleum. Certain circles were not expecting such a visit on  your part.    [Gokcek] This was not my first time.    [Muhtar] No, but this time you visited as a PP mayor. Did  this cause any resentment in the party grassroots?    [Gokcek] This is concocted by certain elements in the public  and they are the ones who believe in it. In other words, they  create the ogres in their heads and then they believe them. In  public offices, for example, they scare the citizens. They have  no right to do this.    [Muhtar] What will happen in the municipalities? I am  directing this question to both of you. Will women employees  continue to work?    [Gokcek] What woman employee was disturbed during the five  years that I served as mayor of Kecioren? I was also general  director of the Child Protection Association for two and a half  years and I ask if any women employees were disturbed during  that time. This is not logical.    [Erdogan] Let me tell you this: We are heading the  municipalities in six districts and three townships in Istanbul  at the moment. You can question all the women in these  municipalities on whether we interfere in their dress code. The  dress code was introduced before us. We believe women can dress  as they wish. There are women in some Istanbul municipalities  who wanted to cover themselves, but were unable to do so. They  could not cover their heads because they feared being dismissed.  There are maybe 10 or 11 such women.    [Muhtar] You became the head of such an important city. In  the first days, it was announced that a mosque will be built in  the middle of Taksim Square. Is this a very important issue for  you? Or, did you not announce this?    [Erdogan] This was initiated by the press. They came and  asked me. I replied as follows: When the Taksim mosque issue  was raised for the first time 20 years ago, I became a trustee  of this project. A foundation exists in connection with this  project. The mosque will not be built by the municipality. It  will be built by the foundation. When the foundation applies  for the project, I will make the necessary arrangements and hand  the land over to the foundation.    [Muhtar] Are you referring to the parking lot?    [Erdogan] Yes. It is a parking lot at the moment.    [Muhtar] What I am trying to say is that the day you became  the mayor of a large metropolis like Istanbul you announced that  a mosque will be built in Taksim.    [Erdogan] No, it was not my first statement. I merely  answered a question. You are the ones who are asking the  questions.    [Muhtar] Does that mean you will not concern yourself with  these questions?    [Erdogan] These are my [word indistinct] issues. These are  legal topics. As the mayor, I will exercise any authority in my  jurisdiction to the benefit of my people, and not as a hostile  action against my people. I would like to explain the  following: There are even things that violate the Constitution.  Article 58 bans alcoholic drinks and bad habits. Even though  the Constitution is being violated here, the media is still  trying to portray me as opposed to the Constitution.    [Muhtar] How does the Constitution ban alcoholic drinks?    [Erdogan] Article 58 cites bad habits, alcoholic drinks, and  notes that the state should take the necessary measures with  regard to these matters.    [Muhtar] The Constitution also defends individual freedoms,  each person's private life.    [Erdogan] Article 58 is very interesting. It says: The  state will adopt the necessary measures to protect the youth in  the face of addiction to alcohol, narcotics, criminality,  gambling, and similar bad habits, as well as ignorance.    [Muhtar] It mentions the youth. In other words, you can  drink if you are an adult. You say that our Constitution bans  alcohol.    [Erdogan] Yes. Turkey is such a strange country. It is the  only country in the world, in which the state itself produces  alcoholic drinks.    [Muhtar] Approximately 75 percent of the population is  opposed to you. You will serve as [word indistinct] mayors.  You must be flexible and you are trying to create such an image  at the moment.    [Gokcek] By the same token, 87 percent are against the  Social Democratic Populist Party.    [Muhtar] Yes, but as you have said, these parties are all  parties who favor the existing order and therefore the  opposition does not create such a contrast.    [Erdogan] How high was the high jump bar placed? Let us say  at a height of 1.8 meters. We jumped from 1.8. We will be able  to jump even if they place the bar at 2 meters. We will abandon  everything else and begin practicing high jumping.    [Gokcek] As someone said, if they succeed once, they will  never fail again. Of course, we will succeed. We are destined  to succeed.    [Muhtar] The fact that a large sector of the population is  against you and you are a party opposed to the existing order  places 75 percent of the population locked against you. You are  the mayor. There are artists and the media in your cities and  these factors are very dominant. Now, sitting here in front of  me, you are creating a very moderate image. Are you playing  tricks, or..    [Gokcek] Again you are putting words into our mouths.    [Muhtar] I am merely asking.    [Erdogan] Moreover, our lives are in the open. We did not  come from another planet. We are currently living here.    [Muhtar] So, you are not playing tricks.    [Erdogan] We did not come from outer space. We were born  and bred here and we live here now.    [Muhtar] Will you always respect democracy?    [Gokcek] Do you doubt it?    [Muhtar] I am asking on behalf of the society.    [Erdogan] Do you personally doubt it?    [Muhtar] I am not important as a person. It is the society  that is important.    [Erdogan] Are you trying me on behalf of the society?    [Muhtar] I am asking because the society has doubts.    [Erdogan] Those who now claim to exist in the name of  democracy are not democrats; on the contrary, they are  democratic dictators.    [Muhtar] You made a statement in response to Istanbul  Governor Kozakcioglu's remarks. You reportedly warned him to be  careful.    [Erdogan] I did not make a statement addressing the  governor. Only the following is true: We are assuming power,  knowing the laws pertaining to municipalities. We are aware of  our rights. The honorable governor is obliged to act  objectively.    [Muhtar] Are you disturbed about the governor's remarks?    [Erdogan] I still cannot conceive that the governor made  such a statement. I read this in the press, but I do not  believe that he made such a statement. It is not the governor's  duty to judge the PP. I had not even assumed my post when the  statement was made. I had not even announced what my actions  will be. The governor's duty is to be objective; he can never  have the right to judge the PP. We plan to cooperate with the  governor in Istanbul and take this city further to better days.    [Muhtar] It is not easy to govern millions. Some of your  supporters or circles close to you may have indulged in  excessive behavior. The citizens of Istanbul and Ankara  probably experienced this. We were informed of such incidents  and I do not think that everyone is telling lies. Do you plan  to take measures against this, against persons telling others  how to dress or behave on the streets?    [Gokcek] Let me tell you clearly. Our own supporters do not  engage in such actions. These are lies deliberately spread by  members of the Social Democratic Populist Party after this party  lost the elections.    [Muhtar] Do you deny that such incidents took place?    [Gokcek] The incidents did occur, but the perpetrators are  clearly provocateurs.    [Erdogan] We caught three men dressed as veiled women and  they fled using their weapons.    [Muhtar] Are these not connected to you?    [Erdogan] No.    [Muhtar] Maybe your party is not involved, but you cannot  control all the millions who vote for you.    [Gokcek] We are making an appeal. I have already issued  calls on television and now I am repeating myself on your  program. I am saying that all this harassment on dress code or  other issues consists entirely of provocations. I am calling on  the citizens to catch such persons and hand them over to the  security and to us. Let us pursue the matter.    [Erdogan] I personally experienced an incident. In addition  to cases in which women dressed in revealing clothes were not  allowed on buses, I heard that women wearing head covers at the  Theology Department in Baglarbasi, Istanbul, were also refused  on vehicles. This creates hostile camps, which is very  unfortunate.    [Muhtar] Since we are talking about polarization, I would  like to ask another brief question. Will there be segregation  on buses?    [Erdogan] Absolutely not. These are mere fabrications.</p>

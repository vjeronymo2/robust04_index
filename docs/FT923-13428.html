			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Letter: Only one measure of incentives Sir, As one who has designed many top management incentive plans I was interested to read ('Shareholder group calls for changes to stock option plans', July 6) that the National Association of Pension Funds is studying alternatives, such as share price, to the earnings per share (eps) criterion used in many such schemes on the grounds that eps calculations are too easily subject to manipulation by top management. It is vital that any measurement standard used in determining incentive awards is one that both management can influence by their efforts and whose achievement will jointly benefit management and owners. Earnings per share is the only criterion that meets these requirements. Share price certainly does not and the relationship between corporate performance and share price has long been established as a tenuous one. As to the argument that it is too easy to manipulate eps calculations, while this may be true, it merely reinforces the need for boards, remuneration committees and shareholders to exercise judgment to ensure that this does not happen.

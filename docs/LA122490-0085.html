			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> COURTLY LEADER: Central Municipal Court Judge Richard W. Stanford has been  grabbing headlines by threatening Sheriff Brad Gates with contempt of court for  releasing inmates early to ease jail overcrowding. . . . But does he have the  support of his fellow judges? A clue: They unanimously reelected him presiding  judge of the Central Municipal Court, effective Jan. 1. . . . "I have not done  any of my actions without consulting" the other judges, Stanford says. "It's a  collective decision of the court as far as I'm concerned." Gebe Martinez and  Lanie Jones  </P></p>

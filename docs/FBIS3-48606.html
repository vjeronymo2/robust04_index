			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Jan 26 (ANTARA) -- President Suharto and  visiting Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic agreed on Wednesday  to explore the possibility of an international conference to  solve ethnic tensions among the former Yugoslav states of  Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia.    "However, I have no idea about the composition of the  planned  international conference such as whether Indonesia will host it  or not," Minister/State Secretary Murdiono said following the  meeting between the two heads of state at Merdeka Palace here.    Both leaders also agreed to open diplomatic relations but no  decision was made on whether embassies will be established in  Jakarta and Sarajevo.    Arriving here on Tuesday, Izetbegovic will leave for India  Wednesday to explain the latest situation in the embattled  Bosnia.    Suharto, as chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), has  asked the Indonesian ambassador to the United Nations in New  York to contact the NAM Coordinating Bureau there about the  possibility of holding the conference, said Murdiono.    Izetbegovic called for an international conference to  replace  the Geneva talks which has so far failed to settle the crisis in  Bosnia.    According to Murdiono, Suharto welcomed Izetbegovic's effort  to try to lift the UN arms embargo on Bosnia who is less  equipped than the more militarily powerful Serbia and Croatia.    "The president as NAM chairman will urge the world to treat  Bosnia fairly in its fight against much stronger enemies," said  Murdiono, adding that Suharto had expressed his support for the  lifting of the embargo.    Over 200,000 Bosnian Muslims have been killed and millions  more expelled since Serb and Croatian aggressors occupied  Bosnia. About 70 percent of Bosnia is now in the hands of its  enemies.    Izetbegovic said the ending of the embargo was necessary to  balance the military strengths of all warring parties. A  military balance is expected to help lead to peace. He also  suggested an air strike on Serbia in a bid to pressure them into  considering peace.    "A combination of force and negotiations is necessary to  stop  the war," he said, adding that all forms of talks so far had  focussed on Bosnia relinquishing parts of its territory. "But  we cannot accept unjust division of our country," the Bosnian  president argued.    The UN Security Council mainly dominated by the United  States, France, Britain, Russia, and China has issued 30  resolutions on the Bosnian war. However, none of them have been  implemented accept the arms embargo.    Commenting on the planned withdrawal of UN forces from  Bosnia, Izetbegovic said it would create more difficulty in  keeping peace.    "If Europe wants to pull out some of its troops, then the  United Nations should allow other non-European countries to  replace them," he added.    European officials recently reviewed the UN presence in  Bosnia and UN sources in Sarajevo confirmed that plans to  withdraw the peacekeepers and aid workers are underway.    Turkey and Iran have offered to send troops to help Bosnia  Muslims but the United Nations refused the proposal without  providing an explanation.    Before leaving Jakarta, the Bosnian delegation received  U.S.$70,000 worth of humanitarian aid from the Indonesian  Solidarity Committee for Bosnian Muslims. Also included in the  package were 450 grams of gold and watches, and a cheque worth  U.S. $24,600 from the Irsyad al-Islamiyyah religious association.    Chairman of the Solidarity Committee Geys M. Amar explained  that the gifts were spontaneous donations collected at mosques  from Muslims all over the country.</p>

A substantially large-scale income tax cut is necessary in  light of the delay in implementing a tax reduction, Kosaku  Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry,  told a press conference.    Inaba also said the government should begin studying a  consumption tax hike as a means of covering the income tax cut,  after confirming the economy has turn around.    Inaba said the ruling coalition parties and the opposition  camp should do their utmost to avoid creating a political vacuum  over the issue of political reforms.    The most urgent task facing the government is the formation  of a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and the main  budget for fiscal 1994, he said.</p>

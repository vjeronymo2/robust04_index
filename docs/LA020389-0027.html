			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> An Israeli government worker accused of trying to sell secrets to the PLO was  brought home from Greece by Israeli officials overnight and arrested when he  landed at Ben-Gurion Airport, Israel Radio reported. The 35-year-old defendant  appeared in court and was remanded in custody for 10 days, with publication of  his name forbidden, the government radio said. According to the broadcast, the  man surrendered to Israeli officials in Athens after the Palestine Liberation  Organization failed to pay him the $1.5 million he sought for his information.  The man, who immigrated from the Soviet Union in the 1970s and worked at an  Israeli government agency, reportedly told authorities that he was having  financial problems and tried to sell the PLO information.  </P></p>

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One of the core items of President Clinton's economic proposals is the need to empower America's distressed rural and urban communities. His Empowerment Zone proposal represents a new approach to the problems of distressed communities. It emphasizes a bottom-up community based strategy rather than the traditional top-down bureaucratic approach. It is a strategy to address economic, human, community, and physical development problems and opportunities in a comprehensive fashion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title XIII of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, enacted to implement the President's vision, authorizes the Secretary of Department of Agriculture to designate up to three Empowerment Zones and up to 30 Enterprise Communities in rural areas. (Unless otherwise noted, all references in this Notice to Empowerment Zones also include Enterprise Communities.) This Notice invites applications from State and local governments, regional planning agencies, non-profit organizations, community-based organizations, or other locally-based organizations for the Secretarial designations as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The program is intended to combine the resources of the Federal Government with those of State and local governments, educational institutions and the private and non-profit sectors to implement community-developed strategic plans for economic development. The Federal Government has taken steps to coordinate Federal assistance in support of the Zones, including expedited processing, priority funding, and waiver of regulations. To that end, President Clinton has issued an Executive Order that creates a Community Enterprise Board chaired by Vice President Al Gore to ensure the success of the Empowerment Zone initiative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Eligibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statute specifies certain criteria that must apply in order for an area to be eligible for Empowerment Zone designation, including geographic size, population, poverty rate by census tract (or by block numbering areas when the community is not delineated by census tracts), pervasive poverty, unemployment, and general distress of the area. The details of these requirements are described in the interim rule governing the program published elsewhere in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This information must be provided in the application. USDA will accept certifications of the data by the State and local governments, subject to further verification of the data prior to designation as a Zone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Designation Factors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statute specifies three factors to be considered by the Secretary in designating Empowerment Zones: (1) The effectiveness of the Strategic Plan; (2) the effectiveness of the assurances provided in support of the Strategic Plan; and (3) other criteria to be specified by the Secretary. Each of these factors is discussed in greater detail in the interim rule (The Strategic Plan is described in the interim rule at 7 CFR 25.200(c)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Timing and Location of Application Submissions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications may be obtained from any FmHA State Office and from Rural EZ/EC State Contacts (see Appendix A) or by sending an Internet Mail message to: info@ezec.usda.gov. An application may be submitted 30 days from the date of publication of the interim rule, which governs the Empowerment Zone program. The deadline for receipt of the application will be 4 p.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time, Thursday, June 30, 1994. Applications received after that date and time will not be accepted, and will be returned to the sender. As the applications require certifications from the State and local governments, we cannot accept applications sent by FAX or through the Internet system. The original application and one (1) copy should be sent to: US Department of Agriculture, Rural Development Administration, EZ/EC Team, room 5405, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20250&hyph;3200. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants will be notified of an incomplete application. Provided that the application is received at the above address with sufficient time before the deadline, applicant will be given an opportunity to provide the missing information to USDA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Notice of Intent to Apply <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants should fill out and mail a Notice of Intent to Apply. The form of notice is located at the end of the Empowerment Zone Application (see Appendix B), or may be obtained by sending an Internet Mail message to: info@ezec.usda.gov to obtain the notice. Applicants may wish to submit the form in order to be placed on the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community mailing list. While the notice is not mandatory for participation in the program, USDA encourages the submission of the notice as it will permit the Department to provide applicants with updated information on program requirements as well as information on technical assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- Political parties and  organizations of different countries have condemned the United  States and the International Atomic Energy Agency for spreading  the rumour about fictitious "development of nuclear weapons" by  the DPRK to aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula.    The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of  the DPRK said in a statement April 23 that the IAEA manipulated  by the United States is picking quarrel only with Korea, a  non-nuclear state, while conniving at the production of nuclear  arms in other countries.    If the U.S. and IAEA truly want global peace, they should  destroy all nuclear weapons, check the nuclear development of  Japan and South Korea and stop slandering Korea over the  fictitious "nuclear issue", the statement said.    The Ghanaian National Institute of the Chuche Idea demanded  in a statement April 10 that the United States discontinue the  "Team Spirit" joint military exercises for good and stop at once  the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea for peace and  security of the world.    The Guyanese National Committee for the Study of the Chuche  Idea of Comrade Kim Il-song, in a statement April 26, criticized  the IAEA Secretariat and the UN Security Council for applying,  under the U.S. patronage, the extremely discriminatory and  prejudiced double standard to the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK.    The Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, in a protest letter  addressed to the U.S. President on May 1, branded the stepped-up  preparations of the United States to resume joint military  exercises against the DPRK, a socialist state, as an act of  disturbing global peace, especially peace and security in the  Korean peninsula.    It urged the United States to immediately withdraw its  nuclear weapons, over 40,000 troops and Patriot missiles from  South Korea.</p>

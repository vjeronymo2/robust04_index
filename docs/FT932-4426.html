			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Ownership doubt over Alpine assets THE RECEIVER for Alpine (Double Glazing) is trying to sell the company amid confusion over who owns some of the company's assets. Mr Grant Jones, of accountants Morison Stoneham, said yesterday he was investigating claims to some of the assets by Finchfleet. The Guernsey-based company claims to have bought Alpine's plant, machinery and office equipment in March 1992, one month after the company was purchased out of administration with backing from Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur with offshore interests. Mr Jones said: 'I have become aware of a potential claim by Finchfleet to some of the assets. In a letter dated March 30 1993 to Mr Robin Speirs, Alpine's chief executive, Mr Michael Macey, Finchfleet's director, wrote: 'I must make it absolutely clear that all plant and machinery and all office equipment is owned by this company pursuant to our Agreement with yourselves of the 20th March 1992.' The letter threatens legal action against 'any party' attempting to gain assets. Mr Jones said Alpine had a 'substantial' order book. One of his main concerns would be to ensure that these orders were fulfilled by achieving a going-concern sale of the business.</p>

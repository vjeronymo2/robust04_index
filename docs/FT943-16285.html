			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: AGF privatisation to go ahead France plans to proceed with the privatisation this autumn of Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the country's third-largest insurer, in spite of the recent weakness of the Paris stock market, according to Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Gagliani, AGF chairman. AGF, like many French companies, has suffered a steep slide in its share price this year. However, Mr Jeancourt-Gagliani stressed in a French press interview that the 30 per cent fall in the value of its shares was 'identical to that of other insurers' and was 'not a sufficient reason for postponing privatisation'. Speculation has mounted that the government, which has already privatised a number of large financial groups, might be forced to delay the AGF issue due to adverse market conditions. However Mr Jeancourt-Gagliani said he had received 'total confirmation' that the government intended to proceed with the share sale this autumn as planned. AGF was earmarked for privatisation in the mid-1980s by the last French centre-right government, but the issue was put off after the stock market crash in October 1987. Mr Jeancourt-Gagliani said the group had 'suffered greatly' due to that delay. He also sought to allay concern about AGF's financial performance by denying rumours that it had lost money from bond futures trading on the Matif, the Paris futures market. 'AGF has not made a loss on the Matif for the good reason that it is not a player in that market, except in a marginal way for some funds,' Mr Jeancourt-Gagliani said.</p>

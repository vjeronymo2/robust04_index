			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BRITISH WEEKLY NEWSPAPER FOLDS  </P> <P> The Sunday Correspondent, a weekly newspaper with national circulation, is  folding after failing to find the investment needed to stay afloat, the paper's  management announced today.  </P> <P> The Sunday Correspondent, which includes the owner of the Chicago Tribune among  major shareholders, was launched on to the crowded Sunday newspaper scene on  Sept. 17, 1989, at a cost of $25.5 million.  </P> <P> But sales of the paper fell below the 350,000 figure needed to break even, and  last August shareholders pumped in another $19 million to keep it going.  </P> <P> The paper also switched editors in what it called "the interests of the  continued shareholder support," and on Sept. 30 became a tabloid. The demise of  the Sunday Correspondent leaves Britain with 10 national weekly Sunday  newspapers.  </P></p>

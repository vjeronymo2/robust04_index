			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / EC agrees airline booking code EC TRANSPORT ministers yesterday agreed on a new code of conduct for airline computer reservations systems (CRS), intended to prevent those airlines which own a bookings system from poaching passengers from airlines which participate in it. In the background of this decision is a long-running battle about so-called 'de-hosting' - separating ownership and use of CRS - between American Airlines and its Sabre system, and its two European rivals, Amadeus and Galileo, in which several European carriers hold shares. Sabre is the world's largest CRS and American Airlines has claimed that its European rivals have tried to prevent its expansion inside the EC by brandishing the de-hosting weapon, by claiming that American has a lock-hold on its own system. European carriers also objected that the EC proposal obliging European CRS to provide flight information to rival CRS, would give Sabre an competitive advantage inside the Community. However, after reaching a compromise last week, the EC yesterday agreed on a partial 'de-hosting', intended to offer safeguards to carriers which are part of another booking system. 'There are now going to be strict rules making sure that the companies running it are not poaching passengers from those taking part in it,' said Lord Caithness, the UK deputy transport minister in charge of aviation. The two European systems already make sure that the owners can only view their own data, allowing customers to shop for fares throughout the system. This will now be true of all systems including Sabre. And the European Commission will police the new rules, and has undertaken to prosecute vigorously any abuses.</p>

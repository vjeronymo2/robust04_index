			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (4): Quality concern - A green tinge to a company's financial statement may not add up to much Environmental reporting may be on the rise, but much more needs to be done to justify the quantity of trees that are being cut down to sustain it. A substantial and growing number of companies now have at least a green tint to the pages of their financial statements. The concern is over the quality of the information that they provide: much is more hollow words than meaningful content. A survey released last month by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, canvassed the practices of 690 of the leading companies in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, the UK and the US*. More than 100 companies produced a separate environmental report, while 400 at least referred to green issues somewhere in their annual report. As Professor Rob Gray, director of the Centre for Social and Environmental Accounting Research at the University of Dundee, puts it, this represents a 'phenomenal' upsurge in the last few years. But when it comes to issues such as consistency, comparability, accountability or the degree to which information is verifiable, the results are more disappointing - and in line with other similar findings. Just 83 of the companies in the KPMG study set quantitative targets. Even though 128 provide some figures to illustrate their performance, the majority were just brief references to issues such as costs of environmental investment. A few also mentioned the fines imposed on them, although there was a general tendency to highlight 'good news' and ignore the bad, particularly among US companies. KPMG argues this reflects concerns over the risk of exposing themselves to litigation. When it came to any indication that the information provided was backed up by any guarantees, the results were also disappointing. Only 63 companies disclosed that they had had an internal environmental audit, and 33 an external audit. Mr Kim Hayworth, partner in charge of KPMG's National Environment Unit in London, admits that the growth in green reporting has been slower than many expected. 'The pressure to report is not strong,' he says. 'It is an issue but it is not at the top of the agenda yet. 'Also, companies are still trying to put together the information on environmental performance. It does not emerge easily.' Mr Hayworth argues that this is partly linked to the growing decentralisation of the management of organisations. 'It is difficult to demand subsidiaries to provide data.' On the other hand, he stresses that a number of voluntary corporate reporting initiatives are being developed. 'For a company starting up now, the standard is very high,' he says. Reports are expected to be logical, honest and full of quantifiable data. He cites as examples the most recent reports of companies such as British Telecom, RTZ and Thorn, which are beginning to provide considerable information on responsibilities and quantified targets for environmental improvement. A handful go further still, such as BSO/Origin, the Dutch computer services company, which has attempted to put a cost on all of its activities affecting the environment. Aside from the specific examples, Mr Hayworth also draws some consolation from several new voluntary environmental reporting guidelines which are being developed, such as the Public Environmental Reporting Initiative in the US, and the work of the Global Environmental Management Initiative. The question is how far these guidelines are relevant to smaller companies, or to those outside the industry sectors which have developed them: normally in the highly-regulated chemical or extractive areas. More generally, there are few attempts by governments to impose stricter reporting. One exception is the Netherlands, where a draft law proposes a requirement on companies to publish detailed information on environmental impact and improvement plans. In the absence of tougher legal requirements, there is one other factor which may drive companies to implement strict environmental management standards internally although these may not be reported: commercial pressure. That will come primarily from litigation, but also partly from companies which are beginning to demand accreditation or other evidence of sound environmental management from their suppliers. Elsewhere, and in less litigious sectors, voluntary initiatives are the norm. Both BS 7750, the British standard on environmental management, and the European Union's Ecological Management and Auditing Scheme (Emas) have been unveiled. But both are awaiting final tweaking and any significant take-up. Emas was substantially diluted over the last few years as a result of intensive lobbying from industry, switching it from a mandatory into a voluntary scheme, and from something with company-wide scope to being site-specific. Despite the changes, there are still considerable issues to be resolved in its implementation. A pilot study on Emas completed over the summer by PA Consulting, showed considerable enthusiasm for the concept. But there were concerns about whether the considerable additional costs  - particularly related to external verification of reports - would outweigh the benefits, especially when applied to smaller companies. Mr Tony Bishop, manager for environment services at the firm, argues for several distinct types of environmental management system across different industry sectors rather than a uniform approach, depending on the degree of formality required and the environmental impact. Meanwhile, if companies still need considerable prompting to develop meaningful statements, the consulting industry that has grown up around the environment equally needs to improve its performance. There is wide variety in the quality of services provided. The Institute of Environmental Assessment has launched an environmental auditors' registration association scheme for individuals. The Association of Environmental Consultancies has launched a registration scheme for member firms. How independent and effective they will prove remains to be seen. But without high standards, the surfeit of consultants peddling management systems and environmental reporting advice to their clients could simply add to confusion and waste.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's </F> Congress Standing Committee, by staff reporter Yao Kan-nan (1202  6373 0589) in Beijing; date not given: "Qiao Shi Answers  Questions on Building the Legal System In the Context of  Socialist Market Economy"]    [Text] Just before the second session of the Eighth  National People's Congress [NPC], Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC  standing committee, gave an interview to our staff reporter in  Beijing on the building of the legal system in the context of  the socialist market economy. Despite his busy schedule, Qiao  Shi spared some of his precious time and answered the questions  in detail. The topics covered issues people are concerned about  in many areas, such as the establishment of the legal system for  the socialist market economy, the acceleration of drafting  economic laws, the coordination of the reform and opening up  with the building of the legal system, and the improvement of  the whole society's awareness of law and understanding of the  legal system.  <H5>  Accelerating the Drafting of Economic Laws </H5>   [Yao] The second session of the Eighth NPC is about to open.  Chairman, what expectations do you have of this session?    [Qiao] Before this NPC session, the NPC standing committee  made some down-to-earth preparations. The objective we are  striving for is to form a rough legal structure framework for  the socialist market economy before the end of the current NPC's  term. Since the first session of the Eighth NPC, the standing  committee has adopted 19 laws or decisions related to legal  matters. This year, another batch of important laws are due to  be promulgated. We set great store by the building of the legal  system and strive to integrate the reform and opening up with  the building of legal system and learn to administer the economy  by way of law. In pursuance of the principles provided in our  Constitution, we shall accelerate the drafting of economic laws  and, in the meantime, make a good job of the formulation,  substantiation, and improvement of laws in other fields. We  shall, with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the  guides, make sure that the forthcoming NPC session will have the  nature of being democratic, unified, truth-seeking, practical,  trailblazing, and enterprising, so that the people of all  nationalities in the whole country can be further mobilized to  work as one, seize the opportunity, deepen the reform, expand  the opening up, promote development, maintain stability, and  promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  national economy. I am full of confidence about this.    [Yao] This year, the tasks of deepening the reforms in the  whole country are very heavy and many reform measures have been  promulgated. How can the work of the NPC and people's  congresses at all levels in localities adapt to the needs of the  reforms? Could you please comment on this?    [Qiao] As you have just said, the year 1994 is one wherein  many measures for deepening the reforms will be promulgated.  Each and every reform measure we adopt is of vital importance.  For this reason, the NPC and local people's congresses at all  levels will promote and support the smooth implementation of all  reform measures through their respective efforts. This year,  the NPC Standing Committee will continue to give top priority to  the acceleration of legislation, especially the drafting of  economic laws. We have made a legislation plan for this term  and, according to its requirements, we shall make proper  arrangements for the legislative work and guide, promote, and  support the reforms with laws. As to the reform measures which  have already been promulgated, we should sum up our experiences  in good time and try to finalize them in a legal form to the  greatest extent possible, so that they can be standardized and  codified.  <H3>  Make a Good Job of the Legislative Work in a Number of  Respects </H3>   [Yao] In the course of establishing a socialist market  economic system, we will encounter some contradictions and  problems in the changeover from the old system to the new one.  In what way does the NPC Standing Committee plan to make a good  job of the legislative work, so that these problems can be  smoothly solved?    [Qiao] The coming few years will be a critical period for  the conversion of our economic system. There has never been any  successful precedent in the world of a smooth transition from a  planned economy to a market economy. It is all up to us to  explore. In the meantime, there is no existing model to follow  as to how the framework of legal system for the market economy  should be established and we must also make a big effort to  explore this. The socialist market economy does not mean one  can do whatever one wishes to or that each can go his own way  with total disregard to laws. In a sense, the socialist market  economy is one ruled by law. Therefore, the NPC and local  people's congresses are faced with onerous legislative tasks.  Only by guiding, standardizing, and supporting it with laws,  can we ensure a healthy development of the socialist market  economy.    In the course of legislation for the market economy, we may  encounter some contradictions and difficulties. To solve these  problems, we will mainly resort to the following solutions. The  first solution is that we will try to match legislation with the  progress of the reform and opening up. On this point, Deng  Xiaoping once said: Having laws is better than having no laws;  fast legislation is better than slow legislation. For some  matters which should be either promoted or eliminated, if the  conditions for legislation are not ripe for the time being, we  can first make administrative regulations or local regulations  and, when we have had some experience, upgrade them to laws.  The second solution is that we must stick to the principle of  subordinating local interests to the overall interests of the  country, avoid overemphasis on local interests and powers, and  avoid passing the buck to each other. The third solution is  that we must base ourselves on China's national conditions and  boldly absorb and draw upon foreign experiences. We can  directly transplant some legal provisions used by other  countries which suit our national conditions and keep improving  them through practice. Some market economy-related laws in our  country should be made in such a way that they can converge with  the relevant laws of other countries and international practice.  The fourth solution is that local people's congresses and their  standing committees should, in light of the actual needs of  their respective administrative areas, step up efforts to  formulate local regulations regarding the market economy, under  the premise of not contravening the Constitution, laws, and  administrative regulations. Besides, we also emphasize that the  role of experts should be brought into play in the process of  legislation and the quality of legislation should be enhanced.  This way, laws are bound to be able to play the role of  effectively supporting and promoting the development of the  socialist market economy.  <H5>  Laws Which Urgently Need Promulgating </H5>   [Yao] You once said the laws that urgently need to be  promulgated in China at present include: Laws standardizing the  subjects of the market; laws to regulate the relationship among  the subjects of the market and maintain fair competition; laws  which improve and strengthen macroregulation and control and  promote coordinated development of the economy; and laws to  establish and improve the social security system. Could you  please elaborate a little on these?    [Qiao] Making laws to standardize the subjects of the market  is largely for the purpose of safeguarding the rights and  interests of the subjects of the market and defining their  obligations according to law, to ensure that they can operate by  making their own decisions, assuming sole responsibility for  profits and losses, seeking development with their own  resources, and exercising self- restraint. For example, the  "Company Law" that was adopted not long ago is important. It is  of great significance in defining the legal status of companies  as a subject of the market, standardizing the organization and  behavior of companies, establishing a modern enterprise system,  and promoting the healthy development of the socialist market  economy. The laws for regulating the relationship among the  subjects of the market and maintaining fair competition, such as  the "Law Against Unfair Practices in Competition," the "Economic  Contract Law," the "Securities Act," the "Checking Law," the  "Arbitration Law," the "guaranteed Mortgage Law," the "Real  Estate Law," and the "Law For the Protection of Consumer Rights  and Interests, are all extremely important and necessary. Of  these, the "Law Against Unfair Practices in Competition," the  "Economic Contract Law," and the "Law for the Protection of  Consumer Rights and Interests" have been drafted. Other laws  have been listed in the legislation plan of the NPC standing  committee and their formulation will be carried out with greater  efforts. As to the laws for improving and strengthening  macroregulation and control and promoting coordinated  development of the economy, we plan to submit the budget act to  the second session of the Eighth NPC to be held this year for  deliberation; other laws such as the "Central Bank Law,"  "Commercial Bank Law," and "Foreign Trade Law" are listed in the  legislation plan and will be drafted. We will also make laws  for adjusting the industrial structure and promoting scientific  and technological advance. As to the laws for establishing and  improving the social security system, we pay close attention to  such laws as the "Labor Law" and the "Insurance Law." In short,  the legislation in the above areas is mandatory. Some laws have  already been drafted, some are under deliberation, and some will  be made efficiently and in a planned way.   <H5>    How To Improve the Legal System </H5>   [Yao] So far, many laws have been promulgated in China but,  in the course of implementation, cases of "failure to abide by  the laws in force" have happened. How can this problem be  solved?    [Qiao] The Chinese society stayed in the feudal stage for  thousands of years, so people's understanding of the legal  system is still quite weak. Therefore, it takes long-term,  unremitting efforts to establish a society ruled by law and  gradually perfect it. We should, through legislation, make  people realize what they should do and what they are not allowed  to do; what is lawful and what is unlawful. Alongside  lawmaking, we should also strengthen the propaganda on law,  conduct extensive education to spread the knowledge of law, and  help the people enhance their awareness of the law and  understanding of the legal system. In the meantime, we should  energetically strengthen inspection and supervision on the  enforcement of laws after they are made; supervise the  enforcement of the Constitution; and see to it that  administrative, procuratorial, and judicial organs enforce the  law to the letter. This is the power which the Constitution has  vested in the NPC Standing Committee. We will, through our  unremitting efforts, establish the authority of the Constitution  and laws societywide and firmly redress any phenomenon of  failing to abide by laws in force, failing to enforce the law to  the letter, or failing to prosecute law breakers.  <H5>  Expectations and Requirements on CHING CHI TAO PAO </H5>   [Yao] Do you have any expectations and requirements  regarding CHING CHI TAO PAO?    [Qiao] The 1990's is an important period for our country to  achieve national reunification. China will resume sovereignty  over Hong Kong and Macao in 1997 and 1999 respectively. I hope  that CHING CHI TAO PAO, as a rather influential economic journal  in Hong Kong, while providing a window to China's economic  construction, will make an effort to explain the work done by  the people's congresses at all levels in China and what is going  on with legislation in China, so that more Hong Kong and Macao  compatriots, Taiwan compatriots, overseas Chinese, and foreign  people can see that China will be built into a modern and  democratic socialist country with a well developed legal system.  I hope you will continue with your efforts and run the journal  well, contributing to the cooperation and exchange between the  mainland and various parties in Hong Kong and Macao.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil market looks for output cut from Opec meeting Oil ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meet in Vienna today, almost two months after setting a new production ceiling that has so far failed to prop up persistently weak prices. The optimism that followed the September agreement to put a 24.52m-barrels-a-day ceiling on Opec production dissipated as prices drifted lower in recent weeks. The price of benchmark Brent Blend has tested new post-Gulf war lows as it has fluctuated in the Dollars 15- to Dollars 16-a-barrel range. The Opec basket, an average of six crudes, has slumped even lower, to about Dollars 14.50 a barrel, from Dollars 18.50 earlier in the year. Analysts suggest that Opec will have to make at least a temporary cut in output to jolt bearish market psychology and break the widespread perception among traders that plentiful supplies will be available for some time to come. Some analysts suggest that a pro-rata cut of as much as 5 per cent of Opec's ceiling will be needed to halt, let alone reverse the price slide. The authoritative Middle East Economic Survey yesterday said Opec ministers could either 'hold fast to the six-month September accord, in the hopeful expectation that the market will pick up of its own accord as the winter progresses', or 'bite the bullet which the market is demanding - namely to cut the current ceiling by at least 500,000 b/d or some two per cent.' Mr Mehdi Varzi, research director at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, agrees that 'if Opec wants higher prices they have to cut production. . . the market needs a clear signal'. Some analysts say, however, that any cut is unlikely to give a big boost to prices in the short term because too many factors - such as the weather and buoyant non-Opec production - are beyond the control of the organisation. In September Opec tried to reverse growing price weakness by raising its ceiling to 24.52m b/d. The strategy to regain market credibility through a higher ceiling was based on the notion that it would accommodate members such as Iran and Kuwait who were consistently cheating on their quotas. The higher ceiling also allowed Opec to set individual country quotas that took most producers close to capacity, thus reducing the prospects of serious cheating. The ministers counted on a traditional increase in demand with the advent of the northern hemisphere winter to mop up excess stocks, which had been built up in part by earlier over-production by Opec states. The thinking at the time was that strict compliance was all that would be needed to ensure firmer prices as higher demand in consuming countries chipped away at surplus stocks. That strategy has been undermined, however, by a combination of plentiful supples and continuing low demand in the main consuming countries.</p>

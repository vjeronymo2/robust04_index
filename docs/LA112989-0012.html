			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> The wild spending spree in baseball is a source of amazement to Don Drysdale, a  Hall of Famer who held out for the grand sum of $115,000 in the spring of 1966  after winning 23 games for the World Series champions the year before. . . .  </P> <P> "You read about somebody signing for $2 million or $3 million a year and the  next article is about a lockout or a strike," Drysdale said at the kickoff  luncheon for the Dodger centennial celebration Tuesday. "It's beyond my  comprehension." . . .  </P> <P> Drysdale and Sandy Koufax were a holdout tandem in '66. Koufax got $125,00  after a 26-win season. . . .  </P> <P> Free agent pitcher Jerry Reuss looks for a lot of movement once Mark Langston  is signed. . . .  </P> <P> Dusty Baker, the Giants' hitting coach, on the World Series: "The A's are one  of the best balanced teams I've ever seen. We didn't lose. They won." . . .  </P> <P> The Dodgers' 1989 draft was ranked the best of any organization by Baseball  America. . . .  </P> <P> Highly regarded catcher Todd Zeile from UCLA is the reason the St. Louis  Cardinals let free agent Tony Pena get away to the Boston Red Sox. . . .  </P> <P> No black quarterback ever has won the Heisman Trophy, but Houston's Andre Ware,  Notre Dame's Tony Rice and West Virginia's Major Harris are among the leading  candidates this week. . . .  </P> <P> Although Indiana running back Anthony Thompson won the Walter Camp player of  the year award, Ware remains the Heisman favorite. Coaches and sports  information directors vote for the Camp, the media for the Heisman. . . .  </P> <P> I never understood why the Atlanta Falcons invited Marion Campbell back after  he went 6-19 the first time around. . .  </P> <P> Dan Reeves, coach of the Denver Broncos, certainly keeps a close watch on his  players. He didn't suspend rookie running back Bobby Humphrey after his arrest  on charges of driving under the influence of alcohol and speeding Friday night  because it took place before 1 a.m. . . .  </P> <P> The New York Giants don't have the rushing game to reach the Super Bowl. . . .  </P> <P> This might sound familiar to Buddy Ryan: In a recent episode of the television  show "First and Ten," Lawrence Taylor played a linebacker who got a bounty for  knocking a rival quarterback out of a game. . . .  </P> <P> The Rams should trade Gaston Green someplace where he is wanted. . . .  </P> <P> If Lou Holtz leaves Notre Dame, his replacement most likely will be Virginia  Coach George Welsh. . . .  </P> <P> Isn't it time for Northwestern, which allowed an average of 46 points in its  eight conference defeats, to think about leaving the Big Ten? . . .  </P> <P> That wonderful and whacky NBA schedule brings the defending champion Detroit  Pistons into the Forum Friday for their only Inglewood appearance of the  regular season. They should find the Laker backcourt somewhat improved from the  last time they visited here. . . .  </P> <P> Craig Ehlo, the guard who replaced Ron Harper in Cleveland's starting lineup,  has been quoted as saying the Cavaliers "lost out" in the trade with the  Clippers. . . .  </P> <P> Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone rejected an offer of $80,000 to pose nude for  Playgirl magazine, but is considering a $25,000 offer to pose in his shorts. .  . .  </P> <P> President-general manager Lloyd Arnold wants to bring trifecta betting to the  Los Alamitos harness races. . . .  </P> <P> Syracuse is the most talented collegiate basketball team in the nation. . . .  </P> <P> Harold Miner indicated Monday against Prairie View A&amp;M that he will be a  force for USC his freshman season, but the Trojans will have to rebound better  to be competitive against Washington State and Washington on the road this  week. . . .  </P> <P> From George Raveling: "The biggest myth in basketball is that leapers are great  rebounders. Ninety-five percent of the rebounds are taken below rim level. . .  .  </P> <P> Nevada Las Vegas is the only school to be ranked in the top ten in both men's  and women's basketball. . . .  </P> <P> The center circle at Pauley Pavilion has been re-painted in honor of the 25th  season of the facility. . . .  </P> <P> Sonja Henning is an all Pac-10 guard for the Stanford women's basketball team.  Wonder if she can skate, too. . . .  </P> <P> Ascot Park, the best little auto race track in America, probably will last  through the 1990 season before being torn down. . . .  </P> <P> Look-alikes: Mike Tomczak and Tom Cruise. . . .  </P> <P> It was Bo's turn to celebrity watch a Jackson Tuesday. Bo, wife and son visited  Michael Jackson in his recording studio in Sherman Oaks. . . .  </P> <P> The Robert Daniels-Dwight Qawi junior heavyweight title bout in France -- won  by Daniels on a split decision -- was scored by three female judges. . . .  </P> <P> From Alan King, the comedian who was born as Irwin Kniberg: "I started out  boxing for a living and got beat up a lot. The first thing I had to change was  my nose. The second thing was my name." . . .  </P></p>

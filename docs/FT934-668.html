			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Tackling the ghost of Black Wednesday - Sara Webb explains moves to ease liquidity problems in London's money markets For months, London's sterling money market has been haunted by the ghost of Black Wednesday. But with the implementation of new procedures early next year, the Bank of England hopes to alleviate the liquidity and volatility problems which stemmed from the September 1992 sterling crisis. When the Bank was forced to support sterling in the autumn of 1992 - in what later proved to be a futile attempt to keep the British currency within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism - the heavy intervention resulted in a large drain of liquidity from the money market. The Bank introduced temporary measures to ease difficulties and ensure a steady flow of wholesale cash through the banking system. The biggest banks and building societies, as well as the gilt-edged marketmakers (Gemms), were allowed to borrow money from the Bank using UK government bonds (gilts) and other high quality paper as security. This ad hoc 'sale and repurchase' of gilts, known as a repo, took place directly between individual counterparties and the Bank. The measures were used to complement the Bank's normal money market operations in which the Bank accepts bills from the banks in return for lending wholesale cash. Now, the Bank has decided to keep these repo facilities as a feature of its money market operations, with a fortnightly timetable. Funds will be provided through the purchase and resale of government debt denominated in sterling and other currencies. In addition, the Bank is inviting all banks and building societies, as well as the Gemms, to act as counterparties. In the past, only the biggest banks and building societies were able to do so. The proposed changes are outlined in a memo from the Bank which was sent to members of the British Bankers' Association at the weekend. Given the December 31 deadline for comments and the holiday mood, it would appear the Bank does not expect BBA members to object. Privately, several money market participants have already welcomed the proposals, and there is now considerable speculation that further improvements to the financial markets could follow. The main point is that the measures should help to reduce the liquidity shortage to a more manageable level while ensuring that short-term interest rates are less volatile. 'The discount houses are very much in favour of this as it should pull more liquidity into the market and reduce the daily shortages,' said Mr Robin Moser, chairman of the Discount Market Association and chief executive of Alexanders Discount. According to Mr Philip Shaw, an economist at Union Discount, 'daily shortages of Pounds 1bn-plus have become the norm'. The moves should also help to reduce the volatility of short-term interest rates. The discount houses complain that a couple of the big clearing banks have a tendency to 'manipulate' the overnight interest rate by hoarding bills. They maintain that overnight interest rates have oscillated between 4.5 per cent and as much as 20 per cent. 'The clearing banks have had effective control of the market, as they have been the biggest holders of bills,' says one market participant. According to Mr Shaw, 'smaller banks often face unpredictable and prohibitive funding costs. The ensuing notion is that the UK money markets are increasingly becoming a closed club which does little to promote London's reputation as a financial centre.' With the proposed changes, the Bank should be able to keep closer control over short-term rates. To some extent, it depends how many people use the repo system. While the clearers are expected to remain the biggest players in the money market, in theory by distributing the liquidity provided by the Bank over a broader range of participants, their influence should be tempered. 'Overnight rates will never go up to extortionate levels again except at those times when the authorities deliberately push up short-term rates, for example to dampen speculation about a possible interest rate cut. This takes the violent swings out of the market,' says Mr George Blunden, chairman of Union Discount. The system is not the same as that used by the Bundesbank in its money market operations where the weekly repo is one of the most closely watched rates. It could be argued that the Bank could quite easily use its repo rate more frequently than twice a month, and harmonise operating procedures with other European central banks as the prospect of European Monetary Union draws closer. As yet, however, there are no signs that the Bank is considering doing so, and the discount houses believe the bill system will remain the significant day-to-day operation. What the proposals have done, though, is to kindle hopes in some quarters of the City that the Bank will implement further changes to the financial markets. Specifically, they ask: what is to stop the Bank from allowing the establishment of an open gilt repo system - whereby holders of gilts could lend out their stock directly to other parties in the market rather than only to the Bank - given that the proposed changes are being seen as a step in that direction? One money market specialist points out that the new arrangements set the basic standards for an open repo system and should encourage familiarity among banks and building societies with the concept of 'repo-ing' gilt holdings. The Bank is considering an open gilt repo system, but it may be some way off.</p>

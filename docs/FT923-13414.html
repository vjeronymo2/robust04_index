			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: US buy helps Tomkins to Pounds 132m TOMKINS, the industrial conglomerate, reported an 18 per cent increase in full-year profits to Pounds 132m owing to the increased contribution from Philips Industries of the US which it bought in 1990. Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive of the company whose interests include bathroom fittings, reinforced shoes, Smith &amp; Wesson hand-guns and mechanical valves, said that while there were no signs of any turnround in the UK, Tomkins had a low cost base and high level of operational gearing which meant it would benefit strongly from the end of recession. Pre-tax profits in the year to May 2 rose from Pounds 112m to Pounds 132m on sales 22 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.27bn. Earnings per share increased by 5 per cent to 27.63p. An increased final dividend of 8.12p (7.06p) is recommended, to give 11.34p for the year, up 15 per cent. Tomkins has not made any substantial acquisitions since Philips and does not need another sizeable acquisition to meet its target of out-performing the UK market in earnings per share growth, he added. The group ended the year with cash balances of Pounds 110m, up from Pounds 46m. This was achieved by squeezing cash from working capital at Philips and strong cash generation from its operating companies. Capital expenditure of Pounds 25m during the year fell below the depreciation charge of Pounds 29m, although another Pounds 14m had been approved and not spent. The results highlighted the benefits of the Philips acquisition, not only in terms of cash generation but also in having a spread of activities. At the operating level Philips, which is now fully integrated and called Tomkins Industries, contributed about Pounds 50m. This was almost double the contribution in the 8 1/2 months for which it was consolidated the previous year. In particular, it had a surprisingly strong second half because US housing starts grew substantially faster than expected and sales of recreational vehicles increased. The group also continued to enjoy strong growth in bicycle sales in the US, partly as a result of the weak dollar and import substitution, and also increased the exports of mowers to an all time record. Mr Ian Duncan, finance director, said Tomkins had found many of Philips' operational managers were of good quality, but there was sloppy financial control, too much stock and antiquated computer systems. The group's dependence on the US, which accounts for about 70 per cent of sales but less pre-tax profits, has raised the possibility that it could hit an advanced corporation tax problem in the UK.

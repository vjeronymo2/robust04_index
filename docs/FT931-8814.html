			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brown to stress economic pragmatism MR GORDON BROWN will today take the Labour party another step along the road towards a pragmatic economic strategy by dismissing as irrelevant traditional internal debates on the respective roles of the state and the market. In the second of a series of speeches designed to map out a new approach to the economy the shadow chancellor will argue that ideological arguments about the private and public sectors distract from the core of Labour's argument. He will stress instead that the enhancement by government of individual opportunity - using both the public and private sectors - is the prerequisite for a successful economy. Last month Mr Brown dropped Labour's pre-election proposals to impose significant tax increases on the middle classes to pay for new social welfare commitments. That was followed by a commitment in the first of the present series of speeches to position Labour as the party which represents the interests of individual consumers against the entrenched and often monopolistic power of producers. Building on Mr John Smith's recent attempt to portray Labour as the party in tune with the aspirations of ordinary people, the shadow chancellor will argue today that it now regards individual and national economic success as interchangeable. His speech adds: 'Our argument is that people become better off learning more, earning more and contributing to the economy by producing more. In this way self interest equates with the national interest and, as individuals succeed, companies and the country succeed also'. Mr Brown blames what he calls a 'failure of ideology' by the Conservatives - the assumption that economic prosperity will follow automatically if the government withdraws from the market-place - for the present ills afflicting the economy, highlighting the trade deficit, mounting public borrowing and unemployment heading above 3m. The shadow chancellor will set out instead Labour's alternative to use 'the power of government' to advance industrial potential and individual skills. That would go far beyond the training budget to fiscal, industrial, regional, technology and social security policies.</p>

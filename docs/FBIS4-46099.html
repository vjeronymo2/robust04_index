			<p>BFN     [Text] Taegu, May 26 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister [and  chairman of the National Unification Board, NUB] Yi Hong-ku  stressed on Thursday that the North Korean nuclear question has  to be resolved not by third parties but by responsible  authorities of the two Koreas.    In a speech at the "Square for Unification Dialogue" held at  the Hillside Hotel here, Yi said, "to this end, there needs  government efforts to tackle those productive areas that can be  agreed on and implemented under the principle of resolution  between the direct parties involved."    He said that since the nuclear issue is an all-important  question over which the nation's survival is at stake, the  government's basic stand is that it cannot allow inter-Korean  exchanges or economic cooperation unless there is a substantial  progress in nuclear negotiations.    "North Korea cannot possess nuclear arms because if they do,  it would shatter power balance between South and North Korea and  would possibly lead to giving Japan an excuse to go nuclear  itself to the prejudice of peace order in Northeast Asia,"  Deputy Premier Yi said.    Also saying that the country now needs the kind of education  to prepare for unification, Yi said the people should now  prepare to share post-unification burdens.</p>

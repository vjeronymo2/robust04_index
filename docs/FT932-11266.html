			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Nuclear rift over Ukraine NUCLEAR disarmament was perhaps the most cherished fruit of the end of the cold war. Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin acknowledged as much when they signed the Start 2 strategic arms limitation treaty in Moscow last January. The rest of the world applauded the prospect of a further significant reduction in the US and ex-Soviet nuclear arsenals, and western policymakers began turning their minds to the next big disarmament challenge: that of renewing and strengthening the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Now it is beginning to look as if everyone relaxed too soon. The Russian parliament has yet to ratify Start 2. More worrying, neighbouring, newly independent Ukraine is embroiled in an increasingly acrimonious row with Russia and the west over the 176 Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles and 41 nuclear-armed bombers still on its soil. Without sensitive handling on all sides, the dispute risks upsetting the international disarmament process and becoming a serious irritant in efforts to renew the NPT. At worst, it could encourage something the west desperately wants to prevent: the emergence of a renegade power in the heart of Europe, clinging to nuclear weapons for lack of what it sees as reliable security guarantees, and perhaps seeking alliances with other would-be nuclear states in the Middle East or Asia. Insensitive handling Thus far, the west's - and in particular Washington's - handling of the issue has been anything but sensitive. The Clinton administration has issued a series of warnings to Ukraine that it will not discuss aid for its shattered economy or any other bilateral questions until Kiev has ratified the earlier Start 1 strategic arms treaty and acceded to the NPT. Ukrainian leaders have been promising to do this since 1991, but parliament has yet to deliver. The main result of US pressure has been to fuel the growth of pro-nuclear sentiment among legislators, making it decreasingly likely that Ukraine will agree to go non-nuclear in the foreseeable future. How is the impasse to be broken? In exchange for ratification, President Leonid Kravchuk is demanding substantial western assistance towards the cost of dismantling the weapons (the US has promised Dollars 175m); payment of the proceeds from sale of the nuclear fuel they contain; and cast-iron guarantees of Ukraine's security from Nato powers and from Russia. Western governments, though some have given security assurances, instinctively jib at what they see as a form of nuclear blackmail. But their failure to respond merely reinforces the Ukrainians' inclination to hang on to nuclear weapons either as a deterrent to Russian adventurism or simply as a means of ensuring they are taken seriously. Legitimate concerns On both these counts Ukraine has legitimate concerns. Russia has consistently refused to sign a comprehensive political treaty with Ukraine recognising the inviolability of its frontiers, except in the context of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the successor body to the USSR of which Ukraine has said it does not want to be a full member. Moreover, influential voices in the Russian parliament are frequently heard staking claims to Ukrainian territory. The potential for instability in Russia is such that Ukraine has no reason to lower its guard. This problem is compounded by the impression in Kiev that the west is so fixated on the need to give political and economic support to Russia that it is turning a blind eye to Moscow's handling of conflicts with its neighbours. In allowing that perception to take hold, western governments have committed a blunder which they may live to regret. Fortunately, it is not too late to correct the balance. To do so the US should couple continuing pressure on Kiev over nuclear weapons with equally firm efforts to persuade Russia to sign a treaty securing Ukraine's sovereignty and its borders. In addition, other interested parties - particularly Britain and France as Europe's other nuclear powers - could adopt a higher profile in the effort to soothe Ukraine's security concerns. Finally, all involved need to demonstrate convincingly that they are coming to terms with the emergence of a new European country larger than France, and that if Ukraine moves down the path of economic reform they are prepared to assist it as generously as they are helping Russia. That way, Ukraine will not feel it needs to retain nuclear weapons to hold the world's attention.</p>

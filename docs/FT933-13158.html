			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Riot police sent to end Hyundai dispute: Seoul's tough stance on industrial unrest THE South Korean government yesterday demanded that workers at Hyundai Motor suspend their industrial action immediately and sent riot police to enforce the order. The swift intervention is meant to end the 46 days of labour strife that has disrupted South Korea's biggest industrial conglomerate. Hyundai Motor is the largest of the nine Hyundai companies still affected by stoppages that began in early June. Hyundai estimates that it has lost Won390bn (Pounds 326m) in sales as a result of the partial strikes at the country's leading vehicle maker. This accounts for two-thirds of total losses in turnover suffered by Hyundai during the dispute, while total production losses amount to Won1,230bn, including business lost by 2,500 subcontractors mostly affiliated with Hyundai Motor. In targeting Hyundai Motor, the government hopes to persuade workers at the other striking Hyundai companies to settle their dispute over pay and working conditions and return to work. The government invoked its emergency powers to intervene because it fears that the continuing labour conflict could affect Korea's economic recovery by reducing exports. Officials estimate that the country has already lost almost Won250bn in exports, mainly motor vehicles, due to the strike. Although Hyundai Motor workers had resumed normal schedules late last week in a conciliatory gesture to management, they threatened to resume partial strikes today and stage a general strike on Friday if no progress was achieved in negotiations. Hyundai Motor workers are now barred from staging any form of industrial action until August 8, while the government mediates in the dispute, possibly imposing a settlement. As many as 10,000 police are being deployed to Ulsan - the south-eastern city where Hyundai Motor and the other Hyundai companies are located - to suppress any strike activity. A clash between workers and riot police would be highly embarrassing for the new democratic government of Mr Kim Young-sam, who promised labour reforms when he took office five months ago. The use of emergency powers already represents a setback for the government's labour policy, which was based on negotiations between labour and management without any government interference. It is only the second time the government has resorted to using emergency powers to end a labour dispute, the first having occurred in 1969. But police were frequently used to suppress strikes during the military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

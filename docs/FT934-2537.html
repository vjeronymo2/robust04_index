			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / World Trade News: The gavel falls on most of Uruguay Round The whisper early on Sunday evening that Uruguay Round negotiators had settled a fiercely fought row over a US bid to dilute international restraint on the use of anti-dumping laws was a watershed at the end of an otherwise fraught weekend. After a low point on Sunday morning when Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's trade commissioner, talked of a crisis in negotiations with the US, news of a breakthrough on the anti-dumping issue injected optimism. The view among negotiators was that if an issue as apparently intractable as anti-dumping could be resolved, then surely other outstanding disagreements  -mainly linked with trade in services - must surely be resolved. Late yesterday, the US and the EU remained at loggerheads on US access to Europe's film and television markets, while US threats to exempt itself from offering full most-favoured-nation status in financial services remained. But, in the wake of an anti-dumping settlement, the gavel has fallen on most of the Uruguay Round agreement. A glimpse into how the anti-dumping clash was settled provides insights into the carefully orchestrated fudges that have been needed in recent days to bring the Uruguay Round deal close to completion, and to ensure that lobbies back home see the gains, rather than the losses, that have been involved in the process. Of the 11 changes demanded by the US to the text of the Uruguay Round anti-dumping agreement - which is intended to provide stricter international discipline on dumping actions at a time of concern over their proliferation  -US negotiators will tell their domestic audience that it has scored seven out of 11. Its key 'victory' has been to win agreement over 'standards of review', where the US had been protesting at proposed new Gatt powers to re-examine not just the handling of a dumping case, but the facts presented to it. For opponents of the US proposals, there will be relief that demands for stricter anti-circumvention rules have been rejected. Similarly, the agreement will retain its 'sunset' clause forcing a dumping duty to expire after a certain number of years. Concessions have been made to the US, but these do not entitle the US to retain dumping duties indefinitely. More than 10 per cent of US dumping duties have been in place for more than 20 years. Another important concession to the US has been amendment to the 'standing' text which will entitle labour unions as well as companies to bring dumping complaints to the government. US demands that the 'de minimis' clause be amended have been agreed. These set levels at which imports are so negligible that allegations of dumping will not be considered. However, the US demand for the 2 per cent threshold to be cut to 0.5 per cent, has been rejected. It will stay at 2 per cent. 'Trying to read this agreement is rather like reading goats' entrails,' one dumping negotiator commented. 'We will all be looking at the same thing, but the US will tell its domestic audience one thing, and others will tell their domestic lobbies another.' Japan, a fervent opponent of the proposed US changes, was licking its wounds yesterday. One senior negotiator said: 'We did not want to touch the original text, so we are not very happy about the outcome. But the political reality is that the US needed support in Congress, so that was a concession we have had to give to them.' He insisted that the compromise outcome 'is at least less ambiguous than the original US proposals'. For Gatt negotiators, the compromise is historic: 'Every previous deal has had to be imposed on countries with unreconciled disagreements,' he said: 'This is the first agreed text ever achieved in the area of anti-dumping,' one said. Such are the climaxes to a negotiator's day.</p>

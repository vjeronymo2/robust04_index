			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: HERNANDEZ HIDEAWAY CHEERFULLY GREETS WEARY SOULS  WITH HEAPING-FULL PLATES  </P> <P> The host at Hernandez Hideaway greeted a late-arriving party on a Friday night  with a sympathetic expression and a friendly, "So you survived another week,  huh?"  </P> <P> A quick glance made it clear that the room was filled with survivors, all of  them happily digging into plates spread to the rims with beans, rice and any of  the numerous Mexican-style dishes that over the years have helped Hernandez  Hideaway to contend for the title of North County's worst-kept secret. And,  although the restaurant hasn't yet hung out a "This burrito's for you" sign, it  does seem to encourage a relaxed, end-of-the-week atmosphere every night.  </P> <P> The restaurant's name was perhaps more accurate some years ago, tucked away on  the shores of Lake Hodges. The drive to the lake now is a little less bucolic,  but the restaurant's surroundings still remain rural and charming. If the time  of the month is right, a post-dinner stroll near the moonlit waters of the lake  is as refreshing as a second cup of coffee.  </P> <P> Nothing on the menu will seem new to anyone acquainted with Southern  California-style Mexican cooking, but the selection should seem a complete and  even exhaustive survey of this cuisine. Several items are paired with a chile  relleno, a dish for which the restaurant says it is famous, and among such  combo plates are those starring a carne asada top sirloin, an unusual grilled  quesadilla stuffed with cheese and shredded beef, a plump tamale and the house  specialty, chicken enchiladas with sour cream sauce.  </P> <P> Hernandez Hideaway has been cooking this menu for years and gives less  attention to some dishes than it ought. A guest who is a native Californian and  a lifelong aficionado of this style of cooking pulled a tortilla chip out of  the basket, gave it a thoughtful bite and said, "This leaves a lot to be  desired." Both the red and green salsas passed muster, however, and the red  salsa can serve duty as more than a dip for the complimentary chips; a big  spoonful of it stirred into the fresh, chunky guacamole (another house special)  brought the creamy mixture to life.  </P> <P> Skipping through the first 10 items on the list brings one to the sour cream  chicken enchilada. "No. 11 is our best seller, and you'll like it, too," said  the waitress. The irresistible suggestion resulted in a high-piled plate being  served in short order. The chicken was dry -- perhaps because it was towards  the end of the dinner hour or perhaps because the kitchen makes this dish in  such quantity -- but dry it was, and the sour cream sauce was hard to find. A  request for more sauce brought a brimming bowlful, and it did add not only  smoothness to the serving but a certain pleasant heat, thanks to the bits of  chilies with which it was spiked. The chile relleno on the side offered an  attractive, savory alternative to the rather austere fowl, the flavor robust  yet sultry under its cloak of burnt umber-colored ranchero sauce.  </P> <P> The tamale, stuffed with the same shredded beef that here turns up in the  machaca and other dishes, was a straightforward and happy preparation, the  savory meat nicely balanced against the soft dough and the mildly spicy sauce.  As is the case with all entrees, the plate was more than generously garnished  with good rice and smooth, savory beans topped with a bit of cheese; dinners  also include a side of Mexican-style slaw, the cabbage dry and tangy and an  excellent antidote to the richness and heat of many main courses.  </P> <P> Other menu highlights include pork chile verde (which can be had by itself or  transformed into burritos); chicken breasts simmered in ranchero sauce and  bedded on rice; shrimp Vera Cruz; carne asada burritos; carnitas and steak  ranchero. The dessert list offers several kinds of cheesecake, bunuelos and a  thick, creamy and excellently flavored flan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> * HERNANDEZ HIDEAWAY  </P> <P> 19328 Lake Drive, Escondido  </P> <P> 746-1444  </P> <P> Dinner Tuesday through Friday, brunch and dinner Saturday and Sunday; closed  Monday.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.Dinner for two, including one margarita each, tax and  tip, $25 to $35.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PLAN TO COVER RESERVOIRS DRAWS 1,000 L.A. PROTESTERS  </P> <P> Nearly 1,000 angry and vocal Los Angeles residents clashed with city Department  of Water and Power officials Saturday over a controversial proposal to cover  six of the city's open-air reservoirs as part of a water-purification effort.  </P> <P> For two hours, residents held aloft critical signs, jeered, hissed and bellowed  catcalls at DWP officials as they tried to present a slide show outlining the  options under consideration in the purification effort.  </P> <P> The DWP is formulating its plan in response to more-stringent drinking water  standards it expects from the state and federal government, and says it could  cost taxpayers as much as $1 billion.  </P> <P> The meeting, held at Le Conte Junior High School in Hollywood, was the seventh  of nine forums the DWP has scheduled for this month to solicit public comment  before completing its plan to improve the quality of drinking water for 3.4  million city residents.  </P> <P> Bruce Mahler, representing the Coalition to Preserve Open Reservoirs, told the  gathering that the DWP had its priorities wrong. At the same time the DWP  considers covering reservoirs that pose no safety risk, he said, it virtually  ignores severe ground-water contamination problems that have forced a shutdown  of drinking water wells in the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> "In short, the open reservoir water-quality improvement project is an  expensive, environmentally destructive, billion-dollar Band-Aid that the DWP is  trying to plaster over serious problems within our entire water system," Mahler  said. "Trying to shove the project down our throats will do nothing to restore  the confidence of citizens. . . . "  </P> <P> Mahler got a standing ovation from the crowd, as did other several speakers.  </P> <P> The catcalls got so bad that at one point an onlooker rose to condemn what he  called "utterly contemptible public displays," adding that although he did not  approve of covering the reservoirs, "I'm a taxpayer, and we don't owe you  people a pretty reservoir just so you can look at it."  </P> <P> Coalition spokeswoman Susan Scibilia said the public turnout was the best yet,  adding that each successive meeting has drawn increasing numbers of concerned  citizens from across the city -- not just from areas near reservoirs.  </P> <P> The DWP has proposed covering Upper Stone Canyon, Santa Ynez, Upper Hollywood,  Ivanhoe, Elysian and Rowena reservoirs, which range in size from 5.7 acres to  14.6 acres. Options for the remaining reservoirs considered too large and  irregularly shaped to be covered -- Lower Hollywood, Silver Lake, Encino and  Lower Stone Canyon -- include fitting them with filtration systems or replacing  them with storage tanks.  </P> <P> "Today the water delivered to you is good, but it could be better," DWP  engineer Tom Rulla said during his slide presentation. "There are real threats  from water taken from open reservoirs."  </P> <P> Rulla and Walter Hoye, engineer of water design for DWP, said bird droppings  and particles from the air and water runoff are contaminating the open  reservoirs. They also said sunlight is creating algae that fosters potentially  carcinogenic compounds when mixed with chlorine. The reservoirs are outdated,  DWP officials said, and help contribute to the fact that two out of three DWP  customers no longer drink tap water.  </P> <P> "Our customers have concerns . . . and we want to address those concerns and be  responsive to our customers," Hoye said in an interview.  </P> <P> Despite the rancorous tone of many in the crowd, Hoye remarked: "This is a good  turnout. We are very pleased about that."  </P> <P> The remaining two meetings are set for later this month in Eagle Rock and  Canoga Park. A final environmental impact report, including the public  comments, is expected by November, after which it will be considered for  approval by DWP commissioners.  </P> <P> Water used by Los Angeles residents, most of which is transported from hundreds  of miles away, is held in 96 reservoirs and tanks around the Los Angeles Basin.  The DWP says most of the reservoirs already are covered.  </P></p>

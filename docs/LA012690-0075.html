			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUTURES SELLING PUTS A DRAG ON MARKET; DOW TUMBLES 43.46  </P> <P> Stock prices ended sharply lower Thursday as a last-hour flurry of  futures-related selling toppled a market already pessimistic about interest  rates and corporate earnings.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials dropped 43.46 to 2,561.04, closing for  the first time below the 2,569.26 level that it hit last Oct. 13 in a severe  but short-lived selloff.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advances in nationwide trading of New York Stock  Exchange-listed stocks, with 539 up, 937 down and 474 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 172.27 million shares, down from 207.83 million  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Traders said few investors were in a hurry to commit funds as disappointing  earnings reports continued to roll in.  </P> <P> Buyers had also pulled back before fourth-quarter gross national product data  due today. "No one wants to be a hero," said Dillon Read &amp; Co. head trader  Daniel Williams.  </P> <P> Economists say the GNP, the nation's total output of goods and services,  expanded in the period but at a much slower rate than in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Prices rose on the Japanese stock market after a series of recent selloffs that  had unsettled other markets around the world.  </P> <P> But brokers said that apparently wasn't enough to allay fears that the risks of  a persistent slump in economic growth and corporate profits were increasing.  </P> <P> Bargain hunting caused stocks to rise in early trading, but it was not  sustained.  </P> <P> Gruntal &amp; Co.'s director of technical research, Gene Jay Seagle, believes  that the lack of buying is fostering the market's decline.  </P> <P> "There's no foreign interest, so we're getting very decided selling in stocks  like International Business Machines, Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing and  Procter &amp; Gamble," Seagle said.  </P> <P> "That's a key area, and that shows up very quickly in this market." The dearth  of interest, combined with thin volume, makes the market more vulnerable to  program trading, he said.  </P> <P> Interest rates reversed an early decline and extended their recent rise  Thursday in the market for U.S. Treasury securities.  </P> <P> In addition, more blue chip companies came in with fourth-quarter earnings  reports that disappointed investors.  </P> <P> DuPont ranked among the volume leaders, down 2 at 37 3/8. On Wednesday, the  company reported fourth-quarter earnings of 71 cents a share, barely topping  the 70 cents a share that it posted a year ago. Seagram Co., which owns a large  stake in DuPont, tumbled 6 3/8 to 76 1/8.  </P> <P> Procter &amp; Gamble, which also posted virtually flat quarterly profit, fell 3  1/2 to 62 3/4.  </P> <P> Other losers among the blue chips included International Business Machines,  down 1 5/8 at 95 7/8; Philip Morris, down 1 at 37; Exxon, down 1 at 46; General  Electric, down 1 1/4 at 62, and American Express, down 3/4 at 29 7/8.  </P> <P> Single-country investment companies provided some conspicuous exceptions to the  downtrend. Taiwan Fund gained 7/8 to 50 1/8; Italy Fund rose 1 to 18; Korea  Fund added 2 3/4 to 33 5/8, and Germany Fund rose 1 1/8 to 22 1/2.  </P> <P> The latest entry in that increasingly crowded field, the New Germany Fund,  soared to 22 in its first day of trading, from an offering price of 15.  </P> <P> The average share on the New York Stock Exchange was down 38 cents. The NYSE  Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 2.03 to 180.61. The Standard  &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 4.18 to 326.08.  </P> <P> The American Stock Exchange index fell 1.03 to 353.64; the NASDAQ  over-the-counter index was down 0.42 to 425.24.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, share prices recovered partly from Wednesday's 600-point drop but the  market remained jittery. The 225-share Nikkei average rose 190.13 to 36,969.11.  </P> <P> In London, shares ended firmer but below the day's highs after Wall Street lost  its early gains. The Financial Times 100-share index closed up 11.3 at 2,289.9.  </P></p>

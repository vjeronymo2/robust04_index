			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Lin Zhenxiong (2651 2182 7160), </F> president of the People's Bank of China's Jiangsu branch, by  staff reporter Zhu Xinhua (2612 2450 5478): "The Investment  Scale Remains Overextended, the Contradiction Between Fund  Supply and Demand Remains Glaring" -- place and date not given]    [Text] The year 1993 was unusual for our province's  banking sector. What will our province's banking situation be  in 1994? With this question in mind, this reporter interviewed  Lin Zhenxiong, president of the provincial branch of the  People's Bank of China.    Lin Zhenxiong first affirmed our province's achievements in  banking work last year. In 1993, our province scored remarkable  achievements in macroeconomic regulation and control of the  banking sector. Everybody credits "three factors" with bringing  about the hard-won change from the extremely dire situation  during the first six months to the trend toward basic stability  by year's end: The effort by the central authorities to  increase and improve the weight of policy decisions regarding  macroeconomic regulation and control, the joint efforts by party  committees and governments at all levels and by all departments,  and the joint efforts by the entire banking sector.    Thereafter, he said: Because some deep-seated problems  pertaining to economic and banking operations have yet to be  solved fundamentally, the foundation for basically stabilizing  the current banking situation remains rather fragile, and there  are still many contradictions and problems. He analyzed the  main contradictions and problems in banking work as follows:    Although the investment scale for fixed assets has been  determined, it remains overextended, and the contradiction  between supply and demand of funds remains glaring. The  commodity price index has risen rather swiftly, posing  formidable tasks for containing inflation. Working capital is  still in short supply. On the one hand, the proportion of  working capital to new loans in the state's credit plan for this  year is the smallest in history; on the other, the substantial  proportion of processing industries in our province's economy  demands large amounts of working capital. Therefore, this year,  banks will face new contraditions in arranging loans for use as  working capital. Banking institutions of various types lack  sound mechanisms by which they exercise self-restraint, and  banking activity has yet to be regulated. Although banking  order has improved somewhat, the chaotic state has yet to be  rectified completely. A few banking institutions and some  localities, departments, and units outside the banking sector  have unduly pursued gains for small groups or individuals. The  practice of indiscriminately collecting fees, providing  financial assistance, granting loans, and raising interest rates  will likely persist, and this will affect banking stability.    What are the countermeasures? Lin Zhenxiong said: The party  Central Committee has set forth the guiding principles for work  to be carried out by the entire party, as well as overall  economic work. It has determined the principle for carrying out  this year's banking work: "Continuing to restore banking order,  advancing banking reform steadily, strictly controlling the  total credit volume, and earnestly tightening supervision and  control over the banking sector." The establishment of this  principle is of vital importance for solving contradictions and  problems in banking work, for consolidating the achievements in  macroeconomic regulation and control, and for promoting  sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. According  to this principle, our province's banking sector should focus on  the following tasks this year:    It should make earnest organizational efforts to implement  the State Council's various measures for reforming the banking  system, and make every effort to raise funds and increase its  financial strength through the gradual establishment of a  banking operational mechanism suited to the socialist market  economic system. This year, it will implement a system of  managing assets and liabilities ratios under the guidance of  loan quotas. It will unify foreign exchange rates, abolish the  practice of retaining portions of foreign exchange proceeds,  conduct foreign exchange transactions through banks, inspire  foreign trading enterprises' enthusiasm for earning foreign  exchange from exports, and attract foreign funds.       It will strictly control the total credit volume,  especially loans for fixed assets investment, in accordance with  the requirements of state macroeconomic policy decisions. The  State Council recently issued a circular on continuing to  tighten macroeconomic regulation and control over fixed assets,  instructing that no efforts should be made to blindly increase  investments, launch projects, and expand the investment scale  without regard to macroeconomic conditions. As state banks,  various banking institutions should properly perform their  functions as banking departments in conjunction with planning  commissions, economic commissions, and other economic  departments under the leadership of local governments. They  should exercise strict control over financial resources in  accordance with the guidelines of the State Council's circular.    We should continue to restore banking order and create a  good  banking environment that is conducive to healthy economic  development. Because of last year's consolidation efforts,  banking order is now taking a turn for the better.  Nevertheless, all departments and localities, as well as banks  at all levels, should pay close attention to preventing the  occurrence of new problems under the new situation. Various  banking institutions should exercise greater self-restraint and  regulate their activities. The lessons of last year have taught  everybody that chaotic banking order will inevitably tarnish the  reputation of banking departments and ultimately affect economic  development. Only by maintaining banking stability can we  promote healthy economic development.    Lin Zhenxiong hoped to send the following message to various  departments through the media: According to the decision of the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we  should take a gigantic step forward in this year's reform of the  banking system. This reform, however, can only be completed  after a lengthy process. We cannot implement it in only one  move; we should advance it steadily in conjunction with reforms  in other fields. It is hoped that people in all circles will  show greater understanding of and support for our province's  reform of the banking system and banking work. Banking  departments should maintain close contact with local  governments, provide more briefings to party and government  leaders, attract greater attention from leading party and  government departments, and make more contributions to our  province's reform, opening up, and economic development.</p>

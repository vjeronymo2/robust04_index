			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MEDIA;  </P> <P> RADIO GROUP MAY REVIVE PROGRAMMING GUIDELINES  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Broadcasters, responding to a federal regulator's  suggestion to curb "shock radio," said Thursday that it is considering reviving  radio and TV program codes that were dropped under government pressure in the  1970s.  </P> <P> Federal Communications Commission Chairman Alfred Sikes, in an address to a  radio broadcasters' convention in New Orleans last week, urged radio executives  to tune out "shock radio" programs that use sexually and racially oriented  humor to attract audiences.  </P> <P> Sikes said broadcasters should revive the codes that were abandoned in the  mid-1970s after the Justice Department initiated an antitrust lawsuit against  provisions of the codes involving advertising. New codes should be drawn up by  the industry, without government pressure, Sikes said.  </P> <P> NAB spokesman Walt Wurfel said the NAB's executive committee, "in response to  comments made by Chairman Sikes at Radio 89 (convention), . . . instructed the  staff to conduct an assessment of the feasibility, effectiveness, legal and  legislative elements of -- and member support for -- devising a statement of  standards or guidelines concerning programming in the public interest."  </P> <P> Sikes, a former radio station owner who came to the FCC six weeks ago, told the  broadcasters' convention they were not "simply recorders, transmitters and  antennas. We are what we broadcast."  </P> <P> He noted that on Aug. 24, the FCC announced it was considering action against  three radio stations in Chicago, San Jose and Indianapolis for possibly  broadcasting indecent programming during daytime hours when children may have  been listening.  </P> <P> That action was widely viewed as a shot across the bow of broadcasters from a  new, no-nonsense FCC. Sikes, along with new Commissioners Andrew Barrett and  Sherrie Marshall, faced tough questioning during their Senate confirmation  hearings in July on what they proposed to do about indecency on the airwaves.  </P> <P> Wurfel said the NAB was a little gun-shy regarding new broadcasting codes in  light of the Justice Department attack on the old codes.  </P> <P> "We don't desire to get into any further antitrust action," Wurfel said, adding  that NAB also has to weigh First Amendment concerns and community concerns.  </P> <P> Wurfel said it was too early to tell if programmers or other broadcast or cable  television groups would get involved in NAB's feasibility study.  </P> <P> The House earlier this year passed a bill that would give the television  industry a three-year antitrust exemption so it can try to adopt voluntary  guidelines on violence.  </P> <P> The Senate passed a similar measure that added antitrust exemption for  guidelines on portrayals drug use and sex, and differences in the two bills are  now being worked out in a House-Senate conference committee.  </P></p>

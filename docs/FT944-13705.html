			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): US indicator rescues bourses in mid-afternoon New lows for the dollar, and further weakness in bonds took bourses to falls averaging 2 per cent in the early afternoon, when a slippage in US consumer confidence in October seemed to rescue them from their worst fears, writes Our Markets Staff. Treasuries and European domestic bonds recovered, the dollar staged a technical rally and bourses recovered half or more of their earlier losses. But Mr Nicholas Knight, the Nomura strategist, said that he would want to see a whole range of US data before he would believe that the US economy was slowing down. In the meantime, Mr Knight held to views expressed in a global strategy note on Monday: 'Our cash allocation is the highest in two years, yet still feels inadequate.' FRANKFURT exemplified the European trend. The Dax index dropped 50.75, or 2.5 per cent to 1,974.63 by the end of floor trading and dealers were prepared for it to test closing lows of around 1,950 for the year in later trading. However, bunds led an afternoon recovery after a morning drop of more than a percentage point in December bund futures. Equities responded with the Ibis indicated Dax closing 26.79, or 1.3 per cent better over 24 hours at 1,995.85. Turnover rose from DM4.7bn to DM7bn. RWE, Germany's largest electrical utility with a decline in 1993/94 earnings per share, and MAN, which said that its big commercial truck and bus division swung to a DM97.4m loss, might have made an impact on another day; but they made little difference in a market which left names like Bayer in chemicals, Deutsche Babcock in engineering and Kaufhof in retailing with falls of 2 per cent or more at the end of the afternoon. PARIS fought back from a year's low in the CAC-40 index of 1,796.82 to close the day with a loss of 17.17 to 1,824.42. The market began to rebuild itself after Wall Street opened, having collapsed earlier following the sharp increase in US Treasuries overnight. The US consumer confidence data later in the day helped to steady nerves, at least for the time being, although traders warned that, given the fact that investors were very unsettled at the moment, further weakness was to be expected. Turnover was about FFr4bn. In the corporate sector BNP lost FFr5.20 to FFr244.60 and said that it was to discuss today a plan to turn its remaining investment certificates - some 800,000 - into ordinary shares, of which there are about 185m. ZURICH's recovery from its intraday lows left the SMI index down 30.50, or 1.2 per cent at 2,494.7 after 2,472.7. The main loser in blue chips was SMH, down SFr30 to SFr667 as two banks reduced their earnings forecasts for the watch manufacturer. Generally, stocks looked more vulnerable in the second tier. Pharma Vision, the specialist investment fund, dropped SFr150 to SFr3,780 although Sandoz, in the sector covered by the fund, lost only SFr9 at SFr641 on a 3 per cent rise in nine-month sales. In floor and wall coverings, Forbo dropped SFr110 to SFr2,350 on a 10 per cent rise in nine-month profits, and in construction equipment, Hilti lost SFr40 at SFr980 after it said that it had no plans to place any of its registered share capital on the bourse. AMSTERDAM broke away from the session low although investor confidence remained nervous. The AEX index closed down 3.13 at 398.20, having fallen earlier to a low of 394.62. The market's dollar sensitive and heavily capitalised issues reacted negatively to the US currency's continued weakness, but a few bright spots were noted. Nedlloyd, for instance, which had been pressured at the end of last week on brokers' downgrades and a decision by a decision by the European Commission blocking pricing and capacity agreements between shipping lines on transatlantic container routes, added 70 cents to Fl 49.20. The group said that it did not expect the decision to have an adverse effect on profitability, and commented that Far East routes were holding up well. MILAN gave up the gains made at the start of the week in another session characterised by low volume. The Comit index finished down 8.01 or 1.3 per cent at 613.78 . Actinvest, the independent research group, commented that in the present climate with turnover remaining depressed - an average of L500bn, although yesterday that figure fell to L450bn - the market was likely to react with exaggerated volatility to any sort of bearish news. 'It is probable,' said Actinvest, 'that this stagnant period could last for at least one or two months, until the budget is finally approved and there is more confidence in the governing coalition's political capabilities.' RAS, the insurance company in which Allianz of Germany has a majority stake, shed 6 per cent to L17,790 after it said that it was to mount a L2,300bn funding operation to cover its purchase of Elvia from Swiss Reinsurance, announced earlier in the year. RAS said that it would raise L1,150bn through a rights issue with warrants attached and L1,150bn through a bond issue, also with warrants attached. The capital increase is expected to begin on November 15. Telecom Italia, which said on Monday that it planned to demerge its mobile telecommunications division next year, lost L80 to L3,990, in line with the market trend. MADRID had a mixed day for headlines. It ended a new low for the year in spite of an intraday recovery with other bourses, the general index closing 3.94, or 1.3 per cent lower at 289.30. But turnover recovered from Pta11.9bn to Pta32.2bn, partly reflecting a big block trade by Bolsa Andino in Acesa, the motorway operator, which fell Pta25 to Pta1,045. Falls of 2 per cent or more were commonplace in the construction sector, reasonably so in utilities where Telefonica dropped Pta35 at Pta1,650, but still unusual in banks, Monday's resilient sector, where Argentaria stood out with a fall of Pta100 to Pta4,780.

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Pretoria cuts oil stocks SOUTH Africa is to raise R2bn (Pounds 455.6m) by reducing strategic stockpiles of oil built up as a result of the international oil embargo, and will spend the money on development programmes including projects aimed at ending township violence, President F W de Klerk said yesterday. However, officials said some R1bn of the total did not represent new funding, as it had already been allocated in the 1991-92 budget announced last month. The balance of up to R1bn might not be available for some years. Mr de Klerk said the government must first finance energy projects to which it was already committed, apparently including the R8bn Mossgas oil-from-gas project, and noted that normalisation of relations with the international community was a prerequisite for the release of further funds. The R1bn available during the current budget year would be used to fund projects that would further social stability, he said, noting that township violence had hurt business confidence and put off investors.</p>

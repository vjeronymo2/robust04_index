			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Borough says staff taking pay cut SOUTHWARK Council in south London says more than 100 of its staff have accepted a 5 per cent pay cut as the local authority attempts to win contracts in competition with the private sector. The council also says that the white-collar workers affected will suffer the cut from the beginning of June - when 400 building workers will also have a two-year pay freeze imposed. Both groups will lose four days of holiday. The two unions involved believe the cuts will be restored in annual pay negotiating rounds. Those take place in July for white-collar staff and September for the blue-collar workers. The labour-controlled council disputes that that will happen. The deal, which was negotiated with Nupe, the public-service union, and Ucatt, the building workers' union, will save the council about Pounds 1.8m, according to Mr Keith Furnett, a management consultant who is advising the council. The council has put four contracts worth Pounds 20m out to tender for housing repair and maintenance. The contracts will be awarded in the next two weeks. Under compulsory competitive tendering arrangements, the council must compete with the private sector to provide services. In the past 14 months, 493 building staff have been made redundant. Up to 100 more jobs may go, depending on the results of the tender, due to be announced on February 18. The two unions say the agreements are subject to review and open to negotiation. The council says its building staff will not receive any pay under the national awards until other workers in the construction industry catch up with the Southwark rates, which it says are inflated by local enhancements. The 400 blue-collar staff have also agreed to move to performance-related pay. Staff will be paid per unit of work completed in addition to basic pay. Last year the council won two of the contracts. This year, contracts are likely to be awarded for between two and four years.</p>

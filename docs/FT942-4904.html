			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Spain backs military air project The Spanish government yesterday expressed its firm interest in participating in the development of a new generation European military transport aircraft, the so-called Future Large Aircraft. Mr Julian Garcia-Vargas, Spanish defence minister, told Mr Volker Ruhe, his German counterpart, that Europe should draw on the experience both of the Airbus consortium and the Eurofighter project in building the FLA. The Eurofighter project, he said, showed the disadvantage of increasing costs when the participating countries reduced their orders. The Spanish interest in the FLA project will raise the pressure on the British government to decide on its own participation. Hitherto, Britain has favoured buying Hercules aircraft from the US for its next phase of military transport needs but British Aerospace is anxious to be involved in the European project, to which both Germany and France have committed themselves.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / World Trade News: New African airline launched - Ventures and Contracts Africa's newest airline, Alliance, was launched yesterday in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, as a joint venture between the Tanzanian and Ugandan governments, their national carriers, and South African Airways. The initiative is one of the first concrete benefits to other African countries following South Africa's reintegration into the continent. Alliance was first mooted seven years ago as a joint venture between Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia but did not get off the ground until SAA was approached following Zambia's withdrawal. SAA will hold 40 per cent of the new company, with Air Tanzania and Uganda Airlines owning 10 per cent each and the two governments 5 per cent each. The remainder will be held by east African private investors. The South African carrier will be responsible for equipment and maintenance, and provide crew. Alliance plans to operate services to and from various east African destinations. Its first flight is scheduled for March 1995 and initial international routes will be to London, Bombay, Dubai and Johannesburg.</p>

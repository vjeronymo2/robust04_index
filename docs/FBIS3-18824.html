Ending up behind bars Monday were Armando Cono Lancuba, a  former public prosecutor in Naples who has since been moved to  Melfi, and Vito Masi, a Naples Appeals Court judge. Cono  Lancuba is charged with Camorra criminal association, while Masi  is charged with corruption.    Naples judges also issued warrants informing 10 people that  they are under investigation, and sought permission from the  Lower House to arrest Giuseppe Demitry, a Socialist deputy, and  Alfonso Martucci of the Liberal Party.    Arrested in this morning's swoop was Alfredo Bargi, a  well-known Naples lawyer and candidate with the Pact for Italy  party in the March 27-28 general elections.    Receiving advisory warrants were Assistant Public Prosecutor  Arcibaldo Miller, who heads an investigation into health service  kickbacks, and Raffaele Sapienza, a judge in Santa Maria Capua  Vetere near Naples and a candidate with the Forza Italia party.    All the legal figures involved are suspected of rigging  Camorra trials to ensure light sentences or acquittals for  mobsters in the dock.    Investigators have been at work on the case for a year,  helped along by Camorra boss-turned-state's evidence Pasquale  Galasso, and some twenty lesser grasses. The recent decision by  key boss Carmine Alfieri, believed to head one of southern  Italy's biggest crime empires, to collaborate with justice,  allowed investigators to corroborate some of Galasso's stories.    Galasso, well-informed sources recalled today, has told  judges of "a solid link between politicians wielding great  power, influential magistrates such as Lancuba, known Camorra  bosses such as Alfieri and Galasso himself, sectors of the  Naples journalistic world, and wheeler-dealers and entrepreneurs  of all types."    Of the 17 arrest warrants issued today nine have been  served.    Today's arrest of two judges brings to four the number of  Italian magistrates behind bars charged with rigging organised  crime trials, with some 30 more around the country under  investigation for suspected complicity with Mafia-style groups.    These include Corrado Carnevale, the former president of the  first section of the supreme Cassation court who earned himself  the nickname of "sentence-killer" for overturning Mafia  sentences on formal quibbles.    In a statement issued later Monday evening, Naples' Chief  Prosecutor Antonio Cordova deplored information leaks which  could jeopardise "extremely delicate investigations." Cordova  was particularly irked by disclosures that his assistant  Arcibaldo Miller, who heads key investigations into Naples'  kickback scandals, had received an advisory warrant. This  warrant is sent to inform people that they are being  investigated in connection with a crime. It does not imply that  an arrest warrant is on the way.    "This office," said Cordova in his statement, "can only  imagine that the spread of this news is likely to cast serious  shadows over the enquiry into the Naples `tangentopoli' [bribe  city] just at a point in time when it has entered its most  important point, allowing the system of political-institutional  corruption to be rooted out and overturned thanks to the  extraordinary commitment of that group of colleagues which  Miller coordinates and will continue to coordinate."</p>

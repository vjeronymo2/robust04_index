			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Foreign Hand in NE"] </F>   [Text] Army spokesmen have painted a very disturbing  picture of the state of insurgency in the North-East. According  to Lt. Gen Niranjan S. Malik who has been briefing the press,  insurgent groups particularly in trouble-torn Nagaland and  Manipur, are better armed and more militant than ever before.  Bomb blasts, assassination attempts and `genocide', he  reportedly said, have become the order of the day. The  escalation in insurgent activity is ascribed to various factors.  The most serious of them is the patronage of foreign agencies.  Although it has long been suspected that some rebel groups have  been assisted by Bangladesh and Pakistan's Inter-Services  Intelligence [ISI] agency, this is probably the first time that  the seniormost army officer in the region has said as much. He  claimed to have definite knowledge of other sources of foreign  aid to the rebels as well.    Malik specifically named the Muivah-Swu faction of the  National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-M) as a beneficiary  in this context. The ISI is said to have launched a new  organisation called the United Liberation Front of Seven Sisters  in which the NSCN(M), the United Liberation Front of Assam  (ULFA), the Bodo Security Force and other tribal groups are key  participants. Just as disquieting was the revelation that the  banned NSCN(M) which has emerged as one of the most formidable  outfits in the North-East was recruiting immigrant Muslims. In  the army's perception, the NSCN(M) has received a major  psychological boost by being admitted as a member of the  Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation based at the  Hague and apparently gets financial assistance from it as well  as from the American Baptist Church. All this has encouraged  insurgent leaders on the one hand to believe that their cause  has received international recognition and on the other to  acquire arms and ammunition more easily. Last but not least,  army officers say that the Nagaland police force has been  grossly negligent in allowing its weapons to fall into the hands  of underground groups.    In this grim backdrop some comfort may be drawn from the  fact  of the doubling of security forces and army units deployed in  the North-East since October 1. However, the army briefing  raises crucial questions about the overall strategy being  pursued by the Central Government in dealing with what appears  to be a heightened level of insurgency. Clearly, if the army  assessment of the situation is accepted, anti-insurgency  operations will have to be stepped up especially in border  areas. But this should not preclude political measures among  which should be steps to stabilise and improve the functioning  of the governments of Nagaland and Manipur. They will have to  become both more responsive to popular aspirations and firm in  dealing with troublemakers than they have proved so far to be.</p>

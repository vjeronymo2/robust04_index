			<p>BFN     [Text] Xie Fei, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau  member and Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee secretary,  recently inspected eastern Guangdong, where he carried out  investigations and study and called for energetically developing  an open and export-oriented agriculture and bringing prosperity  to the peasants as soon as possible.    On 14-24 March, Secretary Xie Fei inspected six cities in  eastern Guangdong, Huizhou, Shanwei, Jieyang, Shantou, Meizhou,  and Heyuan, where he traveled for nearly 2,000 kilometers and  visited dozens of units. Despite the fatigue caused by long  journeys and bad weather situations like strong storms and heavy  rains, Secretary Xie Fei went from one city to another in hopes  of seeing more of the local situation and exchanging views with  more local cadres and masses.    Throughout his inspection, Secretary Xie Fei was primarily  concerned with the issue of maintaining stable grain output. He  pointed out: In order to stabilize agricultural production, we  should first and foremost try to stabilize grain production.  Grain is the ultimate concern of the people. Guangdong should  make every possible effort to stabilize grain production and put  an end to reliance on grain imports from other regions. As long  as we follow this correct guiding ideology, implement correct  grain production policies, grow good varieties of grain, employ  scientific farming methods, and embark on operations of scale,  we will be able to raise grain production efficiency and  stabilize and increase grain output.    When discussing the stabilization of the grain growing area,  Secretary Xie Fei urged cadres at all levels in the province to  protect arable land, stabilize grain output, and energetically  develop a diversified economy. He said: We should strive to  build an open and export-oriented agriculture. To this end, on  the one hand, we should strive to produce more quality farm  products and open up and enter more new markets; on the other  hand, we should strive to expand opening up to the outside world  and import good varieties of crops, advanced technology, and  funds in order to push the province's agricultural production  onto a new stage and build genuine high-yield, high-efficiency,  and high-quality agriculture across the province. All areas  should conscientiously make efforts to identify competitive  local products, build competitive local products production  bases, conduct operations of scale, and make a success of both  post-production processing and intensive processing, thus  raising the added value of products as well as agricultural  efficiency. As long as we follow this road, the province's  agriculture will definitely be able to keep up with the  province's rapidly growing secondary and tertiary industries in  the years to come. We should see to it that the province's  primary, secondary, and tertiary industries develop in a  coordinated manner. In developing the rural economy, we should  develop not only agriculture and a diversified economy but also  township and town enterprises.    Wherever he went, Secretary Xie Fei went into the local  township and town enterprises. He said: Developing township  and town enterprises is an important way of realizing  modernization in rural areas, transferring surplus rural labor  into secondary and tertiary industries, and bringing prosperity  to the peasants. We should attach great importance to the  development of township and town enterprises.    Secretary Xie Fei asserted: The implementation of a  joint-stock cooperative system is a major step forward in the  deep-going rural reform and is bound to mobilize the enthusiasm  of the various quarters concerned and speed up the development  of township and town enterprises.</p>

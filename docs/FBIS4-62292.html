			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report in the "Concept" column: "Sergey </F> Glazyev Is Making Preparations for the Second Budget Reading.  The People's Alliance Designs an Institution of Direct  Democracy"]    [Text] Leaders of the People's Alliance held a press  conference in the State Duma yesterday on budget and economic  policy matters. Journalists were also presented with a draft  federal law, On People's Legislative Initiative. This draft  should "for the first time give Russia's citizens the right to  submit a particular law to parliament by raising signatures."  This draft federal law has been moved in the State Duma by  People's Alliance member Muravyev, who in a note of explanation  cites the experience of such an institution of "direct  democracy" in many countries, for instance, Switzerland, Italy,  and Brazil. Characteristically, the proposed draft grants the  right of legislative initiative to groups of no less than 1  million citizens. This deprives the draft of much of its  relevance but shows an evolution in public relations methods  characteristic of a competitive political environment where  there is not always room for formations like the People's  Alliance.    Perhaps the most substantive part of the press conference  was  a statement by Sergey Glazyev, State Duma Economic Policy  Committee chairman, who expressed his attitude to the budget  approved on the first reading and the results of the vote.    In Sergey Glazyev's opinion the government did not introduce  any significant changes into the budget, limiting itself to  local adjustments, such as: increasing the budget deficit,  raising privatization revenues by a trillion, and so forth.    Glazyev sees the budget policy underlying the approved draft  as consisting in the distribution of resources between the fuel  and energy and the agro-industrial complexes. At the same time  it fails to take into account the priorities of supporting  science-intensive industry and promoting conversion which were  set forth in the presidential message.    There is still a glaring contradiction between the  government  forecast which was used as a basis for the estimate and the  actual decline in industry, which twice exceeds the estimates  made at the budget formulation stage. The Economic Policy  Committee chairman describes the volumes of recession themselves  as an all-time record for Russia (25 percent in the first half)  since the Civil War.    Glazyev believes that as a result of the current policy a  real threat is emerging to Russia's economic sovereignty.    "Even if we decided that we do not need a science-intensive  industry, the budget does not provide for any production  mothballing funds anyway," Sergey Glazyev stated. This  "oversight" in its turn leads to unprepared stoppages of  enterprises, which increases the number of industrial accidents.  There are still no changes in the investment sphere: equipment  obsolescence is on average approximately 60 percent.    Sergey Glazyev supposes that "it is time to start closing  the  gaps." He drew the audience's attention to those expenditures  on which he thinks financing should be increased (defense  orders, communications, investment projects, education and  culture) and also revenues raising, which could lead to  problems. In particular this refers to revenues from the state  property in state ownership, the abolition of concessions in  foreign economic activity, and improving import control (Sergey  Glazyev estimates the volume of smuggling, on which tariffs  could be charged, at $5 billion). Also, taking a short-term  view, the Duma economist proposed suspending the privatization  of the Russian joint stock company Gazprom, whose annual  revenues come to $7 billion.    Assessing the results of the voting on the draft budget in  the first reading, Sergey Glazyev justly pointed to a lack of  constructive opposition in parliament ("some pretend that they  pursue liberalization, and others that they do not approve of  this line"), which results in the invariability of the existing  policy.    Glazyev's statement at the press conference was followed by  a  presentation from Veniamin Sokolov, author of an alternative  draft budget. Mr. Sokolov expressed his extreme dissatisfaction  with the fall in the rate of inflation because each percentage  point is paid for with 5 percent of production. Having made  some reasonable propositions about the problems of monetary  circulation in Russia, Veniamin Sokolov stated that he could  ensure a doubling of budget revenues as early as the end of this  year if a tax reform and a corresponding credit and money policy  were conducted.</p>

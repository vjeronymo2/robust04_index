			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases on arbitrage-related selling ARBITRAGE-related selling left the Nikkei average marginally lower, after a brief rise above 17,000 for the first time since mid-June, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei closed 64.94 lower at 16,783.72, 0.4 per cent up on the week. It rose sharply in the morning in trading related to the July options expiry, reaching a day's high of 17,023.89, but profit taking and arbitrage-related selling brought it back to a low of 16,715.58 in the afternoon. Volume rose to 310m shares from 258m. Some 150m shares changed hands in the first hour of trading on option related activity. Declines led advances by 499 to 401 with 188 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 1.35 to 1,283.58 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.96 to 1,009.46. Dealers took profits on theme stocks. Institutional investors were absent, citing the lack of commitment from authorities to support the stock market as well as the slumping economy. Traders said that investors wanted to wait until Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, came back from his European trip next week. Fuji Heavy Industries, the most active stock of the day, rose Y9 to Y395 as dealers tried to promote the 'mergers and acquisitions' theme; small car companies, active this week on speculation that they may become takeover targets as they face a profits squeeze due to the slump in the auto market, saw Suzuki Motor fall Y4 to Y805 on profit taking. Raito Kogyo, a civil engineering company, fell by its daily limit of Y400 to Y2,130. Reports that the company was involved in substandard construction in a domestic dam project triggered heavy selling. The company later said that while a reconstruction would cost Y100m, forecast earnings figures would be met. High-technology blue chips were mixed. NEC advanced Y14 to Y854, but Matsushita Electric Industrial lost Y10 to Y1,300. Traders said despite the declines of some issues, pension funds buying orders at cheaper levels indicated underlying support. Isetan, the department store fell Y80 to Y1,500. The Tokyo Stock Exchange announced that the stock would be placed under daily surveillance due to its volatile price movements. Isetan's price has been unstable due to rumours of financial troubles at Shuwa, the land and stock speculator and Isetan's leading shareholder. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 82.04 to 19,370.02 in volume of 9.9m shares. Roundup WALL STREET gave most of the region a boost. HONG KONG saw bargain hunting as the Hang Seng index jumped 55.84 to 5,981.36, still 1.3 per cent lower on the week. Turnover stayed comparatively low at HKDollars 3.34bn, up from HKDollars 2.46bn. Brokers said that many retail investors switched to second and third liners. MANILA recovered, the composite index ending 40.76 higher at 1,476.28, almost unchanged on the week, although the rally was described as technical. Turnover climbed from 243.3m to 305.5m pesos. KUALA LUMPUR extended Thursday's surge on strong index-linked and speculative buying, volume rising from 69.4m to 95m shares as the KLSE composite index rose 7.85 to 611.57, 2.6 per cent higher on the week. SINGAPORE was dominated by trading in Malaysian stocks, and the Straits Times Industrial index, 6.03 higher on the day at 1,487.05, ended a mere fraction up on the week. NEW ZEALAND ignored Wall Street as selling in Fletcher Challenge dragged the NZSE-40 index down by 10.87 to 1,566.92, 1.0 per cent higher on the week. Fletcher, New Zealand's biggest company, ended 9 cents lower at NZDollars 3.48 in light volume, much of the pressure coming late in the day.</p>

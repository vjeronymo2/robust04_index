			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Amstrad moves to bypass high street retailers in sale of PCs Amstrad, the consumer electronics group run by Mr Alan Sugar, is to sell Amstrad-branded personal computers and facsimile machines at cut-down prices direct to customers - bypassing high street retailers. The group, which pioneered PC sales in the UK high street in the mid-1980s, has been forced to withdraw from the retail store market because of fierce competition and tumbling margins. Mr Sugar acknowledged yesterday that Amstrad had faced a stark choice. 'It was either throw away all we have created or launch this direct sales programme,' he said. Direct PC sales have grown rapidly in recent years and now account for about 500,000 units a year, or about 36 per cent of the UK market, according to Romtec, the market research organisation. Although there are signs that direct market sales growth may now be slowing, Mr Sugar expressed confidence yesterday that Amstrad's strong brand name would help it gain a significant share of the market. Direct PC sales in the UK are currently dominated by Dell, Elonex and Viglen, the direct PC manufacturer which Amstrad acquired in July. Viglen will continue to sell its own branded PCs, but will concentrate mainly on large corporate and institutional buyers. Amstrad's direct PC and fax sales will be handled by a new unit, Amstrad Business Direct, which plans to sell the machines mainly to first-time buyers using magazine advertisements and telephone sales. Amstrad is relying on a Pounds 1m pre-Christmas advertising campaign to boost sales. The move, which had been widely foreshadowed, is part of a reorganisation being undertaken by Mr David Rogers, the new chief executive. The shares rose 1/2 p to 29p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff and Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Excerpts] The Prime Minister wants immediate, effective  and "more muscular" action to halt the bombardment of civilians  in Sarajevo, Downing Street said today.    Britain will call for political backing for a new approach  at  the European Union's Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels this  afternoon.    And Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind will discuss the Prime  Minister's plans with the United Nations military chief  Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose in Bosnia today. He will  report back to the Prime Minister tonight.    John Major believes that action in the wake of the atrocity  in Sarajevo market place on Saturday [5 February] which killed  68 people cannot wait for an overall settlement of the civil war  in the former Yugoslavia.    He has accused all three parties, the Serbs, the Croats and  the Muslims, of "dragging their feet" in negotiations.    The Prime Minister's call for a new, tougher approach comes  after UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali asked NATO to  prepare for possible air strikes against artillery positions in  and around Sarajevo.    Representatives of NATO's 16 members are set to meet in  Brussels on Wednesday to discuss the request.    Downing Street officials said Mr Major thinks it is now  essential for the UN and NATO to take "immediate and effective  action."    He believes the UN should draw up a plan to halt attacks on  Sarajevo and to deploy UN forces so they cannot resume.    "This is likely to require more muscular action than  hitherto  by the United Nations. Its purpose must be not merely to punish  or retaliate but to improve the situation in Sarajevo," said one  official.    Both Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Mr Rifkind today  warned that an air strikes policy carried risks. [passage  omitted]    Mr Major will hold urgent talks on the Bosnian crisis with  Mr  Hurd, Mr Rifkind and other key Ministers at Downing Street  tomorrow.    It was being stressed today that the Prime Minister realises  that it would be "folly" to ignore the advice of the military on  the ground before launching any reprisals.    But it has been noted that General Rose has already adopted  a  far tougher line than his predecessors in Bosnia.    Downing Street kept in touch with the White House over the  weekend and Mr Hurd spoke three times to Warren Christopher, the  U.S. Secretary of State.    The Prime Minister was also in regular contact with Mr Hurd  and Mr Rifkind.</p>

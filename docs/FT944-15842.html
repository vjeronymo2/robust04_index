			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Asia: Chinese officials lose a touch of luxury Chinese Communist party cadres learned at the weekend that life in the fast lane would lose some of its allure as new regulations outlawed official use of imported luxury cars such as Mercedes and Cadillacs. According to a directive from the party's central committee, high-ranking officials, including ministers and provincial governors, must ride in cars made in China. The regulations stipulate that imported vehicles be replaced by locally made models. If the regulations are enforced, Chinese officials will be deprived of one of their more cherished privileges. Like gold wrist-watches and expensive fountain pens, an imported luxury limousine had become a coveted symbol of advancement for status-conscious representatives of the proletariat. No mention was made of any effect on top leadership figures, such as politburo members, who travel in fleets of black Mercedes. Apart from Mercedes, Cadillacs, and Lincoln Continentals, other favoured foreign brands include BMW and Lexus. None of these marques is assembled in China. The central committee directive seems certain to hasten the scramble among foreign automotive companies for the right to manufacture a luxury car in China. Frontrunners in negotiations now under way are thought to include General Motors, which is offering a version of the Buick, Ford with its Lincoln, and Toyota. In the short-term, the new rules will benefit Volkswagen's Audi and Santana models under manufacture in China. The Audi is widely used by middle-ranking officials, but has not been regarded as entirely suitable for minister and above. China has been without a locally made luxury car since production stopped in the 1980s of the Red Flag limousine, whose generous dimensions were such that a meeting of the Politburo could be conducted in its capacious rear compartment. Chinese officials these days would not be seen dead in a Red Flag, which they regard as a bad advertisement for the modernising state. Among those who might welcome the weekend edict are owners of luxury cars in Hong Kong. In the past few years there has been a lively trade in stolen vehicles across the border into Guangdong province, where many have ended up in official hands, including those of the security apparatus. The security organs throughout China appear to be particularly well equipped with luxury vehicles. In Beijing, black Mercedes with dark-tinted windows are a favourite conveyance of high-ranking officials of the public security bureau. The new regulations follow last month's meeting of the central committee which resolved to clean up the Communist party's image.</p>

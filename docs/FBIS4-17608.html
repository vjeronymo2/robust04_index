			<p>BFN     [Text] At their meeting in the Russian State Duma Monday,  Russian Parliamentary Speaker Ivan Rybkin and Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin discussed the peace process in the Middle  East.    The State Duma press office said Rybkin had informed the  Israeli prime minister of Russia's sincere intention to achieve  a political settlement in the Middle East. "Our country was  among those who backed the creation of the independent Israeli  state, and today we will be consistent in the development of  cooperation," he was quoted as saying.    Rabin pointed out Russia's interest in and responsibility  for  the settlement as a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process.  He hoped that the first part of P.L.O.-Israeli agreements  concerning Palestinian self-rule would be accomplished within  two or three weeks. "We want peace in the Middle East, and I  think Russia's interests correspond to ours," Rabin pointed out.    The Israeli prime minister said he highly praised Russia's  efforts intended for the settlement of the Middle East conflict.    The chairman of the State Duma committee for international  affairs, Vladimir Lukin, said Rabin informed Rybkin of the  creation of a Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho  pointing out possible economic and financial difficulties.  Rabin said he was concerned over the future of Israeli  nationals staying within the autonomy. He added that the  Israeli leadership would ensure the region's external defense,  while its internal autonomy would be quite sufficient.    In the course of the meeting, the two sides expressed their  dissatisfaction with the volume of Russian-Israeli trade,  amounting to as little as $170 Mn at the moment, Lukin said.    The meeting also touched on expansion of bilateral ties in  various fields taking into account that about 800,000 former  Soviet and Russian citizens are residing in Israel.    During the meeting, Rybkin said he feared increasing  nationalist and pro-Fascist tendencies in Russian society. In  an answer to Rabin's questions, Rybkin referred to the fact that  "such tendencies have always been in Russia" and that "one  twentieth of society in any village or city preached exotic  views of similar kind." At the same time, Rybkin said the State  Duma was preparing hearings of the issue.    After the meeting, the Israeli prime minister told  journalists that he had invited Rybkin to visit Jerusalem on  behalf of the chairman of the Israeli parliament. For his part,  Rybkin invited a delegation from the Israeli parliament to  Moscow, Rabin said.</p>

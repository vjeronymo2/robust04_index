			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Action in drugs sector as Bombay waits for a wind - A market currently in the doldrums When world markets dropped early last year, the Bombay Stock Exchange was at the crest of a wave. But now, with global markets in buoyant form, and feverish excitement in the Pacific Basin further east, India is in the dumps. The process of integrating India with the world economy has begun in earnest, but the local stock market still moves in its own orbit, unconcerned with world developments. Bombay's bourse, India's largest, has been haunted for some time by the controversy surrounding Mr Harshad Mehta, the key broker in India's Rs40bn securities market scandal; it has current political fears, with Kashmiri terrorists holed up in a Srinagar mosque under siege by the army. It is two weeks since brokers concluded a four-day trading strike which shut down the bourse after a judge delayed settlement of a dispute over shares seized by tax authorities investigating the securities scandal. Since that time, the market has looked unhappy. Traders fear further interruptions in trading. The income tax department has vowed to track down Mehta-owned shares sold on the market with the connivance of some fellow brokers. Meanwhile, the BSE index, which closed at 2,720.29 in a special trading session on October 19 following the resolution of the brokers' strike, dropped a further 52.46, or 2 per cent, to 2,621.28 on Monday, and stayed flat yesterday amid a general lack of interest. There have been bright spots. Pharmaceutical companies, especially transnationals, have stood their ground after impressive gains over the past three months: Abbott Laboratories jumped by two-thirds to Rs200 between August and October, Boehringer Mannheim by nearly one half to Rs130 and E Merck by a third to Rs115. Glaxo India was up to Rs293.50, from Rs230 at the end of July. According to James Capel, investors have taken a fancy to foreign company shares. The market perceives that foreign companies have access to high technology, resources and efficient management. There are more specific reasons for the drug industry enthusiasm. Traders have driven up share prices, expecting major changes in the draconian drug price policy that stifled profitability and growth of foreign companies over the past two decades; in addition, says Capel, there is a feeling that India will join the Paris convention on patents. That would eliminate competition from cheap imitations. However, there are warning signals, of which Roche India is an example. This year it peaked at Rs170, with a p/e of more than 40, and brokers said this was a high price for a company which returned to black only last year, and paid its first dividend in five years. The bubble burst at the weekend when news leaked to the press that the company's Swiss parent was less optimistic than Indian share traders on Indian government drug policies - and sold its subsidiary to a local businessman. Carmakers have also attracted the traders' attention. Favourable comments by General Motors on the Indian car industry boosted the Calcutta-based Hindustan Motors, although it passed the dividend last year; and the recession-hit Tata Engineering, the largest truck producing company, jumped to Rs270 from Rs240 after Mercedes Benz hinted at a joint venture with Tata. The broad market will have to reckon with the fallout from a special parliamentary committee report on the securities scandal, due next month. This could make it difficult to mount a major rally in the immediate future. The fundamentals are more encouraging for the medium term. They include a good monsoon, strong foreign exchange reserves (Dollars 8bn), good half-yearly corporate results and the prospect of an IMF agreement to a medium-term financing programme. Lehman Brothers, in London, notes that the market has declined by some 40 per cent in local currency terms from its April 1992 'scam-induced' peak of 4,547. However, it likes India's sheer size, its growing middle class population, its well developed local equity culture, its huge pool of cheap skilled labour and the significant pool of non-resident Indian money. Lehman, too, thinks that it is too early for a rally; but it says that this is a good time to start building up Indian exposure to at least a neutral weight position, to benefit from a possible pre-budget bull run towards the end of 1993.</p>

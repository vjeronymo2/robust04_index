			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / International Company News: France appoints Alain Prestat as TCE chairman THE French government yesterday increased its influence at Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE), the state-owned maker of audio and video products, by sending in a senior adviser of the prime minister as its chairman, writes William Dawkins. He is Mr Alain Prestat, 40, deputy chief of staff for Mrs Edith Cresson, who was nominated as TCE's chairman after Mr Bernard Isautier resigned. The change was expected, following the plans to merge the loss-making TCE with CEA Industry, a profitable state-owned nuclear fuel group.</p>

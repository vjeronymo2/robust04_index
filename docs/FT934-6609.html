			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Business and the Environment: Hook, line and sinker - As Brussels prepares to fix European fish quotas / A look at how long North Sea stocks will last Safely home in the port of Lowestoft, on the east coast of England, the crew of the UK fisheries research vessel Cirolana is recovering from a month-long mission to investigate the state of fish stocks in the treacherous North Sea. 'We were out in all that wind and rain and there were all sorts of ships going down around us,' says Barry Chapman, Cirolana's bearded captain, with just a hint of seadog swagger. 'We stayed till the last bitter minute.' The 10 scientists on board have been tracking the serious depletion in many species of fish, notably cod. Their findings, together with those from scientists of other European countries, will feed into data to be used by fisheries ministers in Brussels next month to set next year's quotas for the whole of the European Union. The changeable climate that forced Cirolana into port a day ahead of schedule is also thought to be responsible for the enormous fluctuations in fish numbers from one year to the next, which scientists find particularly difficult to explain. 'Predicting fish stocks is like predicting the weather, only worse,' says John Shepherd, deputy director of the government's fisheries research directorate at Lowestoft. The inexact nature of the science irritates those on the receiving end - the fishermen - who see their livelihoods being squeezed by quotas and other limits on how often and how much they can fish. British fishermen are currently locked in a bitter dispute with the government over its plans to restrict the number of days they can spend at sea. A High Court ruling is awaited on an application by the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations to have the restrictions quashed. The policy is part of the government's drive to cut UK fleet capacity by 19 per cent by the end of 1996 in a European-wide attempt to curb over-fishing. The situation for cod is so serious that the European Commission has just set up a task force to examine how to protect the dwindling North Sea stock. Nobody wants to see cod disappear, as it almost has off Newfoundland. A moratorium on fishing there has led to 20,000 fishermen and processors being laid off. 'Everybody agrees that we ought to be very worried about the state of the cod stock,' says Shepherd. 'It may be in terminal decline.' The spawning stock of cod - fish that are mature enough to breed - has fallen to about 50,000 tonnes, the lowest level on record, through a combination of over-fishing and natural causes. Most cod do not mature until they are about four years old. But in the North Sea only a very small percentage survives to spawn and landings are dominated by two-year-old immature fish. The North Sea fishing surveys carried out by Lowestoft scientists are complemented by researchers from Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Norway, who work together in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. They determine the age of the fish they catch by their length or by examining their scales or the tiny stones in their ears, which carry growth rings similar to trees. Cod is only the most striking example of over-exploitation. All but two species of fish - the low-value blue whiting and horse mackerel - are either fully exploited or over-exploited in the waters around Britain. That means the same number or fewer fish would be caught even if fishing increased. Cod levels are also very low in the Irish Sea and in Icelandic waters. But stocks of north-east Arctic cod in the Barents sea have returned to much healthier levels thanks to drastic cuts a couple of years ago in the quotas shared by Russian and Norwegian fishermen. These accelerated a cyclical recovery in the stocks. 'It's a nice example of how well-timed management action can help,' says Shepherd. Some stocks, such as western mackerel in the North Sea, never recover from over-fishing. Others make sudden comebacks, such as North Sea haddock, catching even the scientists by surprise. After three very poor breeding years, which took quotas to an all-time low, the haddock has unexpectedly enjoyed three consecutive good years. The scientist acts in loco parentis for the fish and always has to be cautious, says Shepherd. 'When you're seeing the lowest stock size on record and it's been there for three years, no responsible person could do other than warn that the stock was in a critical state and likely to get worse.' The best way of conserving fish is the subject of fierce debate. Fishermen argue that 'technical' conservation measures, such as increasing minimum mesh sizes to allow smaller fish to escape, would offer an alternative to direct restrictions on their activities. The problem with larger mesh sizes is that they would not help the cod, the biggest of the main commercially exploited species in the North Sea, says Shepherd. 'For North Sea cod, the increases in mesh size required to enable restrictions on catch and effort to be lifted are such that this is hardly a practical proposition.' Ten years of quotas under the Common Fisheries Policy have failed to solve the problem of overfishing, partly because of evasion. That is where enforceable measures such as decommissioning of vessels and restrictions on fishing times come in. 'Searching for a conservation measure which is painless (for fishermen) is a waste of time,' says Shepherd. 'There is none.' The problem would be eased by a shift in consumer preference away from white fish. Cultivation of fish and shellfish may also emerge as a partial solution in the long term. The UK has been cultivating lobsters and Norway is experimenting with the farming of halibut, turbot and even cod.</p>

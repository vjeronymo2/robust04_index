			<p>BFN     [Text] Ternopol [no dateline as received] -- Meeting the  local electorate on 7 June, Leonid Kuchma, presidential  candidate and leader of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists  and Entrepreneurs, was accused of looking to "the Northern  neighbor" and trying to "pull Ukraine back into Moscow's  bondage." The candidate replied: "I have never, not even in my  sleep, ever said anywhere to anyone anything about a political  union with Russia. As for economic ties, ask people on the shop  floor, would they reject that?"    Meanwhile, Kuchma said he opposed Ukraine's accession to the  ruble zone: "This would lead to loss of sovereignty." He spoke  in favor of strong authority which world practice had proven to  be the only force capable of implementing economic reforms.  "Only one person should take the responsibility," he added.  "That's why if I win I will initially act as prime minister as  well as perform full presidential duties."</p>

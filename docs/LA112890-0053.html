			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 43 FLORIDA DEER KILLED TO KEEP RUNWAYS CLEAR  </P> <P> Forty-three deer have been shot and killed in the past two months in an effort  to keep the animals off the runways at Orlando International Airport,  authorities say.  </P> <P> Three commercial airliners have hit free roaming deer this fall, but there have  been no injuries to people or damage to the planes.  </P> <P> The airport hired a consultant in early October to trap and move deer because  the animals were a hazard when they wandered onto runways from nearby woods.  But after a Delta jet struck a deer on takeoff Oct. 7, the consultant was paid  $100 a deer to kill the animals.  </P></p>

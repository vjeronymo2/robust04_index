			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Tobishima president replaced by father THERE was a change of generations yesterday at Tobishima Corporation, a century-old Japanese construction company with a recent history of aggressive and unsuccessful property dealings. Mr Akira Tobishima was replaced as president by his 78-year-old father, Mr Hitoshi Tobishima. Mr Akira Tobishima was forced yesterday to take the blame for leading the company into debt and for making it a symbol of the many conservative Japanese firms led astray by speculative temptation. Tobishima, one of the country's leading contractors, is entangled in the financial mess left by Nanatomi, a stock speculator and land developer which collapsed earlier this year with debts of about Y300bn (Dollars 2.2bn), the third largest Japanese bankruptcy on record. Nanatomi was formed by seven ex-Tobishima officials, known as the 'seven samurai', and, when the company collapsed in January, Tobishima had outstanding loans and guarantees totalling Y123.4bn. Tobishima had become a keen property developer, and Mr Akira Tobishima, who authorised a spate of US purchases, wanted to run a international chain of five-star hotels. Mr Tobishima, whose resignation will be formally put to a shareholders' meeting in June, yesterday confessed that he had relied too little on construction and too much on real estate development 'in attempting to increase profits rapidly'. The company is now being restructured by Fuji Bank, which wants properties sold quickly to reduce the present debt of Y370bn by Y150bn. Mr Hitoshi Tobishima had left the presidency to take the largely ceremonial post of chairman six years ago, and it is expected that a new chairman will be appointed by Fuji Bank, which has a 4.8 per cent stake in the contractor. As is expected of Japanese banks in such situations, Fuji has indicated to creditors that it is handling Tobishima's financial affairs and assured them that there is no danger of the company defaulting. It is known that Fuji Bank, Japan's fifth largest, is embarrassed by the close links between Tobishima and Nanatomi, which had bought shares in tandem with the Koshin speculator group. Koshin's leader, Mr Mitsuhiro Kotani, has admitted to charges of stock price manipulation. Tobishima is hoping that some of the Nanatomi losses will be recouped through the completion this year of a Y100bn businessman's resort, the Nanatomi Club, which the failed company had boasted would offer next-century facilities at this-century prices.</p>

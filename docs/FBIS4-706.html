			<p>BFN     [Text] Jean-Bedel Bokassa this morning appeared before the  Bangui district court, which recently authorized the Central  African Republic [CAR] state to file a civil and commercial suit  against him. Hearing was adjourned to a later date. In fact,  this case is a continuation of the lawsuit brought against him  in 1987 for money owed to the state and another by parties  claiming damages.    In an interview with CAR radio today, the former CAR emperor  said the money for which he is being prosecuted was used in  building the 500-room Hotel Intercontinental, a white elephant  situated right in the middle of Bangui's residential district.  According to CAR State Attorney Jean Ngandou, following his  death sentence in 1987, Bokassa was asked to pay a fine of 6  million CFA francs to the parties claiming damages while the CAR  state was authorized to confiscate his property to the tune of  3,143,473,300 CFA francs.    During the same interview, the former CAR emperor talked  about the running of the country, which he said has been  destroyed. He said it was ruined by President David Dacko, whom  he held responsible for Barthelemy Boganda's death. He also  accused former President Kolingba and French Colonel Jean-Claude  Masson of assassinating Boganda's son, Bertrand Salate. Bokassa  thereby confirms these allegations.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Venezuela lenders look for action not words: The government's reluctance to administer a dose of economic medicine Venezuela's economic policymakers see themselves as a badly misunderstood group. They believe their country's deep social tensions mean they must avoid the abrupt imposition of market medicine on their ailing economy lest it spills over into popular unrest. This justifies, they say, the return towards state control of the economy engineered by the administration of President Rafael Caldera in the face of a banking crisis and a subsequent run on the currency this year. 'None of us likes the controls. But there was a need for them at one moment,' says Mr Carlos Bernardez, who is in charge of the government's privatisation efforts. The controls on prices and foreign exchange transactions have been necessary in part, the government says, to retain popular support for the government as it tackles the economic crisis. 'We have learned that we have to have an equilibrium between the economic and political aspects of our programme, to preserve a climate of social peace,' argues Mr Luis Raul Matos Azocar an adviser to Mr Caldera and head of the new foreign exchange control board. Even though the government has repeatedly said the controls will be phased out over the next year or so, it continues to be criticised. On the day members of the economic team appeared in London to talk about their economic strategy, the New York brokerage house Bear Stearns sent out to clients a critical research note arguing that foreign investors could no longer use the Venezuelan stock exchange because of the practical problems they faced in getting foreign exchange out of the country. While now theoretically possible after a three-month delay, it remained practically impossible to repatriate currency. 'The procedural blockade posed by the repatriation requirement is a disaster,' says analyst Ms Julie Dykstra. She is also critical of a package of measures recently put before Congress that included 'the normalisation of intrusive executive powers.' The government argues that foreign exchange shortages are slowly being covered, and that the delays in obtaining foreign exchange are 'administrative problems' which are being sorted out. Nonetheless, the senior officials in London have admitted that some of their economic measures have put obstacles in the way of other objectives. Privatisation is an example. The government hopes to raise as much as Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.8bn) by the end of next year in privatisations, starting with the 2,000MW Planto Centro electricity generating plant this year. The biggest element in this is the flotation of the government's 49 per cent stake in CANTV, the telephone company. Forty per cent of this was auctioned off in 1991 for Dollars 1.88bn to an operating group led by GTE of the US. Yet now CANTV faces a host of problems - most caused by the government - which will tend to make it less attractive to investors. Like other Venezuelan companies, it has been forced to seek a rescheduling of its foreign debts, because of the lack of availability of foreign exchange. (The government eased this last Monday by granting CANTV Dollars 19m for interest payments.) There have also been delays in government approval of tariff increases and a tariff structure now in place is regarded as unattractive for investors. The officials say that when it becomes clear the controls are only temporary, the state companies will become a more attractive proposition to investors. One other issue is the persistence of negative interest rates in the economy at a time when the government is anxious to build up foreign exchange reserves. Mr Ramon Espinasa, chief economist at the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, who helped to orchestrate the latest moves in the government's economic strategy, explained that this a consequence of excess liquidity caused by the bank rescue. It is why inflation has proved stubborn, since people will buy goods to store rather than save money at negative interest rates. The government needs now to mop up this excess liquidity - some 1,000bn bolivars, equivalent to 13 per cent of GDP. To do this, the bank rescue agency Fogade - which owes this amount to the central bank  - will issue up to 400bn bolivars in bonds. It will sell assets of the banks it now owns, probably to the tune of some 40bn bolivars this year. The rest should be absorbed by the issue of dollar-denominated bonds inside Venezuela, which will be guaranteed by future oil royalties. This should account for some 6 per cent of future oil revenues (assuming a Dollars 12 a barrel oil price) or one half a per cent of GDP for seven years. By early next year, says Mr Espinasa, positive real interest rates should return. The government has also been criticised for delaying what is seen as a critical decision - the raising of domestic petrol prices to close the budget deficit. Mr Luis Giusti, president of Petroleos de Venezuela, says the time is needed to work out a compensation programme for the 80 per cent of the people who use public transport. They use only 20 per cent of the petrol - some 160,000 barrels a day - while the rest is consumed by the minority that owns cars. The government's recent commitments, in particular those to end controls and to accelerate privatisation, have reduced the once-yawning gap between the Caldera administration and its market-oriented critics inside and outside the country. But these critics - and others such as the international lending agencies in Washington - will want to see its commitments converted into action before passing judgment. Furthermore, by introducing controls in the first place and then by seeking measures allowing wide scope for future interventionism, the government may have inadvertently put in place a longer-term deterrent to the foreign investment it now says it wants.</p>

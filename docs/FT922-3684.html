			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Doubled order book behind Vosper rise VOSPER THORNYCROFT, the warship designer and builder, reported a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to end-March on the back of an order book which has doubled to more than Pounds 700m. The Southampton-based group increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 16.1m despite an exceptional Pounds 3.33m (Pounds 1.48m) charge. Sales rose from Pounds 140m to Pounds 157m with exports accounting for 65 per cent of turnover. The shares rose 25p to close at 325p. Two steel shipbuilding contracts, one for two 83 metre corvettes for Oman and the other for four 56 metre fast strike craft to Qatar, helped boost last year's Pounds 350m order book to significantly more than Pounds 700m. The group is still waiting for the go-ahead to build a fourth minehunter for Saudi Arabia. New orders mean the group is unlikely to make as many redundancies as it feared and so far only 100 of the 350 expected job losses have materialised. Earnings per share rose to 34.8p (31.2p). An increased final dividend of 9p (7.875p) makes a total of 13.1p (11.375p). COMMENT The City's prosaic view of Vosper Thornycroft can be summed up thus: it's building warships; it's affected by the government's Options for Change Review; exports are growing. Result: two minuses, one plus. Right? Wrong. This year exports will take more than 90 per cent of its orders, ameliorating the normal risk associated with UK-based defence companies. In spite of three acquisitions cash balances have increased from Pounds 34m to Pounds 51m as productivity - measured by the number of man hours it takes to build warships - increased by 50 per cent. If the group was viewed as an engineering company instead of a defence related one its shares would be a lot more expensive. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 20m and earnings of 44p (there will be no exceptional charge for redundancies next year) put the shares on a prospective multiple of just over 7 - a 44 per cent discount to the market. If the company was about to launch a rights issue, British Aerospace style, then the shares might be fairly priced. But since it is not there must be a strong case for believing they are good value.</p>

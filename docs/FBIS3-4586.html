			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Japan's industrial  production edged up 0.9 percent in January from the previous  month in a modest rebound from December's 1.9 percent decline,  the trade ministry said Monday [28 February].    The seasonally adjusted production index for the mining and  manufacturing sectors came to 88.6 against a base of 100 for  1990, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)  said in a preliminary report.    But despite the rise, the index was still at its  third-lowest  -- after December's 87.8 and October's 87.6 -- since the 1990  base was introduced in May.    Production continues to slump, although a production outlook  index for the manufacturing sector indicates rises there in  February and March, MITI said, adding that coming movements in  final demand must be closely watched.    Shipments rose 0.6 percent in January with the index at  89.9,  compared with the 0.7 percent decrease logged in December.    The inventory index dipped 0.4 percent to 107.9, adding to  December's 0.9 percent decline.    The ratio of inventory to sales fell 3.2 percent in January  to 122.0, slipping back from the record high set in December  when the ratio rose 1.6 percent.    Monday's figures cap a half year of alternating ups and  downs  in Japan's industrial production, which saw a 2.2 percent gain  in November in reaction to October's record 5.5 percent drop.  That followed a 2.2 percent September gain and a 1.2 percent  fall in August.    On an unadjusted basis, January's industrial production was  down 3.1 percent from a year before, extending a record string  of year- on-year declines to 28 months.    Patches of brightness are appearing, such as production and  shipment of small cars, light trucks and computer equipment, but  it is too early to say that the economy is bottoming out, said  Koichi Yoshimoto, head of MITI's statistical analysis division.    With those gains helping the electric machinery and  transportation equipment sectors, "the possibility seems high"  that next month's projections for manufacturing production will  show a third straight gain in April, he said. But he added  there is not enough data to confirm a trend.    As the Bank of Japan has said in recent reports, Yoshimoto  told reporters that Japan's corporate capital spending remains  in a slump, while only isolated improvements are visible in  personal consumption.    He cited a pickup in purchases of video cameras and discs in  recent months.    Among production gainers in January were electric, general  and transportation equipment, while precision machinery,  ceramics and steel declined, the MITI report said.    Reporting higher shipments were transportation and electric  equipment and nonferrous metals, while shipments fell in the  metal products, general machinery and steel sectors, it said.    Despite its higher production and shipments, the  transportation equipment sector also had higher inventories.    Inventories increased for oil and coal products, but  declined  for most other sectors, notably electric machinery, chemicals,  and plastic products.</p>

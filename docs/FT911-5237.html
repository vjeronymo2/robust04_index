			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Michelin's man aims to ride out the bumps: The French tyremaker's tough way ahead in the wake of further job cuts Francois Michelin, 64-year-old head of the world's largest tyre company, has been loath over the years to take an axe to his workforce. The decision he has just taken was thus one of the toughest of his life. Like everyone in the world tyre industry, Michelin - expected to announce on Wednesday an annual operating loss of almost FFr2bn (Pounds 198m) plus an estimated FFr3bn restructuring charge - is suffering from a decline in prices to its main customer, the troubled car industry. Last week, the company announced it would shed 4,900 jobs in France - 13 per cent of its French industrial workforce - in a bid to cut costs. This is the largest of the five rounds of job cuts Michelin has had to make in eight years. The move is a catastrophic blow for Clermont Ferrand, the sleepy industrial sprawl in the heart of the Auvergne, where Michelin has its headquarters and where one worker in five is an employee of the company. But the only reaction from the 'Bibs' - as Michelin workers are called locally, after the company's roly-poly mascot Bibendum - has been resignation; Clermont Ferrand, which takes almost half the French reduction, is still numb from the last round of cuts in June when Michelin said it had to lose 2,260 jobs. The Michelin man himself is in a mood of grim determination, as he showed in a rare interview last week. His decision is a remarkable change for a company criticised in the past for being too paternalistic. Mr Michelin accepts that the company was late in making its job cuts by comparison with other leading tyre makers. But he points out that Michelin was only just completing its takeover of Uniroyal Goodrich, the US tyre group, at the end of 1989 when the downturn began. He says: 'We were like an aeroplane that is trying to take off. You have to keep all the engines going until you achieve take-off speed. You cannot reduce power until you have taken off, otherwise you crash at the end of the runway.' The group had for some time suspected it had surplus staff. But until recently the priority was to grow and become more international in line with the globalisation of the car industry. Mr Michelin also says the group was inhibited from making these latest cuts earlier by political, trade union and humanitarian considerations. Mr Michelin's direct style is typical of the way that insiders say this notoriously secretive group is managed; it sets the tone for Michelin's strategy in tackling the recession. His office, for example, looks more suitable for a modest works manager than the head of a 130,000-strong industrial empire. It is furnished with plywood and steel chairs on a tiled floor - 'putting down plush carpets would be stealing money from the customers,' says an official - and occupies a corner of the factory started by his grandfather 101 years ago. In keeping with this low-key style, Mr Michelin and the two other top men in the company carry the simple title of gerant or manager. It is a striking contrast with the typical job title of 'president and managing director' given to most French company chiefs. But along with the simplicity comes toughness. Times may be hard, he indicates, but in no way is Michelin prepared to lose market share. Mr Michelin estimates that there is 20 per cent overcapacity in the world tyre industry, equivalent to slightly less than Michelin's own market share. But these latest job cuts will take out hardly any Michelin capacity and leave its European production unchanged. 'We are simply adapting our costs to a new economic situation,' he says. Neither can Mr Michelin exclude further job cuts. That depends on unforecastable car market trends. 'When will you buy your next car? What type will it be?' he asks, with one of his frequent enigmatic grins. 'I'd love to know what will happen in the next four years, but I don't' Yet tyre industry overcapacity is not the main problem, he argues. The decline in prices, hastened by recession, is long-term and pre-dates the industry production surplus. Prices have fallen by 50 per cent in real terms in France over the past decade, so a tyre now costs much the same as a pair of shoes or a tank of petrol. 'Given the difference between the technical risk of a tank of petrol and importance of tyres for the car's safety, that seems a little unbalanced,' complains Mr Michelin, showing the traditional French reserve over the usefulness of brute market forces. He pins the responsibility - though not necessarily the blame - for this on the car industry. 'The price fall is linked not to overcapacity but to carmakers' need to reduce their operating costs, and so sell at prices able to reach a wider clientele . . . Each acts in function of their internal difficulties and they are perfectly right,' says Mr Michelin. And yet, he adds: 'I think they are beginning to realise that they can't get away with everything.' Some analysts argue that the world tyre industry ought to be powerful enough to push the car manufacturers around, given that just six tyre groups control three-quarters of the market. But there is no question of Michelin breaking ranks and raising its prices. 'Nobody would follow us,' says Mr Michelin. Car producers' technical demands are going to become tougher, posing both a challenge and an opportunity for Michelin, the gerant believes. 'Clients' needs are going to get very diverse. I see the progressive abandonment of big series car production, in favour of smaller series. For us, this means slightly smaller production runs,' Mr Michelin predicts. In an ideal world, this would be accompanied by a shift from a commodity-type market to one where prices take more account of quality. Whatever the difficulties, Mr Michelin is sticking to his strategy. The Uniroyal Goodrich acquisition was criticised by many as saddling Michelin with extra production capacity and debt at just the wrong moment. Yet this was essential to get access to the high margin market for replacement tyres and for so-called private brands, both specialities of the US company. Eventually, says Mr Michelin, the Uniroyal purchase will come to be seen as a sensible move. Others have criticised Michelin for not diversifying away from tyres apart from its traditional maps and guides business, which absorbs a tiny fraction of sales. Until the day the group produces the perfect tyre, Mr Michelin sees no logic in diversifying. What about his own future? With his 65th birthday coming up in July, Mr Michelin says the organisation of a smooth succession 'preoccupies me a lot,' the first time he has publicly mentioned the possibility. There is no heir to the throne because the company is run like a partnership, and the three gerants have the same general management function. But Mr Michelin points out that the key figure in ensuring continuity will be the youngest of the gerants, 53-year-old Mr Rene Zingraff, a lifetime Michelin man, promoted to the post four years ago. For the foreseeable future, however, there is no sign of this grand old man of French industry fading into the background or changing his basic strategy.</p>

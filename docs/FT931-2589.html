			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ministers reject French demands on fish imports EUROPEAN community fisheries ministers yesterday rejected French demands for a 30 per cent rise in minimum import prices on white fish and total ban on Russian cod imports, opting instead for stricter enforcement of the floor prices and controls put in place last month. France, which got backing only from Ireland for its demands for stronger checks on the flood of imports depressing fish prices, said immediately it would re-present essentially the same demands to the European Commission next week under the guise of 'emergency safeguard measures'. But Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, EC fisheries commissioner, is understood to regard yesterday's ministerial decision as adequate for the time being. France's raising of 'safeguard' action was 'greeted in total silence' inside the Council of Ministers, EC officials said. Breton fishermen's leaders said they would 'continue the struggle' that has led to often violent protests across France, while Scottish fishermen's leaders dismissed yesterday's meeting as 'a non-event' with 'absolutely no conclusions which will help us at all'. Some 200 French, and a few dozen Scottish fishermen, demonstrated to reinforce their demands, their numbers diminished by the arrest of three bus-loads of fishermen 30 miles south of Brussels for allegedly carrying sticks and flares. Brussels' Charlemagne building, where ministers meet, was completely cut off by a cordon of razor wire, manned by one of the heaviest deployments of riot police of the past two years. The ministers concluded that the minimum import prices, controls on direct landings of fish from non-EC vessels, and hygiene standards - which could filter out part of the large quantity of Russian fish coming into the community disguised as EC fish and via Nordic countries with preferential tariff deals - were not being properly applied, and had not been given time to work. Although they left open the possibility of extending the floor price regime to other species - at present it applies primarily to cod, haddock, whiting and monkfish - they ruled out more radical measures. 'I think today we have gone as far as we could go,' said Mr David Curry, UK fisheries minister. 'We've already agreed minimum import prices, and what's happening is that they're not being enforced.' Mr Curry, had said on the eve of the meeting that Denmark, Germany, and possibly the UK were still failing to filter out cheap Russian fish. Under these circumstances, he said, 'there is no point in multiplying the rules'. Increasing the floor price, moreover, would 'give a greater incentive for the fraud', he added. An aide to Mr Charles Josselin, the French fisheries minister, said judgments differed about the depth of the crisis, which has led to a collapse in fish prices of 30 per cent and more. 'If the community does not adopt these measures, the market will not be corrected,' he said.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Private View: Aussie boyo comes out punching - Bob Hawke still displays the pugilistic streak that carried him to the top in Australian politics Nearly three years after being knocked out of the political ring, veteran pugilist Bob Hawke is still throwing punches. Australia's four-term former prime minister might have dropped in the weights since the Labor party leadership was snatched from him, but he looks very fit for 64: short, wiry, quick on his toes and eager to trade blows. He was in London this week to promote The Hawke Memoirs, a smoothly-written record of his triumphs which critics have found self-serving, even by the standards of political autobiography. In particular, Hawke's successor, Paul Keating - his one-time finance minister and friend - gets a pasting. In the snakepit of Australian politics, attack is the usual form of defence. When I suggested that the memoirs had the tone of a man who felt grossly under-valued - I did not dare use the word 'whingeing' - Hawke began chastising the Australian media for bias. They were the reason, he said, why he had 'inclined to be emphatic'. Like Margaret Thatcher, Hawke lost his premiership in an inner-party putsch. Was he still as sore about it as she appeared to be? 'No. I believed the party had the right to make a mistake, if I can put it that way. I did not feel bitterness about the party making a decision. I did have some bitterness about some of the tactics that were employed and what, in my judgment, was some unprincipled, dishonest undermining.' What happens to a man used to power and attention when it is taken away? 'I can't say what happens with Mrs Thatcher or someone else. But with this man - because I've done it all my life - when I've finished one thing, I get very interested and involved in the next stage of my career.' His plan to re-launch himself as a television interviewer of world leaders fell through. Instead, Hawke has set up as a consultant on Asian affairs and has a couple of Australian university chairs he has yet to warm. There must be some withdrawal symptoms, I said. 'I don't know how long I've got to go on about it. At the time, right at the time, there was. But what I'm saying is, that's something that's finished. I don't want to go into what I've earned in this period. But I've earned very well. My time has been fully occupied working long hours and a whole range of things which are tremendously satisfying. 'You either believe me or you don't. I mean, I keep saying I'm not one that looks back. I fought to keep the position. I was hurt right then, but then that was it. Done.' He punched the palm of his hand. Do you see in Paul Keating some of your own faults? 'No, no. That's a nice bit of amateur psychology. But entirely without foundation.' Hawke took the question as a reference to his own ousting of Bill Hayden (now Australia's Governor-General) as Labor leader before the election victory of 1983. 'The evidence showed that I was the one to get Labor into power, and not Bill. Here (in 1991), you had a situation where the contender said that even if he had a less chance of winning the next election than me, he wanted it because it was his turn. That sort of ambition was totally different.' I reminded Hawke of some of the pejoratives he had used about Keating. He picked up a copy of the memoirs and began to read from one of many marked pages: 'From hesitant beginnings, Paul had grown in confidence, competence, courage, imagination and determination . . .' I know political memoirs are an exercise in self-justification, I said, but, in retrospect, might you have left all that stuff about Keating out? 'Of course I wouldn't' He glared at me as if I had lost my marbles. 'Why would you? I mean, has history changed? Do the facts change?' Maybe it would have been more dignifed . . . 'What's the question of dignified?' he spluttered. To say less, I mean. 'Why? What's the question of dignity involved in history. That may be your perception about one's responsibility writing the facts of history, and why and how things happened. All I can say to you is it's not mine. If the concept underlying your question is that dignity is more important than the facts . . . that's a perverse view.' It wasn't, quite. But it was a good jab, and I stepped back. Hawke achieved his aim of making Labor a natural party of government by grabbing the political centre. He also embarked on a bonfire of protectionist controls. What advice had he got for Tony Blair, Britain's new Labour leader? 'I don't presume to tell him - I would want you to preface with that. But, for what its worth, he should adopt policies that are relevant to the needs and aspirations of the country. It's no good having outdated shibboleths. The basic philosophy is to pursue policies which will be electorally relevant and acceptable.' At the same time, he added, a social democratic government should see its role as creating equality of opportunity for every citizen. Hawke's mother, Ellie, a strictly religious person like her husband, Clem, was convinced her boy was destined for great things - especially after his elder brother, Neil, died young of meningitis. I asked him if he shared her conviction. 'I had some sense that, in a strange way, my life had been developing in a way that was preparing me for the capacity to move through the ranks of the labour movement to leadership. It's a very fair question, a relevant one.' After reading law and economics, and with politics at the back of his mind, he went as a Rhodes Scholar to Oxford University where his choice of research topic - Australia's unusual wage-bargaining system - led to a job with, and inexorable rise to the top of, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the equivalent of Britain's TUC. 'The way those things happened, it was almost as though . . . if I'd been sitting there, almost being able to choreograph the steps in a career, you couldn't have done it any more relevantly. That's the point I'm making. I'm not excluding the fact that within me there was a well-developed ambition to move through and go to the top.' If Bob Hawke once was famous for his gambling, swearing, drinking and womanising, he was even more famous for his public confessions and tears. I asked this former yard-of-ale record holder: Why did you hit the bottle so hard? 'Oh, I don't know. I tended to do everything hard. Remember when I had the accident and nearly died?' (While at university, he crashed his Panther motorcycle and ruptured his spleen.) 'I just then determined to do everything flat out. I didn't determine to drink flat out - the main thing I determined to do flat out was in respect of my studies. But I was a person that was full of energy. I never did things in a half-hearted way. In a sense, that applied to my socialising.' Was it just socialising, or were you trying to get away from something? 'No. As I said, I shared Churchill's view that I got more out of drink than it got out of me. It was a very useful and important part of developing relationships, cementing them. The Australian political labour and industrial scene is a very gregarious, mateship sort of thing. The reason I gave it up was there were too many instances where I behaved stupidly. I wasn't proud of some of the things I did.' In 1980, with the Labor leadership in his sights he turned over a new leaf and became teetotal. Many writers have described Hawke as an exceptionally paradoxical, complicated man. Did he agree? 'Well, I don't know what 'complicated' means. I'm not being semantic about this. Whether I am, in fact, more complicated that Joe Blow, I don't know. Neither do you. I'm not professionally qualified to answer the question. I wonder whether it only becomes an issue because I'm a prominent person. 'I don't fully know myself. No human being does. But to the extent that I do know myself, I don't think I am terribly complex. I understand what drives me. I understand what my passions are. But I could be wrong.' The boyo image, I said, was almost a caricature of an Australian: was that really you, or something you found politically useful? 'Oh, come on. Come on, don't be silly. You really are an amateur psychologist. I am a gregarious bloke who loves his sport, is passionate about his sport and good at it, loves people . . . in a sense, a quintessential Australian since I've been like that.' He held his palm close to the floor. 'Sport, people, lack of pretence. Let's get down to it. That's been me all my life. I mean,' he sniffed, 'that's how I've related to the Australian people. To come along now with this 'Have you really adopted this persona?' Come off it, mate]' People seem to be confused by you, I said. That's why I ask. 'That's why I'm giving you a direct answer. To refute the nonsense.' I nipped across the ring and asked why there was no mention of the entrepreneurs Kerry Packer or Alan Bond in the memoirs, and only one of Rupert Murdoch - compared to King Midas. Your left-wing critics have made a lot of the fact that you were big mates with them and say you gave them the run of the roost. 'Wait a minute. If I spent my time writing about inaccuracy and misrepresentation . . . I mean, it was a canard from the word Go. I knew these people. Bond, early in my prime ministership, wins the America's Cup. I was photographed with him and lauded him for what he did, as did the rest of Australia. I was never close mates with Bond, or with Packer or with Murdoch. They had no part in determining the policy I ran. 'I happened to believe that Australia was over-regulated, and that it had been buggered by a conservative government which was supposed to be for free enterprise but continued to cosset it behind high tariff walls. I was for internationalising the economy' . . . here he banged his fist . . . 'deregulating, bringing in foreign banks, floating the dollar. Within that context, you have entrepreneurs who go like that.' He shot his arm towards the ceiling. 'Big surprise]' Australia, I said, used to be seen as brash, noisy and chippy - a bit ashamed of its culture. Do you think it has grown up in some way? 'I think it has in many ways, yes. It is true we have been exporting reasonable quality culture for a goodly period of time.' He made it sound like wooltops. 'But you're right. Australia's got more confidence in itself now, beyond the traditional areas where we were great at tennis and swimming and so on. 'Some of the insouciance you talk about is still there. I hope for God's sake it will remain a part of us. But now there's a quality of real self-assurance, as distinct from the attractive bravado.' I stepped from the ring to leave the former title-holder looking as fresh as a daisy for the next bout. Thanks very much, I said, 'It's been a pleasure,' he replied. 'The economics, the politics - and the psychology]'</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / MP urges review of competition policy A senior Conservative MP has criticised the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in calling for a comprehensive review of competition policy. Mr John Watts, chairman of the Commons Treasury committee, yesterday used a Westminster meeting to urge a 'thorough investigation into the British process for regulating competition'. 'There was a time when the great and the good could be relied on to interpret the public interest according to a widely-held consensus view,' Mr Watts said, arguing that recent MMC reports 'clearly demonstrate that this is not the case today'. Mr Watts, MP for Slough, was supported by Mr Stephen Locke, director of the Consumers' Association policy unit, who said there was 'considerable duplication of activity' by the MMC, the Office of Fair Trading and the Department of Trade and Industry. The DTI said yesterday it would examine what Mr Watts had to say before commenting further.</p>

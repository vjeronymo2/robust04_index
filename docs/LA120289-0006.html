			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CATHOLIC TAKES EXCEPTION TO PHRASE 'HAIL MARY PASS'  </P> <P> As a member of the Roman Catholic faith, and Los Angeles has a very large  Catholic population, I find the phrase Hail Mary pass offensive and  disrespectful in the extreme.  </P> <P> Please cease from using this phrase in the future.  </P> <P> LARRY C. KNIGHT, Rosemead  </P> <P>  EDITOR'S NOTE: The phrase in question was used by quarterback Roger Staubach  of the Dallas Cowboys, a Roman Catholic, in describing the last-second winning  pass play in his team's 1975 playoff victory over the Minnesota Vikings. It  quickly became a part of the language of football and is used with no  disrespect intended.  </P> <P> </P></p>

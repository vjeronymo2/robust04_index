			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mercedes boon for Alabama MERCEDES-BENZ yesterday confirmed Alabama as the winner of a fierce contest between more than 30 US states to be the site of the company's first passenger vehicle plant outside Germany. The Dollars 300m facility, which will produce a range of four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicles, is to be in the town of Vance (population 250), 12 miles east of Tuscaloosa, home of the University of Alabama, and 32 miles south of Birmingham, the state's largest city. The decision is a great economic and psychological fillip for Alabama, which has trailed other south-eastern states in attracting new investment, particularly from abroad. Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz, the car and commercial vehicle subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial corporation, said the company had decided on Tuscaloosa after investigating 170 US sites. 'Tuscaloosa provides the best combination of those factors we are seeking: a quality workforce, a strong transportation network, a university environment, business vitality and a favourable quality of life,' he said. Alabama is paying a high price to attract Mercedes-Benz. It is providing economic incentives worth Dollars 112m and is committed to spending a further Dollars 140m on infrastructure and education. Mercedes-Benz stressed that other states on its short list - North Carolina and South Carolina - had offered similar packages and that incentives had not been the decisive factor in selection. Mr Billy Joe Camp, the Alabama official who headed the drive to attract Mercedes-Benz, said a cost/benefit analysis suggested that the plant would help create 15,000 jobs in the state over the next 20 years, and bring Dollars 7bn in economic benefits. Mercedes-Benz announced last April its decision in principle to build a volume sports/utility vehicle - a new market segment for the company - in the US. The Tuscaloosa plant, to employ 1,500 people, will begin manufacturing at the start of 1997, and will make 60,000 vehicles a year, as much as half of these for export markets. Mercedes-Benz said more than 60 per cent of the components would be purchased in the US, including the transmission from Borg-Warner. Engines would be supplied from Germany. Mercedes-Benz revealed yesterday the sports/utility business, including worldwide sales, would be managed from Tuscaloosa.</p>

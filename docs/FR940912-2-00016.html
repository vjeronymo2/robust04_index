If, as a result of its reviews, the Board determines that an imminent or severe threat to public health or safety exists, the Board is required to transmit its recommendations directly to the President, as well as to the Secretaries of Energy and Defense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board's enabling statute, 42 U.S.C. &sect;2286, requires the Board to review and evaluate the content and implementation of health and safety standards, including DOE's Orders, rules, and other safety requirements, relating to the design, construction, operation, and decommissioning of DOE's defense nuclear facilities. The Board must then recommend to the Secretary of Energy and specific measures, such as changes in the content and implementation of those standards, that the Board believes should be adopted to ensure that the public health and safety are adequately protected. The Board is also required to review the design of new defense nuclear facilities before construction begins, as well as modifications to older facilities, and to recommend changes necessary to protect health and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board may conduct investigations, issue subpoenas, hold public hearings, gather information, conduct studies, establish reporting requirements for DOE, and take other actions in furtherance of its review of health and safety issues at defense nuclear facilities. These ancillary functions of the Board and its staff all relate to the accomplishment of the Board's primary functions, which is to assist DOE in identifying and correcting health and safety problems at defense nuclear facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This public hearing is being held to provide the Board with general public comments and views on topics related to the fifth annual report to be submitted by the Board to Congress under 42 U.S.C. &sect;2286e (note) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mitsui seeks to sell hotel held as collateral MITSUI Trust &amp; Banking, a leading Japanese trust bank, has filed for court approval in Hawaii to auction an hotel in Waikiki, held as collateral against loans to Azabu Tatemono, a real estate company burdened by heavy borrowings. Japanese banks, under pressure from mounting bad loans, have increased efforts to sell collateral taken for the loans. The move to sell the Hyatt Regency Waikiki, a 1,230-room luxury hotel on Oahu Island, follows a row earlier this year between Mitsui Trust, Azabu's main creditor, and Mr Kitaro Watanabe, owner of Azabu. Mitsui Trust officials said they would gradually try to unload collateral held against loans to Azabu.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ashraf al-Faqi, in Surt: "Foreign Minister 'Umar </F> al-Muntasir: `Proposals to End Lockerbie Crisis'"]    [Text] Mr. 'Umar al-Muntasir, the secretary of the People's  Bureau for Foreign Liaison &amp; International Cooperation--the  Foreign Minister--has announced new Libyan proposals aimed at  finding a solution to the Lockerbie crisis, with Western sources  in Libya saying, in a statement to AL-HAYAH, that "the crucial  thing is not proposals, but Tripoli's compliance with Security  Council Resolution 731."    In a press conference held yesterday in the city of Surt,  al-Muntasir asked the United States, France, and Britain to help  his country put an end to the Lockerbie crisis, as the result of  the "severe harm" done to its economy. He expressed his consent  to a trial of the suspects in the Lockerbie case, 'Abd-al-Basit  al-Miqrahi and al-Amin Khalifah Fuhaymah, by Scottish judges in  any third country (other than the United Kingdom or United  States) agreeable to the three countries.    He accused the American administration of playing the role  of  bully in the Security Council. He said that it was putting  pressure on all the countries, including France, and not even  sparing Dr. Butrus-Ghali, secretary general of the United  Nations.    He added that his country had adopted an Egyptian proposal  last November that demanded the handing over of the suspects to  France through the Arab-Maghreb Union, adding that France had  rejected this proposal due to American pressure. "It is not  just," he said, "for the Americans to reject our efforts to find  a solution." He renewed his refusal to turn over the suspects to  the United States or Britain, because they would then "not be  able to defend themselves." He said that, if the accused were to  surrender themselves voluntarily to these countries, "all they  would have to do is to give their names, for them to be found  guilty."    Al-Muntasir called on Germany and Italy to help Libya in its  efforts to find a solution that "respects Libyan sovereignty,"  given that Germany is a "partner" in the Lockerbie case, as the  flight of the Pan American aircraft that blew up over Scotland  had begun in Frankfort.    Al-Muntasir accused Arab governments of failing to achieve  reconciliation, and demanded that their peoples find a way to  conciliate, especially as "these governments wasted a basic  opportunity to develop" when the price of a barrel of oil was  $40. He disclosed that his country is in the process of again  reviewing its political relations with the countries of the  world, "in line with [Libya's] interests and those of the Arab  countries." He said that the peace talks in the Middle East were  nothing but "surrender solutions."    He said, "We are awaiting the outcome of the contacts of  Arab  League Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid regarding his  initiative on [Arab] reconciliation."    Addressing President Bill Clinton's threat, two weeks ago,  to  issue a resolution preventing Libya from exporting its oil, he  said, "We are dealing with a bully, and we must face facts. We  have a vicious enemy who can do that. But Libya is prepared to  live without its oil."</p>

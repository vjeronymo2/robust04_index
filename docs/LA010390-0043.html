			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: DREXEL GIVES SHER ADDITIONAL POST  </P> <P> Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. on Tuesday named Allan Sher, 58, the senior  management official assigned last year to supervise the firm's Beverly Hills  operations, to the additional post of vice chairman.  </P> <P> With the addition of Sher, the firm will have three vice chairmen, including  Fred Joseph, the firm's chief executive, and Herbert Bachelor, who oversees  corporate finance activities.  </P> <P> Sher, who has been with Drexel since 1983, was already on Drexel's board and  continues as a member of the firm's executive committee. Sher's appointment  last year to oversee Drexel's Beverly Hills-based corporate finance, high-yield  and capital markets departments was a result of the firm's settlement of  securities fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> Claiming that the Beverly Hills operations had been inadequately supervised  from Drexel's New York headquarters while Michael Milken was head of the high  yield junk bond department, the SEC had insisted that Drexel name a senior  management official who would live in the Los Angeles area to oversee the West  Coast operations. Before Sher was given that job, he had served as head of  Drexel's retail division. The firm eliminated that division last year.  </P> <P> Steven Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, said Sher's promotion had nothing to do  with the SEC settlement. He said it was based simply on a decision by the  firm's board to give Sher additional recognition.  </P> <P> Securities industry analysts noted that during Joseph's term as chief executive  a variety of executives in addition to Joseph have been vice chairmen, and they  said the Sher's promotion doesn't appear to change Joseph's status within the  firm. Perrin Long, an analyst at Lipper Analytical Services, said Sher's  promotion appeared to be part of a current Drexel policy "to reward people by  giving them bigger titles."  </P> <P> Drexel also named three new senior vice presidents, including John H. Kissick,  48, who last year was named to succeed Milken as head of Drexel's high-yield  department. The other two new senior vice presidents are Burton M. Siegel, 54,  in charge of the firm's international activities, and Richard J. Wright, 38,  the firm's chief financial officer. SCOT J. PALTROW  </P></p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Hata struggles to remake coalition Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's recently elected prime minister, made no progress yesterday in persuading the Social Democratic party to rejoin his crippled coalition. The deadlock threatens to prevent him forming a majority government, so increasing the chance of an early general election. The opposition Liberal Democratic party, encouraged by the break-up of the coalition, yesterday called on Mr Hata to hand over power. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, SDP chairman, refused to reply to Mr Hata's invitation to discuss the socialists' decision early yesterday to leave the government coalition, so removing its parliamentary majority. The SDP, formerly the coalition's largest member, walked out in protest against the formation of a new alliance, called Kaishin, by five conservative groups led by Mr Hata's Japan Renewal party. Only hours earlier, the SDP had cast a decisive vote for Mr Hata's prime ministerial nomination in parliament. This was 'betrayal', said Mr Murayama. The socialists had got the 'wrong impression', Mr Hata maintained. Mr Hata should step down because he had lost the basis for his nomination as leader, Mr Masaharu Gotoda, an LDP elder, said. 'Is it OK to entrust the future of the people to such an insincere government?' asked Mr Yohei Kono, LDP president. Undeterred, Mr Hata said he planned to form a cabinet as soon as possible. JRP officials say he needs to form a government by tomorrow at the latest. The SDP has said it would co-operate with the government in passing a budget for the current year. This has been blocked for more than a month by a parliamentary row over former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's financial propriety, then by the coalition policy row following Mr Hosokawa's resignation. The government is ticking over on a provisional budget, which expires on May 20. The socialists have also offered to co-operate on economic pump-priming measures, but will not support tax reforms, the most important piece of legislation facing the new government. The socialists' departure was 'only natural', the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said yesterday. The party had been out of line with its former partners on most issues, ever since the coalition was formed last July after the LDP's first election defeat in 38 years. The Asahi and other newspapers questioned Mr Hata's ability to exert strong leadership and suggested the formation of Kaishin showed the increased behind-the-scenes influence of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom strategist. Mr Ozawa was virtual 'owner' of the Hata administration, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun financial daily said.</p>

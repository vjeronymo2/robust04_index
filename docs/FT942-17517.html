			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Sport: Tracking the next generation - The state of British tennis At a time when gloom has descended on those who follow tennis in Britain, with last week's humiliating Davis Cup defeat at the hands of lowly Portugal, it may seem surprising to suggest that the much-maligned Lawn Tennis Association, after years of stagnation, is at last getting it right. But that is what the facts indicate, in spite of the resignation of captain Tony Pickard, who has had more success with Stefan Edberg than with British teams. The role of the LTA is to encourage the game's growth at grass roots level, to build facilities that will allow that growth to take place, to establish a competitive structure for counties, clubs and individuals, and to provide training and guidance for the best of our players so that they may fulfil their potential. During the post-war period those objectives were shamefully neglected. For 40 years club and county tennis continued cosily as an elitist sport with little attempt by the LTA to broaden its appeal. A few ambitious clubs did replace the wooden clubhouses that had been constructed in the 1920s and 1930s with more substantial premises, but most were reluctant to modernise, worried that higher annual subscriptions would lose members. Golf and squash had no such inhibitions. Meanwhile the rest of Europe was building for the future. The French, for example, first under Marcel Bernard and then for 20 years under Philippe Chatrier, transformed the fortunes of both the French open and the national club infrastructure, based on its regional leagues. It was always a weakness of the LTA that its chairman served for only one year. There was no continuity of leadership and the well-intentioned, but inadequate, amateur officials were more concerned about planning their paths to the summit than in revitalising the game. The extension to a three-year term in 1982, when the post of chairman was changed to president, was an improvement but it was not until the appointment of a full-time executive director in 1986 that a truly professional approach could begin. Ian Peacock has held that post for seven years and has presided over a growth in LTA registered membership from 16,000 to 52,000 - and an increase in the number of tournaments from 500 to 900. He has seen the number of multi-court indoor centres built under the Indoor Tennis Initiative grow from zero to 29, with 11 more in various stages of development. He has encouraged private clubs to build indoor courts and reports investment of 5.5m in projects at various stages of completion. County centres have already been built in Derbyshire, Norfolk and Buckinghamshire and eight more are about to come on stream. Thanks largely to the increasing revenues from Wimbledon, which passes its surplus to the LTA each year (Pounds 16.4m in 1993), a bold five-year programme of facility developments, totalling Pounds 63m, is under way. In Nottingham, Edinburgh and Bournemouth, construction has already begun on large tournament sites where the court surface will be an American version of clay. Two other key centres, one in Wales the other in the home counties, will be similarly equipped. In total there will be 41 clay courts in use at these sites by 1996. All will be available for national and county training at agreed times. The importance of clay as a surface for young players to learn their skills can hardly be over-emphasised - especially in Davis Cup matches. Years ago there used to be a springtime circuit on shale courts which, though faster and more slippery than continental clay courts, had roughly the same playing characteristics. Clubs found their upkeep too costly and were encouraged by the LTA to replace shale with acrylic hard courts, the surface used by more and more international tournaments. Thus a generation of players grew up with no chance to develop clay court skills at home. As Richard Lewis, director of national training, admits: 'When we tried to address that problem five years ago by constructing European clay courts in key areas we ignored what was an altogether more appropriate surface for our climate - American clay with its year-round usage against the seven months of European clay and much lower maintenance courts.' Now clubs are being encouraged to lay the American surface with grants of Pounds 5,000 per court for a minimum of two, provided they also commit to a junior development programme. It is a welcome, if belated move. Lewis has sensibly surrounded himself with highly qualified coaches and captains. Ann Jones looks after the Federation Cup women, and Mark Cox heads up the Rover scheme for young hopefuls and is assisted by former US Wightman Cup player Sharon Walsh. Another former highly ranked American, Janet Newberry, started this week as the new women's national training manager, and will attempt to bring the same belief to her players that Bill Knight has instilled so impressively among the men. Former Russian No 1, Olga Morozova, and Ian Barclay, Pat Cash's coach, look after the 12-16 age group at the Rover School at Bisham Abbey. Barclay also contributes to the education of coaches. With Dr Michael Turner appointed as the new medical officer, alongside nutritionist Dawn Thorpe and trainer Steve Green, the former Olympic sprinter, there is a thoroughly professional look about the LTA's training department. The fact that the men have just lost to Portugal merely confirms their known inadequacy on clay. On hard courts or grass it is a different story. Mark Petchey, who lost both singles in Portugal, has just beaten World No 2 Michael Stich and was within a whisker of beating Andre Agassi in Key Biscayne. At Wimbledon last year, Andrew Foster, Chris Wilkinson and Chris Bailey all performed to their full potential. The next generation will be better prepared. At this very moment 25 boys and girls aged between 12 and 15 are at the Bruguera club in Spain where, for three weeks, they will learn the basics of competing on European clay. It is a skill few Britons have ever mastered. Fred Perry is still the only British man ever to have won the French Open - and that was 59 years ago.</p>

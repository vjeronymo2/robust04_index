			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: BOC strong Better than expected interim figures from BOC, the industrial gases and healthcare group, saw the shares deliver the best performance of any FT-SE 100 stock. By the close the share price had risen 29 to 715p, the highest level since April 8. Turnover of 5m shares was the second-highest this year. Analysts said they were impressed with the performance of all BOC's operating areas, especially natural gases, which improved sharply, and healthcare, where they said problems seem to have boottomed out. 'It looks as if the worst is over for BOC,' said one of the market's more bearish analysts. Most current year forecasts were being lifted to around the Pounds 340m mark. News that the London Financial Futures and Options Exchange had decided against joining Reuters' Globex trading system hit the shares, which closed the day 7 off at 485p. Analysts said the development was disappointing but not life-threatening for the product, which has been steadily increasing its trading volumes. However, one analyst said the danger of a major exchange such as the Liffe not joining could have a negative effect on other exchanges' decisions - making Friday's likely announcement by the Deutsche Termin Boerse all the more important. First-quarter profits from Sedgwick, the biggest of the UK insurance brokers, came in well below most market estimates and put the shares under heavy pressure during the morning. But a clarification of the figures at the post-results meeting with analysts helped to restore a measure of confidence in the shares, which ended 6 down on balance at 197p, having fallen to 194 1/2 p immediately following the numbers. Turnover of 9.2m in Sedgwick was the second most heaviest this year. Some analysts had pencilled in first-quarter expectations of Pounds 50m and more, against the actual result of Pounds 43.6m. The company pointed out, however, that it had warned of a change in the way profits were spread out over the year. Profits forecasts for the year were being fine-tuned after the meeting but mostly were clustered around the Pounds 98m to Pounds 100m mark. The reporting season in the drinks sector continued in similar vein, with Allied-Lyons reporting full-year figures in line with market forecasts. As expected, the brewing side performed poorly, prompting louder murmurs from analysts for the company to consider divesting its interest in the Carlsberg-Tetley joint venture. There was also some disappointment over the lack of news on the disposal of the group's food business. The shares dipped on the results announcement but picked up on a positive analysts' meeting. They closed 5 up at 595p. A busy pharmaceuticals sector saw Fisons dip 4 to 140p following the annual meeting. SmithKline Beecham came under pressure early in the session following news of a challenge to its UK patent on its biggest selling drug, the antibiotic Augmentin, from Norton Healthcare. SmithKline shares fell to 394p but later rallied to finish a net 5 off at 400p. Speculation that steel and wire group ASW Holdings may soon be on the receiving end of a bid from British Steel did the rounds in the market. The former gained 8 at 213p, while the latter eased 3 to 142 1/4 p in trade of 12m shares. RTZ raced up 20 to 887p and looked set to attack the stock's all-time high of 897p set in February, following the latest upsurge in copper prices and talk of a strong buy recommendation from BZW. The English power generators moved in opposite directions, with National Power, the biggest of the UK's generators, sliding 6 to 437p on good turnover of 3.5m shares ahead of preliminary results expected this morning, and following suggestions that a big line of stock had been offered to the market in mid-morning. PowerGen, on the other hand, remained in demand and closed 9 higher at 484p. Both stocks were strong performers on Monday. Kleinwort Benson was said to have provoked the big switching from Scottish Power into Scottish Hydro-Electric. The latter was finally 3 off at 339p and the former a further 9 lower at 359p, after 356p. The Pounds 22m rights issue from Higgs &amp; Hill, the housebuilding and construction group, saw the shares retreat 10 to 122p. Shares in publishing group Emap, which have underperformed the market by 14 per cent over the last three months, jumped 18 to 385p after Smith New Court turned buyer of the stock, changing from a sell recommendation. Mr David Forster at the broker said things were improving at Car Week magazine after disappointing initial sales, and that the group should benefit from the better than expected upturn in UK advertising. Around 47 per cent of Emap's revenue is derived from advertising. Redrow, the housebuilder, made an unauspicious market debut, the shares opening around 118p and slipping back to 115p at one point before rallying and ending the session at 128p, a significant discount to the 135p offer price. The day's other debut stock, Capitol Group, the security operator, fared much better, opening and closing at 133p compared with the 125p flotation price. Woolworth and Comet owner Kingfisher was buoyed by positive notes from UBS and Robert Fleming, as well as talk of a bullish meeting with a private client broker. The shares moved ahead 7 to 564p. An upbeat agm statement from Goldsmiths helped the shares rise 5 to 115p. Financial worries continued to overhang Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel and the shares relinquished a further 15 to 405p.</p>

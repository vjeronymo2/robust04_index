			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Restructured Whessoe advances 19% to Pounds 3.67m WHESSOE, the engineering and pipework group 'significantly restructured' since 1989, has maintained its progress with a 19 per cent pre-tax profits advance to Pounds 3.67m in the six months to March 31. The rise from Pounds 3.09m was struck on turnover boosted by acquisitions to Pounds 36.6m (Pounds 25.2m). In September the piping systems division was augmented by the Pounds 8m purchase of Connex Pipe Systems of the US. Elcon Instruments of Milan, Italy, was joined in the instrumentation and control side this January by Varec, a California-based maker and distributor of tank gauges and vapour control products. A 1-for-4 rights issue raising Pounds 8.1m helped pay Varec's Pounds 11.1m purchase price, but Mr Chris Fleetwood, chief executive, stressed that the group remained cash positive. He added that the group had completed its first phase of change away from heavy engineering and that its future direction was towards niche markets such as instrumentation and control. However Whessoe 'was not emotionally attached to any one business'. In the period the holding in the Australian pipe and boiler fabricator was sold, resulting in a extraordinary credit of Pounds 495,000, and Whessoe (Ireland), the group's last heavy engineering fabrication business was bought by its management for about Pounds 700,000. The interim dividend is lifted to 2.2p (2p), payable from earnings only up to 11.7p (10.2p) after dilution by the rights.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (12): 'Cowboys' of the markets - The role of hedge funds At the beginning of 1994, there were at least two certainties in the eyes of most global asset managers: the US dollar and European bond markets, had to rise. It is a matter of history, of course, that events turned out otherwise, with most fund managers reaching the end of the first quarter nursing battered balance sheets and wounded egos. In the search for scapegoats, the finger was quickly pointed at the hedge funds - large pools of speculative capital, whose predatory trading instincts and penchant for highly leveraged trade has conferred on them a reputation as the cowboys of modern financial markets. Figures about the size of the hedge fund industry are notoriously vague, mainly because many hedge funds are organised so as to avoid the application of most securities laws, and hence exist in something of a regulatory black hole. Republic New York Securities, a firm that tracks hedge fund activities, estimates that there are more than 800 hedge funds representing Dollars 35bn-Dollars 40bn capital. These estimates were largely corroborated by recent testimony from Barbara Pedersen Holum, acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), at hearings on hedge fund activities held in the US by the House Banking Committee. The CFTC regulates US commodity futures and options markets and has information on most hedge funds of any size that use these markets. CFTC data indicates a total of Dollars 31.5bn under management of 'self-declared' hedge funds, and Dollars 48bn under management by all listed investment partnerships combined. These figures need to be kept in context. The total net value of the regulated mutual fund industry in the US was Dollars 2,100bn at the end of 1993, with at least 10 mutual funds having a net asset value greater than Dollars 9bn. Other US institutional investors had, at the end of 1993, Dollars 6,500bn in assets under management. Estimates by John LaWare, a governor of the US Federal Reserve, are that perhaps a dozen hedge funds have a net asset value greater than Dollars 1bn with another 25 having capital between Dollars 100m and Dollars 1bn. George Soros's group is believed to be the largest with about Dollars 9bn of capital. How active are hedge funds on foreign exchanges? Testifying before the House banking committee, Mr Soros provided the following appraisal: using 1992 data from the Bank for International Settlements, showing global net turnover of the nine largest foreign exchange markets to be about Dollars 946bn per day, 'all hedge funds in the aggregate control at most 1/180th (or 0.005 per cent) of the daily global trading volume in the foreign exchange markets'. This is based on the assumption that Soros Fund Management (SFM), on an average trading day in foreign exchange, might engage in transactions with a total value of around Dollars 500m; and that SFM constitutes about 15 per cent of the money invested in hedge funds. Against this rather benign view of hedge funds, two points must be made. First, their ability to leverage their funds, and willingness to take big bets, means that some of their trades can be very large indeed. Also, despite their self-styled contrarian instincts, hedge funds do often end up trading as a pack. In such cases their ability to move markets is beyond dispute. But Mr Soros does have support for his view that the influence of hedge funds can be exaggerated. The CTFC, for example, found that the more prominent hedge funds 'have not contributed to volatility in CFTC regulated markets'. The CFTC examined its records of hedge fund activity during February and March, when financial markets experienced considerable volatility, and found it 'not significant'. More specifically, on February 14, when the US dollar plunged to a six-month low against the yen, hedge funds 'were not active participants in yen futures on this day, none appearing among the 30 largest net traders . . .' Arguably as important a development as hedge funds has been the mushrooming of proprietary trading activities by leading banks - that is, trading done on their own account where capital is at risk. Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, noted recently that bank trading activities were 'growing at an uncontrolled, rapid pace. At the top 10 bank holding companies, trading account assets have increased about 400 per cent in the past four years and now top Dollars 140bn.' Insofar as regulators are concerned with the threat of financial instability, it may well be that they will in future concern themselves as much with banks' proprietary trading, and the activities of institutional investors, as with hedge funds. Mr Soros argues that 'trend-following behaviour' is necessary to cause a market crash, and that this is most likely to come from institutional investors in general, and mutual funds in particular, aggravated by hedging practices associated with derivative instruments. Large hedge funds like to argue that their contrarian instincts actually make them a smoothing influence in financial markets. This view also enjoys support from regulators. Indeed, the Fed's Mr LaWare told the House committee that 'the activities of hedge funds add depth and liquidity to financial markets and can be stabilising influences. It would be wrong to single out hedge funds as being responsible for moving global prices of financial assets or as being a major source of risk in financial markets.' It may be that markets have already done the regulators' work for them. Indeed, if reports about the extent of hedge fund and proprietary trading losses in the first quarter are to be believed, then a pruning process is already well under way. Hedge funds and proprietary traders have still to prove themselves in bear markets.</p>

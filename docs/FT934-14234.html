			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Deaths threaten rival to Zovirax SUPPLIES of Usevir, the only licensed effective competitor in the world to Zovirax, Wellcome's herpes and shingles treatment, have been halted in Japan following three deaths among patients. The development is a severe blow to Bristol-Myers Squibb, the US pharmaceuticals group which in 1989 acquired the global marketing rights for the drug, excluding Japan. Usevir, also known as Bvarau, was only launched on September 3. Industry analysts expect the medicine to be withdrawn completely from the Japanese market. The medicine has reached late-stage clinical trials in the US and is one of the most important compound drugs in Bristol-Myers Squibb's pipeline. The company believed the drug was capable of generating revenues of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) by the late 1990s. The group urgently needs new products because the US patents of the heart-drug Capoten, its top-selling medicine with revenues of Dollars 1.6bn, expire in 1995. The Japanese company with marketing rights to Usevir is Nippon Shoji, the Osaka-based pharmaceuticals wholesaling group. The rights were acquired from Yamasa Shoyu, a small Japanese company which invented Usevir. Nippon Shoji had hoped to gain a significant share of Japan's Y25bn (Pounds 156m) shingles market, currently dominated by Zovirax. The deaths in Japan are understood to have been caused by simultaneous use of Usevir with an anti-cancer agent called fluorouracil. The drug's packaging warns against use with certain anti-cancer agents. The Japanese Health and Welfare Ministry has ordered Nippon Shoji to dispatch emergency instructions to medical institutions warning against the use of the drug with fluorouracil, prescribing the drug to patients who have been treated for cancer, and prescribing the drug to patients taking medication which cannot be confirmed. Nippon Shoji has also sent staff to warn of the dangers of the side effects. Wellcome's Zovirax has been used for more than 10 years and has an excellent safety record.</p>

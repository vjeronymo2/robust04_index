			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A San Francisco Superior Court jury recommended that Robert Massie be put to  death for the 1979 murder of a liquor store clerk. The case attracted attention  because Massie was sentenced to death once before for a 1965 murder in the Los  Angeles area. His first death sentence was commuted in 1972 when the state  Supreme Court deemed capital punishment unconstitutional. He was on parole when  he murdered again in 1979. The high court reversed his conviction for that  crime and ordered the retrial that resulted in his latest death sentence. His  lawyer said he will ask that Judge Edward Stern sentence Massie to life without  parole.  </P></p>

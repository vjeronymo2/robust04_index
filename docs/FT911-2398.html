			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Propeller designs for successor to QE2 under test A SWEDISH subsidiary of Vickers, the UK engineering group, is testing propeller designs for a possible Cunard ocean liner that may become the successor to the 23-year-old QE2. Cunard Lines, owned by Trafalgar House, the UK conglomerate, yesterday described as 'entirely speculative' a newspaper report of a top-secret project, codenamed Q5, to design a liner to replace the QE2. It is known that KaMeWa, of Sweden, part of Vickers' marine engineering division, is studying propeller designs for a model of a Cunard liner. KaMeWa, acquired by Vickers in 1986, has one of the world's largest facilities for research into propulsion technology. Yesterday Trafalgar House said it was always looking at a variety of possible ways forward for Cunard, but otherwise had no comment on the report. The company said it would not speak about its fleet plans until the appropriate time. If the project were to go ahead, UK shipyards would face strong competition for the order from continental European yards that have specialised in cruise ships. It is understood that the liner would not be bigger than the QE2, in order that it could pass through the Panama Canal. The report, in the Sunday Express, quoted an estimate by industry experts that a new liner would cost Cunard Pounds 400m. Trafalgar House described the report as longer on imagination than hard fact. Industry sources are quoted saying the ship would become the Princess Diana - or, depending on how long the project takes, the Queen Diana. KaMeWa is the world's biggest manufacturer of controllable-pitch propellers. On this kind of propeller, the angle at which the blades rotate can be altered, changing the speed or direction of the ship, whereas conventional propellers are turned by a shaft of varying speed.</p>

When Supreme Court justices arrived for today's plenary  session, they declined to talk about salaries. But before the  session they held a meeting under the protection of guards. This  delayed the beginning of the session for almost an hour.    During the session, Galotti again read a note released on 21  March saying the Supreme Court rejects the crude and  unacceptable insults against the court and its members.    Galotti once again explained that salaries were converted to  the URV [Real Value Unit] on 20 March because judicial branch  members are paid their salaries on the 20th of each month.  According to him, this measure caused no salary increase and  served only to prevent losses from the conversion.    Galotti harshly criticized the government decision to cancel  the 10.9 percent adjustment of the salaries paid today.    Attorney General Aristides Junqueira, who is attending the  Supreme Court meetings, said after the session that the  conversion is a 10-percent problem that is jeopardizing  Brazilian institutions, and that this is unbelievable.    Junqueira added that the solution is to modify the law and,  to this end, representatives of the three branches of government  are negotiating.</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE AUTUMN OF A DICTATOR;  </P> <P> A CHILEAN DIARY BY ARIEL DORFMAN  </P> <P> ARIEL DORFMAN, ONE OF Latin America's best-known writers, was exiled from his  native Chile in December of 1973, a few months after a military coup ended  democracy there. After he had wandered with his family from Paris to Amsterdam  and then to Washington, D.C., the dictatorship allowed him to return in 1983.  During the ensuing years, whenever he visited his country, he invariably  approached the airport with a dread that turned out to be prophetic. Arriving  one day in 1987, he was arrested and deported with his young son, a punishment  for his human-rights campaign against the government. Although the deportation  order was rescinded some weeks later, Dorfman could never be sure thereafter  what fate might await him each time he went back. On March 10 of this year, he  again returned to the airport from which he had been exiled. But this time, he  was offered champagne, and his customs and immigration procedures were waived:  He was coming home as a guest of Chile's democratic president-elect, Patricio  Aylwin. This is the story of the days that followed, the story of a country  that, after years of repression, surprisingly returned to democracy.  </P> <P> Sunday, March 11, 1990  </P> <P> GEN. AUGUSTO PINOCHET has just made the last mistake of his long dictatorship.  On his way to hand the presidency of Chile over to opposition leader Patricio  Aylwin, the general has, incredibly, decided to ride in an open car, in full  uniform, for everyone to see, through the streets of his native Valparaiso.  Perhaps he thought that the people of his country would cheer him for this  peaceful transfer of power -- not a habitual gesture, after all, in tyrants.  But the thousands of Chileans who have filled the streets to celebrate the  return to democracy are not in a magnanimous mood. "Asesino! Asesino!" they  chant, "Murderer! Murderer!" -- a thunderous shout that the TV technicians  transmitting the ceremonies cannot filter out, which not even the military band  that begins to play the national anthem ahead of schedule manages to stifle.  Nor would the censoring of sound do any good. Because now Pinochet's bodyguards  are forced to hurriedly raise black umbrellas to stave off a downpour of  tomatoes, eggs and sticks thrown by the irate crowd.  </P> <P> It is not only this trip, the general's last ride as dictator of the country he  has ruled with an iron hand for 16 1/2 years, that is turning out differently  from the way he had expected. In his worst nightmares, he could never have  imagined that he would take this ride at all, that he would someday be forced  to give up power.  </P> <P> When, exactly 10 years ago, on March 11, 1980, he rammed his constitution down  the throats of a terrorized populace in a referendum that international  organizations and the Roman Catholic Church called clearly fraudulent, he  believed that he had created the mechanisms that would allow him to govern the  nation for the rest of his life. A plebiscite, scheduled for faraway 1988, in  which the people of Chile would be asked to say yes or no to his perpetuation  as president, seemed a mere formality. He was sure that the citizens were too  scared, the opposition parties too dispersed and fractious, his support in the  armed forces and middle class too massive for a victory to be seriously denied  to him. He was wrong. The people found courage, and in the intervening eight  years, an economic crisis shattered his middle-class support, the opposition  hammered out a difficult unity and important sectors of his own military told  him that they intended to respect the outcome of the popular vote. On Oct. 5,  1988, almost 55% of the voters rejected his claim to remain as president, and  on Dec. 14 of 1989, a larger majority elected Aylwin, a Christian Democrat, to  be Chile's first constitutional president since Socialist Salvador Allende died  in the bloody 1973 military coup.  </P> <P> So sure had the general been of his power that he had ordered an enormous hall  built for his inauguration, the new Congress of the Republic whose steps he is  now mounting in defeat. That building, which combines the pomp and grandiosity  of a Cecil B. De Mille Roman set with the bad taste of a Mussolini  architectural extravaganza, perversely expresses both the general's dreams of  eternal power and, now that those dreams have proven false, his capacity to  leave permanent scars on the face of this country. Worse than this monstrous  edifice is the deeper damage to the people of our land: the millions ravaged by  persecution, unemployment, detention, incessant fear; the thousands killed,  tortured, exiled. All too many of us bear the psychological wounds that terror  inflicts on both victim and abuser, the implacable consequences of years of  authoritarianism and humiliations to the moral fiber of a nation.  </P> <P> Aylwin inherits from Pinochet a deeply fractured country, split between the  very rich and the extremely poor, between the privileged military and the  outcast civilians, between those who want to forget the "unpleasantness and  excesses" (as they call them) of this period and those who feel that all the  atrocities must be remembered so they will never again be repeated.  </P> <P> But the very violence of the confrontation of the past 16 1/2 years has,  paradoxically, created in the whole of Chile, among haves and have-nots alike,  a nearly unanimous desire for unity and fraternization. "National  reconciliation" is the phrase on everybody's lips. I had only been in the  country since yesterday, but I could already sense that this is no passing  rhetorical fad.  </P> <P> THE NEW NATIONAL obsession of Chile is the abrazo.  </P> <P> Chileans have always loved to greet each other with a warm bear hug, but I have  never before known such a mania for hugging and being hugged as that which  welcomed me in the past 24 hours. It is not merely that everybody you encounter  -- whatever the class, whatever the political persuasion -- squeezes you  tightly and pummels your back with an unfamiliar intensity, but that the  language itself overflows with proclamations of the need for Chileans to reach  across barriers that separate them. Such a widespread and exaggerated panegyric  and practice of the embrace reveals, I believe, just how weary of war my  compatriots are and to what lengths they will go, after so many years of  confrontation, to heal the wounds of the past.  </P> <P> There are limits, however, to this conviviality.  </P> <P> Gen. Pinochet will get no abrazo today -- or ever, I suspect -- from his  adversaries.  </P> <P> From a colossal screening room in Santiago, I watch, along with many other  guests and a number of Chilean artists, as the general enters Parliament and is  greeted by dozens of new congressmen who show him photos of the "disappeared."  A friend of mine tells me later that the photographers themselves muttered  insults in his face as they snapped his picture.  </P> <P> At the podium, Pinochet is confronted by the irrefutable evidence of his  failure to modify forever, as was his intention, the soul of Chile. During 150  years of a history that had its share of massacres and disparities of wealth  and power, my country managed nevertheless to construct a strong and stable  democratic tradition in which differences were settled through negotiations and  by consensus. So much so that, with Allende in 1970, we became the first  country in the world to attempt the experiment known as the peaceful road to  socialism, trying to radically alter the country's chronically unfair social  and economic structure through democratic, electoral means.  </P> <P> This adherence to pluralism was so ingrained that when the military, backed by  the United States, rose against Allende, accusing him of putting the fatherland  in danger by fomenting confrontation instead of harmony, it did so precisely in  the name of democracy, even though Pinochet soon decided that it was the chaos  and disorder of democracy itself that was to blame for Allende's revolution  and, therefore, in dire need of total restructuring. Pinochet swore, shortly  after the coup, to "extirpate (politicians) like weeds," calling them rats,  traitors, thieves -- vowing that they would never return. But there on the  podium in front of him are Gabriel Valdes, a man he jailed, now president of  the Senate, and Jose Antonio Viera Gallo, a man he exiled for 10 years, head of  the House of Representatives. Worse still, they represent the two major  political parties, the Christian Democrats (Valdes was the foreign affairs  minister of the late Eduardo Frei, who governed from 1964 to 1970) and the  Socialists (Viera Gallo was Allende's undersecretary for justice), whose  feuding and bitter antagonism during the past 30 years opened the way,  according to many analysts, to a military intervention. The general had gambled  that they would never be able to overcome the antagonisms of the past. After  all, many Christian Democrats, including Aylwin himself, welcomed the coup  against Allende, and many of Aylwin's current left-wing ministers detested  Eduardo Frei's policies, proclaiming that they would deny him even salt and  water. That these rival parties, along with several smaller ones on the left  and the right, are now allies in a governing coalition is a stunning historical  achievement and may be proof that the Chilean elite has learned, in the hard  struggle to regain its freedom, something that everyday people always knew:  that what separates us is not as important as what joins us. They have  embraced, in fact -- but for Pinochet, now there is only a cold, distant  handshake.  </P> <P> Though it remains to be seen how this new experiment will turn out -- if  yesterday's enemies can be tomorrow's friends -- so far it has been successful:  If there had been no unity, there would be no President-elect Aylwin advancing  toward the podium.  </P> <P> The general must now take off his presidential sash, the symbol of his  authority. But it has become entangled and refuses to unbuckle. For three  eternal seconds, all Chile holds its breath. It is as if power were clinging to  Pinochet like a magnet. But now it's done, it's over, the sash is off and  pandemonium breaks loose. Pinochet watches morosely as Valdes solemnly swears  in Aylwin, and now, yes, it is true, the moment we have been awaiting for 6,026  days has finally arrived. Our country has returned to democratic rule.  </P> <P> For a while, Pinochet still hovers around. Then he turns stiffly and leaves --  still with no abrazo. The only presence that remains, like a curse, is the  heavy empty armchair that he occupied a few minutes earlier. As nobody comes to  cart it away, Viera Gallo boldly stands up and, amid widespread laughter, sits  down in the place of the man who banished him, supposedly forever.  </P> <P> It is as if a ghost had been chased away.  </P> <P> AND YET, OUR relief may be premature.  </P> <P> Pinochet has stepped out of the presidency and automatically into the post of  commander in chief of the army for another eight years. He will have at his  disposal an enormous contingent of troops paid for by a bloated, unmovable  budget and dozens of houses and mansions hastily transferred to the army during  the past few months, along with hundreds of cars and tons of furniture, tens of  thousands of security agents and their weapons, documents and property -- and  even his wife's multiple charity organizations, fully financed.  </P> <P> The road the Chilean people have taken from dictatorship to democracy has had  the advantage of being basically nonviolent; but it also has given the general  time to prepare, particularly in the year and a half since his loss in the  plebiscite, a parallel base of power, inside and outside the state, from which  to threaten our renascent, fragile democracy.  </P> <P> He has carefully infiltrated each institution with his cronies, who cannot by  law be dismissed: Not only are the army and the National Security Council at  his command but also the Supreme Court, part of the Senate (enough to stop  major constitutional revisions), most of the townships, as well as universities  and thousands of administrative posts -- even the chauffeurs of the new  ministers are rumored to be Pinochet agents.  </P> <P> During the years of Pinochet's rule, the opposition created islands of  resistance. It took over the surface of the country space by space; it defied  him and paid the terrible cost for that defiance, but it was that collective,  never-ending struggle of a whole community that finally weakened and cornered  the military regime. Now Pinochet intends to reverse the situation with his own  islands of obstructive power, tying Aylwin's hands so that he cannot solve the  country's problems, many of them exacerbated by Pinochet himself. And if this  leads to disorders, Pinochet has promised that he is ready, like the Roman  general Cincinnatus, to come out of retirement.  </P> <P> Just yesterday, when actress Maria Elena Duvauchelle had driven me from the  airport to the center of Santiago, we felt suddenly liberated by the  realization that this was real, that soon we would cease to be strangers in our  own land, that we would begin to have rights, that we were -- amazing that one  should even have to write the word -- persons. For Maria Elena, specifically,  it meant that she would never again receive death threats, as she had several  times since 1987, and that she would not be "protected" by a police major who  turned out to be a member of a death squad. For me, it meant that my exile was  really over. For every Chilean, democracy was not something abstract but the  opportunity to be treated with dignity, to be given back some control over our  bodies and our future.  </P> <P> Then three camouflaged army trucks spilling over with mattresses, furniture,  and lamps crossed our paths and shocked us back into reality. Here in front of  our eyes, Pinochet was stealing part of the country that our taxes had paid  for. Pinochet's booty, taken from government houses that tomorrow he would no  longer command, mocked us with the idea that the general may, after all, be no  more than loaning us a constrained country, already mounting in his imagination  those steps he built for himself when he thought he would reign among us  forever.  </P> <P> NOT EVERYBODY IN Chile, I find out, wants an abrazo.  </P> <P> With my eldest son, Rodrigo, a 23-year-old actor who returned to Chile just a  few months ago to spend some time here, I mingle with the enormous crowd that  awaits Aylwin's arrival from Valparaiso. The problem is that when the new  president finally appears, he passes in such a rush and with such a heavily  armed escort that it is as if we had not seen him at all. The crowd is in a  good mood, but I can sense its frustration: It is sad to wait this long, in  this 92-degree heat, and capture no more than the blur of an image shielded by  the same guards who only a few hours ago were defending the tyrant.  </P> <P> Half an hour later, incidents flare up. An enormous multitude has filled the  Alameda, and not far from where Rodrigo and I wait, fighting breaks out between  bands of adolescents and carabineros, the militarized national police. We can  see stones and sticks flying through the air, over the heads of the spectators,  and as we try to press away, an armored vehicle charges into the crowd, spewing  tear gas indiscriminately. Gagging, crying, our eyes and throats and skin  burning, we escape -- and end up several blocks away from where the incidents  continue.  </P> <P> Whether the disorders were provoked by extreme-left guerrilla activists, as the  police suggest, or right-wing provocateurs linked to Pinochet's secret police,  as other sources indicate, is for the moment irrelevant. What does matter is  that roving bands of adolescents, drunk or drugged, their faces covered with  bandannas, have joined in with gusto. To dismiss these actions as the work of  marginals is to forget that more than half of Chile's youth feel absolutely  left out, unemployed and disaffected. We sit and talk to some of them and find  them dazed, isolated, rebellious. Their hatred of the police is unlimited; they  had all -- every one of them -- been beaten and been in jail, and not one had a  job. These are the children of the dictatorship, its continuing legacy. Yes,  Aylwin is their president, but they are not so sure that democracy will mean a  difference, suspecting that they will be as excluded tomorrow as they have been  yesterday. That night, I mention these youths to a friend who is working with  the new minister of education and wonder whether cultural programs can be  developed in the shantytowns where they live.  </P> <P> My friend smiles. "We'll try," he says. "Except for one problem." He pauses.  "Pinochet left us 10,000 pesos ($35) in the budget item to spend on those  projects for the rest of 1990."  </P> <P> Monday, March 12  </P> <P> DURING THE 1973 COUP, Chile's new military leaders, finding themselves with an  excess of political prisoners on their hands, hit upon what they must have  considered an ingenious idea: Turn the National Stadium, our largest sports  arena, into a gigantic concentration camp. Then, a few months later, after  thousands of dissidents had been arrested and tortured, after hundreds had been  interrogated and executed, the authorities scrubbed the floors and painted the  benches, and reopened the coliseum to the public. The referees again blew their  whistles, the ball once again thudded across the field . . . and gradually  soccer fans began coming back.  </P> <P> I have always refused to do so. Before I could go back to the place where I had  watched so many sports events in democratic times, I desperately needed to  witness some sort of act that would transform it, that would reject its  purported normality as obscene and confront the terrible pain still echoing  there.  </P> <P> What I was waiting for, I now realize, was an act of exorcism. Because today,  under the majestic Andes mountains, the people of Chile performed that act.  Aylwin, by accepting this place as the site of his first official encounter  with Chile, by referring in his speech to the horrors that had happened here  and pledging that "nunca mas," never again, would they occur, helped us rid the  stadium of its demons. Far more significant than his words, however, was the  communal act of mourning that preceded them.  </P> <P> Seventy thousand people suddenly hushed as they heard a solitary pianist  playing, down on the green field, variations on a song by Victor Jara, the  celebrated protest singer murdered by the military a few days after the coup.  As the melody died, a group of women in black skirts and white blouses emerged,  carrying placards with photos of men whose kidnapings by the secret police have  never been acknowledged by Pinochet's government. These are the relatives of  the "desaparecidos," left in a particular form of hell, not knowing if their  loved ones are alive and being tortured, or dead and namelessly buried  somewhere.  </P> <P> That very morning, I had been to see these women, to find out their plans now  that there is a democratic government. After all, many people -- even among  Aylwin's allies -- feel that to normalize the country, it might be necessary to  start forgiving the crimes of the past and start living for the future. The  answer was calm and stubborn: Before the relatives forgive anybody, they first  have to know the truth about what happened to their men, and once that is  established, the criminals must be put on trial. When I press them, they admit  that this might be difficult to attain, given that the Aylwin coalition does  not have the votes in parliament to modify the amnesty that Pinochet offered to  his own agents. But as we talked, I sensed the deepest of their desires: that  the pain that the military regime had mocked should be publicly assumed and  acknowledged by the community.  </P> <P> Now on the field, one of the women -- a wife, a daughter, a mother -- begins to  dance a cueca, expressing all her immense solitude because she is dancing,  alone, a dance meant for a couple. There is a moment of shocked silence -- then  people start, slowly, clapping along with the music, a savage, tender beating  of palms that indicates that we are sharing this sorrow, that we are also  dancing with all our missing loves of history, all our dead, and that we have  brought them back somehow from the invisibility to which Pinochet has banished  them. And as if answering us from beyond time, the Symphonic Orchestra of Chile  bursts out with the chorale from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and the song of the  Chilean resistance, Schiller's ode to joy, his prophecy of a day "when all men  will once again be brothers."  </P> <P> I have never seen -- and never want to see again -- 70,000 people crying  together as they lay their dead to rest.  </P> <P> In the years to come, we will have to repeatedly liberate all the zones, one  after the other, that Pinochet invaded. That very night I visit La Moneda, the  presidential palace bombed by Pinochet, where Allende died -- a place I had not  visited since the day before the coup. And later I put on the television, where  I have not seen a friendly face for ages, and all of a sudden there appears a  journalist, banned for all these years, who can now gain entry to every home in  Chile. And the feeling of victory grows giddy: If we can reconquer so much of  the forbidden country, it is because we have resisted. The dictatorship tried  to isolate people from one another, to isolate the present from the past and  the future. It only wanted people to produce and consume and dream of nothing  else. Somehow we managed to reconnect Chile. That is why we won. Because we  kept the future alive, anticipating these moments when we would be able to  really cleanse Pinochet's shadow from the land that he never managed to totally  contaminate. We won because our love was fiercer than his hatred.  </P> <P> But if we never want to lose our country again, then celebratory acts of magic  are not enough. The poorest 20% of the population has decreased from consuming  7.6% of the national total in 1969 to 4.4% in 1989, whereas the consumption of  the richest 20% has increased from 44.5% to 54.6% in the same years. Pinochet  has increased a disparity that he did not, however, invent. How will the new  government deal with Chile's persistent poverty?  </P> <P> Tuesday, March 13  </P> <P> ALTHOUGH PINOCHET supporters feel uncomfortable when asked to address  human-rights issues, they tend to grow extremely vocal on the subject of  Chile's economic indicators. "The rest of Latin America is a disaster," a high  school chum who is now an impresario tells me. "Look at us: 10% growth last  year, a modernized export sector, gradual payment of the external debt, a  streamlined state, telephone and fax machines, a moderate inflation rate. As  long as the new government doesn't come along and screw it up . . ."  </P> <P> Aylwin's ministers have no intention of screwing it up, I discover as I hop  around Santiago today gathering opinions. Even the Socialists -- not a  surprise, given the worldwide trend -- do not feel they should tamper with a  market economy that is making Chile the envy of its chaotic neighbors. But they  dispute that it is anywhere near the "miracle" that the former government's  experts claim: Statistics show that Chile grew less (2.6%) between 1974 and  1989 than the rest of Latin America (2.8%).  </P> <P> Carlos Ominami is an old buddy from the days of my Parisian exile. He also  happens to be the new economy minister. "All commentators," he tells me, "focus  on the macroeconomic factors, but there's a second story: the devastating  social debt that has been incurred." He ticks off a series of anecdotes: Women  giving birth on the dirty floors of hospitals because all the beds are taken.  Slum dwellers waiting four or five hours in line for an aspirin. Dilapidated  schools. Overexploited workers with no social benefits or health coverage.  Rising suicide rates because of unemployment. "Aylwin's government is assigning  priority to the 48.6% of Chileans living below the poverty level, those who go  hungry every day. And we have to do so precisely when the economy is  dangerously overheated; when inflation has started to rise alarmingly. And we  have to do it with a budget that postpones social issues, with a state  apparatus that has been mutilated by Pinochet, and without the personnel  because the former government left thousands of its own technicians in key  posts. And we can't upset the entrepreneurs."  </P> <P> It sounds like a task that, if not impossible, is fraught with conflicts: to  satisfy the all-powerful social class that was the main beneficiary of  Pinochet's economic model, and at the same time attend to those who were its  victims and who are the primary source of the government's electoral support.  </P> <P> How is it to be done? Where is the money to come from?  </P> <P> Ominami's budget officer insists that the new government will not pay for the  social programs by printing money and with deficit spending. A law is being  prepared that would raise the taxes of wealthier Chileans -- presently at a low  15% to 20%rate. It is a solution the entrepreneurs will resist, according to  Roberto Fantuzzi, a major industrialist. A maverick himself, Fantuzzi believes  that it is time that some of the pain of the country should be felt by his  colleagues, but he doubts that they, "holding all the winning cards," will  cheerfully accept a lowering of profits.  </P> <P> So what happens if the entrepreneurs don't want to cooperate, if they are not  ready to reduce their consumption levels? What if there is no abrazo between  workers and owners?  </P> <P> I speak to several ministers in the next few hours and they all agree that  Aylwin's style is not confrontational. "Things could get rough," Alejandro  Foxley, minister of finance, admits, "but for now we've got them sitting down  at the same table -- and that hadn't happened in all these years." And if the  talks fail? Can the government simply impose the new legislation, including a  law that makes it easier for workers to organize and strike?  </P> <P> "Not really," says Rene Cortazar, the labor minister. The government may have a  large popular majority in the House, but in the Senate the balance of power is  held by nine senators designated by Pinochet. Each piece of legislation will  have to be negotiated, and although there are positive signs that right-wing  parties are willing to collaborate with Aylwin's administration -- Valdes,  after all, was elected president of the Senate with votes from several Pinochet  followers -- it means that some changes will simply have to wait.  </P> <P> The one change that cannot wait, everybody agrees, is the democratization of  the townships. Pinochet, in a much-needed reform, has decentralized power,  giving local communities responsibility for education, health and housing  projects -- but he has designated 310 of the 325 mayors for the next four  years.  </P> <P> One of the few mayors that Aylwin could name is Antonieta Saa in Conchali, a  sprawling impoverished suburb of half a million people on the northern  outskirts of Santiago. I am glad to see Antonieta, who happens to be my wife's  cousin, in such an important post. A feminist, she was one of the few women  given a job by Aylwin -- a situation that irks the many female activists who  were protagonists of the resistance against the dictatorship.  </P> <P> "They've unloaded all the problems at the local level, but not any money or  participatory channels to deal with the solutions," she says with a grin.  "Decentralization doesn't work," she adds, "if it is authoritarian. The former  mayor never once, in 10 years, met with the teachers or the hospital workers."  </P> <P> Fortunately, Antonieta is not waiting for the new legislation that will allow  the citizens of Conchali to elect their own authorities. She is bubbling with  projects. "We're going to use all the alternative non-governmental  organizations that dissidents created all these years in order to survive, that  made us self-reliant and independent from the state. If families discovered how  to cook together in soup kitchens, why can't they build together, organize ways  of buying materials, help each other now?"  </P> <P> And if the 20,000 families of Conchali sharing the crowded, squalid rooms of  their relatives cannot wait and begin to take over municipal lands and pressure  her to act, what will she do? "People have to understand that we can't solve in  one day the legacy of 16 1/2 years. One million new houses are needed, and we  can only build 40,000 in the whole country in 1990. I think people will be  patient if they themselves set the priorities, if they understand."  </P> <P> And what about education?  </P> <P> She is glad I asked. Off we rush to School No. 134 of Conchali, three large  wooden shacks nicely spruced up. The director tells me that last Friday, when  the former authorities heard that this locale had been selected for the signing  of the new government's first international agreement for foreign assistance,  they sent painters, carpenters and plumbers to clean it up -- the first such  visit since the school had been inaugurated many years ago. There is now a  flurry of activity. While a group of children who do not quite understand what  is going on watch and cheer and make jokes, Ricardo Lagos, minister of  education, signs with Sweden's vice-chancellor, Pierre Schorri, a protocol  establishing that $5 million will be donated to Chile's 900 poorest elementary  schools. The money will be channeled through the Fund for Solidarity that  Aylwin's administration has set up -- a direct-aid-to-the-poor sort of program  that is supposed to attract dozens of friendly foreign gifts.  </P> <P> Late that afternoon, I find myself holding a long and serious conversation in  Santiago's central plaza with a diminutive 10-year-old beggar girl, Jocelyn,  who happens, by an extraordinary coincidence, to be a resident of Conchali.  When I ask her how long she's been begging, she answers, "Since I was born. My  mama begged with me in her arms right away."  </P> <P> I ask her if she knows she has a new president, a new minister of education, a  new mayor?  </P> <P> She shakes her head quite emphatically, no, and happily licks away at the ice  cream I've bought her.  </P> <P> The distance between us could not be greater. The transition I have been  immersed in these days, that I have been working for during one-third of my  life, has totally passed her by. And yet, after all, this is more her  transition than mine. It will have been real, it will become something more  than an illusion, only if, six, or if she's lucky, 10 years from now, her own  baby does not start begging as soon as it comes out into the world.  </P> <P> Wednesday, March 14.  </P> <P> I AM TO leave in a few hours.  </P> <P> With Rodrigo, I go to the Vicaria de la Solidaridad, the Catholic Church's  human rights office, to buy some gifts for friends back home. I love the  arpilleras -- tapestries woven by women in the slums out of colorful bits and  pieces of material and through which, during the years, they have been telling  the stories of their everyday lives. The one thing that was rarely missing from  those arpilleras all this time was the military. No matter what the woven  characters were doing -- cooking, gathering wood, picking up pieces of  cardboard to be sold to factories, hooking up illegal wires to power lines to  heat their stoves in the winter -- the brooding presence of darkness, of  soldiers, of ghosts, inevitably erupted into the picture.  </P> <P> In the newest arpilleras, just finished, woven only yesterday, there is not one  military figure, not one army truck, not one stretch of barbed wire. Just  people working and people dancing.  </P> <P> The women have not depicted reality as it is but reality as they want it to be.  </P> <P> Will their dreams come true? Will Chile now be able to solve the problems that  has mired it and the rest of Latin America in poverty for all our history? Or  will the pressures from below, the accumulation of pain from the past, be so  vast that the military will come back once again like a nightmare to repress  the explosion of needs and desires that the present social system cannot  satisfy?  </P> <P> The answer may depend on the people of Chile, their patience, their passion,  their maturity.  </P> <P> On the Sunday of Aylwin's inauguration, I accepted an invitation to an early  morning Mass at a small church near one of Santiago's poorest shantytowns, La  Victoria. When the priest asked the congregation to tell their stories and  their hopes, many stood up. I remember two women above all. One addressed God  as if speaking to Aylwin. Or was it the other way around? "I don't want a raise  for myself," she prayed. "All I want, Lord, is bandages at the hospital where I  work, so I don't have to turn my patients away. Just give me enough so I can  take care of those who are in need."  </P> <P> Then another woman spoke of the Chile we were leaving. "It was a badly woven  cloth," she said, using imagery from her everyday life. "We got the stitches  wrong. But this time" -- and she paused and took a deep breath, "this time we  can't fail," she said fervently. "We have to sew this one right."  </P></p>

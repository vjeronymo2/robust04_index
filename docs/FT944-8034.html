			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Raising the birthrate - A Scottish initiative to increase the number of start-ups Many small and medium-sized businesses in Scotland now have a special advantage over their counterparts elsewhere in the UK: they are able to take out loans from their banks for up to seven years at a rate of interest guaranteed not to go up by more than 1 percentage point. The cost of the guarantee is borne not by the borrower but by Scottish Enterprise, the official development body, under a scheme developed with the four Scottish clearing banks, which had to overcome strong Treasury opposition. Scottish Enterprise reckons it will cost it Pounds 5m over the next two years to guarantee the Pounds 100m of loans which the banks are making available. The small business loans scheme, which is available to businesses employing up to 250 people in manufacturing, construction and business services, is a product of Scotland's Business Birthrate Initiative. The initiative, which was launched on November 1, is aimed at raising the rate at which new businesses are formed in Scotland, and at increasing the number that survive to become significant companies. It focuses on encouraging more people to start businesses, removing some of the financial impediments to launching and expanding a company, and eventually changing a national culture which accords a low status to the entrepreneur. It was started by Crawford Beveridge, a Scot who returned from a senior post at Sun Microsystems in California to run Scottish Enterprise. He was baffled by the contrast between the endeavour displayed by Scots outside Scotland and the apathy exhibited at home. Studies he commissioned showed that while Scotland's business birthrate between 1978 and 1990 was 77 new companies employing more than 50 people per 1m of population, the equivalent number for the West Midlands was 86; and for the south-east of England it was 116. Massachusetts in the US dwarfed them with 333. It was calculated that if Scotland's business birthrate since 1978 had matched that of the West Midlands an extra 70,000 jobs in independent businesses would have been created on top of the 125,000 people in Scotland already working in them. Yet the proportion of the Scottish population interested in creating new businesses was found to be around the UK average. People were apparently being held back by the difficulties in raising finance faced by businesses everywhere, but also by a pervasively anti-entrepreneurial environment. According to an opinion survey, people in Scotland rated entrepreneurs below manual workers such as plumbers and bus drivers on their list of admired professions. Scottish Enterprise decided that raising the business birthrate should not be a top-down affair. The strategy was thrashed out in seminars with businessmen, professional advisers, bankers, officials and journalists. This resulted in a document listing dozens of desirable schemes and objectives, but it was expected that the drive to implement most of them would come from others. That includes the local enterprise companies in the Scottish Enterprise network, some of which were already taking a lead in trying to encourage more entrepreneurship. For example, Dunbartonshire Enterprise, north of Glasgow, runs a training programme named Teamstart for professionals and middle managers interested in forming their own businesses. People in middle-class neighbourhoods are targeted by mail. About 30 people go on each two-month course and the aim is to produce between 10 and 12 businesses, eventually employing between 20 and 30 people, some of which could become significant companies. David Pearson, in charge of enterprise development, points out that Teamstart is separate from the government's enterprise allowance scheme which in Dunbartonshire results in the formation of about 400 single-person businesses a year. His start-ups include a nascent shipping line, an airline hoping to operate to London's City airport, software companies and a manufacturer of sub-sea vacuum cleaners. In Lanarkshire, which is wrestling with the problems caused by the closure of the Ravenscraig steelworks, an Entrepreneurial Exchange is being set up by a businessman helped by the Lanarkshire development agency. Established entrepreneurs will encourage aspiring businesspeople and give their time free to advise them. The chairman is Bill Fleming who founded and later sold the Smiley tyres and exhausts repair chain and is now one of Scotland's business angels - wealthy individuals who invest in new and expanding ventures. Scottish members of the UK angels organisation Linc (Local Investment Networking Company), last year invested Pounds 13m in new and expanding businesses. One manifestation of the birthrate initiative organised by the private sector is the business forum - evening sessions where businesspeople explain their projects to their peers and face questioning. The first forums have proved so popular that Russel Griggs of Scottish Enterprise calls them 'the only meetings in Scotland you can't get into'. So far no business idea expounded at the forum has metamorphosed into a trading company, but equity has been raised and contracts made. Alastair Balfour, managing director of Insider Publications, which has just launched a monthly magazine for new and growing businesses, believes about 300 different schemes are under way as a result of the birthrate initiative. He says it has touched a chord in the business community and stimulated co-operation between the public and private sectors. He cites as an example the small business loans scheme, dependent on links between Scottish Enterprise and the banks, which should soon be followed by a scheme to provide capital to projects too small for normal venture capital providers. The initiative's target is to raise Scotland's business birthrate to the UK average by 2000, which implies achieving a 50 per cent increase in the number of new businesses started every year and which would create 25,000 extra jobs. But it is too early to measure its success in producing start-ups, partly because no satisfactory way has been devised to measure them. As for changing the attitude to entrepreneurs of the average Scot, Pearson urges patience. 'We are seeing more favourable coverage in the Scottish media than we used to. There is a lot of enthusiasm around. But we are trying to make cultural shifts that will take 10 years.'</p>

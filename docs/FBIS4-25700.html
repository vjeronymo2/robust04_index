			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Xinjiang News" program] </F>   [Text] [video shows shots of Pan Zhaomin speaking from a  prepared script to several hundred people in military uniform at  an outdoor area] The Lanzhou Military Region [MR] called a  mobilization meeting on patriotic education at a Xinjiang  Military District [MD] engineering corps this morning.    Pan Zhaomin, deputy political commissar of the Lanzhou MR  and  political commissar of the Xinjiang MD, spoke at the meeting.  He said: We should thoroughly recognize patriotism's special  significance to army building. The ideas of patriotism,  collectivism, and socialism, as well as the spirit of dedication  to national defense and of self-improvement and self-reliance  should take root among cadres and fighters.    He said: We should further foster patriotism in the new  historical era, which calls for adhering to the party's basic  line to accelerate the pace of reform and opening up; establish  a socialist market economy; and build a strong, prosperous,  democratic, civilized, and modern socialist power. The great  cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics that we  have pursued is one of combining socialism with patriotism.  Upholding patriotism to safeguard the Chinese nation's  independence and dignity is the important foundation of  contemporary socialism, as well as the source of strength for  all Chinese people to struggle in unity.    He said: The purpose of patriotic education is to foster the  sentiments for frontier, barracks, and one's own work. We  should strive to perform meritorious services at our own posts.  We should be clearly aware that devoting ourselves to our own  work, doing a good job at our own posts, and endeavoring to make  contributions through our work are concrete manifestations of  patriotism. We should translate the idea of serving the country  with concrete actions.    He said: During several decades of defending and building up  the frontier, a large number of models and heroes working  assiduously and sacrificing selflessly for the motherland have  come to the fore. In light of the realities in the military  region and district, we should educate cadres and fighters with  the advanced deeds of both national and regional heroes and  models.</p>

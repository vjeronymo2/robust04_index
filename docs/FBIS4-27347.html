			<p>CSO     [Text] About 90 percent of listed firms are grappling with  global environment issues, but the contents center on dealing  with laws and regulations and saving energy that has a high  effect on investment. This situation was revealed in the survey  report "Current Status and Evaluation of Corporate Measures in  Global Environment Issues" announced on 12 May by the Science  and Technology Policy Research Institute of the Science and  Technology Agency.    The research institute implemented the survey targeting 500  listed firms, and obtained responses from 263 companies.    As the incentive for undertaking global environment issues,  98 percent of the firms cited "social responsibility," and 95.8  percent of firms are devising some environmental measures. A  trend was seen that the larger the firm, the more it was  aggressively undertaking it.    Viewing the content of the environmental measures, 89.3  percent of the firms are undertaking "environment-related"  measures such as environmental pollution and noise  countermeasures, and many are dealing with laws and regulations  or high effect on investment, such as 93.3 percent for  "resources-related" measures such as conservation. On the other  hand, only 9.5 percent of the firms were carrying out "ecosystem  maintenance-related" measures such as prevention of reckless  development.    As for problems of undertaking global environment issues,  91.7 percent cited high cost of new facilities investment and  the drop in production efficiency, and they are concerned about  a decline in competitiveness.    Moreover, as provision of social conditions, 87.8 percent of  the firms demanded preferential tax treatment or financial  subsidies from national or local public bodies. The firms that  sought approval to shift costs to the public or a review of  lifestyles exceeded 60 percent.    An table for overall evaluation of the handling of global  environment issues by firms is attached to the report. The  research institute distributed the report to about 500  companies, and is urging each firm to grasp objectively the  actual state of their own company's handling of environmental  issues and make a self-diagnosis using this evaluation table.</p>

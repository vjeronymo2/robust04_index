			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Motoring: Estates where expanse beats expense - A trio that blend executive-class comforts with bulk carrying capacity THE DAYS when you wanted a large estate car, could not afford a Mercedes-Benz 200/300 and had to settle for a Renault Savanna, Volvo 240/740/940, Vauxhall Carlton or nothing have long gone. Last year, Ford put right a major error of judgment and re-introduced a Granada (Scorpio) estate. Shortly before that, Citroen's XM had become the champion weight-lifter among large estate cars. Two more distinguished additions were the Audi 100 estate and BMW's 5-Series Touring (an estate car in all but name). Now, Mitsubishi's Australian-built Sigma; a face-lifted, American-made Toyota Camry; and a load-carrying version of Volvo's front-wheel driven 850 have swelled the ranks further. So, from a position of relative scarcity, the buyer or user-chooser seeking executive-class comforts and performance plus bulk carrying capacity is almost embarrassed for choice. You don't have to be an antique dealer, or need to transport things like straw bales, to appreciate the main advantage of a big estate car - the sheer ease of putting awkward things in it. I mean things like two golf bags attached to their trolleys; black labradors on bean bags; or folding two-seat pushchairs, travel cots, and all the clobber parents of young children (and sometimes their grandparents) have to lug around. Most of these (though not the dog) will go into saloon car boots singly, if not together. Even some of the least expensive models have big boots now and the cavern at the tail end of a Pounds 8,695 Seat Toledo (styled like a saloon but actually a hatchback) looks big enough to have an echo. The flat-silled Saab 9000 is another hatchback that almost rivals a big estate car for carrying capacity. But for sheer load space, plus ease of humping goods in and out, a proper estate car is unmatched. For very large objects, the best buys remain the two-litre Vauxhall Carlton (called the Opel Rekord on mainland Europe) at Pounds 14,830 and Volvo's 240 Torslanda, one of today's greatest bargains at Pounds 13,395. Neither of these practical work horses offers executive-class performance, though. For this, you must pay more. I have just sampled three big estates with three-litre engines - the Sigma, Camry and BMW 530i Touring. With air-conditioning and automatic transmission, they come in the Pounds 23,000-Pounds 35,000 price brackets. Any should satisfy business users accustomed to the highest levels of comfort, refinement and performance. The Sigma estate might lack some of the Sigma saloon's high-tech features - for one thing, the V6 engine driving the front wheels has two valves per cylinder, not four - but it delivers ample power (168 bhp), is almost silent and returned a shade over 22 mpg (12.8 l/100km). And suspension designed to cope with fast driving in the Australian outback gives a superlative ride on normal roads. As a motorway cruiser, the Sigma is on a par with a Jaguar. It handles competently, feels as solid as a German car of quality and is totally relaxing to drive. It is a pity, though, that the rear seat cushion does not swing forward. The back-rest sits on top of it when converting the Sigma into a freighter, so the load floor is not completely flat. And there is nothing to prevent a sharp-edged load from damaging the front seats should it slide forward under heavy braking. Toyota's three-litre, V6, front-wheel driven Camry saloon is as suave as the standard-setting Lexus LS400, only a bit smaller. But some of this refinement is lost in the estate version. The greater volume of the load-carrying body amplifies what little noise there is and, when running light, the stiffer suspension is less effective at smothering pot-holes and bumps. This apart, I found the Camry 3.0 V6 GX estate a rewarding car to drive. The more I put in it, the better it went. At Pounds 23,999, it is notably good value because a silky automatic transmission, ABS brakes, leather seats, air-conditioning, cruise control and two rear-facing seats for children are thrown in. As a bulk carrier, however, a potential snag is how the rear suspension covers intrude into the load space. The BMW 530 Touring is a jewel among estate cars. Its 218 horsepower, 32-valve V8 is of surpassing smoothness, spinning up to high revolutions like a turbine, yet pulling without jerks in fifth gear at less than 1,000 rpm. Although a roomy estate - its load floor (rear seat folded) is 6 ft 1 in (183 cm) long - it feels, sounds and rides exactly like a saloon. Predictably, it is expensive, with a key-in-hand price of around Pounds 32,000. This includes ABS brakes and self-levelling rear suspension but not a radio - BMW reckons customers prefer to choose their own. Extras on my test car included a traction control system (Pounds 1,250), driver's airbag and power-adjusted steering column (Pounds 905), and power-adjusted front sets (Pounds 970). Because the sun-roof had been deleted, air-conditioning added only Pounds 350 to the price - worth every penny, in my view. Fuel consumption is around 25 mpg (10.86 l/100km). Clutch and gear-shift are pleasantly light but I would happily pay Pounds 1,650 extra for the optional five-speed automatic transmission.</p>

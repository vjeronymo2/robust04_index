			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Lloyd's, and other troubles of the rich It takes a real effort of will for those of us not directly involved to discuss the Lloyd's crisis with the long Sunday face which ought to be appropriate. The spectacle of Conservative 'names' assiduously feeding information to Labour's City team, and thus helping to stir up a scandal which could lose some of them their seats as well as their investment, is really a sign of desperation and ought to be seen as tragic. It looks comic, though. Their complaints, which are basically that insiders have been profiting at the expense of outsiders, also have their unintentionally comic side. Financial markets are basically markets in knowledge, where those in the know have always prospered since the days when the Rothschild fortune was consolidated by early news of the victory at Waterloo - and attracted only rueful admiration. The one gain from the affair is that no-one will for a long time begrudge such names as stay the course their profits in the good years. In any case, it seems that there is a good deal of hindsight in the judgments now being offered: anyone who has avoided large loss is seen as suspect rather than competent. To be sure, nobody will believe any internal investigation which reaches this conclusion; Lloyd's self-regulation must now have a very limited life expectancy. The fact is that what made self-regulation work was self-interest. As long as the investors were grandees with large power and patronage, it was pure commonsense to cosset them. The democratisation of investment in Lloyd's will have very much the same effect as the breaking up of the old City club, in which the blackball was far more effective (and infinitely less expensive) than any fraud office or rule book could be. That is the inevitable price of progress - if you think it is progress. The government's effort to democratise equity investment will also make things steadily more cumbersome if it succeeds. The logical end of the road we are travelling will be an increasingly American system with a powerful regulator and, no doubt, a tangle of taxpayer-financed investor protection as a safety net. This does preserve confidence in the market; but as the Americans are discovering, it can involve very large additions to the national debt if vigilance is relaxed even for a few Reagan years. And it does not seem to achieve much else: the American system has not delivered the industrial efficiency promised, and it has not encouraged saving. It seems to be a game played for its own sake. The contrast with Japan, where savings and growth are a legend, but the bursting of the financial bubble has revealed scandals which make our own look like errors in etiquette, is striking. It is fashionable to sneer at academics like Colin Mayer of the City University Business School, who draw the obvious conclusion - that there is some contradiction between an obsession with highly liquid markets, and a need to finance massive fixed capital; but they may have the last laugh. Enterprise seems to work best where it is known to be a risky business, and probably a little risque too. Our own attempt to reduce risk to a footnote in small type ('The value of securities can go down as well as up') is really a hypocrisy. It leads to envy: if we fool ourselves that investment is safe, then large profits look suspect. Meanwhile the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington has declared war on another kind of insider - the executive with excessive hidden rewards. Since boardroom pay has become such an obsession on this side of the Atlantic, there is no need to go into the issues; again, it is the imbalance between reward and perceived risk that makes executive featherbedding rightly unpopular. The American solution, based on the idea of transparency, will no doubt prove moderately effective, and may well inspire calls for a similarly powerful regulatory body here; but it is surely tackling the problem from the wrong end. What would be good for enterprise is to increase the risk rather than reduce the reward: to outlaw long contracts of employment, and ensure that incentive schemes work so that pay, like share values, can go down as well as up. But this argument is a bit theoretical and can be challenged from experience: Japanese rules impose quite moderate pay in return for lifetime security. Symmetry is the thing. There is no symmetry, though, in the political effect. Recessions throw large rewards, whether from salaries or from the capital markets, into painful prominence, and encourage egalitarian protest. This is an important long cycle, according to a recent book by Andrew Tylecote*, who has examined all of the long cycle theories which people love to revive at times like these. He has concluded that there is nothing in most of them; but the inequality cycle - which provoked, among other incidents, the French and Russian revolutions - may be peaking again now. There is very probably rather less in this than meets the eye; but there is no question, surely, that rich is not only unfashionable at the moment, but likely to remain so for quite a long time. For that reason it is surely prudent to assume that even if President Bush manages to get re-elected, his successor is likely to be a Democrat; and equally that Mr Major may be the last in his line for some time. Meanwhile the real economic cycle moves on. In the US, something of a consumer-led recovery really is under way, as is shown not only in the house market, but now in the car market too. Sales are not only sharply up, at some 15 per cent above this time last year, but far ahead of expectations. This does not mean that happy days are here again; even the more optimistic projection for the US still show an anaemic recovery by past standards. A recovery, all the same. Not here, though. In the US interest rates are low, and both corporate and consumer debt has been reduced. Hence the upturn. None of these statements is true of the UK. * The Long Wave in the World Economy.

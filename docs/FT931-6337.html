			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Observer: One more talking shop Hands up anyone who hasn't yet formed a pro-manufacturing industry lobby group? After the lost years of the 1980s, during which British business apparently forgot how to make anything except Japanese cars, manufacturing is firmly back on top of the agenda. The CBI, finally bludgeoned into championing the makers of nuts and bolts after its love affair with the service sector, has its National Manufacturing Council, businessman David Turnbull has started the UK Industrial Group, and now an odd bunch of politicians is launching the Manufacturing and Construction Industries Alliance. It's the brainwave of maverick Tory MP Nicholas Winterton. He's got Robin Cook, the Labour industry spokesman, GMB boss John Edmonds, the Lord Mayor of London and a bevy of industrialists from Rolls-Royce downwards on his side. Indeed, the only weakness is Winterton himself. He doesn't have the ear of the PM, to put it politely, and he and his new chums can be rather full of themselves sometimes. Even so, the presence of veteran campaigner Des Wilson suggests that the new alliance will get heard. But why another organisation whose motto 'Making things happen' sounds no different from the CBI's 'Making it in Britain'? It seems Winterton had initially tried to cuddle up to the CBI without success. Nevertheless, all sides are being very polite and the CBI's Howard Davies has even sent a message of support.</p>

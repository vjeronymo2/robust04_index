			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Letter: Thurow view on US trade 'dangerous nonsense' Sir, When Lester C Thurow (Personal View, March 10) makes recommendations for US macroeconomic and trade policy, he writes dangerous nonsense. First, there is his statement that a 4 to 4.5 per cent rate of growth is an absolute necessity if President Clinton is to create growing job opportunities and rising real wages for the 80 per cent male workforce that did not participate in the economic gains of the 1970s and 1980s. We may anticipate, or at least hope for, a one or two-year period of cyclical recovery during which the growth rate of GDP is maintained at the 4.8 per cent level of the last quarter of 1992. It is a pipe-dream to believe that the US is capable of sustaining over an extended period of time an average annual rate of growth of 4 to 4.5 per cent. Over the period 1948-90 the average annual growth rate was just above 3.2 per cent. Even the growth rates achieved in the halcyon days of the 1950s (with an average annual growth rate of 4 per cent) and the 1960s (with an average annual growth rate of 4.1 per cent) were at the lower end of Mr Thurow's range. Furthermore, one of the consequences of the 12 wasted Reagan-Bush years has been a weakening of the supply side of the economy. While it should be possible to do somewhat better during the next 10 years than the average 2.6 per cent growth rate of the 1980s, it is dangerous to declare an obviously infeasible growth rate to be a necessary condition for real wage growth and expanding job opportunities for those who lost out during the 1980s. Desirable feasible policies are endangered that way. Much good can be achieved at a post-recovery average annual growth rate of 3 per cent. It all depends on the composition of the growth. Second, there is the statement that the US could expect a huge surge of imports if it were to succeed in growing much faster than the rest of the industrial world. This proposition need not be correct when the higher growth is supply-driven. (Japan managed to grow faster than the rest of the industrial world for decades without drowning in imports). Even when the higher growth is demand-driven, the proposition holds only if the source of the demand stimulus is expansionary fiscal policy or an exogenous boost to some other component of domestic final demand, not if it is expansionary monetary policy. Third, there is the statement that if one looks at the relationship between output and employment in American manufacturing, every Dollars 45bn in extra manufactured imports essentially costs the American economy 1m jobs. For nonsense statements like this (attributing one-way causality to a co-movement between two endogenous variables), undergraduates properly flunk their intermediate economics courses. What on earth is the counter-factual policy scenario that produces Dollars 45bn in lost imports and 1m extra jobs? Like Mr Thurow, I would like to see a co-ordinated fiscal and monetary expansion in the industrial world (my preference would be for monetary expansion in the US, Germany and Japan, fiscal contraction in the US and Germany and fiscal expansion in Japan). Unlike Mr Thurow, I do not favour 'direct action' by President Clinton if such co-ordinated action cannot be arranged promptly. Surely 'direct action', taking 'whatever actions are necessary' and 'decoupling the locomotive from the rest of the world's economic train' are code-words for protectionism, import controls etc. What America and the rest of the world do not need is a trade war, motivated by screwball economic analysis and a defensive, little-America outlook. The Japanese are good enough to produce large and rising trade surpluses. Some part of the industrial world ought to be doing so, if the urgently needed net resource transfers to the developing countries, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are to materialise. It is of course desirable for the Japanese to abandon their protectionist practices, in order that their trade (imports and exports) may expand, without, however, endangering the desirable Japanese external surplus. I fervently hope no one in a position of policy responsibility is listening to Mr Thurow.

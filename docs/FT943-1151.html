			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Europe's most frequent and hardest-working trippers The Belgians make more business trips than anyone else in Europe. The Greeks make the fewest and, when they do travel, they work the shortest hours when they arrive at their destination. These are some of the findings of a survey conducted by Visa International, the payments organisation. Visa surveyed more than 2,000 travelling readers of Executive Travel and International Management magazines in 10 countries. The Belgians who responded had made an average of 19.6 business trips in the past 12 months. The second most active travellers were the Dutch, who had made 16.7. The British were in third place, with 15.1 trips. At the other end of the scale, the Greeks had made only 7.4 trips over the past 12 months. The Norwegians were the second least active, with 10 trips. The majority of travellers in the 10 countries - 54 per cent - said they were now making the same number of business trips as in the previous 12 months. About 27 per cent said they were making more trips, while 19 per cent said they were taking fewer. Most of the travellers who were making more trips said the main reason was that their companies' performance had improved. While the Germans were not the most frequent travellers, making 15 trips in 12 months, they claimed to work the longest hours when they reached their destination. On average, German business travellers said they worked 11.6 hours a day. The second most industrious business travellers were the Dutch and the British, who both said they worked an average of 11.4 hours a day. The French worked 11.2 hours a day. Many travellers from the four hardest-working countries said they put in even longer hours. Twenty per cent of the British, 24 per cent of the Dutch and French and 25 per cent of the Germans worked more than 14 hours a day. The most relaxed business travellers were the Greeks, who worked an average of 9.9 hours a day when they were on business trips. They were followed by the Spanish, who worked 10.3 hours.</p>

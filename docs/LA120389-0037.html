			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NORVILLE AFFAIR  </P> <P> Regarding the Nov. 26 article on Deborah Norville taking over Jane Pauley's job  on the "Today" show:  </P> <P> I stopped watching ABC's "Good Morning America" in protest when I heard Sandy  Hill's exit was engineered by chauvinist paranoia.  </P> <P> I stopped watching CBS' "Morning News" in protest when they dumped Maria  Shriver, Forest Sawyer and Mariette Hartley.  </P> <P> I am going to stop watching NBC's "Today" show in protest against the  obtuseness of the network executives responsible for the resignation of Pauley  and because there's no visible substitute for Jane's warmth and  professionalism.  </P> <P> WANTED, by yearning, caring, potentially loyal viewer: Single strong network  with charm, perception and the self-confidence to keep terrific people in place  because, as the greatest sirens knew instinctively, it's far more seductive to  hold still and let them come to you.  </P> <P> You can't build a long-term relationship on a series of one-night stands.  </P> <P> LAURA HITCHCOCK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

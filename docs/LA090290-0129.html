			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SPRAY-CAN VIGILANTE  </P> <P> Graffiti artists wielding spray-paint cans can be the scourge of a neighborhood  and vigilantes considered dangerous to a well-ordered society. But there exists  a combination of both in the Mt.  </P> <P> Helix area worthy of some commendation. I refer to the lovable scoundrels who  consistently obscure with spray-paint the small advertising billboards  periodically erected along roads like Fuerte Drive by subdivision promoters.  </P> <P> Mt. Helix is a uniquely beautiful area heavily wooded with magnificent trees,  flowering shrubs and colorful hillsides. The homes that dot the slopes, from  mansions to cottages, complement the natural beauty with caring maintenance and  lush landscaping.  </P> <P> What could be more of an affront to the residents than erection of commercial  billboards along their winding, tree-shaded suburban roads? The eyesores don't  stay for long, of course; after a few nightly spray-paint jobs, the advertisers  give up and pull them down.  </P> <P> As a law-abiding citizen, I certainly can't condone the work of spray-can  vigilantes . . . but anyway, thanks, guys!  </P> <P> RAYMOND E. PONATH  </P> <P> La Mesa  </P></p>

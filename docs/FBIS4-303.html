			<p>BFN     [Text] Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] Chairman  Justice Johann Kriegler says the election will go ahead as  planned in kwaZulu. Interviewed in Johannesburg today, he said  the political climate and not the election date should be  changed, and ANC President Nelson Mandela has supported this  saying he won't agree to a postponement of the election as this  would effectively be a postponement of freedom. Yesterday, a  joint IEC-kwaZulu and South African Government working committee  said an election couldn't be held in kwaZulu-Natal in the  current political climate.    [Begin recording] [Kriegler] I think it would be  irresponsible for the IEC to give a message to spoilers that if  they make enough of a nuisance of themselves the election will  be postponed. We don't say that. We don't believe that. The  election will carry on. The few spoilers are not going to  frustrate the vast majority who wish to vote.    [Unidentified correspondent] Amid speculation that a  postponement of the election was possible, Mr. Mandela was  adamant that he opposed such a move.    [Mandela] There will be no postponement of the election.  [applause]    [Correspondent] On the possible postponement of regional  election in Natal-kwaZulu he kept the same strong stance. Later  at a news conference Mr. Mandela said the IEC report stated that  a final decision was still in the hands of political leaders.  He said Friday's summit meeting for him was an opportunity to  discuss the position of King Goodwill Zwelithini.    [Mandela] The main purpose is to see how I can address his  concerns and to allay his feeling that his position is  threatened by the government of national unity.    [Correspondent] Mr. Mandela said he believed the ongoing  violence in the province might be reduced if an agreement could  be reached with King Goodwill. On the subject of the security  forces he said it was unrealistic to expect them to control the  violence overnight. Mr. Mandela left for discussions with ANC  regional leaders. [end recording]</p>

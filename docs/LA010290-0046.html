			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTLOOK FOR THE '90S;  </P> <P> FOR BUSINESS, THE 1980S WERE A PERIOD OF ENORMOUS TURMOIL. A JAPANESE SIEGE OF  THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY AND AUTO INDUSTRIES, A SURGE AND PLUNGE IN OIL PRICES,  MASSIVE FAILURES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND A FEARSOME STOCK CRASH. THE  1990S DON'T PROMISE MUCH PEACE AND QUIET. HERE'S A LOOK AT WHAT BUSINESS FACES  IN THE NEXT DECADE.;  </P> <P> SECURITIES  </P> <P> The 1990s will realize some of Wall Street's brightest hopes and darkest fears.  </P> <P> The decade will bring a much closer integration of world capital markets, a  development that will sharply increase demand for brokerage and underwriting  services. But with the new integration will come booming competition from  abroad and home, shaving profits in some areas razor thin.  </P> <P> Wall Street firms were preparing for this new reality in the 1980s. Many sought  to bolster their financial resources by merging or forming alliances with  wealthy outsiders. Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. was purchased by General Electric,  for example, while Paine Webber sold an 18% stake to Yasuda Mutual Life  Insurance, and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. sold a 12.5% stake to Sumitomo Bank.  </P> <P> The need for capital was partly due to the threat of increased competition from  commercial banks, which were barred from the securities business for half a  century by the Glass-Steagall Act. With deregulation, the act has been slowly  unwound. And the one remaining barrier -- which prevents commercial banks from  underwriting stock issues -- eventually may be swept away as well.  </P> <P> Because of the tough new competitive climate, analysts expect Wall Street's big  full-service firms to be forced to become much more nimble in the 1990s,  jumping quickly into new ventures and out of them just as quickly if they don't  pay off. This means that the big firms' payrolls will rise and fall swiftly.  </P> <P> Merger advice, which has provided up to 40% of some big investment banks'  earnings in this decade, will probably earn them less over the next several  years if a recession materializes. Further out, however, integration of the  world economy will set off a new round of corporate mergers. There may also be  big moneymaking opportunities as the U.S. firms that have taken on so much debt  in the 1990s issue new stock, sell assets or take other steps to strengthen  their financial positions.  </P> <P> For the regional stock brokerages that sell investments to individuals, life in  the 1990s may change much less. Their best customers, Americans over 50 years  old, will grow sharply in number and will still be willing to pay well for  financial services. PAUL RICHTER  </P></p>

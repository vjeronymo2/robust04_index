			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / People: Sandy Russell promoted Sandy Russell has been appointed a deputy chairman of Customs and Excise. The post, one of two deputies, is currently filled by Valerie Strachan who succeeds Sir Brian Unwin as chairman in March. Russell, 54, joined customs eight years ago as director, organisation, before taking over as director, customs in 1990. The directorship came at a time when customs was undergoing some of the most radical changes in its 322-year history to pave the way for the single European market. Russell was responsible for reforming the customs controls at ports and airports. The work involved moving revenue-collecting posts inland and changing the role of investigation and detection from a barrier-like approach to that of an intelligence-led service. 'It ought to be fairly evident that our whole concentration has been on major prohibitions rather than the odd bottle of hooch. Our effort isn't directed towards finding minor revenue evasion,' he said of his task. Before joining customs, Russell was responsible for pioneering the government's financial management initiative at the Management and Personnel Office and earlier had held senior posts in the Scottish Office. He will retain control of the customs group in addition to becoming director general internal taxation in his new position.</p>

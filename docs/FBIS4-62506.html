			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 17 May -- "Russia is losing Uzbekistan's  market," Uzbek President Islam Karimov warned in an interview  with ITAR-TASS today. The president arrived for a four-day  visit to Japan on 16 May.    "It appears that Moscow does not realize that Russia could  be  squeezed out of Uzbekistan as a result of intensifying  international competition for the emergent market in our  republic," the president said. "Furthermore, we are eager to  win foreign investment in order to develop our economy and to  establish close ties with foreign enterprises and attract them  to our market." Islam Karimov stressed that Uzbekistan wanted  "to retain former links with Russia, but on a new basis."    The president of Uzbekistan called for the establishment of  Russo-Uzbek joint ventures based on close ties between  industrial enterprises in the two countries dating from the  Soviet period. "We are establishing joint ventures with firms in  various foreign countries. There are now about 1,500 joint  ventures in our republic, but there is not one Russo-Uzbek  company," the president noted. He pointed out that Russian  President Boris Yeltsin also fully agreed that the two republics  should set up joint ventures.    Islam Karimov stressed that "the peoples of Russia and  Uzbekistan are bound by close spiritual ties." "The Russian  people have always stood beside us during those times in our  history when things were very difficult for us, and we do not  forget this," the president said.</p>

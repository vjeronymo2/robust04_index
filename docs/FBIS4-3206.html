			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- In the first three  months of this year, China's economy has grown at a rate of 9 to  10 percent.    Ye Zhen, spokesman for the State Statistics Bureau, giving  this figure today, said that basically the economy had reached  the expected goal of the government's macro control efforts.    Ye said at a press conference that in the first quarter the  gross domestic product was 862 billion yuan, up 12.7 percent, in  terms of constant prices, on the same period last year.    But the proportion of agriculture was usually fairly low in  the first quarter, while that of industry was comparatively  high. If this seasonal factor is taken into consideration, the  present growth rate of the economy should be 9 to 10 percent.    He said that the comprehensive appraisal of the country's  economy has shifted from the juncture of "red light" and "yellow  light" to the present juncture of "yellow light" and "green  light" -- meaning that the economy has cooled down to a proper  condition.    The speeds of production, construction and sales, which had  been increasing too fast, have begun to fall to some extent.    In the first quarter, the industrial increased value is 533  billion yuan, an increase of 16 percent over the same period  last year, with light industry increasing faster than heavy  industry. Energy production increased steadily, and the coastal  areas increased faster than inland areas.    Due to the slowing down of industrial production, the  strained conditions of energy and raw materials supplies, as  well as the "bottle-necks" in transport, have been alleviated to  different degrees, Ye said.    He said that state-owned enterprises completed investments  of  81.5 billion yuan in fixed assets in the first quarter, up 36.2  percent over the same period last year, but it is 34.5 percent  lower than the growth rate of the same period last year.    By the end of March, the total volume of retail sales of  social consumption goods was 352.2 billion yuan, up 25.2 percent  on the same period last year. With the factor of price rises  considered, the actual increase was 4.2 percent.    He said that in the present market, about 90 percent of the  goods were enjoying balanced supply and demand, except some  agricultural produce and by-products which are in short-supply.    With the country's economic development and the processing  of  wage reform in administrative departments and institutions, the  income and living conditions of urban and rural residents have  been constantly improved.    In the first quarter, the per capita monthly income for  urban  residents increased 35.5 percent over the same period last year,  while the cash income of rural residents increased 31.1 percent.  With the factor of price increases considered, the actual rises  were 9.3 percent and 13.1 percent, respectively.    Ye said that at the moment there was no centralized,  large-scale "hot spot" for consumption. As a result, many  residents have been using their spare money to buy stocks, bonds  or simply put it in the bank.</p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Letter: Germany sets a competitive example Sir, In the debate discussed in your article, 'Japanese cars and the EC' (May 2), which is really a debate over what trade barriers EC politicians will erect to prevent EC consumers from being able to exercise choice, too little attention has been paid to the fact that, in 1990, Germany, for the first time in over two decades, achieved a surplus in its car trade with Japan. German cars to the value of Y593bn were imported by Japan, and Japanese cars valued at Y518bn were exported to Germany. (Had exchange rates not moved in Germany's favour in 1990, the bilateral trade would have been in balance). This was achieved despite Germany being the only one of the five large European car markets not to operate a quota system for Japanese imports. The obvious moral is that commercial success is most likely where there is full exposure to competition, and where products are manufactured which can successfully be sold abroad, rather than where internal wrangling over quota extensions prevents rapid adaptation to best industrial standards. At the FT London motor conference in March, Professor Daniel Jones, inter alia European research director of MIT's global motor vehicle programme, succinctly suggested that France and Italy would pay dearly for not letting Japanese manufacturers into their countries.

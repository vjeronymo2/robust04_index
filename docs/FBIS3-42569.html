			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Lukin, Russian ambassador to the </F> United States, by Denis Molchanov; place and date not given:  "Fate Leads Those Who Agree With It, and Drags Along Those Who  Do Not: Russia's Ambassador to the United States Vladimir Lukin  Appraises the Results of President Bill Clinton's Visit to  Moscow"]    [Text] [Molchanov] Vladimir Petrovich, do you agree that  for the first time in a long while a Russian-American summit did  not result in us giving up positions in some or other area of  national interests?    [Lukin] I would appraise this visit as a success. And its  results as normal, predictable, and even inevitable.    Of the entire package of documents signed, I would single  out  first and foremost the trilateral agreement on nuclear arms in  Ukraine. Even taking into consideration the difficult political  situation in that country, I think that President Kravchuk's  actions will be met with understanding on the part of both the  Ukrainian people and its parliament. So I believe that the  agreement will be ratified by Kiev. As a last resort, history  knows some instances when documents signed by presidents but  never ratified by a legislative body of that country still were  observed (for instance, the SALT treaty proposed by Jimmy Carter  but rejected by the U.S. Congress).    Another important event is the agreement on uranium. The  American bureaucracy is one of the most talented in the world,  and the fact that this agreement was pushed through is an  unquestionable success of our diplomacy. In other words, the  American market is being gradually opened for us, too.    Another one--the Moscow Declaration. A statement aimed at a  mature partnership without illusions. Practically for the first  time we are saying that we can cooperate as equals in areas of  mutual interest.    [Molchanov] Does this mean that Russia finally has shed the  demeaning image of "Mr. Yes" it has acquired over the past few  years?    [Lukin] I would even say that this was a "Mrs. Yes" image.  In  our desire to follow other people's advice, we went too far.  Today there is an indication of a return to the normal practice  of international relations. Some call it the "old mentality,"  some--"new thinking..." I believe that there can only be right  and wrong thinking.    The right thinking now is letting our neighbors that Russia  is an elephant, not a yapping lapdog, and it should not be  barked at as some do. Difficult times happen in the history of  any country, when it suddenly finds itself at a crossroads. Our  choice is a democratic civilized society, ready for full-fledged  cooperation with its partners on an equal footing. Yes, we do  have problems, but Russia is a great power, and it will resolve  them.    President Clinton showed sensitivity and tact in his grasp  of  our problems. And this is another important result of his visit.</p>

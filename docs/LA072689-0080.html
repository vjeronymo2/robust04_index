			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY JAIL ESCAPEE CAPTURED AT MALL  </P> <P> A Los Angeles County Jail escapee was captured at Fox Hills shopping mall in  Culver City Tuesday after he was recognized by a jewelry store employee,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Keith Williams, 28, was taken into custody shortly after noon by Culver City  police officers, who were called to the jewelry store by a security guard,  sheriff's deputies said. Police said Williams was carrying a knife when he was  arrested.  </P> <P> Williams had been awaiting trial for armed robbery when he made his weekend  breakout from the Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles by using a rope of  bedsheets. His escape was discovered about 7:30 a.m. Sunday by deputies who  found a rope fashioned from bedsheets tied to a rail and dropping about three  stories to the ground.  </P> <P> The jewelry store employee recognized Williams from news reports. But the  suspect didn't realize he had been recognized, giving the employee time to call  police, investigators said.  </P> <P> Williams' bail, previously set at $25,000, was revoked when he was again booked  into County Jail on suspicion of escape.  </P></p>

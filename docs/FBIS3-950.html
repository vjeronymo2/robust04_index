Our special  correspondent, Guy-Bertrand Mapangou, is on line. Guy Bertrand,  what are the main resolutions?    [Mapangou] The curtains have just been drawn at the 15  January Palace here in Ndjamena on the 29th summit of UDEAC  heads of state. The major outcome of the meeting was the signing  by the heads of state of the act establishing the Central  African Economic and Monetary Community [CEMAC] similar to the  West African Economic and Monetary Union [UEMOA].    A new act has just been enacted in the subregion, a new  forum  for reflection and a new economic framework. UDEAC heads of  state are determined to transform their monetary zone into a  veritable monetary and economic union. France, [words  indistinct], CEMAC, and UEMOA have big integration projects  concerning for instance insurance, provident fund, business  management rights, the creation of regional centers for economic  training, [words indistinct] and economic studies.    Concerning the conventions of the monetary and economic  union  which were not finalized, the heads of state have decided to set  up a committee of plenipotentiaries consisting of ministers of  economy, finance, external relations, and justice, as well as  the governor of the Bank of Central African States, and the  UDEAC secretary general. This committee is expected to finalize  these conventions before the next UDEAC summit slated for  Yaounde in December under the chairmanship of President Paul  Biya.    The council of heads of states also decided to convene a  meeting of the CEMAC and donors to study the means of mitigating  the negative effects of the devaluation in the countries of the  subregion. An act approving the restructuring of UDEAC was  signed by the heads of state. Gabon is expected to apply for  the post of deputy UDEAC secretary general which was declared  vacant during the summit. Other decisions were also made  especially in the air, land, and river transport sectors. The  heads of state decided to reactivate these sectors by reopening  the river route between Bangui and Brazzaville. The European  Union has granted 7 billion CFA francs for the reconstitution of  this waterway.</p>

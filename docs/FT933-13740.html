			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Letter: Pensions 'cap' hits mid-career moves Sir, I was surprised at the stance taken by Barry Riley in his article, 'The Long View' (July 10), about the 'pensions cap'. Although I agree entirely with his advocacy for clearer government thinking on pensions (or, indeed, on anything), his proposals for the sacrifice of the pensions of the rich on the altar of egalitarianism would seem more suitable for Fabian Society pamphlets. That is ignoring the fact that that the society is now publishing right-wing leaflets from a socialist member of Parliament (Labour MP (Frank) 'Field calls for pensions switch', July 12) I believe that the government has pitched its 'pensions cap' at the right level of Pounds 75,000, always assuming that it has to have a cap at all and provided this level is reviewed in April each year as originally promised. A problem, however, which companies are now facing as a result of the 'cap' is how to attract executives to join them in mid- or late-career without damaging their pension prospects. The case of Sir Anthony Tennant, which is quoted by Barry Riley, is an interesting example of the recruitment of a chief executive towards the end of his career who at that time could be persuaded to make a late career move when Guinness was clearly in need of his services. Given a similar need today it would be probable that the right person could not be persuaded to move because of the penalty in lost pensions expectations as a result of the 'cap'. One solution to help mid-career moves, which I advocate, would be to revert to the pre-1987 practice of permitting the accrual of a maximum pension over 10 years instead of the 20-year period now required, albeit of 'capped' salary. It would not happen very often, because companies would have to pay for it. But given the higher incidence of preserved pension from earlier employment the costs might not be overwhelming.

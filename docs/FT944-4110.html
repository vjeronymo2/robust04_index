			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Cost cuts at Lufthansa paying off Lufthansa, the German airline, is on course to post a parent-company pre-tax profit for the fourth quarter and resume paying dividends for the full year, AP-DJ reports from Frankfurt. It also said it was taking a stake in a Frankfurt-based travel company. The airline confirmed parent-company nine-month pre-tax profit of DM325m (Dollars 207m). Lufthansa does not publish group figures on a quarterly basis. In November, it predicted it would post a profit for the full year and resume the payout. The airline said a report given by Mr Jurgen Weber, management board chairman, at the final meeting of its supervisory board showed that Lufthansa's cost-cutting measures, begun 10 months ago, had continued to be successful. It also said it planned to take a 25 per cent stake in Alpha Holding tourism company, as well as an option to buy a further 5 per cent. The move is aimed at strengthening the tourism business of Lufthansa's Condor charter unit. Alpha Holding includes the wholly-owned unit Air Marin Flugreisen, which organises trips. Alpha Reisebueros, the travel bureau chain, also belongs to the holding group.</p>

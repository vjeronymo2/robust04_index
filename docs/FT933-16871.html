			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Pittards shares fall on profit warning Shares in Pittards tumbled from 71p to 60p yesterday after the leather company warned that difficult trading conditions meant that profits for the first half of 1993 would not be at the level that it had hoped. In March, Pittards said higher sheepskin prices had meant a 16 per cent drop in 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.76m. The first-half figure had been 22 per cent higher at Pounds 1.27m.</p>

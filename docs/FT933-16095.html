			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Australian broadcaster backs 'Producer Choice' THE BBC director-general Mr John Birt has been advised by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to persevere with its controversial Producer Choice policy. Mr David Hill, managing director of the ABC, told Mr Birt in a meeting in London last week that a similar scheme introduced four years ago at his broadcasting organisation had been 'a dramatic and remarkable success'. Producer Choice, launched at the BBC in April, provides for the full costing of all programmes for the first time and gives producers the right to buy in services from the outside market. The Australian version - largely modelled on the BBC - is called User Pays and, like Producer Choice, involves total programme costing. In the past both ABC and BBC producer budgets have accounted for a small proportion of total costs and resources - such as studios and editing time - and were simply givens. Mr Hill said that since the start of User Pays four years ago there had been a 20 per cent increase in productivity at the ABC. The number of staff had also fallen from 6,500 to 5,500. In 1989-90, Mr Hill pointed out, the total number of resource hours used to produce ABC programmes was 2.3m. In 1992-3 the total was 1.8m, yet in the same time the number of hours transmitted increased by 6 per cent. Since 1989-90 the average cost per hour of ABC television has come down from ADollars 32,424 to Dollars 29,550. 'In Australia User Pays was portrayed as the end of civilisation,' said Mr Hill. In fact, he emphasised, the money saved was ploughed into more Australian-made programmes which helped the public service to fight back against its commercial rivals. Mr Hill pointed out, however, that the Australian scheme was phased in more gradually and producers had to get permission before buying in services from outside.</p>

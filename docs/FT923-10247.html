			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (7): A truly global competitor - Profile, Asea Brown Boveri ASEA of Sweden and Brown Boveri of Switzerland kicked off the late 1980s round of concentration in the world power plant industry by merging in 1988 to form ABB Asea Brown Boveri. The Swedish-Swiss group then made another big step in 1989, taking over Combustion Engineering in the US. The effect, says Mr Goran Lundberg, executive vice president in charge of power plants, has been to transform the new group from a mainly European force to a truly global supplier that is the clear runner up to General Electric of the US with sales last year totalling Dollars 5.7bn. Mr Lundberg says that orders last year were roughly equally split among Asian, European and American customers. The power plant business is ABB's largest division, and accounted for about a fifth of the group's overall sales of Dollars 28.9bn last year. The division has grown especially quickly in the past year. In the six months to April, it took in Dollars 5bn in orders compared with Dollars 6.4bn in the whole of 1991 and only Dollars 2.8bn in 1988. It has admittedly been operating in a strong market during most of this period. Mr Lundberg estimates that the total world market has grown from about 30 gigawatts (1 gigawatt equals 1,000 megawatts) in 1988 to a likely 45 to 50 gigawatts this year. He believes rationalisation is still the order of the day. In the mid 1980s, there were 10 steam turbine makers in Europe with capacity to supply 120 gigawatts of new equipment per year. Now only five suppliers remain and Mr Lundberg estimates that capacity, including eastern European suppliers, is down to about 90 gigawatts. 'We still have some things to do,' he says. ABB itself still has a bewildering array of factories in Switzerland, Germany, Sweden, Norway,the US and Poland. ABB is almost a full line supplier. It has two nuclear technologies, one inherited from its Swedish subsidiary (the boiling water reactor or BWR) and the other acquired with Combustion Engineering in 1989. CE is one of the US PWR technology holders. The group also makes coal and gas fired plants, hydro plants, boilers, steam turbines and heavy duty gas turbines. The one technology it lacks is the currently popular aero engine-derived gas turbine, used frequently in combined heat and power generating plants. Mr Lundberg does not seem worried about this gap, claiming that the aero-engine derived market is 'very small', accounting for only about 4 per cent of the total market. ABB's strategy has three main components. The group tries to match its products to customer needs. It invests heavily on innovative environmental control systems for its plants and it tries to do its part to contribute to the much needed rationalisation of the industry. Mr Lundberg says the shape of the industry is changing rapidly. 'In the mid 1980s, everyone was a regional actor. Today, the survivors are working in the global market.' He believes the four largest groups - General Electric and Westinghouse of the US, Siemens of Germany and ABB - will gradually pull away from smaller competitors because of the growing level of investment required to stay competitive. Interestingly, he does not consider GEC-Alsthom, the British-French joint venture, as a separate competitor, but part of the GE family. Similarly, Toshiba and Hitachi of Japan are in the GE family, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is with Westinghouse, although it now appears to have the lead of the Westinghouse family. The customer side is changing also, as large utilities are broken up and new ones enter the business. Mr Lundberg says they talk to each other more than traditional customers did, and have become more demanding. Also, in most countries, there are fewer and fewer distortions to open competition created by governments. ABB is particularly proud of its drive to make power generation a more environmentally friendly process. 'The market is asking suppliers to make big investments in efficiency and environmental protection, and we have been able to keep our spending relatively high,' Mr Lundberg says. ABB as a whole spends 8 per cent of its sales on research and development, and Mr Lundberg points out that the power plant division, being the largest in the group, has a big budget. The group has set up a joint venture with Japan's Ishikawajima Harima Industries (IHI) to market the pressurised fluidised bed reactor - an idea first explored by British Coal in the 1970s - to provide a more complete combustion of coal. It claims that emissions from these burners are well below the most severe requirements - 10 parts per million of sulphur dioxide, less than 50 ppm of NOx, and virtually no carbon. 'The dream was to have a zero emission plant. We now call it a zero environmental impact plant,' Mr Lundberg says. So far, the joint venture has won two orders for the technology. 'We want to refine the system further and improve its operating economy. There is already 10 per cent less consumption than in a normal coal plant and we are aiming at taking out another 10 per cent.' ABB has also led in removing NOx emissions from gas fired plants. 'We have got it down to 10 to 15 ppm which is well below the 25 ppm standard. Obviously, a major focus of research effort is on eliminating carbon dioxide emissions, and Mr Lundberg thinks the most promising avenue is through improvements in net efficiency. ABB's other thrust has been into eastern Europe, and Poland in particular, where it has made a number of acquisitions in the past two years and now employs some 10,000 people. ABB has found that it could bring manufacturing standards up to western standard quite quickly. In particular, it has transferred gas turbine technology and now uses Poland as a low cost source of machinery for world markets. ABB said in May that it was still expecting a difficult year and that profits would probably not grow above last year's level. However, in June, it announced a huge Dollars 1.8bn order for an oil and gas fired power station and seawater desalination plant in Abu Dhabi. Its own share of the contract would be close to Dollars 1bn, and it may well be that this and other orders could make the year end better than expected.</p>

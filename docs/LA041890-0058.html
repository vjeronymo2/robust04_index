			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> BOB FLORENCE BAND OVERCOME BY CRAFTSMANSHIP  </P> <P> The 18-man behemoth known as Bob Florence's Limited Edition took to the stand  Monday in the latest of promoter Diane Varga's weekly big band events at the  Biltmore's Grand Avenue Bar in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> An eclectic composer and arranger, Florence proudly informed his listeners that  "We have no subs in the band tonight." That this was his basic personnel was  reflected in the infallible accuracy with which his six saxes, five trumpets  and four trombones interpreted the demandingly intricate music.  </P> <P> For all the ingenuity of his writing, though, there were times when  craftsmanship took precedence over creativity. Although Florence is a writer of  sufficient skill to avoid derivative tricks, his tendency to borrow from  familiar sources was often in evidence.  </P> <P> A reworking of Johnny Mandel's "Emily" vacillated between piano solo and  orchestral passages, with Florence showing respect for the original Bill Evans  waltz treatment before the band jazzed it up, complete with pointless quotes  from "Things Ain't What They Used to Be." This patchwork chart, despite  ingenious use of everything from flutes to contrabass clarinet, never settled  into a firm indentity.  </P> <P> Deliberately secondhand was Florence's "Big Band Treasure Chest," packed with  references, some obvious and others obscure, to Ellington, Goodman, Basie and  Herman among others. But his version of the Harold Arlen standard "Out of This  World" was truly original, showing that he does not need to rely on gimmicks.  </P> <P> Much of the band's warmth lies less in the writing than in several strong  soloists, notably Steve Huffsteter on fluegelhorn, Lanny Morgan on alto sax and  Charlie Loper on trombone. The ensemble was driven by drummer Peter Donald,  whose power and precision kept the rhythmic pulse in flawless shape.  </P> <P> The skill Florence has shown over the years leaves no doubt that he can tackle  just about any orchestrational challenge. The proof was present again on  Monday, but along with it came reminders that a first-rate talent can be  qualified by reliance on secondhand ideas. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROWN  </P> <P> Contrary to the statement in the section titled "When Reality Intrudes,"  "Electricity-generating windmills have become symbols of flakiness," the  California wind-farm developments have become a major worldwide symbol of  dramatic, efficient use of alternative energy. The wind turbine industry is a  multibillion-dollar industry that is no longer esoteric, nor has anything to do  with tax shelters. It creates jobs, pays taxes and is part of the solution to  the growing environmental problems.  </P> <P> GEORGE WAGNER  </P> <P> WIND HARVEST CO.  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

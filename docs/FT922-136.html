			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Ercros may be forced to file for protection ERCROS, Spain's biggest chemicals company and the industrial flagship of the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) in the country, may be forced to file for protection from its creditors before the end of this week. The group's board, in an emergency meeting in Barcelona yesterday, again failed to solve its deepening debt crisis. Ercros employs 10,500, and a collapse would be one of the biggest-ever corporate failures in Spain. Ercros, which lost Pta16bn (Dollars 161.6m) last year, owes Dollars 2bn to banks and suppliers and some of its fertiliser plants have recently had their gas and electricity supplies cut off. About Dollars 500m of the debt matures this year, and KIO, which controls 40 per cent of the group, has refused to make an emergency injection of Dollars 250m without the state making new capital available. Madrid, however, has said it is legally unable to make new subsidies available to Ercros. The talks yesterday revolved around two proposals. KIO is insisting on an immediate suspension of debt repayment while Mr Jose Piquet, Ercros's managing director, is understood to be looking for an 'extra judicial' solution. This would involve major shareholders and the government restructuring Ercros's capital and later informal debt negotiations with creditor banks. The situation is complicated by an earlier agreement between Ercros and the US commodities group, Freeport-McMoRan, under which Freeport was to invest fresh capital into Ercros's fertiliser and mining divisions. Madrid may at least be prepared to honour Pta10bn of debt guarantees and it, too, is pressing KIO not to suspend payments in order to allow the Freeport deal to go ahead quickly. People close to the negotiations say, however, that KIO, as the largest shareholder, will probably get its way and force a protection filing. One last effort to avoid this will be made today when KIO and Ercros officials meet Mr Claudio Aranzadi, the industry minister, in Madrid.</p>

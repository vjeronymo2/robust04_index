			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [no dateline as received] Prime Minister  Tereshchenko has held a meeting with members of the government,  heads of departments, major enterprises, national and joint  stock companies, and holdings, and deputy heads of oblast  administrations. Views were exchanged on the serious economic  situation. Reports on the situation in their industries were  presented by ministers of industry Salomatin; of power and fuel  resources Baykenov; and of transport Isingarin.    As was pointed out at the meeting, production continues to  decline. In the first quarter of this year it fell by 30  percent. Extraction of oil dropped by 14.5 percent; of coal by  10 percent; and of natural gas by 35 percent. Electric power  output declined by 14 percent.    Despite the mutual writing-off of debts, mutual debts have  reached a total of 24 billion tenge. Curbing inflation has  become the most difficult task for the government. [passage  omitted]    One tonne of oil is likely to cost $191 by yearend. Even now  prices for fuel on the domestic market are higher than the world  level. If the debts are not repaid, production of electricity  will be reduced by a significant degree.    The main conclusion drawn during the meeting was the  necessity to change pricing, first of all prices for fuel.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Guinness There is a slightly unnerving message for the market as a whole in the 9 per cent fall in Guinness's share price over the past two days. The company is starting to feel the chill spreading through the European economy. September's devaluation will do little for earnings for the time being because export revenues were hedged, a factor which also protected Guinness from the weakness of the dollar earlier in the year. But European consumers, particularly in Germany, are spending less on spirits. Added to that, Guinness has a particular problem in Spain where the rationalisation of its brewery acquisitions is proving more difficult than expected. It has lost both market share and margin in a declining beer market. The upshot is that Guinness may, for once, see a decline in profits this year and the chances of it generating over Pounds 1bn in 1993 are remote. This realisation, prompted by a wire agency interview on Wednesday, took the market by surprise, so the share price fall could be seen as a one-off adjustment to lowered expectations which may not have much further to run. The harder question is whether Guinness has lost its magic touch for good. There is no reason why recession should have blighted the long-term growth prospects of the international spirits sector, but declining inflation may leave consumers in the industrial world more price conscious for a while. With earnings growth next year unlikely to match the market average, it is hard to see the share price outperforming even from a lower base.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Letter: Concern over US transfer pricing proposals Sir, Earlier this year the US Treasury and Internal Revenue Service issued new draft transfer pricing regulations. These could have far reaching - and dramatic - implications for foreign multinationals in the US. Price Waterhouse has closely consulted representatives of British industry and made detailed representations to the US tax authorities to urge that the worst excesses of the proposed rules are avoided. As drafted, the regulations overturn the internationally accepted arm's-length standard for transfer pricing. Instead, they elevate one method frequently used by tax authorities as a way of checking the reasonableness of transfer prices (ie comparing a company's results with those of its competitors) to virtually the sole determinant of prices, with little flexibility for adjusting results for differences in economic circumstances. The draft regulations also seem to require companies to recalculate royalty rates charged for the use of patents or trademarks every few years. If these new rules are adopted, conflict between taxpayers and tax authorities - and between tax authorities - is expected to increase. The use of the recently introduced Advance Pricing Agreement procedure is likely to be of limited assistance in overcoming this problem. Fortunately, in response to detailed criticisms the IRS at last appears to be modifying its original approach. It has recently indicated that the comparison of results pricing method may have a lower priority than originally planned and there may also be more flexibility in relation to intangibles and in other areas. However, because of the high profile of the issue in the US, there must be concern that the rules could change again. It is to be hoped that Britain's tax authorities continue to make strenuous representations so that potentially serious damage is averted.

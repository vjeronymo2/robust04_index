			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Following last night's signing of an agreement  with Bosnian Prime Minister Silajdzic, Croatian Foreign Minister  Dr. Mate Granic this afternoon had talks with UN officials -- UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and Jean Bernard Merimee, French  ambassador and president of the UN Security Council. Here is  Jozo Curic with a report from New York:    [Curic] Croatia is ready to continue peaceful dialogue with  the Serbs in UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] areas, Minister Granic  told UN Secretary General Ghali and UN Security Council  President Merimee in New York today. He mentioned the principle  of local autonomy in those UNPA's where Serbs were in the  majority before the war. Croatia wants the issue of the occupied  areas to be resolved in line with UN Resolution 871. The UNPA's  are an integral part of Croatia, Dr. Granic said.    According to some UN sources Croatia will ask for a more  active UNPROFOR mandate, including the use of ultimatum. This  would mean the implementation of the resolutions that provide  for the control of borders, for disarmament, the control of  roads, measures to restore confidence, and the economic recovery  of these areas. Minister Granic informed his hosts about the  Croat-Muslim outline agreement on a federation and the  preliminary agreement on a loose confederation of Croatia and  the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation.

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Letter: Misleading impression given of a little known country Sir, As the general manager of a consultancy which specialises in assisting and advising western firms doing business in Romania, and therefore a regular traveller to Bucharest, I was amazed and appalled by various inaccuracies in David Pilling's article, 'In Ceaucescu's broken footsteps' (September 19). For example, it portrays Bucharest as a grim city in which 'the Intercontinental Hotel has no coffee and many restaurants little or no food'. I returned from Bucharest on the day the article appeared, having spent three evenings entertaining British and German clients involved in a Romanian petrochemicals modernisation project. As usual, the food of the countless privately owned restaurants which have opened over the last two years in Bucharest was most agreeable and the atmosphere pleasant. Although the quality of food in Bucharest's restaurants is in itself of little import to the prospects of British business in the region, the article's inaccuracies are damaging as they create a misleading impression of a country which is still little known to the outside world. Perhaps Mr Pilling's puzzling experiences are best explained by his own admission that his travel companion on his trip was a 'guide book from pre-revolution days'. This is presumably not the best source of information on a city where the atmosphere, restaurants and the entertainment have changed immensely since the grim days of Ceaucescu.

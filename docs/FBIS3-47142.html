The (?seamy) side of the case was disclosed in December last  year. The puppet Army-prosecution joint investigation  headquarters clinched off the case as a "mere fraud" committed  by a South Korean arms broker and a French arms dealer vis-a-vis  the logistics headquarters of the puppet Defence Ministry.    The Democratic Party in a commentary January 7 branded the  joint investigation headquarters' behavior as ridiculous, and  urged the invocation of the "parliamentary investigation power"  in order to probe the truth of the case.    The national party in a statement demanded that the  "government" nullify the results of investigation of the  headquarters and appoint a special prosecutor to make a full  reinvestigation into the case.</p>

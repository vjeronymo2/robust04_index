			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' SOCCER PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> KENNEDY, DEFENSE STOP MANUAL ARTS COLD, 1-0  </P> <P> Kennedy High scored early and then controlled the ball for the rest of the  match Wednesday, defeating visiting Manual Arts, 1-0, in a first-round City  Section contest.  </P> <P> Luis Sandoval gave the Golden Cougars the only goal they would need, heading in  a corner kick from Brian Singer less than five minutes into the match.  </P> <P> The Toilers' quickness gave Kennedy trouble at times but the Golden Cougars  managed to stay in control, outshooting Manual Arts, 19-6.  </P> <P> Blustery winds hampered play but Kennedy proved more adept at passing the ball.  </P> <P> "Considering the wind, I thought we played really well," Kennedy Coach Fred  Singer said.  </P> <P> Manual Arts' scoring opportunities were limited and the Kennedy defense stopped  any serious threats.  </P> <P> Defender Ruben Rios came up with a big play late in the first half, clearing  out a Manual Arts shot after goalkeeper Salvador Aragon had left the goal.  </P> <P> Aragon had replaced starting goalkeeper Chris Hines, who is sidelined because  of a collapsed lung.

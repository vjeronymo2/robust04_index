			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOLS DON'T EXIST JUST TO TRAIN ATHLETES  </P> <P> Pity the poor Los Angeles City high school football teams that will lose  players just before playoff time because of academic ineligibility. Pity the  coaches who demand that the players spend so much of their non-school time  practicing.  </P> <P> Judging from Lonnie White's column on Nov. 21, you would think that the high  schools existed for the purpose of training athletes and not minds. Let's get  our prioities straight. Students attend school to get an education first.  Extra-curricular activites should be considered only after students have proven  themselves capable of meeting their academic responsibilites.  </P> <P> JIM HAYES, Torrance  </P></p>

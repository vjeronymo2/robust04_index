			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / UK, France agree to join forces to persuade EC to change the Acquired Rights Directive 1977 THE UK and France have agreed to join forces in persuading the European Community to change the Acquired Rights Directive 1977. Implementation of the directive in the UK through the Tupe regulations has created uncertainty over its application when public services are contracted out. The French government is believed to be concerned about the impact of the directive on its plans to privatise state-owned banks and industries. At Monday's summit meeting, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, agreed to include the directive in 24 items of EC legislation they wish to be reviewed.</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / US-Japanese trade deal caps Tokyo summit THE US and Japan this morning reached agreement on a broad negotiating framework designed to open Japan's markets to American goods and to reduce the size of its bilateral Dollars 50bn trade surplus. The agreement, only concluded after all-night bargaining, appears to crown a successful summit in Tokyo of the world's largest industrialised nations for President Bill Clinton. Earlier, leaders of the Group of Seven had given the 'highest priority' to concluding the Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations. Mr Clinton and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, jointly announced their resolution in brief statements. Shortly before, the president had held a brief press conference with President Boris Yeltsin, in which he said the US and Russia would propose a tripartite agreement to persuade Ukraine to give up its nuclear weapons. Neither the US nor the Japanese leader were immediately specific about the details. Mr Miyazawa said, generally, that Japan would expand access to its markets, increase the transparency of its policy-making and promote deregulation in return for continued progress in reducing the US budget deficit. Mr Clinton said the framework approach - in his words, 'a good beginning' - meant a series of 'results-oriented' agreements to be negotiated sector-by-sector over the next six months. He mentioned cars, telecommunications, computers, medical equipment, financial services and insurance. A US official characterised the accord as giving the US rather more than it expected in setting numerical targets for opening up specific Japanese sectors to US products and services. But Japan had resisted some US macro-economic demands. Concluding their three-day economic summit, the G7 members  - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada  - yesterday supported a fresh effort to reach agreement by the end of this year in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks under the aegis of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. A communique also said they had agreed to promote long-term growth by trying to co-operate in reforming labour markets, social security and health-care systems. Earlier, Mr Clinton said: 'All of us are mindful that we have a long way to go to restore real growth and opportunity to the global economy, but we have made a serious start.'. He cited Wednesday's agreement by the US, Canada, Japan and the European Community to reduce or eliminate import tariffs on a range of manufactured goods, which he said would help bring global trade talks to a successful conclusion. On Russia, Mr Clinton said the Dollars 3bn programme to help privatise state-owned industries 'will not only bolster prospects for freedom there, it is a very solid investment for the US'. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said the summit, with its progress on trade, had been better 'than I anticipated and better than most people expected'.

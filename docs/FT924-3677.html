			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Private View: The daughter cast in her father's mould - Mary Moore on her troubled dealings with the trust which guards her father's legacy WHO best knows the mind of a dead man? His only child, or the friends and advisers appointed to carry out his wishes? It is painful conundrum, because love and money are involved, and a familiar one. But when the dead man is an artist whose works are worth millions, it is an important and very public one. Nobody who has read of the battle between Henry Moore's daughter, Mary, and the foundation she helped him create can remain quite neutral. Some will see it as a contest between a loyal daughter and an overweening cabal of the art Establishment (with Pounds 50m invested, the Henry Moore Foundation is the largest art-funding body after the state). Others will think, what the foundation's advisers have sought to convey, that Mary Moore is a troublesome woman who, having fallen out with her father towards the end of his life, is seeking requital after his death. Verdicts of a sort will be delivered next year. The Environment Secretary will have the report of a planning inspector before deciding whether the foundation should be allowed to develop the artist's studios and land in the Hertfordshire hamlet of Perry Green in order to show more of his work to a bigger public. The local authority says the scheme is too disruptive: their counsel called it 'an upmarket industrial development down a substandard road in the heart of a rural area.' Moore's daughter says it will look like a theme park and is a betrayal of her father's wishes. A proper museum, she says, should be built elsewhere. Meanwhile the High Court will be asked to decide whether a large part of the foundation's holding of 650 sculptures, especially the artist's copies, rightly belongs to Moore's three grandchildren. In bringing this action as her father's executor, it is clear Mary Moore hopes to limit the foundation's control over exhibitions and disposals. They will be verdicts, but they will not be answers. And even if the daughter proves by means of letters and tape recordings that she is the true and trusted interpreter of her father's wishes, the public may still ask whether any artist - even a great one - can decree for ever how his Muse is to be commemorated. Judgment is often helped by coming face to face with the protagonist. Although I had met Mary Moore, now Mrs Raymond Danowski, in my youth (and was once shown round the studios and garden by Moore himself) I did not know what to expect. Nor, it was obvious, did she. She was enthusiastic in describing how as a child she sat in the studio with her father 'mucking about with paint' or copying him as he modelled clay. But then her answers became oddly detached. When I asked what kind of obligation she felt to her father, she replied: 'If I see things which are blatantly wrong it seems to me an obligation to point them out. In this case it was quite obvious that nobody was going to stand up and protest (about the plans). I have just been involved in a campaign to open people's eyes to the destruction I saw going on.' Do you resent the time you have to spend looking after your father's legacy? 'I don't feel that's a burden. That seems to me the kind of obligation anyone would feel towards anyone with whom they were particularly intimate.' What about the other penalties, like the publicity? 'It would only be difficult for me if I felt I wasn't getting the right message across. So far the only stressful situation has been the planning inquiry and press coverage. The press coverage has been very hurtful: it's a bit like taking a blow in the stomach because of the way it's been conducted, certainly from the other side. It's as if they made a personal attack on me so there was no need to discuss the merits of my arguments, no need to take seriously the possibility that their ideas were not so good.' Later when I asked again if she felt any resentment about the accident of being born to a famous artist, she denied it. 'I do this because I have to, out of regard for my father.' Do you mean out of love? 'Yes, out of love. You have to translate for me.' Some children rebel against their parents' world. Mary Moore, taught to see through her father's eyes and taught to regard drawing as the true test of any artist, seems entirely absorbed by it. 'I wasn't rebellious,' she said, 'because I got such enormous pleasure from what I'd been shown.' At the age of 16 she studied life drawing at the Slade 'where I had a hell of a time because I was Henry Moore's daughter' and she still draws at the Royal College of Art once a week. Physically she resembles her father more than her mother, the Russian-born Irina Radetsky (also an artist) and she thinks she has also inherited his outgoing temperament. Certainly at the planning inquiry she appeared confident and fluent under cross-examination. Yet I felt there was something constraining her beyond the need to make a good impression and to weigh her words ahead of the court case. What was this need to be be 'translated'? She explained it suddenly, while posing for the picture. 'I am very left-handed', she said. 'So I talk like a negative.' Psychologists may recognise the phenomenon: it seemed to mean that she speaks rather as a painter paints, not going directly for the highlights but describing the shadowy areas in order to let the highlights emerge. I came to the point. Do you agree there was a break between you and your father? 'On the emotional level on which we related to each other I don't believe there was a break. There was a disagreement about the way the foundation was going, and there was a break in the amount of time we spent together in that I went to South Africa.' Your father wasn't happy about that, was he? 'My father was a great anti-apartheid man but he never made a big deal about me going there. Other people, the foundation's lawyers, made a big deal of it when I started questioning ownership, hoping I would be undermined.' She lived in South Africa for five years, returning in 1985 a year before Moore's death. Before her departure she had resigned as a trustee of the foundation, apparently over a disagreement about a sale. She says that on her return her father wanted her reinstated but that the other trustees refused. Her father was old and ill and, she implies, increasingly under the thumb of his advisers. Why should the foundation behave in the way you allege, I asked. 'I think the process began before my father died. if something goes off the rails it diverges further and further . . . 'They're in a very powerful position. It's probably the richest arts funding body in England, When you have that kind of influence you probably get quite used to making it function in an unquestioned way.' Mary Moore and her advisers clearly think the foundation is discharging its duties towards Moore's work on the cheap and is preoccupied with its sponsorship of contemporary art. I asked her: having got the bit between your teeth do you quite enjoy this struggle with the foundation? 'No. One just hopes that the right solution will eventually come about, that the studio and grounds will be preserved.' Mary Moore was well provided for at her mother's death, but I asked: are you after the money? 'I don't need the money. I would hope that into whoever's ownership those sculptures fell that they would be used as my father wanted, to contribute to a comprehensive display of his work. The foundation could combine with me.' What have you learned from the whole experience? 'It's going to sound very crass. Probably that if you believe in something you can do things that you never believed it was possible to do - if you believe enough. She added: 'It's as though there were two stories - the story of me having to survive these fardels, these slings and arrows, and the real story of underlying importance. I don't think it's an issue that relates to Henry Moore particularly. It relates to our heritage, our attitude to all kinds of things.' One can hear the Henry Moore Foundation saying much the same thing.</p>

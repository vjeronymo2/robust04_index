			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Hawke's political memoirs hit a wave of criticism The queue in the Miranda Shopping Centre in one of Sydney's southern suburbs was modest but persistent. For 90 minutes, it shuffled slowly forwards, never dropping below two dozen people. At its head sat Mr Bob Hawke, Australia's prime minster until late-1991, signing copies of memoirs with patience and flourish. The recently published book has caused a storm in Australia, largely because of its highly personalised attacks on Mr Paul Keating, Mr Hawke's successor and the current prime minister. But for the most part, Saturday's shoppers were quietly supportive of their former leader. 'I'm going to get him to sign it for my granddaughter - he was a good prime minister,' remarked one woman. Assistants from Angus &amp; Robertson, the bookstore handling the promotion, said sales had been brisk. Not everyone was enthused, though. One teenager, hanging over the railings, thought this was a curious way for a former prime minister to be spending his time. 'Look at Malcolm Fraser, he's going round for CARE Australia,' she said in reference to the former conservative prime minister's work for the aid agency whose profile has been raised by the Rwanda crisis. Another lady, flicking through the memoirs noticed the ADollars 49.95 (Pounds 24) price and was blunter. 'I wonder how much he gets out of it ?' she asked. Dollars from sales appear forthcoming, but there has been a lack of critical acclaim. Most local commentators view the book as an effort at self-aggrandisement, with Mr Hawke anxious to ensure the credit for prising open the Australian economy in the 1980s is laid at his door. In the process of claiming sole credit for the reforms of the 1980s, Mr Hawke - who held power for eight years and won an unprecedented three elections - has missed few opportunities to do down his successor, who served as Treasurer during much of the Hawke government. The bad blood between the two has been evident ever since Mr Hawke tried to duck out of the 'Kirribilli agreement', under which he would step down in favour of Mr Keating after the 1990 election. It took a bruising fight within the Australian Labor party before Mr Hawke was forced to relinquish the reins. By the end of last week, the former prime minister appeared weary of taking a barrage of criticism over the book, but was still talking tough. 'I knew it would cause some unhappiness,' he said, when asked if he had been surprised by the reaction. 'But the facts have to be told.' Mr Keating has kept out of the fray. There was only one tart comment, as he unveiled a series of 'Open Learning' programmes for TV. This he said was 'not the only launch today, but I'll bet pounds to peanuts this one has a longer-term influence on Australia'.</p>

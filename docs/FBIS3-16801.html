It is important to note that the agreement for the complete  withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia is also ready to be  initialled. Estonia had hoped that this could have been done at  the last round of talks, but instead the Russian side presented  new demands and even placed the mutually agreed upon withdrawal  date of August 31, 1994 into question.    In light of the Russian Prime Minister's recent stated  agreement to remove Russian troops from Estonia by August 31,  1994 and the international consensus that the withdrawal of  Russian troops from Estonia can not be tied to any conditions,  the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs hopes that Russia will  initial the agreement to withdraw troops from Estonia during the  18th round of negotiations April 5-6 in Moscow.    By completing the removal of its troops from all three  Baltic  States by August 31, 1994, Russia will finally be in conformance  with paragraph 15 of the 1992 Helsinki document, which requires  "early, orderly and complete" withdrawal.</p>

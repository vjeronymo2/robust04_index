			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report]  <H5>  Contradictory Poll Results </H5>   The results of a PARIS MATCH/BVA poll conducted from 2 to 6  December 1993 among a nationwide sample of 966 individuals  appeared in the 24 December Paris weekly PARIS MATCH. While  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's popularity remained high, a  majority of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with the way  the country is governed. Respondents were asked the following  questions (all figures are percentages):    "For each of the following personalities, can you tell me if you trust  him/her or not?"

While Balladur works to improve  France's economic and social conditions, he "paradoxically"  profits from the electorate's fear that it could worsen  conditions by contesting the government's actions, Jeambar  writes. Economic recovery might bring down Balladur's popularity  by "removing the danger," he concludes.  <H5>  Balladur' s Presidential Prospects </H5>   After Minister of Health Simone Veil and Minister of Defense  Francois Leotard--both UDF members--strongly approved during  television interviews of a Balladur candidacy in the next  presidential elections, Jacques Patoz commented in the 20  December Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS that the two  ministers' statements are really intended to block other  candidacies and are "certainly not a naive homage to the prime  minister." Many UDF officials wish to see Balladur as the  conservative coalition's presidential candidate, Patoz writes,  because they want to forestall the candidacies of UDF leader  Valery Giscard d'Estaing and RPR leader Jacques Chirac. The  endorsement of Balladur by Veil and Leotard was "logical" but  "clumsy," Patoz continues. By opening the presidential debate  and promoting confict based on party and personality  differences, Veil and Leotard risk weakening the governing  majority as well as the prime minister, whose strategy has been  to place himself above partisan quarrels, Patoz writes. If  Balladur is indeed considering a run at the presidency, being  viewed as the UDF's favorite places him in a delicate position  in his own RPR among those who disapprove of his policies or  remain Chirac loyalists. Veil and Leotard's embrace of Balladur  indirectly reinforces Chirac's position, Patoz concludes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Breakaway communist leaders yesterday warned that  new attacks will be unleashed against strategic targets if the  government imposed new taxes in place of the P1 [Philippine  pesos] oil levy. In a statement sent to media offices, Sergio  Romero, commanding officer of the Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB],  reiterated his group's threat to "renew attacks" if no "complete  and unconditional" rollback is implemented.    "It is unjust for the Filipino people the Ramos  administration's move to force the enactment of new taxes as a  replacement for the removal of the oil levy," Romero's statement  said. "We will renew attacks if the government disregards the  people's demands," Romero added, but refused to elaborate what  kind of attacks the breakaway leftist hit squad is planning.    The ABB, which broke off from the leadership of Communist  Party of the Philippines [CPP] founder Jose Ma. Sison, had  claimed responsibility for the 1 February bombings of the  offices of Shell and Petron in Makati, and Caltex in Manila.    Two security guards of Petron were reported hurt in the  bombings, which police said was carried out by four unidentified  men using dynamites.    The government panel in a 14-man committee looking for  alternatives to the levy has recommended new taxes to replace  the levy which President Ramos imposed last September. But  members of the Kilusang Rollback [KRB; Rollback Movement], a  multi-sectoral coalition opposed to the price increase, rejected  the proposed new taxes.    Leaders of the Freedom from Debt Coalition, one of the  groups  under the KRB, said the government could find alternatives to  the levy without passing new taxes.    According to Romero, the collection of additional taxes is a  scheme to circumvent the people's demands for a rollback of  petroleum prices. Romero added that new taxes are a different  form of oppression. He urged the Ramos administration to "stop  blackmailing" the people, roll back oil prices unconditionally,  and refrain from implementing measures that will only further  burden the people.    The ABB had warned it will bomb more offices and assassinate  officials of the government and the International Monetary Fund  if prices were not rolled back permanently. But ABB leaders  later said they were temporarily halting all armed operations  while various people's organizations are protesting in the  streets against the price increase.    In its statement, the ABB also criticized the government for  allegedly spreading distorted news that linked the armed group  to terrorist acts, like the rumored planned bombings of oil  depots and other facilities in the Visayas, and the reported  coordination between the leftist rebel group and the rightist  Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Revolutionary Nationalist  Alliance]. "There is no other objective for these moves except  to divide and divert the concentration of the widespread mass  movement over the issue of oil and to smear our ranks," Romero  said.    Police intelligence reports claimed communists in the  Visayas  planned to bomb power plants, oil depots, and other strategic  targets in the region if the government again raised oil prices.  Based on the report, the Philippine National Police placed all  police units on alert in the entire Visayas. Police personnel  were sent to guard places likely to be targets of the bombings.  But the standing committee of the CPP Visayas Commission denied  the report, saying it is a "blatant lie." Indio Pluma, spokesman  of the CPP territorial commission, said the report was just a  "black propaganda" against communist rebels in the Visayas.    Breakaway communist leaders also branded as a lie a report  quoting an unnamed leader of the rightist military rebels as  saying the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa provided a cache  of explosives to the ABB in 1990.</p>

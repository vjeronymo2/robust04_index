			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Nissan and Mazda seek components price cuts NISSAN and Mazda, the lossmaking Japanese carmakers, are seeking another round of price cuts from their components suppliers. Nissan said it had asked about 50 of its suppliers to reduce their prices - its second such move this year. In February, the carmaker sought reductions from 32 of its affiliated suppliers. It had been forced to seek further price cuts by the prolonged downturn in the Japanese market and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, it said. Nissan had forecast a recovery in new vehicle demand in the second half, but it now believes that there is unlikely to be any improvement before 1994. Mazda said that it had asked its components suppliers to reduce prices by at least 3 per cent. Honda asked its suppliers to reduce prices by 2 per cent earlier in the year. Japanese vehicle makers are squeezing their suppliers under the impact of one of the worst downturns the industry has experienced. New vehicle sales are expected to fall in 1993 for the third year in succession. Similar pressures are being exerted elsewhere, particularly in western Europe and North America.</p>

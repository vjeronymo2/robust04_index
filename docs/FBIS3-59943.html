It was conducted by Yuriy Kostenko, the  ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of Ukraine in  Austria. Addressing foreign journalists, he noted that  ratification by the Supreme Council of Ukraine of the START I  Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol, opens realistic possibilities  for Ukraine progressing along the path to nuclear disarmament.  The international community, stressed the ambassador, should  understand and realistically assess the huge difficulties of a  political, economic, technical, and ecological nature, which are  arising before the young independent state in the process of  elimination of the powerful nuclear potential inherited from the  former Soviet Union.</p>

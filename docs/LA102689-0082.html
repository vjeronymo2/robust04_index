			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> TEENS WEAR RED IN STAND AGAINST ALCOHOL, DRUGS  </P> <P> At first glance, it would appear that red ribbons and red medical bracelets are  a hot new fashion item for local teen-agers.  </P> <P> But they're not. Across the country, this is Red Ribbon Week, a national  campaign against alcohol and drug abuse that is endorsed by the Parent Teacher  Assn., Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other groups.  </P> <P> Thousands of students in Long Beach and its surrounding communities are wearing  red ribbons and bracelets.  </P> <P> "I will not drink or use drugs for the week," is inscribed inside each  bracelet, along with its wearer's signature.  </P> <P> "They are to serve as a reminder of the countless young people who have been  hurt or injured due to alcohol or drugs," said Jerry Shults, outreach  coordinator of New Beginnings Adolescent Unit, a chemical dependency treatment  center at Doctors Hospital of Lakewood, which is providing the bracelets.  </P> <P> "The color red should represent all the young lives lost due to drinking and  driving, overdoses, suicides and the many other drug and alcohol related  deaths," Shults said. "Society cannot endure such an assault on its young  people. With the red wrist bands serving as a constant reminder, how can one  forget?"  </P></p>

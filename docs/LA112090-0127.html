			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> TRAFFIC STALLED BY KNOTT'S FIREWORKS  </P> <P> A massive fireworks show Sunday night at Knott's Berry Farm brought traffic to  a standstill as fire officials cordoned off streets near the park to allow for  a fireworks "fallout" zone, officials told the City Council on Monday.  </P> <P> The more than 2,000 pyrotechnics also prompted more than 50 calls from  residents who thought there had been an explosion.  </P> <P> But both fire and police officials said there was no danger to residents.  </P> <P> "From our perspective, it went very well," Fire Chief Sam Winner said. The  "fallout," which included burned fireworks and paper scraps, landed in a vacant  lot near the park, he said.  </P> <P> During the 18-minute show, drivers were not allowed along portions of La Palma  and Western avenues.  </P> <P> "We restricted the area for safety purposes," Winner said.  </P> <P> Eight off-duty fire fighters were hired by the radio station that sponsored the  show. Two on-duty fire officials were also on hand to oversee the actual  discharge of the fireworks. It was the largest fireworks show ever to be held  at the park, Winner said.  </P> <P> Police Chief Richard Tefank said 22 police officers working overtime helped  control traffic and crowds within the park. Knott's has agreed to pay the  $2,600 for the officers' overtime, Tefank said.LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

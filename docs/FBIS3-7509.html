Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] Chairman  Tomiichi Murayama told a news conference that it is time for all  the coalition members to take a united front in helping Diet  debate on the fiscal 1994 state budget go smoothly. Murayama  said any move that threatens the unity of the coalition should  be avoided.    Murayama said he relayed his thoughts to Hosokawa when he  visited the premier at his official residence last week to  inquire about news reports that the planned coalition study  group is a preliminary step before establishing a new party.    Mass media reports said that a prerequisite for joining the  group is support for choosing joint candidates under the new  electoral system for the House of Representatives.    Hosokawa said earlier this month the coalition would be at a  disadvantage in the next general election unless it overcomes  internal rivalry and agrees to file a joint candidate in each of  300 single-seat constituencies.    If joining the study group is a condition to be selected as  a  joint candidate or if the group is designed to create a new  party, "I would not be able to agree" to let SDP legislators  participate, Murayama said. But he added the SDP has no plan at  the moment to decide on whether to allow party ranks to join the  study group and instead will keep watch over political  developments.</p>

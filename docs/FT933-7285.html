			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Monks blames job worries for social ills GROWING insecurity in the workplace is contributing to problems in the family and to rising crime rates, Mr John Monks, the general secretary-elect of the Trades Union Congress, said yesterday. Mr Monks, who takes over his new job in a fortnight, said on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost programme: 'What we've got now is over-mighty employers  -employers who can do what they like, empowered by the government.' He added: 'If you are insecure at work, you're insecure in other aspects of your life as well. My job as the new general secretary of the TUC is highlighting the links between these things and to put work and relations at work back at the centre of things.' Observer, Page 13</p>

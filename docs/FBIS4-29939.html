			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on negotiations on the automobile and  auto parts sector under the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks,  a senior official at the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] stated on 20 June: "We cannot make any  concessions on the point on which we cannot compromise in  principle." Thus, the official stressed Japan's stand that it  will not make easy concessions in final consultations on the  sector, which will start on 24 June to prepare for the  Japan-U.S. summit talks prior to the July Naples summit (meeting  of leaders of the seven industrialized nations).    It is believed that he reiterated Japan's stance of not  accepting anything like numerical targets.</p>

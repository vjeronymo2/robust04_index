			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Blair outlines agenda on crime GOVERNMENTS had to take responsibility for combating crime but that should not be a substitute for the responsibility of individuals, Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, told the conference yesterday. Outlining a fresh agenda for Labour on the home affairs beat, Mr Blair - a possible future challenger for the Labour leadership - steered between a 1960s liberal emphasis on social conditions and a 1990s concern with the aspirations of individuals. 'There is no excuse for crime, but when young men and women seek but do not find any reflection of their hopes in the society around them . . . when communities disintegrate and people within them feel they have no chance to improve, then it takes not a degree in social science, merely a modicum of common sense to see that, in the soil of alienation, crime will take root.' He did not believe there was a choice between self-interest and public good. 'It is only on the foundation of a strong and fair society that individual aspiration can best be built.' Mr Blair took only tentative steps towards backing a 'written constitution' for the UK - calling for a 'full and proper' freedom of information act and the incorporation into UK law of the European convention on human rights as the 'first step to a new bill of rights for Britain'. He called for proper scrutiny of the secret services, via a Commons committee, and the restoration of full trade union rights at the government's GCHQ communications centre at Cheltenham. Later, Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy Labour leader, warned that freedoms in Britain were being 'steadily, stealthily removed'. Secrecy, for instance, was being imposed on nurses and doctors under health reforms, she said.</p>

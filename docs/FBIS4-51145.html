			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 20 (XINHUA) -- China will complete a  34-volume collection of the biographies of 1,500 outstanding  modern and contemporary scientists by 1995. This will be the  first such work.    According to officials from the China Association for  Sciences and Technology (CAST), eight volumes of the book have  already been published.    Zhu Guangya, chairman of the association, who is in charge  of  the compilation, said that the book is a reflection of the  contributions made by the scientists to China's achievements in  science and technology and social progress.    The book contains precious records about the history of the  country's scientific and technological development, said the  chairman, who is one of the country's best known scientists.    In another development, a scientific and technological  experts' publishing fund was set up today, with about one  million yuan allocated by cast as capital.    The fund is designed to finance publication of the book,  audio and video products about Chinese scientists and history of  science and technology in modern and contemporary China.    Despite China's gradually increasing investment in sciences,  many academic books could not be published because of inadequate  financing.    The fund will accept donations from home and abroad.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Pressure mounts for Clinton to recognise Angolan government THE CLINTON administration is coming under increasing domestic and international pressure to recognise the Angolan government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Influential black Americans, including the Rev Jesse Jackson and Congressman Kweisi Mfume of Maryland who heads the congressional black caucus, are urging the step to make it clear to Mr Jonas Savimbi and his rebel Unita movement that renewed fighting in Angola is unacceptable to the US. Mr Jackson has urged President Bill Clinton to invite President Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria to Washington to demonstrate the US commitment to democratic reform in Africa. Mr Mfume wants direct talks with Mr Clinton to emphasise the gravity of several African problems. The case for Angolan recognition, which has strong support inside the State Department, is being given fresh impetus this week by celebrations commemorating the 40th anniversary of the African-American Institute, a private-sector interest group. Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, plans to address the institute, as will President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda. It is possible Mr Christopher will use his speech to make a policy statement on Angola. Mr Savimbi refused to accept the results of last September's elections, narrowly won by Mr Dos Santos, and ordered the civil war renewed. Last week Unita rejected the latest peace plan offered by US, Portuguese, Russian and UN negotiators. For many years Mr Savimbi has enjoyed the backing of US conservatives, most conspicuously Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican from North Carolina, who portrayed him as a heroic bulwark against Soviet and Cuban ambitions. Mr Clinton was accused this week by Mr Anthony Lewis, the New York Times columnist, of refusing to take an initiative in Angola for fear of upsetting Mr Helms and his cohorts. Mr Anthony Lake, national security adviser, who has been turning his attention to African problems, conceded in a recent speech that the US could have reacted more strongly to Mr Savimbi's rej-ection of last September's election results.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SMITH LEADS CRESPI PAST NOTRE DAME  </P> <P> Notre Dame High controlled its destiny in its Mission League finale against  Crespi on Friday, but Crespi quarterback Cody Smith and all-purpose player Ryan  Kieling ruined it all.  </P> <P> Smith, who was wearing a flak jacket under his jersey to protect the bruised  kidney and bruised ribs he suffered last week, completed back-to-back touchdown  passes in the fourth quarter to give Crespi a 21-10 win at Pierce College.  </P> <P> Both teams had clinched playoff berths before the opening kickoff, but Notre  Dame (6-3-1, 4-1-1 in league play) could have shared the league title and been  the league's top-seeded team if it could have held on to its 10-7 first-half  lead. Notre Dame finished in third place, one game behind champion St. Paul  (5-0-1). Crespi (8-2, 5-1) finished second.  </P> <P> Athletic directors from Notre Dame and St. Paul met Thursday for a coin toss  that would determine which team would get the higher seeding if both schools  won their final league game.  </P> <P> Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney, who also is the school's athletic director, won  the toss but kept it a secret from the team before the game.  </P> <P> St. Paul defeated Alemany, 24-14, to take the title and the top seeding. The  Knights will be the third-seeded team from the Mission League.  </P> <P> Crespi regained the lead in the fourth quarter when Smith hit tight end Frank  Romano over the middle for an 18-yard touchdown and a 14-10 advantage. Romano,  a 6-foot-3, 218-pound senior, was hit by a host of tacklers but managed to  bulldoze his way into the end zone.  </P> <P> It was Kieling's 59-yard touchdown reception on the Celts' next possession that  put Notre Dame away. On third and 15, Smith hit Kieling in the right flat on a  down-and-out pattern, and one quick move gave the receiver an open field.  </P> <P> "Before I caught the ball, I saw him coming up," Kieling said. "I knew he was  going to leave his feet and that if I put a move on him, he'd miss me."  </P> <P> The defender did miss, and Kieling was on his way to his second touchdown.  Kieling, who returns kickoffs and punts, was putting the moves on defenders all  night, but he was doing it from a new position -- tailback.  </P> <P> Kieling, who had carried just once -- for two yards -- before the game,  finished with 49 yards in seven carries. The 5-foot-7, 143-pound senior also  led all receivers with five catches for 85 yards.  </P> <P> Crespi opened the scoring on its second possession. Kieling took a handoff from  Smith and made his way through heavy traffic on the left side before cutting  back the opposite way for a 30-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> Notre Dame responded with an 11-play, 51-yard drive on its next possession, but  the Knights' fourth-and-14 attempt picked up only 12 yards and Crespi took over  at its 15.  </P> <P> Notre Dame defensive back Bob DaCorsi returned an interception 37 yards to make  the score 7-7.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 6 Jun (MENA)--An official Sudanese source  admitted today that an Egyptian irrigation delegation was  recently denied entry to Sudan. The source justified this by  saying the delegation came to Khartoum on its own initiative,  not at the invitation of the Sudanese Government.    Sudan had invited irrigation experts in Egypt to discuss a  number of cooperation projects between the two countries, but it  did not allow the delegation to enter and gave no reason. The  delegation returned on the same plane.    It is known that Sudan recently seized a number of buildings  where Egyptian irrigation engineers lived in the Sudanese  capital.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Arts: Nureyev's 'Bayadere' just hints at riches - Clement Crisp attends the opening performance of the Paris ballet season The ballet season began at the Paris Opera on Thursday night with Rudolf Nureyev's production of Petipa's Indian spectacular, La Bayadere. This has been a long-cherished project for Nureyev, but in view of his ill-health the staging can best be considered a sketch of what he might have achieved under happier circumstances. With sets by Ezio Frigerio and costumes by Franca Squarciapino, it looks opulent enough to have emptied a Rajah's treasury down to the last emerald. In interpretation, though, it only hints at riches: the Opera dancers don't yet know how to wear these jewels of dance and drama. When Nureyev first mounted part of Bayadere in the west he put on the 'Shades' scene for the Royal Ballet in 1963 - he was giving us the best of the work. The rest had been much edited and revised in Leningrad, with a massive cut in 1919 when post-Revolutionary stringencies lopped off the last act so that the story lost its denouement. Six subsequent producers laid hands on the text: what we see today at the Kirov Theatre is far from Petipa's original. It is nonetheless sustained, given credibility, by weight of performance tradition and the immense dignity of the Kirov dancers' style. We believe, because their every action speaks of belief. For Paris, Nureyev has reproduced the Kirov version, with the assistance of the distinguished Petersburg ballerina Ninel Kurgapkina. He had intended, I believe, to provide his own recension of the lost fourth act - as did Natalya Makarova in her 'complete' staging which we know with the Royal Ballet and with American Ballet Theatre - but circumstances precluded this. There are, otherwise, only a few small additions owed to Nureyev; the Minkus score (replete with those traditional Hindu waltzes) has been lightly cleaned by John Lanchbery, and is admirably played under Vello Pahn's baton. When he became director of the Opera Ballet in 1983, Nureyev put on Raymonda as his first production, and inculcated in his casts a sense of the harmonies of Petipa style which gave a commendable seriousness to the ensemble. This quality was too little apparent in the new Bayadere. Save for Elisabeth Platel's Gamzatti and Laurent Hilaire's Solor, interpretation was light-weight, self-centred. Visual extravagance seemed to underline a lack of faith in the text, as if luxury would impress where performance failed, and gorgeous trappings disguise a dramatic void. Frigerio has provided grand and somewhat claustrophobic settings for the Rajah's palace, and an oppressive facade for the temple in the crucial first scene. (PierLuigi Samaritani's painted back-cloths for Makarova's staging are to be preferred. They show the locales specified in Petipa's original libretto, and echo the production strategies of the Kirov version - whose ravishing scenery dates from 1900). The jungle vista in which Frigerio places the Shades is, however, most poetic; and Solor has a splendid property elephant - as in Petersburg - for his entrance in Act 2. Franca Squarciapino has plundered the east for fabrics, and for decorative ideas - the priests wear what look like small golden Burmese temples on their heads. Silk and sequins, gold thread and pungent Indian dyes, gleam and blaze; fantasy rather than historical probability is the key. Thus accoutred, the Opera dancers turn drama into a dress parade. Wearing tinsel and glitter, they propose tinsel and glitter in playing. A Russian Nikiya, emerging from the temple for the first time, carries her fate and the whole action of the ballet with her, as we known from Makarova and Asylmuratova. It is this vital sense of purpose that must now be given to the Opera casts as they start to explore La Bayadere. On Thursday the soloists in the Grand Pas and in the Shades scene offered vivacity instead of harmony; the Chief Brahmin was petulance incarnate; the Rajah had the nobility of a used-car salesman involved in a dodgy deal. Of course, in physical expertise and elegance of manner the Opera dancers are magnificent; their redoubtable skills, though, seem hardly to impinge upon La Bayadere. The Nikiya was Isabelle Guerin. Her reading was conscientious, but the heart of the role was untouched. (I wish she could see the spiritual fervour that fires Asylmuratova's playing.) Even her superbly easy account of the Shades scene was oddly unmoving, poetry lost amid flawless pirouettes. Happily, Elisabeth Platel has the physical and emotional assurance that bring Gamzatti to life. Whether glaring balefully at the end of the first act as she meditates vengeance on Nikiya - curtain-fall frozen by her basilisk gaze  -or showing a radiant assurance in the Grand Pas, she is mistress of the role. Laurent Hilaire is a fine Solor, bold in presence as in dance, and with a refinement of manner that compels our belief in this warrior hero. Since his earliest appearances in the West, the power of ballet's traditions has ever concerned Nureyev. In La Bayadere, as in his other classic stagings, he asserts the continuing potency of the old repertory and of the academic style. In this last gift to the Opera, he reaffirms his concern: his dancers have yet to comprehend the grandeur of the example he has given them. La Bayadere continues in performance at the Palais Garnier, Paris, until the end of October.</p>

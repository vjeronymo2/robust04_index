			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuwait, 30 Apr -- Kuwait's Central Bank Governor  Shaykh Salim 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Sabah ruled out in remarks  published here today that the decrease in world oil prices would  have a negative effect on the Kuwaiti dinar's exchange rate.    Shaykh Salim al-Sabah told Al-Siyassah newspaper in an  interview that the exchange rate of the Kuwaiti dinar was linked  to a basket of currencies of Kuwait's principal companies  dealing in trade and financial operations.    He clarified that the Kuwaiti dinar was unlikely to be  affected by the decrease in oil prices. He said that it would  not be devalued, especially if it was taken into consideration  that its exchange rate mechanism suited the Kuwaiti economy, had  proven to be effective in gradually lowering imported inflation,  and maintained relatively stable exchange rates against major  currencies.    Shaykh Salim al-Sabah said the strong performance of local  companies during 1992 and 1993, and the remunerative profits  which were distributed, helped maintain the stability of local  shares and fought off pressures to push them down.    The Kuwaiti Central Bank governor said the decrease in the  discount rate - which reflected increasing confidence in the  stability of the overall monetary system - would bring local  interest rates close to international levels.    He clarified that differences on interest rates on foreign  currencies was in the interest of the Kuwaiti dinar.    In the interview, he indicated that a reduction in the  interest rate of the dinar would help stimulate local economic  activities.    Shaykh Salim mentioned that the Kuwaiti Central Bank would  not obstruct local loans to banks but said that bank management  had begun to review their lending policies to test their  effectiveness. That was in harmony with the latest economic and  financial developments where a policy of awareness and caution  were being pursued.</p>

In a statement issued from Cairo yesterday the party called  for safeguarding Sudanese unity -- territory and people --  "toppling the [National Islamic] Front's regime," and holding a  national constitutional conference based on the Sudanese peace  agreement and the charter of the [opposition] National  Democratic Grouping.    It also stressed that the self-determination question in  Sudan has been settled since independence in 1956.    It pointed out that this issue has two aspects: a legal  aspect and a political aspect. It listed the documents opposed  to undermining national unity. It said: We are not listing the  legal stipulations and evidence to prove that there are no  regional problems in our country, but because political debates  must be based on solid legal and realistic foundations, from  which to proceed toward finding solutions to the new problems.</p>

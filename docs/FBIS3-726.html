President Jose Eduardo  dos Santos has sent a message to US Secretary of State Warren  Christopher and received Bill Clinton's special envoy. All of  this on the same day that the conference of the Angolan and Sao  Tomean episcopate has again urged the warring parties to allow  peace to return to Angola once and for all.    So, international pressure is growing, with the UN Security  Council due to pronounce on the future of UNAVEM-2 [United  Nations Verification Mission] in four days' time. Our colleague  Mario Ribeiro has heard the views of the two sides:    [Ribeiro] [passage omitted] President Jose Eduardo dos  Santos  had a meeting today with Stephen Morrisson, President Bill  Clinton's special envoy. No statements have been forthcoming  but we have learned that Bill Clinton's envoy expressed the  United States' commitment to helping Angola, but only after a  nationwide cease-fire has been signed. Angolan presidential  spokesman Aldomiro da Conceicao told Renascenca that the  government is committed to the success of the Lusaka talks, but  that UNITA is not:    [Begin Conceicao recording] The government has made the  concessions necessary for making it [success] possible, but, on  the other hand, there must also be goodwill, and above all  sincerity on our adversaries' part. [end recording]    [Ribeiro] In Luanda today, at the close of the General  Assembly of the conference of the Angolan and Sao Tomean  episcopate, the bishops urged UNITA [National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola] and the government to come to an  agreement and stop fighting once and for all. From Lusaka,  UNITA's Jorge Valentim said this was precisely his movement's  goal:    [Begin Valentim recording] This appeal speaks of a big heart  with room for all the Angolans. That is the kind of Angola we  want, an Angola that does not discriminate against anyone. We  want no more ostracism of the kind we endured last year. This  is why national reconciliation must be discussed in great depth,  and the exclusion law [as heard] must be abolished. And in  government too, there must be no posts barred to UNITA.

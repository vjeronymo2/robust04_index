			<p>BFN     [Text] From 4 to 7 June, Yue Qifeng, secretary of the  provincial party committee, conducted investigation and study in  Yichun city during which he pointed out: The most important  task facing the cadres and the masses across the province is to  conscientiously study volume no.3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping, further emancipate the mind, and realize the  change from the planned economy into the socialist market  economy. Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, Wang Xianmin, member of the standing committee of the  provincial party committee and secretary general, and  responsible comrades of provincial-level departments concerned  joined in the inspection tour.    Yue Qifeng and his entourage successively traveled to (Lang)  Township, and (Guyingzi) and (Nanxia) Districts in Tieli city to  inspect more than 10 state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises, joint-investment enterprises, township enterprises,  individual, and private enterprises, visited (Ma Yongshun), a  model worker on the forestry front, and (Chen Tongzhi), an  outstanding paddy rice grower. In every place they visited,  leading comrades of the provincial party committee extensively  contacted with cadres and masses at the grass-roots level, and  asked in detail about their situations in various aspects, such  as production, operation, and living. During his inspection,  Comrade Yue Qifeng gave some important views.    Yue Qifeng said: Since the third plenary session of the 11th  party Central Committee, we have greatly emancipated our minds  indeed. However, we must never overestimate this point.  Northeast China is the first region that entered the planned  economic front but the last one to leave it. At present, it is  still in a state of retreating from this front. Many  departments, enterprises, and units have still held fast to the  planned economic front, and the traditional concepts left over  by the planned economy still can be seen everywhere. Therefore,  emancipating the mind has remained our major task at present and  for some time to come. Only when our minds are emancipated, can  we further deepen reform, expand opening up, give full play to  the wisdom and ability of the people, and change the advantages  of resources into commodity and economic advantages. First of  all, leading cadres at all levels should emancipate their minds  and so do the masses of people. It is necessary to act in line  with the ideology and work realities, combine the emancipation  of minds with the specific issues in economic construction, and  grasp them conscientiously and firmly. If we do a good job in  emancipating the minds, our pace to advance will be rapid and  even [words indistinct].    Yue Qifeng pointed out: Heilongjiang is an important  industrial base of the state. For a long time, it has made  great contributions and sacrifices to the country's socialist  construction. At present, to readjust the production set-up, it  is not realistic to rely only on the efforts of the state. We  must rely on our own efforts. We should regard reform of the  property right system as a nucleus and expand the enterprise  reform strength. In the past, enterprises used to clasp  state-owned enterprises which were considered as the trump  cards. Actually, this is the sign of a big common bowl. We  should be determined to conduct reform of the property right  system in small state-owned industrial and commercial  enterprises and lease out or sell what should be leased or sold.  We should not continue to sit at home eating away our resources.    Yue Qifeng repeatedly stressed the necessity of grasping  enterprise management. He said: One of the major reasons for  enterprise deficits is lax management and discipline, having no  person to assume responsibility, and thus resulting in low  economic efficiency. Grasping management needs no investment.  But, we must [words indistinct]. Therefore, enterprises should  conduct activities on training internal skills, grasping  management, tapping potential, and increasing efficiency, raise  the management level, and enhance economic returns.    Yue Qifeng said: While attending to state-owned large and  medium-sized enterprises, we should exert efforts to grasp  township enterprises, high and new technology industries,  tertiary industry, three types of foreign-funded enterprises,  neighborhood collective enterprises, and individual and private  enterprises in an effort to cultivate new economic growing  points. These new economic points need very little investment  but have very rapid development rates and can yield economic  returns within a short time. At present, we should give a free  hand in the development of individual and private economic  units. In short, we should develop all types of enterprises and  actively support those who can be developed rapidly.    Yue Qifeng said: I have traveled to the forestry area to  have  a look of it and discovered that it is really rich in natural  resources and has treasures everywhere. It is necessary to  enhance the concept of market and the sense of commodity,  protect, cultivate, and develop the natural resources, and  transform the resources advantages into commodity and economic  advantages.    Yue Qifeng fully affirmed the achievements of (Nanxia)  District in developing small-scale processing of wood products  and pointed out: In this processing work, we may develop many  varieties. This work has great prospects. It is necessary to  give the people a free hand in running this business and let all  households do it. The government should do a good job in market  construction and service. As long as we change our minds, we  will not lead a poor life when there is a gold mountain nearby.    During investigation and study, Yue Qifeng emphatically  pointed out on several occasions: We should try by all possible  means to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses of cadres. He  said: When the people are eager to do a thing, they can even  move Thai Shan and when the people are not happy and not eager  to do it, nothing can be accomplished. Our cadres should strive  to make the places where they serve as officials prosperous.  This is the full expression of ability of political integrity of  cadres. To evaluate cadres, we must pay attention to the  achievements in their career and not to any relations. In the  course of building the socialist market economic system, as long  as we strengthen party building and mobilize the positive  factors of all sectors, all difficulties facing us will surely  be overcome, and the economic invigoration of Heilongjiang will  surely reappear under the socialist market economic conditions.</p>

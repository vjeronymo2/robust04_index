			<p>BFN     [Text] On 24 April, Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime  minister and foreign minister of the Liberal Democratic Party,  commented about his future cooperation with Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party]. He said: "If our policy goals are the same, it  is natural for us to begin by first joining our hands to do that  which is beneficial for Japan." Watanabe made his remarks in an  appearance on a program broadcast by FNN TV Network the same  day. He indicated he plans to continue seeking possible  cooperation with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and  other party members.    Watanabe disclosed his views, saying: "Under a single-seat  constituency system, there will eventually emerge two large  political parties." He then pointed out: "I doubt whether the  current coalition alliance would merge into a single party." He  thus disclosed his expectation that those advocating similar  policies will eventually form an alliance.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Dzhon Polishchuk] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg, 10 Feb--"The situation in Russia  will change drastically this year," Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) of Russia,  stated today. He has arrived at the city on the Neva at the  head of a group of LDPR deputies of the Russian parliament. He  asserted that the LDPR was already prepared to form a new  government since it "did not need to look for candidates for the  top posts".    In his characteristic manner, the LDPR chairman warned  journalists that they would be held responsible for attacks on  his party and for discrediting its program and methods of work.  He also threatened to take their television and radio  microphones and their newspapers.    In order to strengthen the position of the LDPR, its leader  again tried to exploit the problem of the position of the  Russian-speaking population in the republics of the former USSR  and also the foreign political aspects of the party's  activities. In particular, Zhirinovskiy stated that he viewed  relations with Japan and India as priorities. India, he  asserted, "is prepared to feed and clothe the whole of Russia if  it is allowed to have the products of the St. Petersburg  military industrial complex."</p>

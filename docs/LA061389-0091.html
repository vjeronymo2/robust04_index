			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIE MEMORIES  </P> <P> Three performers who appeared in "Gone With the Wind" helped mark the 50th  anniversary of the Academy Award-winning film at the annual Clark Gable  celebration over the weekend in Gable's birthplace, Cadiz, Ohio. On hand were  Cammie King Conlon, who played Scarlett and Rhett's child, Bonnie Blue; Patrick  Curtis, who was Ashley and Melanie Wilkes' infant son, and Fred Crane (the  former longtime classical music program host at KFAC in Los Angeles), who had  the role of Brent Tarleton, one of Scarlett's suitors. The celebration was  sponsored by the Clark Gable Foundation, which plans to build a theater and  museum where Gable films would be shown year-round. Gable was born in Cadiz,  but grew up in nearby Hopedale. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

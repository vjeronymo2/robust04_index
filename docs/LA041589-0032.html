			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRASH RECYCLING SOUGHT TO EASE PRESSURE ON LANDFILLS  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley, reviving a proposal that once cost a predecessor his job,  announced a comprehensive trash recycling program Friday aimed at cutting by  nearly half the amount of garbage destined for landfills.  </P> <P> If enacted by the City Council, as expected, the plan would require residents  of all 720,000 houses and small apartment buildings in the city to put their  glass and plastic bottles, aluminum cans, newspaper and yard wastes into  separate containers for garbage collection. A recycling program for businesses  and for buildings of six or more residential units will be proposed later.  </P> <P> "It is nothing less than an environmental vision of the future -- a time not  long from now when the people of this city will regard their trash as a  resource to be conserved and reused," Bradley said in announcing the plan,  which could begin this summer.  </P> <P> The proposal, created by a panel of city officials and outside consultants  during the last nine months, comes at a time when the city is running out of  room to dump its trash.  </P> <P> The city's primary landfill in Lopez Canyon is scheduled to close in 1992. A  proposal to stretch its capacity and keep it open through 2005 is being fought  by residents in its San Fernando Valley neighborhood. And privately owned  landfills that would accept the city's trash are scarce and expensive, city  officials said.  </P> <P> Key City Council members, who said they had been anticipating the recycling  proposal, said they think it will be approved although some struggle is likely  over how to pay for its roughly $33 million yearly cost.  </P> <P> In his annual budget proposal announced Thursday, the mayor proposed a trash  collection fee and suggested it could be increased later to pay for "other  solid waste programs."  </P> <P> "Over my dead body" was Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's response to the fee  proposal.  </P> <P> But the recycling program itself received immediate, enthusiastic support.  Councilman Marvin Braude, who will steer the recycling program through the  council and who joined Bradley at a City Hall news conference to announce it,  said:  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We Want a Better City'  </P> <P> "It's sending a clear message that the people of Los Angeles want to move  forward. . . . We want a better city . . . and we're going to do it in a  cost-efficient way," Braude said.  </P> <P> Council President John Ferraro said the council would likely support the  mandatory program, as it has backed other legislation aimed at controlling  growth of landfills. Councilman Ernani Bernardi, whose district contains the  Lopez Canyon landfill and who has been a leader on waste management issues,  said the proposal is "long overdue. . . . Recycling is a must."  </P> <P> Limited recycling projects are already in the works in several council  districts.  </P> <P> Even former Mayor Sam Yorty, who was swept into office in 1961 in part for his  promise to drop then-Mayor Norris Poulson's program of mandatory separation of  recyclable trash, said in an interview Friday that Bradley's plan is "much more  workable" than the one he had campaigned against.  </P> <P> For several years beginning in the 1950s, residents were required to save cans  for a once-a-month-pickup. Trash that was not properly separated was left at  the curb. At the time, Yorty called the separation requirement "coercion  against the housewives of this city."  </P> <P> While generally approving of Bradley's proposal, Yorty could not resist taking  a poke at his old rival: Why, Yorty wondered, didn't the mayor unveil his plan  -- and accompanying price tag -- before he was reelected Tuesday?  </P> <P> Under the proposal, each household would be given three containers: one 12- to  14-gallon plastic rectangular box for aluminum cans, glass and plastic bottles,  one 60- or 90-gallon container for yard debris and one 60- or 90-gallon  container for all other household garbage that is not recycleable. The larger  containers would be suitable for automatic collection by specialized trucks.  </P> <P> Newspapers, to be recycled, would be stacked on top of the can-and-bottle bin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Once-a-Week Pickups  </P> <P> Pickups would continue to be once a week.  </P> <P> Though separation of materials would be mandatory, homeowners would retain the  right to save recyclable materials for private sale. Scavenging would be  illegal on trash pickup days only.  </P> <P> About 90,000 households would begin recycling all but the yard wastes as early  as July. The rest of the households would be phased in within three years.  Recycling of yard waste would be added two years later.  </P> <P> During the first five years the program would cost about $46 million a year,  with an estimated $13 million earned back through the sale of recyclable  material and reduced landfill costs. The annual cost could balloon to $72  million a year during the next 25 years.  </P> <P> Among the financing programs being explored by a special mayoral task force is  a $3.66 per household per month fee to be levied against taxpayers, according  to Ed Avila, chairman of the Board of Public Works.  </P> <P> Braude said it may be possible to work the added recycling costs into the  general budget, though he was not able to identify what programs would have to  be cut.  </P> <P> "You're always paying for it in one way or another," Avila said.  </P> <P> Among the expenses are the replacement of 400 trash trucks with more modern,  automated vehicles, and the purchase of millions of recycling bins for  distribution to residents. The Sanitation Department would add 69 staff  positions to oversee the program.  </P> <P> Officials said there are some risks that the program could cost much more than  projected. Markets for recycled materials could dry up or become very  competitive and that could drive prices down, they said. And as yet, there is  no workable market for composting material, which officials hope to create with  recycled yard trash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public Acceptance  </P> <P> Avila said public acceptance remains the stumbling block to mandatory  recycling.  </P> <P> "It's a question of the elevation of public awareness and willingness to  participate," he said. Until two to three years ago, people balked at the idea  of having to separate their garbage, he said.  </P> <P> "It's been long in coming, but it's here now," Avila said. "History is  history."  </P> <P> Stephen Tobia, one of the private consultants who worked with the city to  formulate the plans, said public opinion surveys showed that 80% of Los Angeles  residents would cooperate. Only 6% indicated they would likely not cooperate  under any circumstances, he said.  </P> <P> In general, cities with similar programs -- including Santa Monica, Glendale,  Burbank, and Pasadena -- report good public cooperation, Tobia said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKING IT AS A COMPLIMENT  </P> <P> In reviewing my novel, "Blue Notes Under a Green Felt Hat" (Book Review, Aug.  6), Leonard Feather compared my literary voice to Robin Leach's TV voice.  Feather meant to be nasty, but I see it differently. Leach has a unique,  recognizable and humorous commercial voice. That's what I'm aiming for. My  novel is pop entertainment. Feather reviewed it as serious literature,  criticizing it for something it was never meant to be.  </P> <P> DAVID RITZ  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES  </P></p>

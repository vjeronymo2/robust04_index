In that determination, the Chief stated that the DOE did not find any documents responsive to the appellant's information request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In considering the Appeal, the DOE confirmed that the Chief followed procedures which were reasonably calculated to uncover the requested information, and had therefore undertaken an adequate search. Accordingly, the DOE denied the Pioneer Press request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

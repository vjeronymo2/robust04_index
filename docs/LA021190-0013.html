			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: HANDMADE;  </P> <P> 'SNOWFLAKED' CERAMICS  </P> <P> THE CRYSTALS IN Philip Freeman's crystalline ceramic glazes are reminiscent of  snowflakes on a moist woolen glove -- crisp, perfect and unique in this world.  In fact, customers have refused him commissions when they discovered it wasn't  possible for him to produce two identical pieces.  </P> <P> Freeman's technique hails from ancient China. A single coat of glaze is fired  to a peak temperature of cone 10 (2,350 degrees), and crystals start to form  much as frost forms on a windowpane. All the color is then pulled into the  crystal, leaving a lesser strength of color in the background and creating a  multicolor effect.  </P> <P> Freeman achieved one of the highest scores at last summer's Laguna Arts  Festival, but he wasn't exactly a long shot. The semiretired Saddleback College  sculpture and ceramics teacher has participated in the festival for the past 33  years. He primarily throws vases and bowls, though he does produce an  occasional sculptural piece such as marvelously realistic-looking Japanese koi,  which are glazed to mimic the flash of colors caused by the carp slipping  through the water. Freeman's koi are expensive treasures: $3,000 for each  22-inch sculpture. His small plates, bowls and trivets start at $100.  </P> <P>  Philip Freeman works out of his home studio in Dana Point, (714) 496-1488.  </P> <P> LORETTA PARAGUASSU  </P></p>

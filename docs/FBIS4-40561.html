			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Bychkov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 16 TASS -- The problem of the use of the  Camranh Base in Vietnam by the Russian Navy should be resolved  on the basis of new principles in keeping with the spirit and  demands of our time, Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, who  is on an official visit in Moscow, said in an interview with  ITAR-TASS today.    "The crux of the matter is that," the Vietnamese leader  recalled, "the agreement dates back to the period, when the  Soviet Union still existed. That is the reason today we are  signing a new interstate treaty with the Russian side, renewing  and improving previous accords." Vo Van Kiet did not elaborate  on details of the agreement, but he noted that the principles it  is based on "will conform to conditions prevailing in our both  countries today."    The Camranh base on the Vietnamese coast of the South China  Sea was modernized during the years of war waged by U.S. forces  in Vietnam. After America's retreat from Vietnam this facility  was changed into a material-technical support centre for the  Soviet Union's Navy. Currently the Camranh Bay is being used by  Russia on the basis of the agreement signed by the former Soviet  Union and Vietnam in 1981. The validity of the agreement  expires in 2004. The strength of the servicing Russian personnel  has been reduced to almost the one-fourth compared with that in  1980, and coordination with the Vietnamese side has been  converted to commercial basis.</p>

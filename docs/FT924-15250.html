			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Nurses urge pay body to stand firm UNIONS representing 600,000 nurses, midwives and health visitors yesterday urged the review body that recommends their pay to assert its independence and resist government pressure to recommend a low settlement. Nurses' unions have asked the review body for an 8.7 per cent pay increase. That is well above inflation and the increase in average earnings, which was 6 per cent in the year to July. It also poses a direct challenge to the government's attempt to drive down public-sector pay increases which, over the past year, have been larger than those in the private sector. Average pay in the public sector has outstripped average pay in the private sector for the first time since 1986. Unions representing the nurses say the 8.7 per cent rise is necessary to restore the value of nurses' earnings to 1988 levels. They have said that while their pay has kept pace with inflation it has not kept pace with increases in non-manual workers' pay. Unions say failure to bring pay levels back to those of 1988 will restore the image of nursing as a low-paid profession and lead to staff shortages. 'We do not believe the claim is pie in the sky,' said Mrs Judith Carter, chairman of the staff side of the Nursing and Midwifery Staffs Negotiating Council. The government, in its evidence to the Review Body for Nursing Staff, Midwives and Health Visitors, has called for 'an exceptionally modest increase'. The review body will report to the government later this year and the cabinet will decide early next year whether to accept its findings. Pay review bodies recommend increases for about 30 per cent of public-sector employees. The government may find that if the review bodies recommend high settlements it will have to take the unusual step of rejecting them, as it did earlier this year with the Top Salaries Review Body.</p>

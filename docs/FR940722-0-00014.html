			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCA's rationale for requiring director and senior officer compensation disclosures stems primarily from the ``at-risk'' nature of the stock and the significant number and wide distribution of shareholders, which are similar attributes to those of financial institutions with publicly traded stock. In terms of assets, the size of many FCS institutions is comparable to, and sometimes greater than, financial institutions whose equity and debt securities are widely held by the public. In addition, even if commenters are correct in their assertion that investors of FCS debt obligations are more concerned with the System as a whole, the FCA believes that the investor concerns addressed by the 1934 Act are not completely absent as suggested by commenters. Regardless of their motivation for purchasing the stock, borrowers make a financial investment in FCS institutions and obtain the right to participate in the affairs of those institutions. Shareholders can potentially benefit from their investment in terms of dividends and patronage refunds. Thus, shareholders need sufficient information to make intelligent decisions about the management and operation of the institutions in which they have invested and to hold directors and management accountable for their actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA stated in the preamble to the shareholder disclosure regulations published on June 12, 1986 (51 FR 21337) that while not all FCS institutions would meet the test for public companies, many of them have in excess of 500 shareholders, and the number of institutions with fewer than 500 shareholders continues to decline in conjunction with the trend toward mergers. Further, the FCA stated that while the stock is not publicly traded on the secondary market, it is held by over 900,000 individuals and business entities that have a common interest in the financial and operating information of the institutions. The FCA Board continues to believe that the distinction between holding stock for investment and holding stock for doing business with an institution does not have a material bearing on the right of shareholders to have access to information in order to make informed decisions. Therefore, the final compensation disclosure requirements continue to place CEOs of FCS institutions with a significant amount of assets and number of shareholders under the same scrutiny as CEOs of financial institutions with publicly traded stock subject to the registration requirements of the 1934 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Section 514 of the 1992 Amendments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCA agrees with the commenters that section 514 is quite broad and its interpretation, as it applies to compensation disclosures, is a matter of the FCA's discretion. Commenters stated that nothing in section 514 of the 1992 Amendments compels the disclosure of individualized senior officer compensation or concludes that the current disclosure requirements are inadequate in any respect. They felt strongly that the existing disclosure of senior officer compensation in the aggregate, coupled with the requirement that shareholders may request the individual compensation of any senior officer, or any other individual included in the aggregate whose compensation exceeds $50,000, was adequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There was no intention in the proposed rule to suggest that section 514 mandates individual disclosure of senior officer compensation. In section 514, Congress stressed the importance of disclosure of compensation paid to, loans made to, and transactions made with FCS institutions by directors and senior officers of the institution. Congress also directed the FCA to review its regulations to ensure that they meet the purpose of the section and applicable laws, but did not prescribe any specific regulation amendments. After reviewing its regulations, the FCA concluded that more detailed senior officer compensation disclosures satisfied the spirit and intent of section 514. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Board Accountability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters expressed concern that providing individual compensation information would undermine the board's authority and its ability to effectively administer the institution's salary administration program. Further, commenters asserted that the disclosure rule would dilute the board's responsibility and shift the oversight responsibility from the board of directors to the shareholders as a whole. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

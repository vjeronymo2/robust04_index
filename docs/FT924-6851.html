			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Technology: Driving down a 'superhighway' / A look at US president-elect Bill Clinton's plans for boosting technological competitiveness As speculation grows about US president-elect Bill Clinton's likely changes in policy, there is one safe bet at least: the new democratic administration will take a far more vigorous line on technology than its predecessor. Clinton has pledged to make research and development no less than a national priority, in line with his vision of technology as 'an engine for economic growth'. Thus his technology policy is set to be activist, aimed at boosting private and public spending on the development of technologies with broad potential economic benefits. Before the election, Clinton asserted: 'Leadership in developing and commercialising new technologies is critical to regaining industrial leadership, creating high-wage jobs and ensuring our long-term prosperity.' He has cited Japan and Germany as countries to emulate. To some, his approach signals a radical and disturbing change in Washington: a switch to interventionist 'industrial policy' with bureaucrats 'picking winners and losers', an idea anathema to Republicans. Yet Clinton stresses that the primary responsibility for industrial competitiveness lies with the private sector. He adds, however: 'It is imperative that we recognise that government has a role in encouraging pre-competitive technology development, encouraging dual-use (military and commercial) technologies, supporting industry-led consortia and making the most of technological advances.' While there may be deep philosophical differences between the new president and his predecessor, Clinton's approach to boosting industrial competitiveness does appear in many ways remarkably similar to that of President Bush. Bush has, for instance, supported funding for Sematech, the semiconductor industry consortium, and significantly increased funding for civilian or dual-purpose research and development. On the campaign trail, Bush trumpeted his support for greater co-operation between federal laboratories and business. But among high-technology industry executives, who have long urged more government action to stem the declining technological leadership and international competitiveness of US industry, Clinton is expected to give higher priority to stimulating competitiveness than did president Bush. The man charged with putting this policy into effect will be vice president-elect Al Gore, a decade-long campaigner on technology and telecommunications policy issues. Its key elements are contained in a blueprint of Clinton's technology policy, circulated in September: Investment in 'information superhighways', or advanced communications networks linking research laboratories, universities, hospitals, schools, and ultimately even homes. Reform of federal R&amp;D programmes to focus on critical technologies such as advanced materials, information technology and new manufacturing processes. Reform of the National Laboratories, reassigning 10 to 20 per cent of their Dollars 23bn (Pounds 15bn) annual budget to joint ventures with industry. Creation of a 'world-class business environment' through changes in US tax, trade and regulatory policies. This means making the R&amp;D tax credit permanent, providing tax credits for investment in new equipment, and ensuring that depreciation schedules reflect rapid technological obsolescence. A 50 per cent tax exclusion would be provided for entrepreneurs who make long-term investment in new businesses. Investment in technology programmes aimed at small businesses, establishing 170 manufacturing extension centres. The budget of the National Institute of Standards and Technology would be doubled and industry-led R&amp;D consortia supported by matching industry funds. Establishment of education and training programmes for a high-skill workforce. This would include set standards and a national examination system in core subjects, a new national apprenticeship programme, and incentives for industry to invest in worker training. The most ambitious, and potentially most expensive, of Clinton's proposals is the development of advanced communications technology for information superhighways. Clinton aims to make this project a symbol of a national effort to regain technological leadership, akin to the space race of the 1960s. His proposal builds upon the existing High-Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) programme, a pet project of Gore, which last year won the support of the Bush administration. HPCC already includes research to deploy a high-speed research and education network linking universities and government laboratories. Clinton wants to broaden the scope of HPCC to include funding for national networks linking schools, hospitals and libraries, which would serve as a catalyst for commercial developments. Such a network 'could do for the productivity of individuals at their places of work and learning what the interstate highway of the 1950s did for the productivity of the nation's travel and distribution system,' Clinton predicts. His plan to create a network of 'manufacturing extension centres' throughout the US is designed to 'diffuse' technical knowledge and new manufacturing techniques among small- and medium-sized businesses. Currently there are fewer than 30 government-funded manufacturing technology centres in the US. Clinton maintains that the US government must match the efforts of foreign competitors such as Japan and Germany. Critics charge that existing US manufacturing centres have not yet proved their worth. A more fundamental question is, however, raised by the possibility that if these manufacturing extension centres succeed in encouraging many businesses to adopt the latest automated manufacturing technology, many job losses will follow, which is not what the president-elect has in mind. Overall, Clinton proposes giving 'generic industrial technologies' a higher priority in the federal research and development budget. Currently, the US government spends about Dollars 76bn per year on R&amp;D of which military work consumes about 60 per cent. The president-elect aims to shift the balance to 50 per cent defence and 50 per cent commercial, providing about Dollars 7bn in new spending for civilian R&amp;D programmes. Even then, the US would trail Germany and Japan in private and public spending on non-defence R&amp;D as a percentage of gross domestic product. 'Civilian industry, not the military, is the driving force behind advanced technology today,' Clinton says. 'Only by strengthening our civilian technology base can we solve the twin problems of national security and economic competitiveness.' A central element of Clinton's technology policy is to forge a 'new partnership' between government and business. He plans to 'create a forum for systematic private sector input into US government deliberations about technology policy and competitiveness'. This represents a fundamental change in the US, where government has traditionally been a watchdog over business with a relationship that is frequently adversarial. It is a measure of Clinton's success in moving toward this 'new partnership' that he is backed by several high-technology industry leaders, among them John Sculley, head of Apple Computer, and John Young, former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. Perhaps the biggest challenge facing Gore will be to establish a central focus for the co-ordination of technology policy, drawing together programmes which currently span several departments and agencies. This may involve the formation of a civilian version of the Pentagon's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency which has taken a controversial leadership role in government funding for dual-use technologies over recent years. However, such plans remain vague. Clinton also recognises the need to seek changes in the way multiple congressional committees authorise R&amp;D spending, 'making it nearly impossible to set priorities among competing programmes'. But however his ambitious plans work out, the fact that Clinton looks like being the first president to put technological competitiveness high on the policy agenda is alone seen by many industrialists as an important step forward.</p>

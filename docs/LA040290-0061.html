			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIVIDED E. GERMANS UNITE AGAINST CURRENCY PLAN  </P> <P> East Germany's two main parties, haggling over the makeup of a coalition  government two weeks after the country's first free elections, united Sunday to  attack a West German proposal for currency union.  </P> <P> Angrily distancing himself from his West German patrons, East Germany's likely  next prime minister, Lothar de Maiziere, told reporters he was not consulted  about Bonn's proposal.  </P> <P> It would exchange the East's ostmarks for Western deutschemarks at a 2-to-1  rate, apart from small personal savings.  </P> <P> De Maiziere, speaking after talks with the Social Democrats, said he sees no  reason to go back on his election promise to have ostmarks swapped with  deutschemarks at par.  </P> <P> His comments heralded a potential rift with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,  who helped the Christian Democrats to victory in the March 18 election. The  dispute could stall hopes to complete monetary union by July and slow the pace  of full unification.  </P> <P> The Social Democrats, debating whether to join the Christian Democrats in East  Germany's first non-Communist government, said they support De Maiziere's  position on currency union. But talks remained bogged down on whether to  include the Christian Democrats' right-wing allies, the German Social Union.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Above the Redline" column by National Assembly member </F> Fawzi al-Mashhadani: "Prices of the State and Mixed Sectors'  Products"]    [Text] It seems that the soaring prices fever has not only  affected the private sector's products, but also the state and  mixed sectors' prices. If we consider the phenomenon carefully,  we cannot attribute it to the economic blockade, which has  recently been viewed as a source of all problems, including the  soaring prices phenomenon. Most companies and establishments  are still using their assets of the raw materials that were  stored before the economic blockade, as well as some  alternatives, in order to perpetuate the production process.    At the same time, we know that the unjust economic blockade  has halted the import of raw and supplementary materials.  Therefore, the surge in the prices of these establishments'  products cannot be attributed to the increase in costs. Aside  from increases in the workers' wages, no change occurred in the  framework of the cost. Therefore, the level of costs in these  establishments is still reasonable because the elements of the  cost, except the wages, have not changed to justify the rise in  prices by more than three to five times the prices a year ago.    If we review these prices, we will find, for example, that  the prices of the products of the State Enterprise for Leather  Industry have risen by more than five times. A pair of men's  shoes that were sold for 50 to 70 dinars in 1992 were sold for  185 to 400 dinars in 1993. This also applies to all the items  this state enterprise produces. The same is also true of  textile companies and electrical industries. However, the rise  in the prices of the mixed sector's products was much more than  that of the state sector. The prices of the Light Industries  Company's products have increased up to 4,500 to 6,000 dinars.  [sentence as published] Similarly, the prices of the products  of the Electronics Industries Company, the dyes industry, the  alcoholic drinks industry, and other mixed sector establishments  have also risen.    Scientifically speaking, the rise in these prices can be  attributed to the policy of increasing the profits of the  project instead of the establishment's production capacity, or  that this phenomenon has nothing to do with economic laws, which  seek to increase the net income by using the means of production  in the best way, working to introduce scientific inventions in  the production process, raising the level of production, or  reducing the costs to the lowest level possible in order to  raise the margin of profit to a reasonable level in harmony with  the nature and trends of prices in the market of commodities and  industry.    This shows that these establishments have abandoned their  responsibility, as well as the social duty required from  economic and production units, instead of reflecting their  eagerness to improve the level of performance. This can be  interpreted by a defect in the economic behavior. These  establishments behave like the private sector traders, who  define their prices in light of foreign currency exchange rates  in the parallel market. This behavior has harmed price levels  and led to higher inflation rates. Therefore, it can be  considered as part of a wrong behavior, which will damage the  economy by fixing unrealistic prices that do not reflect the  economic situation and production relations.    During a meeting with the Council of Ministers, leader  President Saddam Husayn, may God preserve him, instructed that  the state enterprises depend on the true cost rather than the  standard cost, search for opportunities to reduce the costs, and  adopt austerity measures to limit spending. The concerned  industrial establishment is required to take these instructions  seriously and not to adopt such a behavior to define the prices  of their industrial products, just as the private sector does.  This fever may also affect the fines imposed on citizens  violating the instructions of Baghdad municipality and health  and traffic rules.</p>

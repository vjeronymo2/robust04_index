			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 500,000 MARCH IN BEIJING; CHINA PROMISES REFORMS;  </P> <P> 'LIKE OUR HOTHEADS': GORBACHEV  </P> <P> Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang today promised students on a hunger strike  that China will take concrete steps toward democracy, one of the demands by the  500,000 people jamming Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> As China's leaders held a historic summit with Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev inside the Great Hall of the People, protesters surged onto its steps  today and turned the adjoining 100-acre square into a vast parade ground,  including 3,000 students on a 4-day-old hunger strike.  </P> <P> Hundreds of police and soldiers guarded the hall's entrances, but no police  were seen in the square.  </P> <P> After midnight, Zhao sent a message to the students on behalf of the party  Politburo Standing Committee, the highest party body, saying it affirmed their  patriotic spirit in calling for greater democracy and attacking official  corruption.  </P> <P> He also promised that the government won't punish them and will "work out  concrete measures to enhance democracy and law, oppose corruption, build an  honest and clean government and expand openness."  </P> <P> The message addressed key demands of the students, but it was not clear whether  they will be satisfied. He did not accede to a demand for a dialogue with  officials, to be broadcast live.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Reforms Overnight  </P> <P> Gorbachev, in his meeting with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping today, raised the  issue of the unprecedented protests raging in Beijing and said, "We also have  hotheads."  </P> <P> Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, stayed clear of the mass of student  demonstrators for a second day today.  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov told reporters that  Gorbachev raised the student issue with Deng and expressed confidence that the  Chinese leadership could resolve the situation "for the benefit of the entire  country."  </P> <P> " 'We also have hotheads' is what he said," Gerasimov reported. "He said both  sides have their hotheads who want to renovate the system overnight. Gorbachev  said this was, of course, impossible.  </P> <P> "He said this does not happen overnight. That only happens in fairy tales,"  Gerasimov said.  </P> <P> Gerasimov said Gorbachev also raised the question of the demands of the  students as expressed in their banners and slogans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Who Is More Interested?'  </P> <P> "We also have our slogans. They are similar to what our slogans, the slogans of  our party, were. After all, who is more interested in renovating the system  than the party that introduced the reforms?" Gorbachev was quoted as saying.  </P> <P> When asked whether Gorbachev's remarks about "hotheads" meant that he was also  referring to the Chinese students as such, Gerasimov stumbled and said  unconvincingly that the Soviet leader was referring to Soviet radicals only.  </P> <P> He then repeated: " 'We also have hotheads' is what he said."  </P> <P> The Soviet leader, on his way back to the state guest house after lunch with  Deng, avoided Tien An Men Square but stopped his car and got out to shake hands  with pedestrians, New China News Agency reported.  </P> <P> Raisa Gorbachev earlier toured the national library with Zhu Lin, the wife of  Premier Li Peng. She, too, walked into a crowd of spectators upon her arrival  and greeted them with handshakes and hellos in Chinese.  </P></p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Political developments hold the key Political developments held the key in three of the world's emerging markets last week. Istanbul, already sharply down since the beginning of the year, was the week's biggest loser. The market became nervous when it decided that this Monday's local elections were a key test of whether the coalition government of Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, could be trusted to tackle the looming economic crisis. The gloom was compounded as Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit ratings agency, downgraded the country's debt and placed it on credit watch, suggesting that the rating might be lowered even further. Mexico and Brazil both had bumpy weeks. Mexico began firmly on a combination of political and interest rate considerations, before the country was shaken by Wednesday's assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate. The market was closed on Thursday as a mark of respect and it was left to Wall Street to respond with a sharp fall before local investors returned in remarkably resilient form on Friday. Sao Paulo shares recovered from worries early in the week about higher interest rates and rising inflation fore-casts as speculation mounted that Mr Fernando Henrique Cordoso, minister of the economy, would run for president.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               Dollar terms                No. of stocks        Mar 25     % Change     % Change                                       1994    over week   on Dec '93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina               (25)         931.50        +1.2         -6.3 Brazil                  (57)         326.26        -0.5        +40.2 Chile                   (25)         590.89        +0.6         +7.1 Colombia1               (11)         946.70        -2.1        +46.8 Mexico                  (69)         919.96        +3.9         -8.1 Peru2                   (11)         149.37        -2.7        +23.5 Venezuela3              (12)         732.93        -3.4        +23.8 East Asia China4                  (18)         108.60        +5.2        -27.2 South Korea5           (156)         117.93        -3.7         -0.2 Philippines             (18)         254.70        -1.2        -25.2 Taiwan, China6          (90)         119.40        +1.2        -11.7 South Asia India7                  (77)         122.66        -2.6         +5.3 Indonesia8              (37)         100.27        -5.1        -19.6 Malaysia               (105)         248.10        -5.3        -26.8 Pakistan9               (15)         431.71        -1.0        +11.3 Sri Lanka10              (5)         210.84        -2.5        +19.0 Thailand                (55)         353.22        +4.3        -26.0 Euro/Mid East Greece                  (25)         265.90        -0.9        +16.8 Hungary11                (5)         235.56        -1.1        +41.4 Jordan                  (13)         175.44        -0.7         +6.0 Poland12                (12)       1,138.48        -7.9        +39.2 Portugal                (25)         135.17        +0.9        +18.8 Turkey13                (40)          95.34       -12.6        -55.2 Zimbabwe14               (5)         283.63        -3.3        +40.3  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Local currency terms                No. of stocks        Mar 25     % Change     % Change                                       1994    over week   on Dec '93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina               (25)    571,594.55         +1.2         -6.3 Brazil                  (57) 383,587,742.4         +8.5       +277.5 Chile                   (25)      1,014.78         +0.1         +6.5 Colombia1               (11)      1,377.44         -2.0        +48.6 Mexico                  (69)      1,323.42         +4.9         -1.4 Peru2                   (11)        198.66         -2.7        +24.9 Venezuela3              (12)      1,920.10         -2.1        +35.1 East Asia China4                  (18)        119.42         +5.2        -27.2 South Korea5           (156)        125.24         -3.5         -0.2 Philippines             (18)        333.45         -1.2        -24.9 Taiwan, China6          (90)        118.29         +1.2        -11.6 South Asia India7                  (77)        135.65         -2.6         +5.3 Indonesia8              (37)        116.97         -5.0        -17.8 Malaysia               (105)        249.08         -5.3        -26.1 Pakistan9               (15)        596.01         -0.9        +12.8 Sri Lanka10              (5)        225.11         -2.6        +17.9 Thailand                (55)        355.11         +4.4        -26.5 Euro/Mid East Greece                  (25)        438.76         -2.3        +14.1 Hungary11                (5)        287.39         -2.6        +42.3 Jordan                  (13)        253.73         -0.5         +6.0 Poland12                (12)      1,589.21         -7.7        +43.9 Portugal                (25)        159.98         -0.4        +15.8 Turkey13                (40)        971.96        -11.6        -33.2 Zimbabwe14               (5)        336.70         -3.9        +57.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

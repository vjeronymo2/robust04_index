			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Gas companies break their traditional mould: Rapid growth opportunities in the global energy market BRITISH GAS engineers from Liverpool lay pipes to connect the sleepy town of Kelbra in the foothills of the Harz mountains to the east German gas grid using technology developed in the UK. Enron, the US gas transit company, unveils one of the world's largest gas-fired combined heat and power stations on Teesside in the UK at a total cost of Pounds 895m. Both projects are evidence of the growing trend among gas companies to break out of the traditional confines of their domestic markets and extend their global reach. 'We are moving into a new era of gas and you will see the growth of the gas majors in a similar way to the development of the oil industry in the 1950s,' said Mr Ken Lay, chairman of Enron. Mr Lay has ambitious plans for Enron to be one of the first truly global gas companies, but he faces intense competition from British Gas and other European energy companies such as Spain's Gas Natural and Belgium's Tractebel. But Mr Jonathan Stern, analyst at Gas Strategies, a consulting group, believes that since the gas business is so capital intensive, companies will be financially constrained from developing a worldwide network in the way the oil industry has done. 'It will become a regional business and is already becoming dominated by about 20 companies with strong local bases which are expanding into specific markets overseas,' he said. Gas Natural, for example, is looking to expand into overseas Spanish-speaking markets and focusing on opportunities created by the wave of privatisation in South America. Gas companies' global ambitions rest on the back of a growing trend towards de-regulation and privatisation in the world energy business, accompanied by expectations of huge growth in gas demand over the next 20 years. 'The worldwide gas market is expanding fast and it offers a unique opportunity for huge growth to some of the companies that are getting involved now,' said Mr Simon Blakey, gas analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Gas is becoming more attractive as an alternative to coal and oil because of its environmental advantages - it is much cleaner to burn - and its price is competitive. In a cautious estimate for the growth in global gas demand by 2010, Royal Dutch/Shell group puts consumption at 2,500bn cubic metres from the current level of 2,000bn cubic metres. The rapid growth in gas demand poses a huge challenge for the energy industry. In a recent speech, Mr Roland Williams, gas and coal co-ordinator for the Shell group, estimated that the cost of finding, producing and transporting new gas to the main markets over the next 20 years will be between Dollars 800bn (Pounds 519bn) and Dollars 1,100bn. The oil companies have so far stuck mainly to gas exploration and production, resisting involvement in distribution or power generation, which could prove the more lucrative market sectors. Gas is not a globally-traded commodity in the way oil is, and gas companies will have to develop the expertise to operate differently in different parts of the world. Gas distribution is an area where companies such as British Gas, which has rapidly developed its own domestic markets, can offer technology and know-how with the financial muscle to invest in developing transit networks. 'We have expertise in all parts of the gas chain and we want to grow in all directions, but our real knowledge is in developing gas markets,' said Mr Russell Herbert, director of British Gas's Global Gas business. This has seen British Gas tapping into potentially lucrative markets overseas. The company is active in 45 countries. But competition is intense  -European gas companies fear their market monopolies may be broken up by the EC and many are looking to diversify overseas. These new markets offer great growth potential, but bring with them a bigger risk of regulatory interference than exists in gas exploration and production. Countries privatising their utilities have often looked to the UK for a model and here, British Gas has suffered at the hands of the regulator. However, established gas companies such as British Gas, Gaz de France and Ruhrgas have great marketing expertise they can offer countries developing their gas businesses. Technology usually means they can offer cost savings in running a market and they also have the cash to invest in large scale projects. Gas distribution companies are also moving into oil exploration. British Gas is currently involved in negotiations to develop the giant Karachaganak field in Kazakhstan, which would double its existing gas reserves. Germany's two main gas companies, Ruhrgas and Wintershall, are looking to buy into exploration acreage in the North Sea. British Gas's need to expand is driven by more pressing concerns: its UK market is being actively eroded by regulators and government. The company is under investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which could lead to substantial changes in its UK business. The UK regulator has already warned the company that it will not be able to finance expansion overseas by raising prices in the UK. The next 10 years, however, should see the transformation of the gas business from the current domestically-focused supply chains into a much more global industry.</p>

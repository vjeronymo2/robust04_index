			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sainsbury weaker There were strong rumours in food retailing circles that Mr Bob Emmott, the former joint deputy managing director of Wm Morrison Supermarkets who resigned earlier this week, would next week turn up in a senior position at J Sainsbury. If true, it would represent a considerable coup for the latter chain. Morrison's shares benefited from support from BZW and gained 7 to 141p. Sainsbury weakened 4 to 443p.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Working Life: Linen without all the tears - Style Whether the British like it or not, linen just won't go away where fashion is concerned. It's a fabric more often accepted for the bed or table. Its tendency to crease horribly frustrates those who wear it. Yet this summer there is more of it than ever. There are linen garments of every sort and all prices in the shops this summer. Classic good buys are Racing Green's shirt, in a wide choice of colours and easy to wash and iron, or its Pounds 99 linen jacket (by mail order or from the Racing Green shop in Regent Street). Marks and Spencer do a reasonably tailored linen suit for Pounds 100. The three-button double-breasted style, with matching trousers, is similar in look to the top-of-the-range Giorgio Armani version, in cream, brown or navy which is a lifetime investment for Pounds 1,300. On the continent and in the US, where summers are hotter and longer, linen is seen as a godsend - cool, comfortable, natural and ecologically sound. In Italy, where men in pale summer suits have lunch a casa, it only takes a little persuasion and Mama or the maid will re-press their Armani linen for the afternoon, a service that's almost inconceivable in Britain. A label in John Rocha's crisp, pale beige, three-quarter length pure Irish linen coat, announcing that the look of the fabric might change after dry-cleaning, is a daunting prospect. But, says David Tothill of London's speciality dry-cleaners, there is nothing to fear if the job is done professionally. 'Beware of thinking you can look after linen at home,' he adds, 'since it's the reshaping and pressing of the garment after washing (this takes three or four times longer than most fabrics) which completes the process. 'English women don't understand linen like continental women do. It is a luxury fibre, expensive and difficult to care for. It can come alive if it's professionally looked after but wash it yourself and you could end up with a shiny finish which is hard to reverse.' Tothill has another warning. Linen will eventually end up with permanent creasing in areas that always crease with regular wear, and no amount of cleaning or pressing can alter it. For converts, however, there is nothing like it. Those who appreciate the natural qualities of linen can ignore the down side. 'There isn't a more natural fabric,' says Rocha, UK Designer of the Year. 'As the years go by the fabric gets more mature and both the look and feel get better and better. It's perfect for summer.'

			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: THEY NEVER PROMISED HIM A ROSE GARDEN  </P> <P> In one of the classic murder mysteries, it turns out to be the judge who done  it. The author obviously played on the surprise generated by the fact that  judges are presumed to be innocent.  </P> <P> Judges may assign guilt and innocence right and left, but up there on the bench  they are understood to be themselves blameless and without sin. Not true, of  course, and, as I should have realized before, there is a certain delight being  able to sit in judgment on a judge.  </P> <P> Judging the Miss America contest sounds like heaven to any healthy male, until  he realizes that he has found a sure-fire way to make dozens of gorgeous women  angry at him with a flick of the pencil, and in the process has convinced  millions of equally healthy males that they could have chosen better than he  did.  </P> <P> When I agreed to be one of the three judges of this year's centennial  Tournament of Roses parade, it did not occur to me that we could be  second-guessed by half a million on-the-spot witnesses and an additional 300  million or so elsewhere on the globe.  </P> <P> But one newspaper, after canvassing a handful of parade-watchers, quickly  concluded that we and they must have been watching different parades. The fact  that the curb-side watchers could not agree among themselves on the worst  mistakes the judges had made was some slight consolation.  </P> <P> What also hadn't occurred to me was what hard work judging 55 flower-draped  floats was going to be. The Tournament of Roses is fiendishly well-organized,  with a century's worth of experience codified into do's and don'ts, as the  recent series in The Times indicated. The tournament could probably give  organizational lessons to Ma Bell, IBM and the Masons.  </P> <P> Our hosts gathered us up at 6 a.m. on Saturday for a 12-hour tour of the  construction sites, which stretch from Glendale to Downey and which were damp  and chilly last weekend. We took a second look Sunday on another 12-hour day,  again beginning at 6 a.m., noting the progress as the floats flexed their  animated muscles and thickened with blooms.  </P> <P> We'd hardly finished when we were picked up again at 2:30 Monday morning for a  final look at the floats, now in their parade positions in the eerie,  floodlighted darkness along Orange Grove Avenue.  </P> <P> Six hours later, when the parade passed our sleepless eyes, we three judges  winced a couple of times (at least) for the floats we wished we could have  honored.  </P> <P> You'd think with 18 trophies to be spread among 55 floats you'd surely be able  to salute all the deserving entries. But like any art form -- and designing  floral-decorated floats is an art form, however you rank it with sculpture and  needlepoint -- this kind of design does not stand pat; it progresses. There was  a lot of good work to choose from.  </P> <P> Computers, advanced hydraulics and miniaturized motors are now part of the  float vocabulary. The Casablanca Fan Co. float (out of competition because of  its immense size), with skiers doing midair loops, is a very far cry from the  flower-covered carriages of the first parade.  </P> <P> Yet, technologies aside, the shaping hand of the designing artist is still what  matters, and the best floats, so we concluded, were not necessarily large or  costly (although they could be both) but were simply very beautiful. The parade  theme, "Celebration 100," was broadly interpreted and one of the most striking  floats celebrated the whale and other endangered sea species.  </P> <P> The surprise, I think, was how much of its originating impulse the Rose Parade  still retains. Despite the fact that the tournament has become a very big (if  nonprofit) business and that the grandest floats represent corporate  investments of $100,000 easily, there is no substitute for the thousands of  hours of volunteer labor. (The volunteers at the commercial firms are paid but  are often earning money for their churches, schools and charities.)  </P> <P> There are still the modest self-built entries from the surrounding cities like  Burbank, Sierra Madre and La Canada Flintridge, and it was a special pleasure  to be able to honor one of those floats for its spritely wit.  </P> <P> The danger to the parade, as to many aspects of American life, is the  distending, distorting pressure of commercialism and television.  </P> <P> The television coverage began with a 15-minute mini-revue before the grandstand  that struck me as television at its variety-show dreariest, awkward, corny  dialogue and all, despite the fact that the attractive young singers and  dancers were locals -- from Cypress College. It wasn't Pasadena and it wasn't  the Rose Parade, and while some sort of kick off moment isn't a bad idea,  another year it ought not to suggest "Follies" on an off night.  </P> <P> The parade reprises some of the elements in American life now deemed to be in  short supply: community spirit, collaborative effort, the beauty of natural  things (when they have not been completely chopped, ground and reworked for  purposes of illustration) and a sense of innocence and good humor, silly as the  jokes sometimes are.  </P> <P> At their best, the floats are worth a fervent "gee whiz!" and there are not as  many honest "gee whizzes" around as there might be.  </P> <P> My fellow judges, Pasadena artist Helen Pashgian and C. Wade Roberts, chief  horticulturist at the Sherman Gardens and Library in Corona del Mar, have  doubtless been reminded, as I have, of the biblical injunction "judge not, lest  you be judged." We should probably have thought of that sooner, but then we  would have missed a remarkable experience.  </P></p>

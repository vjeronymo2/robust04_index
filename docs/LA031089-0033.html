			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> The world of Norman Schwab's mixed-media painting constructions is a gloomy and  impoverished place, defined by black-painted pieces of cloth, bedraggled bits  of string, twigs bound together to form skimpy triangles, black crosses in  little boxes, sad photo-etched imagery (a sorrowful young man in the Army,  innocent people gunned down by snipers) and incongruous swaths of wallpaper  printed with little ducklings, which the artist paints over in various ways.  </P> <P> There are pieces that convey an earnest attempt to create a particular mood and  attitude, but too often it comes across as hollow and secondhand. Schwab  borrows certain elements from arte povera -- the use of "poor" or "innocent"  materials, a deliberate starkness -- but without being able to endow the work  with the all-but-magical power it needs to make an overwhelming impression. As  it happens, the concrete, undramatized images (mostly from newspaper  photographs or snapshots) that Schwab incorporates into the works generally  have a good deal more power than the ritualized settings he creates for them.  </P> <P> A few pieces, however, offer an overall fresher approach. In "Demise of a  Stone-Cutter," a wooden ammunition box filled with sharp stone shards in a bed  of mulch and earth, Schwab combines various ideas and images -- war, a  gravestone, futile attempts (at chipping the stone), craftsmanship and the  shape and purpose of an individual life.  </P> <P> Bay Area artist Barbara Milman's mixed-media works on paper are busy and  bright. Layers of multi-directional little images -- skulls and hands and  hearts and fish and crosses and heaven knows what else -- create a steady  drumbeat that reads primarily as all-over pattern. For the most part, this  bouillabaisse of familiar imagery does not seem have anything fresh to say. The  more successful pieces are the ones (like "Patterns of Chaos" and "The Secret  Garden") in which the broth is made up mostly of abstract markings and  garnished with the steadying effect of superimposed black shapes.

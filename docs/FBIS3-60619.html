The MAINICHI SHIMBUN quoted a senior U.S. official as saying  that attacking North Korea's nuclear facilities would be very  difficult, although President Bill Clinton and Defense Secretary  Les Aspin had said they would not rule out military action  against the communist country.    The Pentagon has been looking into possible options,  including a pre-emptive air strike, with the understanding that  military action will be difficult if Pyongyang acquires nuclear  weapons, the U.S. official said.    But Washington came to the conclusion that it is impossible  to destroy North Korea's nuclear facilities with missiles or  bombs if they are moved underground, he said.    Bombardment of reactors or nuclear fuel storage sites was  ruled out as it is most likely to result in a release of  radioactivity, he said.    In addition, Washington had to consider the possibility of  Pyongyang's retaliating and devastating South Korea, the  MAINICHI observed.    Seoul is a strong opponent of an attack and, considering all  of the odds, a military attack on North Korea's nuclear  facilities is highly unlikely, the newspaper commented.    The Japanese daily noted there were calls for an air attack  if the situation worsens from conservative U.S. congressmen and  some military experts, but they lost ground with Washington's  reaching this conclusion.</p>

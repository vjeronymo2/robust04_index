The team met with a  number of Lebanese and Syrian officers in al-Biqa'. During the  tour, the team was accompanied by six military vehicles carrying  special units from the Lebanese Army as well as an armored  vehicle that belongs to a U.S. security team.    Shaykh Nabil Qawuq, Hizballah Consultative Council member,  held a news conference in Sidon in which he called for the  release of all Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners held in Israel  in exchange for releasing two [as heard] Israeli soldiers  captured by Hizballah. Shaykh Qawuq denied that Israeli pilot  Ron Arad is being held by Hizballah, adding that knowing his  fate is a matter that concerns Israel. He also denied any  direct contacts between Hizballah and the U.S. Congress. He  noted that the United States is a full partner with Israel and  therefore cannot act as a mediator. [passage omitted]    According to the latest reports, the U.S. team concluded its  visit to al-Biqa' at 1500 today and left for Syria. The team is  supposed to hold a news conference in Damascus to announce the  results of its visit to Lebanon.</p>

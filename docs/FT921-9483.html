			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Management: Poachers turning gamekeepers - Recruitment / David Goodhart considers whether employees should pay a transfer fee to change jobs Football clubs do it, the armed services do it; so why shouldn't companies? Putting a value on employees and insisting that they or a future employer pays something when the staff member leaves is not entirely foreign to British traditions. So why not use the idea to help combat the poaching of highly trained employees, as the government suggests in yesterday's Employment White Paper? Fear of poaching is thought to be part of the reason for under-training in British industry. Curiously, little empirical work had been done to show the real extent of the problem but the fact that it is widely perceived to be a problem is sufficient to make it one. It may be that employers are merely finding an excuse for inadequate training; surveys have shown that more than one-third of employers cite poaching as a reason for not training. It is also true that training tends to be high in industries where transferability of skills is low, such as in the nuclear industry or teaching. Employers' organisations used to run anti-poaching pacts, but such agreements and the organisations themselves have now gone out of fashion. With heightened awareness of the importance and expense of training, the cost of poaching is a current concern. Greg Clark of the Business Performance Group at the London School of Economics has calculated that the average cost of losing a middle-ranking employee is Pounds 70,000. He arrives at that figure by adding up the cost of recruitment, formal and informal training, and an employee's learning curve. Sig Prais at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research points out that the easiest way to stop poaching is to follow the example of Germany and to pay trainees low enough wages to make it economically worthwhile for companies to over-train. But as that seems to be impossible, erecting barriers against the training free-riders is the best alternative. The Labour Party's idea is a training levy, under which employers who did not spend 0.5 per cent of their wages bill on training would have to pay that sum to a special fund. But the government wants to examine how employers could extract some of the cost of training from employees who leave before a specified period of time has elapsed after training. The government says that the legal uncertainty which currently plagues attempts to do just that must be cleared up and the procedure brought within the jurisdiction of industrial tribunals. Michael Howard, the employment secretary, is a recent convert to the idea that more must be done in this field. As recently as last month, he was arguing that employers already have the means to bind people until some of the cost of training has been repaid. And recent legal precedent seems to support his original argument. In 1990, a US company, Electronic Data Systems, won a battle in the High Court in London to make an employee honour an agreement to pay Pounds 4,500 of his training costs if he left within three years of completing a course. Such contracts are common in the US, and although less common in the UK, they can be found in sectors like information technology. Viewing training as a loan which has to be repaid is a concept supported by Clark. He says that companies like British Aerospace could specialise in training and supply smaller companies which could not afford the cost of expensive training equipment. In such cases, it would presumably be the small employer who would pay, or perhaps a combination of the small employer and the employee. Clearly, when employers want to poach badly enough, they will simply 'buy-out' an employee, as Goldman Sachs did recently when it paid Pounds 10,000 for a Treasury economist. However employers seem relatively cool towards the idea of greater use of training contracts. The spring industry, based in Redditch, suffered badly from poaching when the economy was booming. People trained as statistical process controllers were often using their certificates as a ticket to a new job. But Michael Parkinson, chairman of Airdale Springs, says that restrictions must not be put on people's career paths, adding that poaching is 'an attitude problem not susceptible to legislation'. Edward Roberts, chairman of Heath Springs, echoes that view, saying: 'Employees won't be poached from good companies'. Peter Ashby, senior consultant of Fullemployment UK, does not like the idea of 'transfer fees' believing that it is bad for the employees. He prefers the idea of individual training accounts, already used in many companies, where employees share in the cost of their training, especially where it is of no immediate benefit to the employer. One growing problem that transfer fees cannot deal with is the disincentive to training in large organisations. An economist working in one of the clearing banks has pointed out that since training budgets have been devolved local managers want to train only for their immediate technical needs and not send staff on general management courses. But the new emphasis on repaying training costs ought to be welcomed by one large part of the economy, the public sector, which has always over-trained to the benefit of the private sector.</p>

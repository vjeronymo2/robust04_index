			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Western groups sign Russian telecoms deal France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, the German state operator, and US West, a US Baby Bell regional operator, have signed a memorandum of understanding with Russian partners to develop Russia's long distance telephone network. The initial investment to launch the project will be only 'several hundred million' dollars, but the Russian ministry of communications believes it could lead to a total investment of Dollars 40bn over the next decade. It will be channelled through a joint venture company. Meanwhile, AT&amp;T, the biggest US operator, has signed an agreement with three Russian operators to upgrade Moscow's telecoms network, providing 400,000 new phone lines. The four-year project is expected to cost Dollars 200m. AT&amp;T said it would give Moscow upgraded digital telecoms facilities 'comparable to other cities with modern networks'. Analysts believe these investments and others announced in recent months, although significant, fall far short of the level required to provide Russia with a modern telecoms network by the turn of the century. According to the World Bank, the former eastern bloc requires between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 15bn of telecoms investment a year - about half of it from the private sector - if it is to build a basic telecoms infrastructure by 2000. Russia has barely 15 phone lines per 100 people, compared with 43 in western Europe. France Telecom said its project with Deutsche Telekom and US West would include the construction of 50,000km of fibre optic cables, and could result in a doubling of Russia's 22m telephone lines. However, the three western telecoms groups and their two Russian partners - Russian Overlay Network and Rostelecom - have yet to develop a business plan for the project, and one is not expected to be agreed until next year. The project has been dubbed 50x50, because it envisages the construction of 50,000km of fibre optic cables and more than 50 digital exchanges. According to a statement from the three western companies, the capital will be raised from their own resources, the sale of telephone concessions and by the participation of investors.</p>

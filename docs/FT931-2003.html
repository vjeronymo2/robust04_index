			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (16): Reducing the paper mountains - The Electronic Office JUST when you thought it was safe to joke about the 'paperless office,' the convergence of a number of technologies is making it possible. Early attempts at the paperless office failed because no matter how many computers a company bought, paper kept arriving in the post. But now a number of companies are starting to store both incoming mail and computer files electronically. They include Nirex, the UK company tasked with finding long-term storage for Britain's nuclear waste, IBM systems house Triangle Computers and the mortgage department of Barclays Bank. Later this month, scientists at Nirex will receive all their post electronically. The contents of their filing cabinets are also being turned into electronic files. So in future when they need information, they will be able to use a database (a computer-based library) to retrieve all the information available, whether it be letters, in house reports or external research. No-one wants a nuclear waste repository nearby and Nirex's ability to respond quickly and efficiently to questions about safety could determine the success or failure of its plan to site the repository at Sellafield. The idea is that the system will provide a single-source of information, both for office work and for operational tasks, such as construction and maintenance. It will be one of the first systems to do this. Yusef Eisa, the company's new information technology (IT) director, says: 'The data contained in the system will constitute the corporate memory and is therefore an important asset. Information on the nuclear waste repository will have to be kept indefinitely because future generations may need to look at it.' Nirex's system (called Fred - for Fast Retrieval Electronic Database) illustrates the way different technologies are coming together. It is a combination of established and emerging tools combined in a new way by two UK-based suppliers: image processing company Trimco and free-text specialist Kinesis. The tools include: Traditional office automation products, such as wordprocessing and electronic mail. Personal computers (PCs) connected by a network. Image processing. This enables paper documents (including any signatures/graphics) to be turned into electronic images, which can be displayed on a computer screen. Optical character read (OCR) technology. This is being used to 'read' electronic images (which can't be altered) and turn them into computer files, which can be edited. Structured and free-text databases. Structured databases allow users to look for specific information, such as everything received on a particular date, or written by a particular person. Free-text databases are useful for retrieving everything written about a specific topic, eg'reprocessing plants.' Workflow software. This helps to route information automatically between workers involved in a common process and improve the information flow. High-quality graphics and computer-aided design software. This will enable engineering drawings, designs and maps (for both construction and planned maintenance) to be included in the second phase of the project. Groupware software (which supports team work). For example, Nirex plans to use 'red-lining' - a form of shared editing - to underline and add margin notes to online reports and drawings which have to be approved by several people. How it works Paper-based information, such as a letter, will be scanned into the new system. An electronic image of the letter will appear on a large screen in the mailroom. Then the post clerk will key basic details about the letter (such as date, author of letter, and addressee) into an Oracle database index. The image will then be sent to a queue on a Sun workstation. From there, OCR software will produce a text file of the image. The image and its associated text file will then be forwarded to a specific department, where further words will be typed into a structured index. Finally, the image of the letter will be stored on an optical disk and the text version will be loaded into the BRS/Search database. In the second phase of the project, it will also be possible to load wordprocessed documents into the free-text database very easily. And to link them with other files. For example, an outgoing letter might be linked with an incoming letter. The idea is that when a user carries out either a structured or a free-text search, he/she will get as full an answer as possible. If a structured search does not retrieve the information required, the user can try a free-text search - or vice versa. In addition to database searches, users will be able to send each other images via electronic mail. Groupware benefits However, Nirex's approach is not the only way of reducing the paper mountain. According to Roger Whitehead, editor of the Groupware News newsletter: 'Many different combinations of old-fashioned office automation and new-fangled groupware products can support new ways of office working. They can help conquer the boundaries of time and space, enabling people who are normally separated by different time zones or different locations to work together on the same project.' Typical groupware applications include workflow; shared editing systems; group decision support; and conferencing and information management. For example, last month Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch multinational decided to use Lotus Notes (one of the best-known groupware products) to break down communications barriers between its international offices. Notes provides information management as well as information distribution and can be used to exchange graphics, photographs, figures and text. Unilever expects to have over 10,000 Notes users. Mike Johnson, worldwide head of IT at Unilever, says it will be used to 'support team-working, and the sharing of information from desk-to-desk, worldwide.' This will reduce the paper flow. But Triangle Computers, a Notes reseller, has decided to dispense with paper altogether. Every piece of information that comes into the company, gets scanned into Notes and thrown away. Douglas Drysdale, the company's technical director, says: 'People are basically lazy. They make better use of information if it is at their fingertips, rather than a short walk away in a filing cabinet. In the end, it boils down to efficiency.' For some, reducing the paper mountain can open up new business opportunities. Barclays Bank's Intermortgage division has started to use Filenet imaging technology to convert its mortgage correspondence files into electronic documents. This has speeded up the time taken to approve mortgage applications and cut costs. Before long, it plans to process all loans electronically. Gordon Charlesworth, who is responsible for image processing at the division says: 'In the third and fourth quarter of this year, we will start scanning all the post that arrives in the mail room in to the image processing system. This will be phased in a department at a time.' As the division's processing costs have fallen, it has started to attract business processing mortgages for other lenders. It hopes to win more business of this kind in future. Changes in technology could mean that the paperless office becomes less of a laughing matter and more of a serious competitive advantage.

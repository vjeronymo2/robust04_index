			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / International Bonds: Crisis of confidence rips heart out of Ecu sector and hype - over reality? The Ecu bond market, long touted as the future face of European capital markets, ground to a halt last week as the pent up pressures within the exchange rate mechanism finally took their toll. Traders returning to their desks this morning face an unenviable task. How do they convince investors that the market is still open for business when on Friday they had sent the clearest possible message that it is not? Banks which act as market makers in Ecu bonds were relieved of their normal obligations to trade with each other at quoted prices - though only for one day. Traders claimed that this did not stop investors dealing - as, in fact, many were said to have done on Friday. But if the heart of the market's mechanism has been ripped out, how much of a market can truly be said to remain? And is the concern that spread through the investment community on Friday likely to ease quickly? The tension in the Ecu market had been clear since early June, when Danish voters gave their damning verdict on the Maastricht plans for economic and monetary union. It took the German Bundesbank to finish the job. Its move a week and a half ago to raise the German discount rate by  3/4 point gave the latest nudge to a market which already seemed to be tottering on the edge of an abyss. Ecu bonds duly fell off. The yield on the 10-year benchmark, the French government's 8.5 per cent OAT due March 2002, had risen by the end of the week to just under 9.5 per cent, up around 25 basis points on the week and more than 50 basis points in the last month. Perhaps a more significant indicator is that Ecu bonds are now thought to be worth less than the sum of their parts. As optimism over monetary union gathered momentum last year, yields on Ecu bonds fell to less than the theoretical yield of a basket of bonds made up of the component currencies - a sign that investors were prepared to pay a premium to invest in the prospect of monetary union. One result was a rapid increase in the amount of bonds being issued in the international markets. As the graph indicates, borrowers turned away from issuing Ecu instruments in their domestic markets to rely more heavily on international investors last year. After the Danish vote, though, the premium on Ecus vanished. Although it returned briefly, the discount disappeared again last week, as 10-year yields climbed to as much as 40 basis points over the 'theoretical' level for Ecus. Many banks were said to have been running long positions in the Ecu for some time. Last week, as more investors moved to unload their own stock, the one-way tide of paper finally forced the market makers to call it a day. As the week wore on, there were already complaints that market makers were not answering their telephones or were otherwise making themselves unavailable. The International Securities Market Association, which oversees the market, took no immediate action. 'ISMA has to police this better,' one Ecu trader complained. ISMA's sub-committee overseeing the Ecu market duly decided on Friday that enough was enough, and rather than try to force market makers back to their phones, it imposed a one-day 'time out' to allow traders to recover from their battering. Market makers argued that it was impossible to run a market when conditions had deteriorated so fast. 'We are the messengers rather than the cause of the problem,' complained Mr David Ovenden, head of the ISMA sub-committee. Why should things be any better today than they were last Friday? With the French referendum on Maastricht nearly two months away, there seems little prospect of confidence returning to the Ecu market. And the current overhang of paper will persist for some time. It seems that a core of market makers will regroup and re-establish the semblance of a market. Although there have officially been 44 market makers in Ecus, around three quarters of them in London, the real market has concentrated in perhaps 10 or a dozen banks, among them Paribas, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, CCF and Indosuez. Enough of these core banks indicated on Friday that they would start making markets again today to suggest that the market will return. Also, the maximum spreads market makers are allowed to quote have been widened to help protect them against a renewed round of selling. For most bonds, maximum spreads from today will have doubled. It may also take official intervention to bring some confidence back to the market. The Bank of England and the French Treasury were in contact with market makers on Friday, concerned about the fate of their Ecu-denominated securities. The message they were given: they should be prepared to intervene themselves to put a floor under Ecu bond prices. 'I wouldn't be surprised, if the markets stayed volatile, to see some sort of action from the central banks,' said Mr Ovenden. Such assurances may help to shore up the market for now. But it is still likely to be a long and bumpy ride to the French referendum on September 20.</p>

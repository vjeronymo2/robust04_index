			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Observer: Perks for EC pensioners The removal of Germany's capital from Bonn to Berlin is causing awful soul-searching in the political establishment, not to mention among the good property owners along the banks of the Rhine. So it's nice to hear of some people who stand to do rather well out of it - for doing nothing. The European Commission, bless its boots, has decided that it must recalculate the 'central co-efficient' according to which its employees in Germany get their salaries calculated, and ex-Commission pensioners their pensions. Instead of using Bonn's cost of living for the central figure, it will now use Berlin. Of course, Berlin is a rather more expensive place to live in than Bonn. If Brussels is rated at 100, Berlin stands on 104, and Bonn on a modest 95. Any suggestion that every EC official in Germany is suddenly going to get a fat pay rise is roundly denied. Berlin, Bonn and the research centre in Karlsruhe all have their own specific co-efficients, to which salaries in each place are tailored accordingly. However, that leaves all the EC pensioners in Germany, whose salaries are tied to the 'central' co-efficient. So for them, a nice little windfall of almost 10 per cent, assuming the Council of Ministers approves the juggling.</p>

The Vienna-based IAEA is waiting for Pyongyang to provide an  official message signed by Atomic Energy Industry Minister Choe  Hak-kun for any kind of breakthrough in the situation in view of  past negotiations with the communist regime, Meyer said.    There has not been any message from Pyongyang since  unofficial contact between working-level officials from each  side on Wednesday [5 January], he said. But IAEA expects North  Korean response regarding nuclear inspections soon and will  continue to be on the alert this weekend, he added.</p>

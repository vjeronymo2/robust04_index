			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Undated statement by the Russian Social Protection Ministry </F> under the "Officially" rubric: "On Pension Indexation and  Compensation"]    [Text] In connection with the appearance in certain mass  media of a report about the Russian Federation Pension Fund's  so-called "denial" regarding the question of pension indexation  from 1 May this year, the Russian Social Protection Ministry  considers it necessary to state the following.    The Russian Federation Pension Fund is a financial and  credit  institution, therefore the explanation and interpretation of  pension legislation does not come within this organ's terms of  reference. All necessary information on questions of applying  existing pension legislation, as well as on normative acts being  drafted in this sphere, is given by the Russian Federation  Ministry for the Social Protection of the Population.    The Russian Social Protection Ministry confirms the  information given at a press conference 9 April 1994 that from 1  May this year the implementation of the Russian Federation  president's edict No. 2121 of 10 December 1993 "On Increasing  Previously Fixed Labor Pensions," begun 1 April this year, will  be continued.    Under this edict earnings before 1 January 1993 on which  pensions are calculated are subject to an 80-percent indexation  (increase). This measure is intended to rectify the  miscalculations made when determining the size of the  coefficients used to "index-link" past earnings.    This provision is being brought into effect in three stages  from April through June 1994: from 1 April in relation to  pensions fixed up to and including 1981; from 1 May in relation  to pensions fixed in 1982-1987; and from 1 June in relation to  pensions fixed in 1988-1992.    From 1 May this year there will be another indexation  because  of the increase in prices for consumer goods and services. The  actual level of indexation is being determined at the moment.  In addition it is intended to retain the existing compensation  of 19,700 rubles payable in addition to a pension.    Indexation and retained compensation because of price  increases will be payable over and above the level of a pension  increased under the Russian Federation president's edict of 10  December 1993.    [Signed] Russian Social Protection Ministry Press Service    In addition, the ministry clarified that the maximum pension  is three times the minimum pension, not counting compensation.</p>

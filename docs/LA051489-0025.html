			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBUM REVIEW: '9';  </P> <P> PUBLIC IMAGE LTD. "9." VIRGIN. **  </P> <P> Relentlessly witty, acerbic and outspoken, Johnny Lydon is a great personality.  He should have his own counterculture talk show -- then he wouldn't feel  compelled to make records as mundane as "9." Were it any other musician, "9"  might coast by on its big, bombastic, made-for-KROQ propulsion, its expert  musicianship, its incorporation of Arabic tonalities and Brit-funk rhythms into  a wall of murk.  </P> <P> But we're dealing with the formative figurehead of punk-rock (Sex Pistols) and  what came after (PiL's original spacey, free-form meanderings). Lydon's  sneering wail is intact (if buried in the mix), but considering that his past  work included searing, scabrous views of abortion (the Pistols' "Bodies") and  hallucinogenic jabs against capitalism (PiL's "Careering"), things like "9's"  banal warnings about a "Brave New World" seem pretty vacant. Only a facsimile  of his former rotten self, Lydon proclaims at one point, "I am a warrior! I  take no prisoners!" Adam Ant couldn't have expressed it better. CRAIG LEE  Ratings are based on a scale from one (poor) to five (excellent) stars.  </P></p>

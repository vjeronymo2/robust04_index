			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Christian Democratic Movement, by Roman Vegh; place and date not  given: "Conditions for Three-Member Coalition of Ethnic  Hungarian Parties"]    [Excerpt] [Vegh] The all-Slovak Council of the  Coexistence Movement has decided to form a coalition with the  Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] and the Hungarian  Civic Party [MOS] for the fall elections. [passage omitted] You  must be pleased with that decision.    [Bugar] I am not so enthusiastic about the decision. There  are matters on which we had already agreed with Coexistence--for  example, that the conditions for the formation of a coalition  would not include a common club of deputies because it is far  more advantageous to have two clubs than just one. When someone  formulates this condition, nonetheless, and adds that, if the  MKDH does not agree, there will not be a coalition, he is  actually shifting the blame to us. I cannot agree with that.  We have therefore resolved to inform the mass media about every  meeting we hold on the formation of the three-member  coalition--if, for no other reason, than to let the voters find  out who is actually slowing down the formation of the  three-member coalition and who is asserting only narrow party  interests. When something like that happens, all of society  must know about it. We cannot play a game in which the voter  learns about the result but does not know anything about its  course. We will not accept that.    [Vegh] How do you assess the conditions that Coexistence set  for MOS?    [Bugar] So far, we only know about them from the press,  which is why we have called for an early meeting with  Coexistence to discuss them. It could very well happen that we  will not agree with some conditions. As I have already said,  even now we disagree with a common club of deputies. Moreover,  I am curious whether MOS, too, will agree with the conditions  that have been published in the media. Personally, I do not  consider it appropriate to say in advance: Take it or leave it.  That is an ultimatum that need not be accepted.</p>

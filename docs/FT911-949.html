			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: Nestle confident despite sales drop NESTLE, the Swiss group and the world's biggest foods company, yesterday disclosed a 1.8 per cent decline to SFr11.1bn (Dollars 7.6bn) in first-quarter turnover. However, it said full-year 1991 sales and earnings were expected to show an improvement. Exchange rates had moved more favourably during April, and sales and earnings should improve over the next eight months, said Mr Helmut Maucher, managing director. The goal was 4 per cent growth by volume in 1991, he said. Nestle's sales for the quarter, in Swiss franc terms, had lost 8 per cent through negative currency and price factors, said Mr Reto Domeniconi, general manager in charge of finance. Internal growth had been an 'excellent' 5 per cent, with a further 1 per cent coming from new acquisitions. Currency fluctuations, principally the depreciation of the dollar, were the main factors behind the decline in Nestle's sales and profits last year. Sales shrank by 3.5 per cent to SFr46.37bn, and cash-flow dropped 3 per cent to SFr3.88bn. Net consolidated earnings, at SFr2.27bn, were down by 5.8 per cent. Nestle had said earlier the figures hid a 3.5 per cent increase in sales volume. According to the annual report released yesterday, net profit per share in 1990 was SFr617 against SFr656 in 1989. The board plans to pay an unchanged dividend of SFr200 per share, raising its often-criticised payout ratio to 32.4 per cent from 30.5 per cent in 1989. Had Nestle reported in dollars, like its US competitors, group sales would have shown a 19.3 per cent increase to Dollars 36.5bn in 1990, Mr Domeniconi said. Net earnings at Dollars 1.79bn would have been 16.5 per cent higher than in 1989, while the net profit per share would have grown 16.3 per cent to Dollars 486. Exchange rates had a favourable effect on Nestle's financial position last year. The fall in the Swiss franc value of its borrowings in foreign currencies helped to produce a reduction of SFr1.2bn to SFr4bn in net debt. Shareholders' funds amounted to SFr13.4bn at the end of 1990. Liquid assets totalled SFr5.5bn, up by SFr1.3bn over the year. Mr Maucher said that although Nestle planned no big acquisitions in the near future, he would not exclude one should an opportunity arise. Referring to the legal block on a capital increase imposed by a small group of shareholders, Mr Maucher said the Federal Tribunal was due to give its ruling on June 25. He said Nestle had no urgent need of capital and saw no point at this stage in diluting shareholders' holdings with a new issue. In a drive for greater efficiency, McKinsey, the US business consultants, are advising on streamlining Nestle's head office in Vevey. Re-organisation is affecting the US and UK businesses in particular. Carnation, the big US milk foods company bought in 1985, is being merged with Nestle's other operations into one unit, Nestle USA, with a Dollars 7bn annual turnover, under a new chief executive, Mr Tim Crull. Mr Peter Blackburn, former managing director of Rowntree, acquired in 1988, is returning to the UK after two years in Vevey, where he headed Nestle's chocolate business. He will head the single organisation, with a Pounds 1.4bn (Dollars 2.4bn) turnover, into which Nestle is merging Rowntree and its other UK businesses.</p>

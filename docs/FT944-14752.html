			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Six steps to untether trade: Kim Chul-su, candidate to head the WTO, outlines his priorities It is difficult to be objective about a process in which one has been so closely involved. But I think it is fair to say that the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, and the World Trade Organisation to which it gave birth, will be seen by historians as one of mankind's most valuable achievements. Eighty years after the start of the first world war ended a century of relative peace and rising prosperity, the principles of free trade advocated by the great 19th century liberal thinkers are gaining near universal acceptance. Both the idea of free trade and its institutional expression can no longer be seen as part of an ideological arsenal - or indeed as a means whereby an affluent 'north' seeks to exploit an impoverished 'south'. Recent experience shows that a worldwide free trade system can provide developing countries with a fast track to economic development if they can stay the course and avoid doctrinal detours. But developed nations are no less dependent on free trade for their continued economic progress. The contribution of trade to economic growth in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has been steadily rising and this trend will continue. For the world as a whole, international commerce acts as a powerful integrating mechanism. It exerts a humanising influence on politics, culture and social life. In the 21st century, I believe it could form the basis of a new global civilisation, characterised by the peaceful interplay of competition and co-operation. That, in short, is why the WTO is so important. And yet the outcome of the Uruguay Round was a close-run thing. At several points, the process of reaching agreement almost ground to a halt - most notably at the 1990 Brussels ministerial meeting. Even now, six months after the final Uruguay accord was signed in Marrakesh and less than three months before the scheduled launch of the WTO on January 1, some 90 contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have yet to complete their internal ratification procedures. Clearly, the first director-general of the WTO will be more than just 'present at the creation', in the memorable phrase of former US secretary of state Dean Acheson. The organisation will doubtless bear the impress of his professional style, modus operandi and personal philosophy for many years to come. He will, unavoidably, be called upon to set precedents that will guide his successors and help chart the future direction of the WTO. Therefore, I believe that any candidate for this post has an obligation publicly to state which tasks he would accord the highest priority. In my view, there are six: First, expediting completion of the unfinished business of the Uruguay Round. This in-cludes negotiations in the services sector and new issues for further market liberalisation. Second, promoting expansion of the organisation to ensure that it becomes a truly universal institution. The admission of China, Russia and some 20 other prospective members will create a unified, worldwide multilateral trading system for the first time in history. I hope that the most populous of these countries - China - will be a Gatt signatory soon, in time to become a charter member of the WTO. Third, ensuring that the benefits of the Uruguay Round accrue to all WTO members, irrespective of size, region or developmental status. In the past, developing nations have often felt that their interests were not adequately represented in the Gatt. The Uruguay Round was the first time the developing world took an active part in the Gatt round. The WTO, by combating protectionism and fairly enforcing trade rules, can help narrow the gap in living standards between developed and developing countries. Fourth, strengthening the rule of law in the international trading order through effective utilisation of the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism. This major reform denies the parties to a dispute the effective veto over a settlement that they had under the Gatt. As a result, the WTO should be able to resolve trade disputes faster and more fairly and effectively. Indeed, the credibility of the WTO will depend to a great extent on how well it meets these expectations. Fifth, co-ordinating the work of the WTO with that of the World Bank and the IMF. The original proposal at Bretton Woods to establish an 'International Trade Organisation' to complement the Fund and the bank was never realised. Now, 50 years later, the WTO will fill the gap. The mandates of all three overlap and interface at so many points that a high degree of co-ordination is needed if each is to yield maximum benefits. Sixth, preparing the ground for dealing with trade-related issues that go beyond market access. At the front of the queue is the question of trade and the environment, for which a committee has already been set up within the Gatt. Other issues brought forward by some members include the relationships between trade and subjects such as competition policy, investment and labour standards. I think it is essential to recognise that these issues are complex and do not admit of easy, black-and-white solutions. All involve trade-offs and value conflicts over which reasonable men and women may surely differ. That is why our first task in dealing with them should be to acquire a sufficient basis of scholarship and research to enable us to discuss these issues intelligently. During its 50 years of existence, the Gatt achieved enormous success in reducing tariffs and opening markets. More than any other institution, it has shaped today's global economy. However, it was not without structural defects, and its potential was limited by the fact that it could operate on only one side of an ideological frontier. Moreover, during its last decade or so, the Gatt system seemed increasingly hard-pressed to deal with the rising challenges of protectionism, regionalism and unilateralism. The WTO was designed to avoid the defects and weaknesses of its predecessor. And the end of the cold war has eliminated the barrier to a globally inclusive membership. Thus the auspices look favourable for the inauguration of the WTO on January 1. This is the kind of opportunity for mankind that comes along rarely in history. It is one that, both literally and figuratively, we cannot afford to squander. The author is minister of trade, industry and energy for South Korea.

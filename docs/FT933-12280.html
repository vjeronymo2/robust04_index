			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Sleeping beauties - Jancis Robinson unearths some classics at bargain prices / Wine THANK GOODNESS some wine merchants are being pro-active about this recession. Too many British merchants have been concentrating solely on improving their range under Pounds 5 a bottle, often rather belatedly - 'Now let's see, where is this place Oc?' But some have been alert enough to realise that some of the best wine buys around are of classic wines desperate to find a buyer. The most obvious examples of this have been vintage ports, particularly 1983s and 1985s, which have been going for a song at auction and have been retailed by the single bottle for hardly a couple of songs. Oddbins has had the delicious Smith Woodhouse 1983 at just Pounds 11.99 a bottle, not much more than when it was released. But perhaps the richest hunting ground for fine wine bargains at the moment is Burgundy, where both negociants and individual domaines are suffering a severe case of post-opportunism. Throughout the 1980s these sheltered producers of prototype Chardonnay and Pinot Noir could hardly keep up with demand. Prices, and yields, rose accordingly. Many wines, especially whites, came less to express place than grape variety, contrary to the spirit of France's appellation controlee law. Meanwhile, the rest of the world's growers of these grapes made rapid strides in producing wines with more finesse and integrity, but at much lower prices. The result is that in too many cases burgundy became over-priced and under-expressive in comparison with its counterparts elsewhere (particularly parts of California, Australia and New Zealand, although the New World is yet to rival Burgundy at its best). Even more importantly than this, burgundy (a bit like champagne) is associated with the extravagances of the 1980s, and stocks in the Burgundy region have been sleeping beautifully, awaiting a wake-up call from the princely likes of Tony Mason of Majestic, Graham Chidgey of Laytons, and Robin Crameri of Peatlings. All three have made notable raids on the cellars of Burgundy, although Chidgey is a particularly veteran campaigner. Majestic is selling through its wine warehouses 3,000 cases of growers' burgundies at prices that would have been unthinkable this time last year, although some of the examples I tasted exhibited some of the faults of some growers' burgundies: an earthy lack of fruit. Nevertheless, neither their Bourgogne Rouge 1991, from Mongeard-Mugneret, nor their Bourgogne Rouge 1989, from the Maconnais Domaine de la Chapelle, are to be sniffed at when offered at Pounds 5.99 a bottle - and the Chablis 1991 is a very respectable mouthful for Pounds 4.99. Chidgey has found a clutch of genuinely interesting white burgundies under Pounds 10, currently available either at Laytons, of London NW1 (071-388-5081), or by the bottle from Andre Simon shops in central London. Jean-Marie Guffens, the talented and idiosyncratic Belgian whose sky-high Pouilly-Fuisses have long been sold by Laytons, now has his own negociant house, Verget, buying in grapes from Cote d'Or vineyards. Verget's Bourgogne Blanc 1991 is a fascinating hotchpotch of leftovers. The subtlety and depth of flavour transmitted by fermenting lesser wine on the lees from various famous vineyards can be tasted. And Laytons' own Pouilly-Fuisse 1992, made in Ropiteau's cellars, is tailor-made for those who complain that the punch has gone out of white burgundy. Both wines sell for about Pounds 9 for a single bottle, or about Pounds 8 as part of a case. Perhaps most enterprising is Peatlings' special offer of domaine burgundy, bottled in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. In an uncharacteristically snazzy booklet, the wine division of Greene King, the East Anglian brewers, is offering four red 1991s and three white 1992s at extremely competitive prices. Here is a rare opportunity for the humble wine drinker to benefit from boardroom machinations (as Bernard Pinault has done by buying Ch Latour so advantageously from Allied Lyons). The wines are the produce of eminently respectable Burgundian sources and taste delightfully frank and true - most of them genuinely of the terrain. I found the best white by quite a margin was the Chassagne Montrachet 1992 from Michel Colin's own vines, and was thrilled by all three 1991 reds from Lucien Boillot: the charming Volnay at Pounds 9.99 for the next year or two, and the premier cru Volnay, Les Angles at Pounds 11.99 and the Gevrey-Chambertin at Pounds 9.99 for keeping. The Gevrey is probably the best buy of all. Peatlings, which has a shop in London EC1 as well as 26 in East Anglia, is also offering free cellarage of all wines bought through them - a not inconsiderable incentive. There are also bargains to be had higher up the scale, and not just in Burgundy. Farr Vintners, of London SW1 (071-828-1960), has been selling Bonneau de Martray's famous Corton Charlemagne 1987 at the silly price of Pounds 150 a case, and has a number of claret bargains too. Meanwhile rivals Cave Cru Classe, of London SE1 (071-378-8579), has a special offer of Domaine Ponsot's highly acclaimed 1990 red burgundies, and rivals Turville Valley Wines, of Great Missenden (02406-8818), and Wilkinson Vintners, of London NW3 (071-267-1945), are also busy paring prices to the bone.</p>

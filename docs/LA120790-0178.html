			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: CBS' HEWITT TELLS WHY HE WALKED OUT ON PRIVATE PARTY  </P> <P> COMES DON HEWITT to give me his feelings on the recent teapot tempest in which  he departed from a private party after being lectured by fellow guests on his  and "60 Minutes" lack of "objectivity" in the airings of material on the Temple  Mount killings in Jerusalem.  </P> <P> "I am not thin-skinned," the veteran CBS producer says. "Any viewer can rake me  over the coals and tell me anything. But why should I stand around at a party  and let myself be lectured by my competitors -- Barbara Walters and Mort  Zuckerman? How objective are they? Zuckerman was named last Monday in an ad in  the New York Times as one of the '100 Defenders of Jerusalem.' How objective  does that make him as the publisher of U.S. News &amp; World Report? Barbara  Walters thinks it is OK to zero in on me in public and tell me what is proper  in news coverage. Has she ever taken her own objections to the head of ABC,  Roone Arledge, or addressed them to her own network's bureau chief in Tel  Aviv?"  </P> <P> Why, I asked Hewitt, didn't you simply tell these people to blow it out their  ears? "It was a nice private party. I didn't want to make a scene with them and  I didn't want to stay there and be lectured. These competitors of CBS are  hardly paragons of objectivity themselves."  </P> <P> THE DIVINE actress Margot Kidder has called me from Vancouver to say that the  story in the New York Post had the basics about her accident down right but  that "I am NOT paralyzed. This kind of thing is frightening enough without any  wild excess."  </P> <P> Margot was injured in a car accident while making a TV film for Nelvana Co. The  movie was to appear on the USA Network. Margot says she tried to go on working  but finally collapsed and temporarily lost the use of her legs. She is in  therapy every day, using flotation tanks and acupuncture.  </P> <P> Margot says she didn't exactly get a fair shake from Nelvana. "I never heard a  single encouraging or nice or concerned word from either Nelvana or the USA  Network. They had the nerve to say I was drunk and on drugs, then that I was  faking my illness. I wasn't using anything, and it would be impossible to fake  my CAT scans and spinal taps. So there is a large lawsuit in the offing."  </P> <P> We wish Margot all the best and a speedy continuing recovery.  </P></p>

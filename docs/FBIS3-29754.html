A source at the Army's Scientific  Department said the military always used this depleted uranium  for the purpose of making armour-piercing bullets because of its  high penetration power. He said Thai army officers had  occasionally received similar items in the form of sticks from  its intelligence unit but it had never come in a tin box.    The source said the department so far had not sent any  officer to fetch the box to determine the type of substance it  contains, but he believes it might be Uranium 238, as it was  widely used by the U.S. Army. If not, it might be parts  smuggled from a small research nuclear reactor unit in Dalat,  Vietnam.    A Vietnam war expert said the unit was given to the  Vietnamese government during the Vietnam war for research  purposes but the U.S. government took back all its equipment in  1975. He said that the USSR donated the equipment needed to  resume the operation of the small research reactor in Dalat in  1976. He dismissed the report that the box might contain  uranium since he had never seen it when he was in Vietnam during  the war. He believed that it might be a joke or the work of a  gang of swindlers.    Meanwhile, the Office of Atomic Energy for Peace said  depleted uranium has low radioactivity and would not be a danger  to anything and cannot be used to produce nuclear weapons.</p>

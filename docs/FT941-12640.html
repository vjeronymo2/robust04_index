			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (23): Debt may be inevitable but watch the interest - Financing the Family / Going to university / The cheapest loans, after free overdrafts, are from the state student scheme - but avoid credit cards Parents will have to pay less towards their children's university education from the start of the next academic year, as the government steps up its programme for shifting the burden of student maintenance away from grants and parental contributions, and towards more state loans. But there may still be many parents who are unwilling to see their offspring start adult life with large debts to pay off, and who prefer to make more than the contribution required by the state. Maximum grants for the current academic year are: Pounds 2,845 for students in London; Pounds 2,265 elsewhere; and Pounds 1,795 for students living with their parents during term-time. Students can currently borrow between Pounds 470 and Pounds 940 a year from the state Student Loans Company, depending on where they are studying and whether it is the final year of their course. Changes announced in the November Budget mean that, from this autumn, student grants (and therefore mandatory parental contributions) will be cut by 10 per cent, and the maximum student loan increased to compensate for this and for the effect of inflation. This means that maximum loans will increase to between Pounds 915 and Pounds 1,375, or Pounds 670 and Pounds 1,005 for final-year students. If you are already organising savings for school fees, the cost of three years' university education can be worked into the equation relatively easily. However, even parents whose children have used the state education system up until A-level have no choice about whether to pay when it comes to university. Grants are means-tested on parental earnings, and anyone with residual income of more than about Pounds 14,000 has to contribute. The message from financial advisers is that it is never too early to start saving for both school and university expenses. Suggestions include personal equity plans (Peps), building society accounts, tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas), National Savings, unit and investment trusts, and endowment policies. The combination you choose will depend on: how far in advance you are planning, your tax position, your attitude to risk, what savings you have already, and whether lump sums are available to invest or you are saving out of income. An independent financial adviser should be able to help work out an appropriate programme; but be wary of commission-based advisers and tied agents, who may be tempted to push you towards endowments, which are very profitable to sell but may not be the most suitable for your needs. One threat for the future is that some universities, as they see their government funding gradually reduced, may have to introduce top-up tuition fees, payable by students or their parents. When the government raised the possibility of means-tested tuition fees in the mid-1980s, there was a middle-class revolt, and the idea was dropped, but it has recently returned to favour in some circles. University vice-chancellors have so far failed to agree on the issue of fees, but proposals for a number of schemes are under consideration. Cautious parents, who have sons and daughters due to leave school in a few years' time, might want to put a little extra aside, just in case. If you are about to become a student, you will have a lot to think about and organise. One of the most important things is to set up a bank account. All the big high street banks offer special deals for students, involving incentives such as gift vouchers or cash gifts; but more important are free banking and interest-free overdrafts. Debt is now an almost unavoidable part of student life, but some forms of borrowing are more expensive than others. The most expensive is credit-card debt - credit card issuers make no special allowances for students, and charge them the same exorbitant interest rates as everyone else, though some may waive the annual fee. Credit cards are probably best avoided, unless you use them strictly for travel and emergencies, and pay off the balance every month. Unauthorised overdrafts can be almost as expensive: if you think you are about to go over your agreed limit, tell the bank immediately, and it is unlikely to penalise you as heavily. The second cheapest way to borrow, after free overdrafts, is through the state student loan scheme. Interest is pegged to the rate of inflation (1.2 per cent this year), and repayment does not start until the April after you graduate. If your earnings are low, repayment can be deferred. The amount you will be able to borrow will rise steeply over the next few years, and by 1996, loans should account for half of the average student's income. Until now, a large minority of students have not taken out a student loan, but this is likely to change as other sources of funding are reduced. Even students who take out the maximum loan can still suffer a financial shortfall, particularly if they study in areas with high rents, as they are no longer eligible for housing benefit. The government does provide some emergency money, known as access funds, to be distributed by universities to students facing hardship, but there is rarely enough to go round all the applicants.</p>

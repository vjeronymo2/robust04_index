			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 8 (AFP) -- A senior UN official met  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic Sunday [8 May] and defended  a controversial decision by UN envoy Yasushi Akashi to allow  Bosnian Serb tanks to transit through a NATO exclusion zone  around Sarajevo. Sergio de Mello, UN civil affairs coordinator  for ex-Yugoslavia, told reporters after the meeting that the  agreement on the tank movement reached by Akashi Tuesday [3 May]  with Bosnian Serb leaders was made "in the context of a rather  complex and long negotiation."    De Mello said he was "not in Sarajevo to admit mistakes,"  but  declined to provide details of his discussions with Izetbegovic,  who has demanded Akashi's dismissal over the issue. Since Akashi  agreed to allow seven Serb tanks to pass through the  NATO-enforced 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone around the  Bosnian capital, five have transited to the Trnovo region south  of the city, a sixth has been blocked by UN troops near the  Serb-held suburb of Lukavica and a seventh has gone missing in  Serb-held Grbavica, close to the city centre.    The Bosnian authorities, angered by Akashi's decision, have  written to UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali asking him  to sack Akashi, and have said they will refuse to cooperate with  the envoy any longer. UN peacekeeping officials in Sarajevo  were also dismayed at the decision.    De Mello said he would "certainly not" replace Akashi in  subsequent dealings between the United Nations and the Bosnian  authorities. Meanwhile, soldiers of the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) continued searching for the missing Serb T-34 tank,  UNPROFOR said in a statement early Sunday. A UN source said on  Saturday that the tank was probably hidden in a large building  such as a barn or a warehouse in or near Grbavica. The  concession for Serb tanks to pass through the Sarajevo exclusion  zone was "not the only event that may have slowed down the peace  process in recent times," De Mello said.    It was "perhaps not the most striking of the setbacks"  suffered by the peace process, and mediators were hoping to  resolve "other chronic problems," citing the situation in the  eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde, the northwestern Bihac region  and "other hot-spots." His talks with Izetbegovic had covered  the situation in Gorazde where there remained "some seemingly  minor but in fact very important differences" to resolve,  notably the withdrawal of Bosnian Serb forces, "especially the  Serb militia," from the three-kilometre (two-mile) exclusion  zone.    Izetbegovic again insisted on full Serb compliance with NATO  ultimatums and exclusion zones as a prior condition for agreeing  to a country-wide ceasefire.</p>

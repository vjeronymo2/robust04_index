			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 7 (CTK) -- The Christian  Democratic Movement (KDH) and the Democratic Party (DS) have  discussed cooperation between the right-wing parties, KDH  Chairman Jan Carnogursky told CTK today.    The KDH is for loose cooperation of all the parties right of  the centre, in particular the DS (extra-parliamentary), the  National Democratic Party-New Alternative and the Party of  Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen, added Carnogursky, Slovak prime  minister between 1991 and 1992.    The KDH has also established contacts with "Knazko's  followers" and "Moravcik's followers" who want to create the  Slovak Democratic Union on April 23. Milan Knazko is a former  Slovak Foreign Minister who heads the Alliance of Slovak  Democrats (AD SR). Josef Moravcik, current prime minister,  recently created the Alternative of Political Realism (APR).    "National differences seem to be stronger than ideology,"  Carnogursky commented on contemplations of possible contacts  with the ethnic Hungarian parties.    However, he did not rule out cooperation with them because  "apart from some aspects of ethnic policy our views are very  close."    "Bilateral meetings of the right-wing parties will continue  and we would also like to stage a multilateral session this  month," Carnogursky announced.</p>

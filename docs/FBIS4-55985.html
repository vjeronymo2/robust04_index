			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] According to Minister Lux, the report on the  state of Czech agriculture last year, which was published today,  states that the structural changes in that sphere are being  carried out much faster than those in industry. Ales Hermanek  reports:    [Hermanek] According to the report, the nonstate sector has  a  77 percent share in overall agricultural production, which is  almost double that in industry. In the Czech Republic, new  private entities own approximately 85 percent of land, out of  which 18 percent is owned by natural persons.    In this connection, Minister Lux said that in view of the  fact that the majority of owners have assumed their rights,  their number is much higher than the number of business units.  Another result of this is that rented land constitutes 60  percent of overall arable land. The average farm size --  probably still a result of forcible collectivization under the  communist regime -- is 10 times as large as that of comparable  entities in the countries of the European Union, representing  over 135 hectares of land. [passage omitted]    In 1993, the overall loss in agriculture was 9.7 billion  crowns, while the share of state farms in this figure is over 3  billion crowns.    Minister Lux noted as positive the approximately 16 percent  rise in food prices last year, inasmuch as consumer prices grew  by over 20 percent in the same period.</p>

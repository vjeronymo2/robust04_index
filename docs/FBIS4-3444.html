			<p>BFN     [Text] Changchun, April 21 (XINHUA) -- A mobile neutron  radiography system that can be applied to national defense,  aerospace, oil prospecting, medicine and other fields has been  developed in this capital of northeast China's Jilin Province.    Experts on the appraisal committee said the system marks a  major breakthrough in China's neutron radiography technology,  and that its critical part -- the scintillation augmentation  screen -- is up to the top international standard.    China's neutron radiography applications used to be  restricted to nuclear reactors, as its expense and inconvenience  prevented the technology being used more widely.    A research group at the Northeast China Teachers' University  took over the development work from the State Commission for  Science and Technology six years ago.    The experts said the new system can take pictures with a  sealed neutron tube as the neutron source or in a weak neutron  current environment. The picture can be a film or a microphoto  image processed by computer technology.</p>

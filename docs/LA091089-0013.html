			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: RED ALL OVER  </P> <P> When producer Irwin Winkler asked writer-director Abraham Polonsky to  collaborate with him on a film about a blacklisted Hollywood director, Winkler  had the right guy. Polonsky, blacklisted himself in 1951, had plenty to write  about.  </P> <P> Four years later, however, a screenplay is circulating with both their names on  it -- and Polonsky's notified the Writers Guild that he wants his removed.  </P> <P> "That script was not written by me, not a single word is mine," Polonsky told  Outtakes. "There is no political basis to it, which is what I intended."  </P> <P> Polonsky, 78, who wrote the classic 1947 John Garfield film "Body and Soul,"  said Winkler rewrote the script without consulting him and, as a sop, offered  to make him exec producer. Polonsky declined.  </P> <P> Winkler acknowledged rewriting the script: "I wanted a story about how the  blacklist affects (the director's) life, his family, his friends, his jobs."  </P> <P> Polonsky, feeling that stories about blacklist victims have been done to death,  said he wanted "a picture about someone who's guilty of being a radical and has  to face the problem and say, 'Yes, I'm a communist and I don't have to answer  any questions about my politics . . . That's my right."  </P> <P> Winkler said he'll let the Guild determine credits when the film is finished.  Polonsky wants action now.  </P> <P> "As it stands," he said, "if the movie is made, I would get sole screen credit,  and I don't want any credit for it."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Polonsky and producer Mike Kaplan plan to adapt "Season of Fear," a  novel Polonsky wrote during the blacklist period, about a water engineer caught  up in the paranoia of the Red Scare.

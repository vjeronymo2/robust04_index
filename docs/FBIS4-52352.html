			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's foreign affairs minister, Gareth Evans,  has opened an ASEAN-Australia forum in Canberra, predicting  continued growth in links between ASEAN and Australia. It is  the 16th ASEAN-Australia Forum and is being attended by more  than 100 government officials and representatives of business.    Senator Evans told the forum he expects the growing  relationship between Australia and the region to intensify over  the next two years.    [Begin Evans recording] The trend in ASEAN-Australia  relations is already clear. By 2014 we will be, I believe,  significantly closer than even we are today, and forming  something of a cohesive unit within a broader Asia-Pacific  framework.    In a changing regional environment, I think we need to look  to the future of ASEAN-Australia relations and develop further  the structures and the linkages to sustain our political and  economic relationship into the next century.

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Greece being too quickly criticised over Macedonia (2) Sir, Your leader, 'Greek disgrace', should be entitled 'European disgrace'. It is two short months since Greece's so-called partners in Europe rushed with indecent haste to recognise 'Macedonia' in a crude attempt to pre-empt the issue before Greece's presidency of the EU, in the full knowledge that it had been a leading factor in the electoral downfall of the moderate former prime minister, Constantine Mitsotakis. Led by Germany, with a long history of disastrous meddling in the Balkans, and abetted by Britain and France, which ought to know better, they left the Greek government with no option other than a dramatic gesture if it was to retain credibility. To complain now that this may rock the position of the 'moderate' Gligorov and to introduce Bulgaria into the argument is pure sophistry. Your leader writer, in company with most of Europe's leaders, shows no sensitivity to the painful 150-year struggle of Greece to put back together the ideal of Hellenism after nearly 2,000 years of subjugation to Roman, Venetian, Frankish and Turkish invaders, or to the importance to them of Philip of Macedonia, his son Alexander the Great, and Vergina, his birthplace. May I ask how the Scots would feel about the Faroe Islands (with about the same justification) taking the name of the Republic of Scotland, using the stone of Scone on its flag and having a clause in its constitution requiring its government to involve itself in the protection of Scots wherever they may be.

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Crown jewels to have a change of setting THE crown jewels, one of Britain's most priceless assets, are to be made more accessible to the public. The move is aimed at maximising revenue for the Department of the Environment - currently estimated at Pounds 11.5m a year in visitors' receipts. But it might prove a nightmare in terms of security. The centuries-old jewels consist of the regalia of the English crown - the Scottish regalia are kept in Edinburgh Castle - together with jewellery brought together by a variety of European sovereigns. They include the Imperial State Crown, which contains 3,538 diamonds, 17 sapphires, eight emeralds, five rubies and 165 pearls. The Historic Royal Palaces Agency, which manages the jewels on behalf of the DoE, has approved plans to move the jewels from their present location 50 ft below ground at the Tower of London to a larger room on the ground floor of the Tower by April 1994. The jewels' present home was built in 1967 when the Tower was taking in between 5,000 and 8,000 visitors a day. A trebling in the number of potential visitors to the Tower over the last 20 years has meant that the jewels have become increasingly difficult to look at in comfort. Col Hamish Mackinlay, deputy governor at the Tower, insisted last night that in its drive to make the jewels more accessible to the public, every precaution would be taken not to make it easier for 'another Captain Blood' to attempt to steal them. In 1671, Irish-born Captain Blood, a renegade officer in the service of King Charles II, was arrested with his two accomplices after attempting to run away with various regal items of considerable worth. One security expert, aware of the present-day existence of more sophisticated criminals, warned that there would have to be a thorough 'threat analysis' before the jewels were finally transferred. 'Security is going to have to be the best available. If anything was to happen to such a valuable asset, it would be disastrous.' Lehrer McGovern International, the US construction management company owned by Bovis, the UK construction group, has won the project management for the contract. Security Training International is acting as the consultant on security. During the Second World War, George VI ordered Garrard's, the royal jewellers, to remove the jewels from the Tower and submerge them in a lake at Windsor Castle in order to prevent the Germans from getting hold of them. Yesterday the Tower said the jewels were temporarily closed to the public, for their two-week annual cleaning by Garrard's. Last night Garrard's would not put a value on the jewels. It said: 'The jewels are irreplaceable.'</p>

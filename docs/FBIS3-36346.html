			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius told  INTERFAX on Thursday that he is not satisfied with the latest  relations with Russia.    In particular, the premier said, immediately after signing  the treaty on most favored trading status with Russia a few  months ago the Lithuanian side sent a note to Moscow. However,  the Russian side has not yet responded, so the treaty cannot  come into force.    Referring to unofficial reports, the premier said that the  Russian side is trying to link these issues with other problems,  in particular with "some aspects of relations between Lithuania  and the Kaliningrad region of Russia."</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Missing link - What will replace Britain's Unlisted Securities Market? Norma Cohen finds a stream of suggestions Grabbing the attention of investors is no problem for small companies and venture capitalists in the good times. But in a bear market, small company shares tend to lose their lustre; liquidity in shares simply disappears. (They become difficult to buy and sell.) With the Stock Exchange looking at what should replace the Unlisted Securities Market, which is to be phased out by 1997, the issue of liquidity in small shares is again taking centre stage. A growing number of venture capitalists believe that what is needed is a new market managed independently of the Stock Exchange and which actively promotes itself as the listing authority for small, entrepreneurial firms. Whatever happens, venture capitalists are agreed that any replacement for the USM is unlikely to succeed unless there is liquidity in the shares. And to a large extent this depends on the community of intermediaries being willing to research, promote and make markets in small company shares. The issue is particularly pressing in Britain where the withdrawal of investment banking services to small companies remains a painful memory. 'The USM fell into disuse because there was no one there who ensured that the business remained through good times and bad,' said Marc Cramsie, head of corporate finance at Singer and Friedlander, a firm which specialises in structuring capital-raising exercises for small companies. In the recession of the early 1990s, investors who already held small company shares lost the ability to sell them, and even venture capitalists with exciting prospects in their portfolios found there was no marketplace. Moreover, market makers - who offer to buy and sell securities at firm prices in all market conditions - withdrew from dealing in small company shares while stockbrokers who produced research reports on small companies wound down their research teams or deployed them to cover other sectors. Privately, venture capitalists and even some securities industry officials say the stockbroking community itself has a lot to answer for. 'There is a missing link here,' said Jos Peeters, managing director of Capricorn Venture Partners, a Brussels-based joint venture with Baring Venture Capital. 'There is the absence of investment banks who research and promote interest in smaller companies. Maybe the stockbrokers have forgotten how much money they made promoting smaller companies before the recession,' he said. Perhaps, venture capitalists also concede, too many companies sought listings when public listing was an inappropriate capital-raising method for them. 'There are 15,000-18,000 companies in European venture capital portfolios and the majority are not suitable for public listing,' Peeters said. 'But if 10 per cent are suitable, you have 1,500 to 1,800 companies available for listing.' Venture capitalists and others point to the US, where NASDAQ has become the successful trading exchange for the shares of entrepreneurial start-up companies and has endured through good times and bad. One ingredient for success in attracting both private and professional investors to shares of these companies has been the presence of a group of 'cheerleading' stockbrokers. These firms, such as Hambrecht and Quist, and Baltimore-based Alex Brown and Sons, have specialised in producing reliable research on small companies, helping investors separate the high-quality investments from the others and generally promoting interest in the sector. Andrew Beeson, partner at Beeson Gregory, a stockbroking firm specialising in small companies, says the production of timely, credible research about companies is critical. 'We recognise that you are not going to get institutional or other investors into small companies unless you keep them informed on an on-going basis,' he said. In Britain, not enough firms are producing such research, he says. Beeson Gregory does so, but has found that when the shares in question are those of one of its own corporate finance clients, investors become understandably sceptical. As a result, the firm only gives out analytical reports on companies after they have reported their earnings, highlighting significant developments both good and bad. Some who specialise in marketing small company shares argue that the big investment banks devote too little time and effort to the sector. After all, the top 350 companies in the FT-A Actuaries Index account for 94 per cent of turnover on the London Stock Exchange. 'These guys pay no attention to the sector when the markets are good and they walk away from it when times are bad,' grumbled one stockbroker. One problem, he argues, is that rules for initial public offerings allow too high a percentage of shares to be tucked away into the hands of a few investors. This means that too many stocks quickly become illiquid. Often the market maker is the firm which brought the shares to market in the first place, allowing a degree of price manipulation. However, Cramsie argues that this practice is hard to change. 'If you decree that half of any new issue's shares have to be sold to the public, you are guaranteeing a few flops,' he said. NASDAQ may have staying power in a recession because there is more capital available for investment in the US and private individuals are prepared to make investment decisions themselves. If there were to be a new exchange, many members of the UK City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco) believe it will need to be pan-European, that is, a trading place for the shares of small, entrepreneurial companies all over Europe which attracts capital from a full European investor base. According to Peeters, a pan-European exchange for small company shares would be able to attract more investment capital and offer listing to more companies than any domestic exchange. 'Research has shown that only new, fast-growing companies are gaining employment in Europe,' he says. 'Older companies are shedding workers. These new companies are adding to the overall economic activity but without funding, they cannot grow as fast as their competitors in the US or Asia.'</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / US bank to pay Pounds 25m into Mirror Group fund: First settlement lifts hopes of Maxwell pensioners Bank of America yesterday became the first financial institution to settle claims stemming from the diversion of over Pounds 440m from pension schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell, raising expectations that others will follow. The San Francisco-based bank said it had agreed to pay Pounds 25m, while not admitting any liability, into the Mirror Group Pension Scheme. 'This has thrown the situation into a new realm where it may be possible to talk about a settlement,' said an official at one investment bank alleged to have helped divert pension scheme assets. After receiving a writ in June 1992, Bank of America approached the pension fund trustees about six months ago to discuss a settlement independently. The writ alleged that Bank of America, which acted as a safekeeper for a portfolio of securities, passed them to Credit Suisse on the instructions of individuals who were not authorised to give such instructions. The securities were later used as collateral for a loan to Mr Robert Maxwell's private interests, the writ alleges. Sir John Cuckney, appointed by the government to encourage financial institutions holding pension scheme assets to return them, had no part in the Bank of America move. Mr Tom Brooks, Bank of America's assistant general counsel, said: 'We view this settlement as an appropriate means of contributing to the restoration of the pension funds without the delay and uncertainty to pensioners and the bank of lengthy court proceedings, and of putting this claim by the trustees behind us.' The Mirror Group Pension Trustees had sought Pounds 38m from Bank of America and Credit Suisse jointly. That case is scheduled to come to court in October and the pension trustees said they will continue to seek the balance of the funds plus accrued interest from Credit Suisse. The writ also names Invesco MIM, Lehman Brothers International Ltd and Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management. It seeks Pounds 200m, of which roughly Pounds 50m relates to assets alleged to have been passed to Robert Maxwell's private interests by the fund managers. The other Pounds 150m relates to negligence charges for failing to inform the trustees of improper activities. That case is due in court on January 25. Mirror Group Newspapers has pledged to make up the shortfall from the diversion of assets to its own pension scheme members. It recorded a charge of Pounds 174m - to be paid over the lifetime of its scheme members - in its interim report last June to cover this. The Bank of America payment will reduce Mirror Group's liability by Pounds 25m. Mr Colin Cornwell, chairman of Mirror Group Pension Trustees (MGPT), said he hopes the Bank of America settlement will encourage others to seek a similar solution. 'I think it makes sense commercially,' he said, noting that the expense and adverse publicity of a public trial are likely to be damaging to many financial institutions. Yesterday, other financial institutions which handled assets missing from the pension scheme said the Bank of America move had no bearing on their cases. Lehman Brothers said it was only prepared to consider a 'global settlement' in which all financial institutions participate. Coopers cleared in probe, Page 5</p>

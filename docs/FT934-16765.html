			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Tories row over veto on speakers A BEHIND-THE-SCENES row over attempts by the organisers to stifle attacks on Mr John Major's government erupted last night on the eve of the Conservatives' Blackpool conference. Officers of the party's National Union were accused of seeking to 'screen out' representatives planning critical speeches from the conference floor during this week's debates. The task of vetoing potentially 'dangerous' speakers has been handed to ministers' political advisers and to the research department at Conservative central office. But a number of ministers have expressed fears that the tactic could backfire by increasing the anger of the government's critics and provoking public demonstrations during debates.

The conference organisers are also trying to ensure that the prime minister's critics on the Tory back benches at Westminster - the so-called 'barmies' - are denied a voice by preventing all MPs from speaking in the main debates. All of the constituency party motions chosen by the organisers are supportive of the government's policies.

There is no mention of the imposition of value added tax on fuel or of the government's inability to curb rising crime rates, despite the scores of critical motions submitted. But to the embarrassment even of some cabinet ministers, the organisers have attempted to prevent any public rows by 'vetting' those constituency activists who have asked to speak. The principal flashpoints at this week's conference are judged to be tomorrow's law and order debate and Thursday's economic debate. But there are also fears that the opponents of the Maastricht treaty could seek to stage a demonstration during today's foreign affairs debate. Sir Basil Feldman, the chairman of the National Union, denied yesterday that the organisers' refusal to hold a separate debate on VAT was an attempt to stifle debate. He said that the issue was certain to be raised from the floor during the economy debate. But in a reflection of the determination in Blackpool to damp down attacks both on the government and Mr Major's leadership, Sir Basil told a press conference: 'The party is fed up with the disloyalty and negative messages being put out by the malcontent minority.'</p>

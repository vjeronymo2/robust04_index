			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Part two of article by Vu Oanh, member of the Communist </F> Party of Vietnam Political Bureau: "Developing Combined Forces  in Mass Motivation Work and Renovating the Work Content and  Method of the Fatherland Front and Mass Organizations"]    [Text] The government performs its public relations work  through cadres and government officials' behavior and their  working attitude. They must respect the people; listen to them;  improve their work performance; and fight against corruption,  authoritarianism, and bureaucracy. That will increase public  trust to the government and the regime. Government officials  must be trained in their work, management skills, and legal  knowledge. The government must work with mass organizations to  contain and eliminate sucessfully social vices, and safeguard  social and political stabilization.    Life in mountainous areas is still very difficult and  backward. Public relation work in ethnic-inhabited areas is  still weak. We must pay proper attention to economic  development and social issues in mountainous areas by opening  schools in every mountain village, rebuilding schools under  deterioration, eliminating the situation of teaching different  grades in the same classroom, and reducing malaria, gout,  leprosy, and tuberculosis... We must stop the imbalance between  economic development and social advancement.    Government and mass organizations must coordinate their  socioeconomic duties. The relation between the government and  mass organizations is not a relation in which the government is  always helping mass organizations. It must be understood that  the government can only accomplish its duties, especially in  movements to "eliminate starvation and reduce poverty" with the  great support fo mass organizations. These movements must help  poor families and families who rendered meritorious service to  the country. These movements must also carry out other  socioeconomic projects.    Government Decision No. 163 about the relation between the  government and the Vietnam Women's Union is an example of  coordination. The two sides must actively remind one another  about the need for good cooperation and high efficiency in their  work.    3. Renovating the working contents and methods for  fatherland fronts and mass organizations to match their new  duties is a necessary task. In the new situation with a new  economic structure, the people will not accept fatherland fronts  and mass organizations' ideas and programs of action if they do  not meet their legitimate interests and aspirations. Realizing  this, the sixth party Central Committee resolution on mass  motivation work confirmed: "The work of mass organizations is  to unite their members to look after their own practical  interests, contribute to the national cause, and construct and  protect the revolutionary government". President Ho Chi Minh  said: "Mass organizations are organs of the masses, fight for  the masses, protect the masses' interests, and closely connect  with the masses and the government." (Ho Chi Minh Collected  Works, Volume 5, page 393) The people's interests must be  guaranteed and stipulated in the legal system. At the same  time, their interests must also be guaranteed by a system of  mass organizations, in which, the position, role, and function  of each mass organization must be guaranteed by the law. The  mass organizations must perform their best functions and duties  to guarantee the people's benefits.    A. Fatherland fronts and mass organizations need to  accelerate their political and ideological education to improve  the people's knowledge. They have to instill national pride in  the public. They also have to encourage them to overcome  starvation and poverty, to enrich themselves legally for a  better life, and to contribute more to society. They also need  to upgrade the people's education levels, morality, aesthetics,  professionalism, thoughts, and working skills. They should  improve information services for politics, economy, culture, and  society via newspapers, radio, television, and their other means.    We must upgrade the quality of the mass organization  information service to ensure better dissemination of the party  and state line and policy. The service must carry information  suitable to particular communities and regions so the people can  clearly understand the nature of the party's line and policy  before they consciously observe them.    On the other hand, mass media agencies must tell the truth  in  any situation, avoid optimism, and direct public opinion on  major political events. At the same time, they should carry  articles suitable to different sexes amd ages, answer daily  questions, and guide the public for to lead decent, useful, and  helpful lives.    We must continue to construct and perfect a system which  provides great effects to the public (social clubs, cultural  houses, political and cultural centers, professional  associations, and so forth). In order to attract more people,  we must expand political activities and heighten national  tradition and political awareness with social movements such as  visits to former revolution bases for youths, receptions given  to revolutionary prisoners sentenced to death, and public  campaigns to support Cuba and victims of natural disasters.    Efforts must be made to develop various scientific research  institutes and investigative agencies to effectively monitor and  survey public opinion and the people's aspirations to correctly  formulate measures for mass mobilization work and make proposals  to the state for revising and supplementing various lines and  policies.    We must improve activities to promote democracy and the  ideological work at various mass organizations especially at the  grass-roots level such as teams, chapters, work groups,  families, and populated areas. We must strive to ensure that  the people's thought and actions are in conformity with lines  and policies of our party and those of the era.    B. Activities of the Vietnam Fatherland Front [VFF] and  other  mass organizations must be carried out in a wide and  far-reaching fashion and must be in line with the socioeconommic  development task. Following the arduous protracted war for  national salvation and independence, our people's forefront  tasks at present are to carry out socioeconomic development  program and build a bountiful and happy life for the people as  President Ho Chi Minh wishes: "Our nation will regain total  independence, our people will enjoy full freedom, our countrymen  will lead a bountiful life and are equally entitled to proper  education." To live up to mankind's advancement, we will not  stop at just a moderate happly life, but we should strive to  attain a bountiful life with tastes and modern facilities. This  is also the urgent demand and aspiration of our people. Whether  or not the VFF and other mass organizations score achievement in  their activities depends on how far they can meet the people's  aspirations in this regard.    As for the industrial and goods circulation sectors, with  the  current market economic system, their production and business  activities are facing serious challenges. They may experience  failure, subjected to dissolvement, or can continue their  operation with success, all depend on their efforts and  determination. As a result, mass organizations should not cross  their arms in vain and adopt a passive attitude when facing  difficulties. They should, however, surge forward to  participate in activities to develop their units and  organizations. They should coordinate with responsible agencies  to satisfactorily rearrange production, carry out projects, and  apply contractual work for finished products at factories and  workshops to enhance the workers' responsibility toward their  work and the market; strive to diversify forms of ownership and  introduce the share-holding enterprise system so as to prevent  losses of state property, create more jobs for the workers,  increase their income, and stabilize their daily life.    Various mass organizations and societies must mobilize their  members to discuss and share weal and woe with specialized  production establishments to find ways and means to overcome  difficulties, protect and develop capital, produce new products,  change equipment, strengthen industrial production network;  improve packaging, delivery, and the production of new products.  Efforts must be made to find new clients and expand markets  while participating in implementing the policy on developing  economic components. We must actively detect shortcomings in  our legal system to make proposals to the state for revising the  irrational laws while striving to protect the laborers'  interest. We must respect the legitimate interest and social  equality of owners of establishments, oppose all illegal  business activities and tax evasion. In agriculture, various  mass organizations must mobilize the peasants to implement  resolution no. 10 on the contractual system, promote the  allocation of land for long-term use and granting of ownership  over some means of production to the peasants; encourage family  economy and motivate peasants to engage in fruit orchard, fish  rearing, gardening, aquaculture, and the production of  specialized goods. Efforts must be made to develop the  assistance program among the laborers to help one another in  term of crop seeds, capital, and experience to integrate them  into an economic cooperative organization to work for a mutual  interest. Various social associations must carry out activities  to guide the peasants to improve their production, transfer new  technology to peasant families, develop all potentials to  produce more products to amass wealth. For instance, the  Women's Union in Tuyen Quang province has participated in a  movement to promote agriculture and forestry, teach the peasants  on how to raise hogs by using sugarcane juice, raise milk goats,  and produce biogas (by using animal manure). Moreover, they also  set up women's groups (481 in number) to practice thrift,  provide loans to poor members to engage in some kind of trades  or production to increase income and improve their daily life.    Various mass organizations must also strive to help and  guide  their members and the laborers to develop the family economy,  produce agricultural products, develop production activities,  and improve goods circulation. In cities, efforts must be made  to improve work at resturants, dress-making factories,  transportation, production of handicrafts, and export goods,  thereby creating favorable conditions for the people to help  resolve the unemployment problem and increase their incomes.    While we integrate our efforts in carrying out economic  development program to revolve various problems, we should pay  attention on resolving the social issues. Various mass  organizations and societies must pay special attention to  protecting the laborers' interest because it is a great and  complicated issue.    Social issues and social policies are very copious. They  involve jobs, food, clothing, housing, transport, education,  rest and recreation, medical treatment, physical fitness, and  the building of a new culture. Satisfactory resolution of this  issue will have a vigorous effect on the feelings and emotions  of the people and on their confidence in the party.    Together with responsible organs, mass organizations must be  mindful of the need to resolve employment and must hold  discussions to chart new course for production activities and  new work methods. This is to help maintain production and set up  additional workshops to create more employment. Mass  organizations must motivate the people to participate in the  movement against the degradation of educational and health  facilities and to respond to a fund-raising drive designed to  obtain money to ensure better pay for teachers, improve academic  qualities, and repair and build schools and classrooms. We must  ensure the enactment of good by-laws for schools and must pay  attention to organizing vocational training in general education  schools. We must encourage the people to build their physical  fitness and preserve their health. We must build first-aid  stations and medicinal herb gardens and satisfactorily care for  the welfare of public health cadres and personnel. We must  motivate the people to make contributions to the causes of  providing medical treatment for handicapped children and  disabled people and bringing up orphans. We must motivate the  people to respond to the movement for family planning and must  improve the composition and quality of our diet.    We must encourage and organize the people and create  conditions for them to build houses in accordance with urban  planning. We must promote the building of more brick houses in  rural areas, build new urban areas, and ensure satisfactory  repairwork for houses in various communities.    We must organize democratic debates among the people so they  can help formulate and comply with regulations on the  safeguarding of their neighborhoods and city wards. Mass  organizations must cooperate with popular defense forces and  professional security police in tracking down and getting rid of  hoodlums, thieves, and other social ills. We must set up  security funds and incentive funds to maintain and care for  popular defense forces. We must motivate the people to detect  evil elements and subject them to self criticism for  correctional purposes. Youth union members and youth association  members must help and encourage backward people to make progess.  This can be done in various forms and ways, the most important  of which being the setting of good examples for other people to  follow.    We must encourage the people to participate in popular  national defense work, ensure the fulfillment of troop  recruitment targets, carry out the army's rearguard policy,  using diversified methods to ensure that combatants and their  families engage in national defense activities with peace of  mind.    We must build a sense of attachment among members of a unit  and between themselves and their parent unit and must promote  mutual assistance among people in cases of illness and mishaps.  We must encourage giving assistance to people in the event they  suffer from misfortunes, catastrophes, and illness and for those  hapless families with incapacitated members. We must set up  mutual assistance funds, charity funds, and retirement funds in  the rural areas.    Mass organizations must motivate the people to contribute  their energy and money to helping the administration build  public utility projects such as bridges, roads, power lines,  schools, first-aid stations, communication networks, and  cultural and information systems.    To make a long story short, we must initiate a widespread  mass movement to carry out the following programs and movements:  The program to do away with hunger and ease poverty, the program  to resolve employment in conjunction with efforts to develop and  restructure the economy, and provide vocational training for the  people, especially for youths, the program for population and  family planning, the program for preliminary heath care, the  expanded program for immunization, the health insurance program,  the program to develop folk culture, build a civilized lifestyle  and cultural households, the program to fight outmoded customs  and social ills, the program for illiteracy eradication, the  program for compulsory education, the movement for physical  fitness, the movement to repay the kindness of those who have  performed their meritorious deeds for the nation, and the  charity movement.    Mass organizations must cooperate in enaging in community  reconciliation efforts in various residential areas. We must  form reconciliation teams made up of prestigious and  enthusiastic people. Meanwhile, we must make youth union members  and youth association members responsible for the task of  resolving differences among the people. We must motivate the  people to live and work in accordance with the law. In the same  token, the people must have the right to use the law as a means  of self defense. We must fight against acts of coercion and  injustice among government cadres and employees and against  their misinterpretation of the law.    In carrying out the mass motivation task, mass organizations  must closely cooperate with youth union members and youth  association members in motivating outside people. We must  involve ourselves more fully in seeking to know the specific  situation of each family and each person and the feelings,  emotions, and aspirations of the people. We must talk to the  people, listen to their views, and discuss the situation with  them. In this way, the people will be thoroughly aware of and  voluntarily comply with the party and state policies and lines.  We can also discuss those policy issues that are not properly  carried out. Mass organizations may ask the state to amend or  revise its policies in a rational and appropriate way. Mass  organizations must work toward resolving policy-related demands  of the people. They must blend themselves with the people to to  find out each other's similar points of views. Activities of  mass organizations must be compatible with the activities and  interests of the people. Mass organizations must learn from the  people and be in the service of the people. They must avoid  imposing their will on the people or doing anything against the  aspirations of the people.    Our policy system has, at certain times and in certain  areas,  not been compatible with realities. Given the limited  capabilities of the state, mass organizations must explain this  fact to the people so they can understand and live with it. We  must consult with the people over our planned enforcement of  policies to prevent them from feeling unhappy with our policies  or the enforcement of these policies. Just as Nguyen Trai put  it: "We must strive to do in such a way as to keep villages and  hamlets free from angry voices," and "this will bring  prosperity, peace, and happiness for all." Our people's  intellectual standard has been further improved in keeping with  the era of wisdoms, science and technologies. As there are many  talented intellectual workers in our society who are the sons or  brothers of the laboring people and who are renowned both at  home and abroad, our existing mass motivation method is all the  more important and will certainly develop its effect.</p>

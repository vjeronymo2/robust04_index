			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- Former socialist countries  and former Soviet republics are beginning to spy on Russia,  director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service Sergey  Stepashin warned on Tuesday.    "The danger of spying has considerably increased today and  can inflict major damage to independence, defence capability,  scientific, technical and economic potential of the country", he  told a conference on "Security of Individual, Society, State and  Russian Special Services".    The director added that secret services of former Warsaw  treaty member states and of former Soviet republics also get  involved in the spying activities.    "This tendency calls to strictly determine the notion of the  threat to Russian security", Stepashin said and added that  counterintelligence bodies should be strengthened.    "A strong democratic Russia should have strong security  bodies. As any other state, it has the right to resort to  adequate measures to protect its national interests", he said.    Stepashin also voiced concern over increased attempts of  foreign special services to ensure access to commercial  information.    Dwelling on anti-crime fight in the country, he warned that  mafia is actively trying to penetrate into the bodies of power,  also by intimidation and terror.    New concepts of ensuring the national security are necessary  and the Russian security council is working on them, the  director said.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Closed Book: Veteran Washington, D.C., newsman Jerry Oppenheimer is contacting  people around town for his unauthorized biography of Ethel Kennedy, whose  husband, Sen. Robert Kennedy, was assassinated in 1968. But it won't be easy:  Kennedy is a private person, rarely talks to the press and has not answered his  request for an interview.  </P> <P> Oppenheimer, who wrote "Barbara Walters: An Unauthorized Biography," said he  signed a mid-six-figure advance with St. Martin's Press and will write the book  even if Kennedy won't talk.  </P> <P> Korean Model: Former Romanian gymnastics star Nadia Comaneci arrived Monday in  Seoul, South Korea, to tour Olympic sites and to talk with fashion promoters  about modeling in South Korea. Comaneci, the 1976 Olympic gold medalist in  Montreal, fled Romania last December for the United States.  </P> <P> Ace in the Face: New York Mayor David Dinkins is wearing dark glasses around  the office after being smacked in the eye with a tennis ball at a celebrity  tournament Sunday. Dinkins, 63, saw a doctor Monday after Mayor Sharpe James of  Newark, N.J., "hit a ball with some force . . . and I sort of got blinded." The  ball sent Dinkins' glasses flying and knocked him to the ground. The injury  left him highly sensitive to light.  </P> <P> Best Blonde: Bridgette LeAnn Wilson of Oregon topped 50 other teen-agers to  earn the Miss Teen USA crown in the eighth annual pageant in Biloxi, Miss. "I  went in and I was going to give it my best shot, and whatever my best was, I  was going to hope for the best," said the blond, brown-eyed teen-ager after her  win Monday. The 16-year-old said she hopes for a career in entertainment.  </P></p>

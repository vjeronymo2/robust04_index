The CAMEROON NEWS AGENCY (CAMNEWS) reported in a dispatch to  PANA Monday that the arrival of the French soldiers and  diplomats was prompted by what it termed as "the illegal  occupation" of parts of the Bakassi Peninsula in southwestern  Cameroon. CAMNEWS did not give the number of French soldiers  who arrived. The agency said that the French mission is in  Cameroon "to evaluate the situation created by the invasion of  Bakassi by troops of the Nigerian Army and the agression of  Cameroonian soldiers on their territory".    CAMNEWS said that there were clashes between Cameroonian and  Nigerian troops on 18 and 19 February around the fishing zone  around Kumbo and Janea. The agency claimed that Nigeria's green  and white flag has been flying in Jabana and Diamond areas since  3 January 1994. The Cameroonian agency quoted Radio Kano of  Nigeria which reportedly said that in three assaults, Nigeria  lost 30 soldiers while one Cameronian soldier was killed and two  others injured.    A journalist from the national Cameroonian daily, CAMEROON  TRIBUNE, who accompanied the country's minister of state in the  president's office, Edouard Akame Mfoumou, on a visit to the  area wrote that: "Troops from the two armies have occupied the  fishing zones which have been transformed into combat areas and  are only 100 metres away from each other in the Diamond and  Ibabato area".    CAMNEWS wrote that the French troops arrived around the same  time as a French delegation of French diplomats from the French  president's office and Foreign Ministry. Among those in the  French diplomatic team is the special chief of staff of  President Francois Mitterrand. The diplomats are also expected  to visit Abuja, Nigeria's federal capital, on "reconciliation"  the agency added.    France and Cameroon have a defence pact dating back from  when  the central African state became independent from France on 20  May 1960.</p>

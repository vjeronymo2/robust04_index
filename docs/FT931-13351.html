			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Property: History and tradition in land of the commuter - Gerald Cadogan explores Sussex, with its distinctive houses of half-timber and hung-tiles, its wealth of attractions, and a hot-line to the heart of London SUSSEX was remote from civilised society until George IV, the Prince Regent, turned Brighton from a fishing village into a seaside resort centred on his pleasure dome, the Royal Pavilion. Then, with the advent of the railways in Victoria's reign, Sussex changed for ever. The county of woods and sticky clay, where travelling in a carriage was a nightmare and where blacksmiths and forgemasters worked the iron, burning the trees and damming the streams to make 'hammer ponds', became a Home County. Bankers and stockbrokers, and their clerks, moved out of London and set about creating wonderful gardens of rhododendrons and azaleas. (A century ago, trains to town took the same time as today. The choice of stations was better.) The Sussex they moved to had largely escaped 18th century gentrification - there are no Georgian stone stately piles. Instead, wood, daub, and brick and tile are the basis of the Sussex vernacular, and near the South Downs, knapped flint also. The houses are distinctive - their frames are half-timbered, with a filling of daub, bricks or flint, with the upper part sheathed in vertical hanging tiles as a protection from the weather. Roofs are tiled and low, giving most Sussex houses the look of cottages. Inside are low, head-hammering beams and brick floors and fireplaces, often wide enough to have an inglenook. The affluent 19th century commuters hastened to enlarge their homes, or build new ones in the same style, as has continued to happen ever since. With their look hardly changed for 400 years, it can be hard today to spot the original bits in an 'old' Sussex house. As a result, they exude the reassurance of sharing in a living tradition. Sussex is a large county that divides into three parts. West Sussex, bordering on Hampshire, has the attractions of Chichester and its cathedral, theatre, and harbour, and the Roman palace at Fishbourne, racing at Goodwood, and a beautiful, unspoilt hinterland. Mid-Sussex is the London-Brighton corridor along the M23/A23 (now being improved) and the railway line, with easy access to Gatwick, Glyndebourne (closed for 1993) and the gardens at Wakehurst Place and Nymans. East Sussex flattens as it nears Kent and the Channel tunnel, and oast houses (for hops) begin to appear. A splendid example of a typical East Sussex house newly on the market is the 18th century New House Farm at Bodiam, (where the National Trust has a famous castle) and close to Battle, where William of Normandy conquered Harold in 1066. Brick and hung tiles mask its timber frame. Cluttons in Haywards Heath (0444-441166) are offering it at around Pounds 350,000, with the adjacent triple oast house for around Pounds 200,000, and up to 320 acres of farmland. More expensive and basically 16th century (when a family called Thatcher obtained the property at the dissolution of the monasteries), is Arches Manor at Framfield, near Uckfield and Lewes, with John D Wood (071-493-4106) and Batcheller &amp; Thacker in Battle (0424-775577) at around Pounds 600,000. Nearby is the 17th century Buckham Hill Farm at Isfield, a house rich in oak and with an 18th century barn offered by Cluttons, at Pounds 575,000. The Stable Cottage at Wadhurst near Tunbridge Wells, with a Victorian coach house that could be converted, is available at around Pounds 110,000 from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Tunbridge Wells (0892-515035). Next door, Hamptons (071-293-8222) offer the big house, Best Beech Place, a 1920s Sussex-style oaken splendour with garden by Gertrude Jekyll, at around Pounds 850,000. For keen shots, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley are selling Platts Farm at Burwash looking across to Rudyard Kipling's old house (Batemans) at around Pounds 500,000, to include barns and outbuildings, 71 acres and two duck flighting ponds. Oldcastle at Dallington near Battle is a house that grew over 300 years but did not change its Sussex style. Humberts in Lewes (0273-478828) will sell it to you with nine acres for about Pounds 625,000. Or they offer the attractive 17th century Oak Ferrars Farm at Piltdown, with outbuildings and three acres for about Pounds 269,000. An intriguing East Sussex conversion is the flint Place Barn at Wilmington, nestling under the Downs with views to the giant, chalk-cut Long Man of Wilmington, who stands on the slope holding a stave in either hand. The Barn (Humberts, around Pounds 275,000) won a Civic Trust award in 1982. Another recent conversion is the Coach House at Halland near Lewes, a handsome brick building that has the merit of not being cottage-style. Watsons in Heathfield (0435-865077) offer it at around Pounds 320,000. The best Sussex-style house in East Sussex is called Toad Hall: its name must be reflected in the price of Pounds 395,000 (from Fox in Haywards Heath, 0444-450105). It is an impressive Wealden hall that could have belonged to an ironmaster, dating back to the 15th century. But finest of all is a manor house, early 17th century and listed Grade II*, built in stone by an ironmaster to show he was above the common Sussex cut, and on offer for only the third time in its history. Court Lodge at Ashburnham near Battle (Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, under offer at around Pounds 450,000) comes with a Grade II barn and 48 acres, including 27 acres of vineyards which the vendor would like to rent back from the new owner for Pounds 175 an acre. In mid-Sussex, a similarly grand manor, now a romantic ruin, is part of Brambletye Manor Farm near East Grinstead. The total price for a typical Sussex house, ruins, 26 acres, swimming pool and tennis court is around Pounds 495,000, or Pounds 100,000 less excluding the farmyard (from John Powell in Forest Row, 0342-822261, or Savills in Sevenoaks, 0732-455551). Odder still, and dearer at around Pounds 1.25m, is Laughton Manor near Lewes (from Hamptons in Mayfield, 0435-872294), a cream-stucco early Victorian villa with an Italianate belvedere tower that has popped up in the country from Belgrave Square or Regent's Park. About half that price is a delightful house (from Fox), the Elizabethan East Mascalls in Lindfield near Haywards Heath, which a Cheshire family built with the ornamental half-timbering familiar in the north west. They must have brought their joiner down with them. Nearby Cockhaise Mill Farm is for those who want to run a business, as it comes with a thriving farm shop (with game licence, sausage licence, ice cream licence and liquor licence). Petfood is a new line and doing well. Humberts offer it at around Pounds 585,000. Another neighbour is the many-bedroomed 16th/17th century manor called Tremans at Horsted Keynes, listed Grade II* (Humberts, around Pounds 550,000). Arthur Benson, librettist of Land of Hope and Glory called it 'almost incredibly picturesque'. Top marks go to Michael Winter-Kaines, a retired British Airways captain who is marketing his Windmill Cottage at Rowhook, near Horsham, himself (0403-790513) at Pounds 330,000, provided there is no chain. Not wanting to pay agents' fees, he has produced an excellent, straightforward brochure for an attractive listed Grade II house and cottage and barn, and is amazed at how many people have replied to his advertisements and how nice they are. 'They are delighted to deal directly,' he says. If you want to farm in mid-Sussex, the 425 acres of Little Danny Farm at Hurstpierpoint is virtually all the estate once belonging to the imposing Elizabethan manor house called Danny (now retirement housing with the Mutual Households Association). It is an attractive proposition: mixed farming, lovely country, parkland and lakes, in the lee of Wolstonbury Hill (National Trust) on the Downs, and yet no distance from Brighton. Being sold in lots by Humberts, the total asking price is around Pounds 1.3m. Going west, Jackson-Stops in Midhurst (0730-812357) offer an essence of cottagey Sussex in Old Hill at Lurgashall, near Petworth, three cottages and a mill run together for around Pounds 220,000. The garden is crammed with specimen plants. At Washington they are selling (with King &amp; Chasemore in Pulborough, 0798-872081, at around Pounds 445,000) an 1820s old vicarage, a good late Georgian box of a house for those who do not thrill to the wealth of head-height old oak that is the hallmark of Sussex.</p>

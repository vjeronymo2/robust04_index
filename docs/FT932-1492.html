			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Toyota Motor takes 8% stake in Indonesian group TOYOTA Motor Corporation has taken an 8 per cent stake in Astra International, the Indonesian automotive conglomerate, in a deal worth Rp200bn (Dollars 95.9m). Analysts see the deal as a vote of confidence in Astra, which has more than Dollars 800m in foreign debt and last year saw net profits fall 61 per cent to Rp81.5bn. Dismal sales also coincided with a financial crisis for the Soeryadjaya family, Astra's founders, when their privately-owned Bank Summa was closed at the end of 1992 owing more than Rp1,600bn. According to analysts, the Soeryadjayas now own less than 10 per cent of Astra, compared to 73 per cent last year. Ownership is principally split between public investors (16 per cent), state-owned financial institutions (27 per cent), and a 17-member consortium of private investors which took a 33 per cent stake in January. Astra's share price has recovered from a low of Rp8,500 last December to Rp13,250, although Toyota paid just Rp10,000 a share for its stake. Toyota said Astra has also asked Toyota representatives to join its board, although there may be problems taking up the invitation under Indonesian law. Brokers were quick to warn that yesterday's purchase does not mean Astra is free of its troubles. Sales for the first four months of the year totalled just 28,495 units (of which 48 per cent were Toyota vehicles), down 12.5 per cent on the same period last year and 42 per cent down on 1991. However, Astra may be able to improve profit margins following tax increases on imported completely built-up cars and reduced tax on imported components for vehicles assembled in Indonesia.</p>

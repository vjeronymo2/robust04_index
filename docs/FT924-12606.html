			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: MY poised to seek acquisitions after sharp jump to Pounds 2m MY HOLDINGS, the packaging company, is heading for the acquisition trail following a sharp rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 547,000 to Pounds 2.02m for the year ended August 31. The group, which is 86.5 per cent controlled by Malbak, the South African packaging company, achieved the increase on sales Pounds 1.4m lower at Pounds 34.3m. However, turnover in 1991 included Pounds 3.74m in sales from currently discontinued businesses. Mr John Monks, chief executive, said the company aimed to increase its range of packaging products through acquisition. A deal would be effected either through borrowings or for paper, he said. The company is believed to be in discussions with three possible targets. Malbak has repeatedly let it be known that it would be willing to dilute its stake substantially. At last night's share price of 38p, up 3p on the day, MY has a market value of about Pounds 16m. The company, which has experienced several years of restructuring since Malbak moved in, cut debt from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 700,000. That factor, and lower interest charges, left debt repayments significantly lower at Pounds 401,000 (Pounds 1.2m). Mr Monks said the debt reduction had been achieved through tight control of working capital, a reduction in stocks and debtor days, and general efficiencies which included cutting lead times for raw materials. 'We are now operating on a true just in time, not a just in case, principle' he said. The steepest rise in profits came in the Sharp subsidiary, which makes blister packs for industrial use. Sales and profits increased by 20 per cent. The corrugated packaging division was steady, helped by lower paper costs at the beginning of the year. However, these were beginning to increase again, Mr Monks said. The moulded packaging division, manufacturing plastic cushions for products such as hi-fi's, suffered a 10 per cent decline in sales. Nevertheless, market share and profits were marginally ahead. Earnings per share expanded from 1.66p to 3.41p, and the total dividend is doubled to 1p with a final of 0.75p.</p>

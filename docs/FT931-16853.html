			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Apocalypse, but not just now - Business and politics / 'Where will all these people go? We won't need them if we are going to utilise Europe as one market.' Percy Barnevik, head of ABB, talks to Guy de Jonquieres FOR Mr Percy Barnevik, president of ABB, the world's largest power engineering group, the advent of the single market marks the fulfilment of a long-cherished dream. Yet as he examines Europe's prospects, the picture he sees is tinged with the shades of an incipient nightmare. Since 1987, when Mr Barnevik master-minded the merger of Sweden's Asea with Switzerland's Brown Boveri, he has acquired a reputation as a far-sighted and decisive manager. The merger - the first in a wave of big cross-border deals - has been followed by about 70 further acquisitions on both sides of the Atlantic. Driven by a vision of Europe without frontiers, ABB has been reshaped into a decentralised transnational enterprise, equipped to operate freely across borders. Mr Barnevik, a 51-year-old Swede, says it is at home in all the 140 countries in which it operates, yet owes fealty to none. But while he remains convinced that the strategy is right, he is increasingly worried that the leap forward represented by EC integration will be jeopardised by long-term economic problems and by growing instability on Europe's eastern borders. At worst, he fears, the fabric of European cohesion will start to unravel. His prime concern is not that the single market programme will prove still-born. Indeed, he is confident that, despite some rearguard protectionism, EC public procurement markets will steadily open up to competition as purchasers seek better value for money. ABB's pursuit of increased efficiency and faster decision-making has earned it a reputation as a ruthless cost-cutter. In four years it has shed 50,000 jobs, while increasing turnover 60 per cent to Dollars 28.8bn in 1991. 'We grow all the time, but we also shrink all the time,' says Mr Barnevik. But the company still has more plants making more products than its main competitors in the US and Japan. 'We have six production centres for bogies and five design centres for traction motors, where only one or two of each are needed. All that has to be standardised, Europeanised,' he says. It is at this point that the doubts start to creep in. If economies are to benefit fully from integration, he says, industry must continue to slim down. Yet by doing so, it risks creating a backlash which will thwart further restructuring: 'All hell breaks loose when we want to close a plant because half the workers walk into unemployment.' He believes the problem is not rooted in recession, but in inexorable advances in productivity. He forecasts that the proportion of Europe's labour force employed in manufacturing and business services will fall from about 35 per cent today to 25 per cent in 10 years' time - and to 15 per cent a decade later. 'Where will all these people go? Out they will go, because we won't need them if we really are going to utilise Europe as one market.' In addition, public sector payrolls will fall sharply as governments are compelled to curb spending and become more efficient. Mr Barnevik reckons the result will be a shake-out comparable to that in agricultural employment earlier this century. But this time, surplus labour will be much harder to absorb because service industries are too sluggish to create enough well paid jobs. 'If anybody tells me, wait two or three years and there will be a hell of a demand for labour, I say, tell me where. What jobs? In what cities? Which companies? When I add it all together, I find a clear risk that the 10 per cent unemployed or underemployed today could easily become 20 to 25 per cent.' 'If you look at service industries, there are highly paid people, like lawyers and investment bankers, and then there are the cleaners and guest workers who earn a third or half as much as skilled factory workers. So we end up either with permanent unemployment or under-employment, or with two classes of differently paid people. Both are social dynamite. That is exactly what will create Fortress Europe. That is what will hamper restructuring.' The blame cannot, he says, be laid on government policies, nor does he see any clear solution: 'If I knew the answer, I should probably win Nobel prizes in several subjects.' Yet, he insists, the problem pales into insignificance compared with the threat to western Europe's future posed by economic disintegration in eastern and central Europe. 'It is tragic to see what is happening. The desperation, the disappointment, people feeling cheated. What is so terrible is to see these lost opportunities, the political destabilisation and the threat to economic development in all of Europe happening before our eyes.' Yet the west's response so far has been supine and impassive, he says. Without much more decisive action, it will pay a heavy price in the form of a massive influx of refugees, which will strain social cohesion to breaking point. Here, he does have a solution to propose. Western governments should sharply increase financial aid over three to five years and back it with generous long-term soft loans, freer market access for exports from eastern Europe and political insurance for western companies investing there. 'Today, nine out of ten western executives say, let's wait, this is too unstable, I can't handle the inflation, I don't speak the language. So they stay out. We must get people in there to introduce the market economy, to organise, to bring computers in, to teach accounting and English, to tell them how to export, purchase and calculate product costs.' This may sound like special pleading by a company which has expanded rapidly in eastern Europe and is seeking to limit its risks. Yet Mr Barnevik insists ABB can look after itself. He cites its operations in Poland, where it has taken only 18 months for ABB's 10,000 workers in eight factories to achieve western quality and productivity levels. 'These people work like crazy. This isn't the third world. Take Russia. It has 12m engineers and 1m PhDs. Russia's strength is not its oil, it is its people. But you have to organise them, motivate them and get them into a normal model of a market economy,' Mr Barnevik says. 'The positive side is that if you do these things right, they can be a major force for stimulation because new markets open up with tremendous needs for telecommunications, energy, transport, health care, you name it.' The drawback is that few western politicians seem ready to contemplate a programme which, Mr Barnevik concedes, would entail short-term sacrifices by the west. 'They tell me it is politically impossible, not least in a time of recession, to advocate more public expenditure.' My conclusion is that we don't have a political system which rewards long-term thinking and looking beyond your own borders.' That will not prevent him from continuing to grab every opportunity to ram home the message that it is in the west's self-interest to act, and that there is not much time left. 'We have to tackle the problem immediately. We are too late already. If you sacrifice a little now, you will get the benefits. If you just sit there and sacrifice nothing, you will get the refugees and will have to maintain your military forces. Then you sacrifice your future and a hell of a lot more. We should not talk about sacrifice. We should talk about how to protect ourselves.'</p>

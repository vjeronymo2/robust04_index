			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: ANI reports ADollars 66.6m loss after Spedley group collapse claim AUSTRALIAN National Industries (ANI), has reported a plunge into net losses of ADollars 66.6m (USDollars 48.2m) for the 12 months to June, from net profits of ADollars 77.5m a year earlier. The figure included an abnormal loss of ADollars 76m, mostly relating to the settlement of a ADollars 900m claim by the liquidator of the collapsed Spedley group. Mr Ted Harris, chairman, said ANI would pay ADollars 22m to the liquidator following an out-of-court settlement. The group will also write off ADollars 28m in payments due from Spedley, raising the cost of the settlement to ADollars 50m. ANI also reported a tax bill of ADollars 81m, compared with ADollars 10m in the previous year, after providing for the full cost of a dispute with the Australian taxation office over the treatment of Spedley-related losses. ANI, a heavy engineering and manufacturing group, owned 45 per cent of the Spedley Securities finance group until 1989, when its holding was sold to Mr Brian Yuill, Spedley's managing director. The group collapsed later the same year. Mr John Harkness, the Spedley liquidator, claimed ANI was partly responsible for the collapse because of its failure to prevent alleged negligence and dishonesty by Mr Yuill, who faces criminal charges in connection with the collapse. Mr Harris said ANI, which denied responsibility, had agreed to settle the claim to bring an end to the uncertainty surrounding the group and the drain on management time. The settlement was within the range expected by the financial markets. However, analysts were surprised by a reduction in the final dividend to 3.7 cents from 6 cents a year earlier, bringing the full-year payment to 9 cents, fully franked, down from 11.3 cents. ANI said the reduced dividend related to economic weakness in Australia and the UK. The group said there was no sign of a recovery in business activity in Australia. Sales fell to ADollars 1.16bn from ADollars 1.3bn. ANI's shares dropped by 4 cents to ADollars 1.71 on the Australian Stock Exchange.</p>

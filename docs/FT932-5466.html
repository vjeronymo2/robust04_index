			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Carolco agrees to Dollars 112.5m infusion CAROLCO, the cash-strapped independent Hollywood film studio, has agreed to an infusion of Dollars 112.5m from a group of investors including Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, another struggling film producer. Carolco hopes that the agreement, announced yesterday, will ensure its survival as one of the film industry's premier film production studios. Under the deal, which requires the approval of Carolco's shareholders, MGM will acquire Dollars 30m of convertible notes, and the other investors - Canal Plus of France, Pioneer of Japan, and Rizzoli of Italy - will buy Dollars 82.5m of a new class of preferred stock. The agreement will leave Canal Plus, Pioneer, and Rizzoli with 63 per cent of the voting power of the company and MGM with 18 per cent. The investors also agreed to satisfy part of a Dollars 32.2m loan made to Carolco in March 1992, in exchange for the company's 51.7 per cent stake in Live Entertainment, the music and video retailer. Although Carolco has scored big box office successes with such films as Terminator 2 and Basic Instinct, rising debts, incurred partly because of lavish spending on big-budget films, have threatened to overwhelm it. Only yesterday Carolco said it had defaulted on three different tranches of debt. Last month the studio reported a loss of Dollars 88m for 1992, down from the Dollars 265m loss incurred in 1991. Yesterday's financing agreement comes five weeks after Tele-Communications, the big US cable company, signed a letter of intent to invest Dollars 90m in Carolco in return for the exclusive rights to show the studio's movies on pay-per-view television. News of the deal did not appear to impress the stockmarkets, where Carolco shares fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 1 1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. Credit Lyonnais, the French bank which owns MGM, announced yesterday that Mr Dennis Stanfill had stepped down as co-chief executive of the Hollywood studio. He will stay on as a senior adviser to Credit Lyonnais, helping the bank run its entertainment and cinema interests. The move, which follows reports in the Hollywood trade press last week that Mr Stanfill was leaving MGM because of management differences with Credit Lyonnais, leaves Mr Alan Ladd in sole charge of the studio.</p>

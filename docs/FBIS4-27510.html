			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Japan's Crimes in Aggression Can Never be Pardoned" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today  points out that the Japanese authorities and reactionaries are  stepping up the moves to revive militarism and convert Japan  into a military power while refusing to admit Japan's past  crimes.    This was made clear when Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata  said recently at the Budget Committee of the House of  Representatives that he had no intention to define the war waged  by Japan against Asian nations in the past as "a war of  aggression" and Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito  brought forward the doctrine of "ordinary state", the analyst  says, and continues:    Immeasurable are the misfortunes and disasters imposed on  the  Korean and other Asian peoples by the Japanese imperialists' war  of aggression and their policy of colonial looting.  Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities and reactionaries  refuse to properly admit Japan's past crimes. This well shows  how shameless they are.    Just voices demanding the liquidation of the Japanese  imperialists' past doings are growing louder not only among the  Asian people but also among the world people. The Japanese  authorities and reactionaries, far from lending an ear to their  just demand and honestly responding to it, are now racing  headlong toward the conversion of Japan into a military power,  denying that the war started by Japan was "a war of aggression."  Yet the Japanese authorities are coveting a permanent seat of  the United Nations Security Council.    The acts of the Japanese authorities and reactionaries can  never be tolerated.    The Japanese authorities should act with discretion, mindful  that their acts are an intolerable challenge to the people in  Asia and the rest of the world.</p>

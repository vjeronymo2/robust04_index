			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Johnston Gp losses continue JOHNSTON GROUP, the civil and mechanical engineer, yesterday continued its loss making run, as its late 1980s foray into property continued to hit performance. The group fell to an interim pre-tax loss of Pounds 765,000 (profits of Pounds 1.25m). At the operating level Johnston barely broke even. Losses per share were 7.52p, against earnings of 5.22p. The interim dividend is bing cut from 4.5p to 2.25p. Mr Graham Johnston, chairman, said that most of the group's markets had been adversely affected by reduced demand and tighter margins. The group said it would review the value of development properties at the year end and that a further revaluation was likely. Rental values had fallen since a Pounds 4m exceptional provision was made last December. The contracting and construction division was hit by the Caribbean activities which had what Mr Brian Deller, the finance director, called a 'horrendous first half'. The building materials division was 25 per cent lower than last year. However the sweeper activities, helped by significant export orders, had a much improved profit. Mr Deller said that in the short term trading conditions looked bleak.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Rap to raise Pounds 1m less than expected Rap Group, the rubber and plastics distributor, will raise Pounds 1m less from its flotation than was expected when its pathfinder prospectus was published on November 15. In common with several recent new issues, Rap has had to alter its plans because of lower than expected institutional demand. Mr David Emmett, chairman and chief executive, who co-led a management buy-out in 1991, said: 'We obviously had to react to market conditions but the important thing is to get the listing.' According to the prospectus, published yesterday, Rap will receive Pounds 3.55m net from the flotation compared with an original estimate of Pounds 4.6m. The market capitalisation will be Pounds 15.1m, down from Pounds 17m. The planned placing price of 145p was lowered to 142p and the prospective p/e for the year to December 31 is 11.1, down from 11.5. Gearing will rise from an expected 12 per cent to 36 per cent. The flotation involves the placing of 2.8m shares, 40 per cent of the equity capital. The eight member management team will sell a further 450,000 shares for Pounds 640,000, leaving it with a 36 per cent holding, and Causeway Capital, the only investor at the time of the MBO, will sell 1m shares for Pounds 1.42m, giving it a 23 per cent stake. Of the Pounds 3.55m raised, Pounds 2.1m will be used to redeem the outstanding preference shares, currently held by Causeway. The remainder will be used to provide additional working capital and to finance further acquisitions. New shares will be issued for larger acquisitions. The pre-tax profits forecast for the year to December 31 remains Pounds 1.7m, up from Pounds 1.2m in 1993.</p>

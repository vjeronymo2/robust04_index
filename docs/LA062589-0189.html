			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SHATTERED DREAM: CHINA /1989  </P> <P> For a brief moment, it was one man against an army. One individual who stood  alone against a column of tanks. One citizen who, to many, stood for an entire  nation of 1.1 billion Chinese.  </P> <P> The man jumped on top of the lead tank and talked briefly to the soldiers  before friends hauled him away to safety.  </P> <P> Many were not so lucky. The People's Liberation Army turned its guns on them in  a simultaneous display of the brute physical strength and the unmistakable  political weakness of China's rulers.  </P> <P> For centuries before Christ, a succession of emperors had ruled China with the  power of the sword. Deng Xiaoping had appeared willing to try a new way. For  the better part of a decade, the 84-year-old Deng, China's supreme leader, had  permitted a measure of economic freedom.  </P> <P> For many Chinese students, that was not enough. They massed in Tian An Men  Square in central Beijing, chanting slogans for democracy, demanding a free  press, erecting an imitation Statue of Liberty.  </P> <P> This was more than Deng and the octogenarian leaders of the Communist Party  were willing to permit.  </P> <P> During the night of Saturday, June 3, troops moved toward the center of  Beijing. In the ensuing clashes, hundreds of people were killed, perhaps  thousands. At 7:40 a.m. on Sunday, a government loudspeaker announced to an  empty, bloodstained square: "Rebellion has been suppressed, and the soldiers  are now in charge of Tian An Men."  </P> <P> But the shock waves from the Chinese demonstrations will reverberate for years  both inside China and throughout the world.  </P> <P> For many in China, the spring of 1989 shattered whatever faith they retained in  the ruling Communist Party and its leaders.  </P> <P> And around the globe, millions became moral supporters of the demonstrators,  glorying in their triumphs and grieving in their ultimate suppression.  </P> <P> What follows is an account of what, for now, remains a shattered dream.  </P></p>

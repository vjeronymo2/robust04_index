			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Inquiry starts into BAe move to develop airfield A public inquiry opens tomorrow into what the business community in the west of England regards as one the most important issues for the region's economic future. Mrs Jean Brushfield, the Department of the Environment inspector, will be leading the inquiry into a fiercely opposed application by British Aerospace to develop its airfield at Filton, north Bristol, into a commercial airport. While noise within a densely populated area - especially at night - will be the main issue at the inquiry, the outcome is crucial to the development of a principal regional airport for the south-west, and the argument over where such an airport should be sited. Watching the inquiry closely will be Bristol's existing Lulsgate airport and Cardiff-Wales airport, which would both face tough competition, and the promoters of two grandiose international airport schemes, one on the Severn estuary and the other near the new Severn bridge. Local businesspeople believe Filton airport is essential. Mr Chris Curtis, director of the south-west Confederation of British Industry, said: 'The south-west is probably the only UK region without a decent airport. We need one.' 'We are far from certain Lulsgate can provide what we need. To maintain our place as a major European region we need more airline destinations and greatly increased services. We believe Filton can provide that. It has ideal surface communications.' Within an hour's drive of Filton there are 3.3m people compared with 1.7m for Lulsgate. Few dispute that the former, close to the M4 and M5 motorways and railway, is in principle a better location than Lulsgate, which is south of Bristol and has poor road links and no train service. There is a drawback. In the past decade more than 4,000 houses have been built within two miles of Filton. After heated public meetings and thousands of protest letters, the planning authority, Northavon District Council, has decided to oppose BAe's application. Bristol City Council, which owns Lulsgate, is among other objectors. BAe said its existing airfield, used for company flights run by Air Bristol and maintenance business, costs Pounds 1.5m a year and is under-used. It believes scheduled services would prove a 'tremendous attraction' and help safeguard the company's adjacent manufacturing plant, where more than 5,000 people work. The company plans a terminal handling up to 350,000 passengers a year. Operations would be limited to 23,000 annual movements, including 20 each night, in addition to maintenance flights. There would be no charter flights, although there would be freight. Airlines would fly 'quiet' aircraft such as the BAe 146 and it is claimed the noise impact would be small. In contrast, Northavon council estimates 1,300 houses would suffer noise sufficient to warrant insulation, and many expect there would soon be demand for long-haul services and larger aircraft. Although BAe says there could be room for two Bristol airports, Lulsgate fears its success would be undermined. It made record pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.6m in the year to March 31 with 1.2m passengers and said business travel is the fastest-growing sector. It is the hub for the Brymon services run by British Airways but, if BAe wins consent, Lulsgate could be hard-pressed to retain these. The Department of Transport said the government's strategy was not to direct from the centre. Instead, it was to 'facilitate the provision of airport capacity to meet demand substantially where it arises, while minimising the impact of airport development on the environment'. Consultants for Avon County Council consider Lulsgate could meet likely demand until 2005, but approval for Filton would inhibit the necessary investment. At Lulsgate private capital is being sought to build a Pounds 14m terminal handling up to 2m passengers a year and capable of expansion to 3.5m. This would have its own environmental impact - the airport is in a green belt. Bristol City Council, fearful for Lulsgate's future, is sceptical of Filton's value in determining the region's economic well-being and believes job creation there could be offset by job losses at Lulsgate. The south-east regional planning conference, in a report last month, described Lulsgate as the only south-west airport performing a regional role. 'The one major drawback is, without doubt, the transport links which are impossible to improve without massive investment that could not be justified in a regional context.' In the Filton debate, it concluded, 'a fine judgment will be required between the need for enhanced regional and local needs for airport facilities as against the environmental implications'. From tomorrow, and until the inquiry is due to end in mid-January, Mrs Brushfield will need to use that judgment.</p>

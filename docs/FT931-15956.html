			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / The Long View: Bonds may deliver KO SO THE fund managers had another bumper year in equities and the dogged minority who put their faith in fixed interest gilts have once again been forced to take a rain check. That is the kind way to interpret the latest figures from the performance measurement specialists at the WM Company, which showed that British pension funds earned a total return, taking capital and income together, of between 19 and 20 per cent in 1992. A more realistic verdict might be that the trustees and fund managers of the average pension fund, which continues to hold a whopping 78 per cent of its assets in equities, were saved by the bell. Were it not for sterling's dramatic exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September, gilts would have put equities in the shade on the basis of their performance in the first three quarters of the year. The great debate on the respective merits of the two principle categories of investment thus rages on. How long can the pension funds maintain their historically high exposure to equities in the face of overwhelming pressure to expand their bond holdings? The institutional investor's disinclination to buy gilts is understandable against the background of one of the sharpest deteriorations in public finances in living memory. Most analysts expect the PSBR, that left-over from the 1970s, to exceed Pounds 50bn in 1993. Since institutional cash flow is a little under Pounds 40bn, something has to yield. The obvious candidate, unless foreign investors pick up the gauntlet, is the gilt yield itself, which must surely rise in the face of such a huge funding burden. QED. The trouble with this argument is that it has been around for some time and is widely understood. For it to convince, its proponents have to explain why gilt yields have not already surged into double figures, as estimates of the PSBR have come close to trebling over the past year or so. But before pursuing the argument further, consider the conventional wisdom in equities. The easing of policy on both the exchange rate and interest rates fronts since devaluation unquestionably paves the way for economic recovery. The problem here is that domestic consumption looks set for a painfully slow revival, while the competitive devaluation took place just as Britain's trading partners especially in Europe, started sinking towards the doldrums. After the big valuation adjustment in equities in the fourth quarter of 1992, the historic price earnings ratio on equities is well over 17, which assumes an impressive profit recovery. Will it come up to expectations? Against that background it is important to remember that the capital component of the total return recorded by the WM Company is, from an actuarial perspective, fool's gold. The actuary is interested in income, not paper gains in the stock market. And dividends last year fell 5 per cent in real terms, according to WM, raising questions about what might happen if actuarial surpluses disappear. Since the 1980s corporate earnings have been boosted by reductions in pension contributions. The resulting increase in earnings has facilitated higher dividend payments, which in turn have contributed to pension fund surpluses. If this British form of what the Japanese call zaitech, or financial engineering, goes into reverse, a virtuous circle could turn vicious. People with a sceptical turn of mind might conclude that we have just witnessed the last fling of equities, before the official declaration of the Decade of the Bond. If so, the question is why pension fund trustees and managers still adopt what the Americans would call a highly aggressive stance in equities. One answer is that gilts were consistently mispriced in their formative years in the face of unanticipated inflation. Another is that they were taught to believe that they needed to match real, earning-related liabilities with real assets such as equities and property. The real assets argument is clearly guff. Commercial property was no kind of hedge against inflation in the 1980s. As for mispricing, note that estimates of the rate of increase in UK earnings are falling by the day and unemployment is rising inexorably. With average earnings going up at 4 1/2  5 per cent in a very slowly growing economy, while long gilts yield 8 1/2  9 per cent, a historically high real rate of interest could prove a better match for pension liabilities than a wilting dividend stream from equities. It seems plausible that mispricing of an equal and opposite kind could take place in present disinflationary circumstances. One thing that might just tilt the argument on the allocation of assets is a change in financial structure. In 1980, the net cash flow into pension funds ran at nearly 20 per cent of assets. By 1990 it was down to 4 per cent; WM expects it to be well below 3 per cent this year. That means that with dividends weakening on 80 per cent of the portfolio, many funds will have had to liquidate investments to pay the pensioners. In short, liquidity has become more important; and as we all know, there is no more liquid investment than gilts. There is also the fact that the Goode Committee's deliberations on occupational pensions could ultimately lead to stricter funding rules that would affect the shape of pension fund portfolios. US pension funds hold three to four times as much fixed interest paper as their British equivalents because holding bonds makes it easier to avoid underfunding under American rules. The big weakness in this case for gilts is one that has been expressed here by my colleague Barry Riley. At its simplest, the value of gilts is in the hands of the government and the present government's reputation in monetary policy is one of matchless incompetence. But if you share that view, the correct response is not to maintain 80 per cent in equities, but to increase overseas bond holdings in countries with a better reputation for monetary management. One way or another, the equity content is going to fall.</p>

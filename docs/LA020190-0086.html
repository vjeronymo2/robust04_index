			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TORREY PINES DROPS RBV BACK INTO PACK  </P> <P> Torrey Pines held a one-point advantage going into the final quarter, then  proceeded to outscore Rancho Buena Vista, 21-16, for a crucial, 64-58 Palomar  League victory.  </P> <P> RBV (9-9, 5-4), which had been hanging surprisingly close in the standings,  fell three games behind league-leading Mt. Carmel and two behind Torrey Pines  (20-2, 8-1).  </P> <P> Torrey Pines' Kyle Armstrong led all scorers with 18. Carter Brown helped put  RBV away late in the game with some crucial one-and-ones. He was five of seven  from the line and finished with 13 points.  </P> <P> RBV's Bond Schoefel entered the game in the second quarter and scored 10 of his  16 points before halftime. Brad Grubaugh also scored 16 for the Longhorns.  </P> <P> Daryl Parker, who entered the game with a 23.7-point average, was held to just  12.  </P> <P> Mt. Carmel 59, Fallbrook 54 -- Mt. Carmel (16-3, 9-0) maintained an eight-point  lead through much of the game, but things tightened up with two minutes left.  </P> <P> Fallbrook's Darnell Lee made a field goal, and Mt. Carmel's Shane Knight was  called for a technical foul. Chris Miller made both free throws, then got the  ball back on the inbounds and hit a three-pointer to cut Fallbrook's deficit to  55-54.  </P> <P> But Mt. Carmel's Ryan Wootton made a quick layup, Fallbrook (14-7, 5-4) missed  its next shot, and the Sundevils then scored again to put it away.  </P> <P> Poway 98, Orange Glen 46 -- Poway (13-5, 4-5) had four in double figures: Greg  Sorrell (19), Frank Garrett (15), Kirk Hipple (14) and Zeke Awbrey (13).  </P> <P> Avocado League  </P> <P> El Camino 90, Ramona 51 -- Ramona (12-5, 4-4) never recovered from a two-point  first quarter.

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Arts: Operatic dementia, whirlwind chaos - Cinema LORENZO'S OIL (12) George Miller HONEYMOON IN VEGAS (12) Andrew Bergman LEON THE PIG FARMER (15) Vadim Jean and Gary Sinyor UNDER SIEGE (15) Andrew Davis ROMPER STOMPER (18) Geoffrey Wright Soaring crane shots; music by Verdi and Bellini; heraldic frenzies of colour co-ordination; lighting that crosses Rembrandt with Delacroix. Lorenzo's Oil takes the kind of subject usually reserved for the small screen - a true-life tale of family heroism fighting illness and medical bigotry - and nearly bursts a blood vessel trying to inflate it for the large. In this 136 minutes of operatic dementia from director George 'Mad Max' Miller, a small but radiant seam of truthfulness is provided by Susan Sarandon. She plays Michaela Odone, mother of the ALD-suffering child who gave his name to the rapeseed-derived medication of the title. ALD - Adrenoleukodystrophy - struck five-year-old Lorenzo in Washington DC in 1983. The disease, which damages the brain via the nerve system, might have terminated the boy soon after but for the cure-seeking tenacity of his mother and father Augusto (played by a Nick Nolte involved in his own life-or-death struggle with an Italian accent). Michaela and Augusto, hacking through a jungle of 'triglycerides,' 'myelinations' and 'C24/26' fatty acids, finally stumbled on a clearing in the form of a simple vegetable oil sent for synthesising to a veteran British biochemist. The said boffin, Don Suddaby, plays himself in the film and is - no disrespect - a hoot. His walnut face and diffident Northern burr, at bay amid the Hollywood test tubes, belong in a different movie from the house-style hyperboles of director Miller, who has not come down to earth from his last American film The Witches Of Eastwick. Lorenzo's Oil begins con molto espressione - baroque cathedral ceiling behind credits, opera booming from Nolte's car radio, hospital corridors lit like celestial travel brochures - and then moves into maestoso con total overkill. A theoretically touching human story, lashed forward by this laying-on of styles, needs a gentling hand from the actors but gets it only from Sarandon. She wraps the role so tenderly and completely around herself that we are engulfed by every close-up. Watch her face as it flickers with fear and choked-back grief at the first bad news from the doctor. Or watch that face open like a plant to sunlight at the first hints of recovery from Lorenzo. The rest of the cast struggle to keep up. Peter Ustinov is woolly and unfocused as Professor Nikolais, the family's helper-hinderer from the medical establishment. And poor Nolte, wrestling with his Italian accent like Laocoon with his snakes, has some wild moments of overacted or overdirected emoting on dim-lit stairways and in brainstorming libraries. Lorenzo's Oil, one surmises, is the right project fallen among the wrong people. We should believe in the Odones as human beings first, tragic or operatic paradigms second. And we should beware of any film in which the stages of deadly illness are nudged forward by Maria Callas singing 'Casta Diva' or by 'Una Furtiva Lagrima' coercing tears that should need no coercion at all. Watching Honeymoon In Vegas is like being dragged off on an unsolicited holiday, with no time to pack or pleasurably anticipate, and then discovering that one enjoys every minute. 'No, I don't want to go to Las Vegas with Nicolas Cage]' - but we do. 'No, I don't want to go to Hawaii with James Caan.' But when Mr Caan takes us there - he plays a mobster who has won a weekend with Cage's fiancee Sarah Jessica Parker after humiliating him at poker - we calm down, stop gibbering and enjoy ourselves. Film-maker Andrew Bergman wrote Blazing Saddles and wrote/directed The In-Laws and The Freshman: films in which a touch of frantic went with the funny. Honeymoon In Vegas is his operation yet. It begins with suave hilarity in New York, where the world's worst private eye (Cage) copes with adultery paranoiacs who suppose their wives are sleeping with Mike Tyson. In Vegas - Cage and Parker jet there for a whirlwind wedding - life is a sweetly obstructive chaos of gambling disaster, Elvis impersonator conventions and charming con men. Then the chase is on as Cage crosses seas and continents to retrieve the prettily twittering Miss P. Pleasures of the journey include Peter Boyle as a Hawaian chief who can sing all of South Pacific and almost does; a fussy man buying a ticket at an airline counter (funniest off-wall vignette since the art gallery scene in Beverly Hills Cop); and - well, the list is agreeably long, and so is the charm-and-comedy mileage Bergman gets from the simple tale of a Caan-man stealing a bird from a gelded Cage. Every time I tut-tut in print over British cinema's tendency to whinge about its need for subsidy, a small army of commentators gets purple with indignation at me. Yet Leon The Pig Farmer was made by Vadim Jean and Gary Sinyor on a tiny self-raised budget and went on to win the Best First Film prize at Edinburgh and the International Critics Prize at Venice. The moral is simple. Talent and determination find cash and win prizes. While everyone else weeps and begs on the Arts Ministry doormat, Sinyor and Jean have signed up a fee-deferring cast - Janet Suzman, Brian Glover, Gina Bellman - and fashioned this cockeyed comedy about a young Jewish estate agent (Mark Frankel) who discovers he is the product of artificial insemination. Is his father not the London net-curtain tycoon David De Keyser? No, he is the north-country pig farmer Brian Glover. Hearing this news, the entire close-knit Jewish community rears up around him - a veritable Kosher Nostra - offering outrage or sympathy. And the two sets of parents, Keyser/Suzman and Glover/Connie Booth, meet at a Yalta-style suburban conference where they swap accents in a diplomatic hailstorm of 'Oy-veys' and 'Eeh, lads.' Jewish film comedy, rampant in America, is virtually unknown in Britain. But Leon essays the classic mixture of tribal self-deprecation  - like Woody Allen, the film's hero tries to hide his yarmulka under a protective hail of WASP wit or suavity - and surreal visions of human togetherness. Just as Allen plucked Marshal McLuhan out of a movie queue, Frankel is approached by total strangers in art galleries or petrol stations. In a global village turned funny-terrifying gossip shop, they know all his problems and offer instant advice. In Under Siege Steven Seagal, the action star with the superglued frown, plays a Navy cook aboard the battleship USS Missouri. One day a bunch of terrorists come on board and take over the ship's nuclear arsenal. Seagal tells them to go away, using the following means of expression: an automatic rifle, a hunting knife, a bomb in a microwave, a private army of fellow sea-salts still at liberty, and the ship's 16-inch guns. (The terrorists by now are trying to escape in a submarine.) I liked this film's insouciance. When the Pentagon calls Seagal by emergency phone to ask how things are going, Seagal's girlfriend says 'He's in a gunfight right now. I'll have to take a message.' And headbanded villain Tommy Lee Jones has time to muse 'I miss the Sixties' between killing people, having psychotic tantrums and trying to nuke Honolulu. Clean simple fun, directed by Andrew Davis from a script by JF Lawton. Why was the press-show print of Romper Stomper so hideous? Processed as if in blue ink, it makes the 90 minutes of this shock-horror Australian tale of neo-Nazi skinheads seem like 90 years. At best Geoffrey Wright's film, which won a succes de scandale on last year's festival circuit, is a fitful thing: part handheld docudrama of race hatred - the gang-warfare scenes are violently effective - and part leaden-footed melodrama of romantic jealousy. But if all London's distributors can offer is this blue-rinse eyesore, wait for the video.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht 'chaos' rapped MPS HIT out yesterday at the 'chaotic' state of affairs that has left them ignorant of which amendments to the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty they will be asked to vote on when they conclude detailed consideration of clause one of the bill, probably tonight. On the eve of the measure's return to the Commons, Mr Peter Shore, the veteran Labour Euro-sceptic, called on Mr Michael Morris, deputy speaker, to clarify the position as early as possible when today's debate gets under way. Mr Shore was supported by Mr Nigel Spearing, another Euro-sceptic Labour MP. Mr Shore said he would be adding his voice to cross-party calls for Mr Morris to reconsider a decision not to allow a vote on Labour's potentially crucial amendment 27 - which would remove the protocol containing Britain's opt-out from Maastricht's social chapter. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, was last night due to see Mr Morris in person to plead the case for allowing a vote. If the deputy speaker does reverse his decision, the vote - which could deal a severe blow to the government - would probably come later tonight. If he sticks to his guns, there would be a vote on a separate Labour clause to prevent powers being transferred under the bill until MPs had decided whether the social chapter should apply to the UK. There were rumours last night that disgruntled Tory Euro-sceptics might attempt to call a vote of no confidence in Mr Morris if he confirmed that no vote on amendment 27 would be allowed. Hard-core Tory rebels were expected to meet to discuss tactics today before the committee stage resumed.</p>

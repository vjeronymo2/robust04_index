			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Compromise sought on HDTV row MR John Major, the British prime minister, faced intense pressure last night to agree a new compromise to unblock European Community funding for development of high definition television technology. Officials travelling with Mr Major and Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, to the US-EC talks in Washington said the two held private talks to try to resolve the row over HDTV which broke out on the Canadian leg of their North American visit. The two men discussed a Dutch proposal, expected to be tabled at a meeting of the European Community's foreign affairs council on Monday. It is thought the compromise, a combination of ideas from Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers and Mr Delors, would assure significant backing for the HDTV programme being run by Phillips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France. The Dutch are understood to have agreed to incorporate British objections that HDTV technology risks being overtaken by more advanced digital television technology. A possible compromise is that the UK would commit itself to the principle of a five-year spending plan; but it would restrict funding to one year, pending a thorough review of technologies. At a heated meeting of EC telecom ministers on Tuesday, the UK offered Ecu80m (Pounds 63.8m) interim support. But the 11 other EC states, led by the Netherlands and France, supported a commitment now of Ecu500m over the next five years. Despite talk of compromise neither Mr Major nor Mr Delors was willing yesterday to withdraw from positions taken earlier this week on whether Britain had reneged on an agreement reached at last weekend's Edinburgh summit. Mr Delors and Mr Lubbers insist the record of the summit shows that Mr Major agreed to lift his veto on the long-term funding of HDTV. Mr Major is adamant he offered no such commitment.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the NASD is aware that under New York law, which is often applicable to an arbitration or to one or more parties to a proceeding, a respondent in an arbitration case must file an application for an order enjoining the arbitration of a claim on statute of limitations grounds within twenty days of service of the claim in order to preserve any statute of limitations defense for use in a subsequent court proceeding. The filing of such an application will have no effect on the Director's eligibility determination; if the claim is eligible, the respondent can raise his statute of limitations defense before the arbitrator, if it is ineligible, he can raise the defense in court. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD intends to make the proposed amendments to Section 15 applicable to all claims filed after the effective date of the amendments without regard to when the cause of action accrued or arose, or the timing of the event or occurrence giving rise to the dispute. The NASD will advise its members that the proposed amendment will apply retroactively to all claims brought after the effective date of the amendment. The NASD will also advise its members and associated persons that they have expressly agreed that under the NASD's rules all agreements currently in effect are subject to the amendment to the Code. Although one court has recently held that amendments to the Code do not apply to claims which have already accrued to require arbitration of the claim, <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  the NASD believes that case was a decision about the scope of the agreement to arbitrate_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> whether the parties had agreed to arbitrate the particular claim_a subject which courts have virtually always held is for the courts to decide. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Kresock v. Bankers Trust Company,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 F. 3d 176, 179 (2d Cir. 1994) (`` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Kresock <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The court stated that the parties could not have agreed to arbitrate the claim in issue in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Kresock <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  case thereby rejecting the NASD's assertion, supported by the NASD's rule filing on the amendment in issue, that the amendment was merely a codification of existing interpretations of the Code. Moreover, the amendments to the Code at issue in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Kresock <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , according to the court, did not purport to apply retroactively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act in that the proposed rule change will protect investors and the public interest by facilitating the arbitration process through expeditious resolution of eligibility issues arising under Section 15 of the Code by authorizing the Director to determine whether a claim or controversy occurred less than 6 years prior to filing in the event eligibility is disputed by a responding party. Moreover, in order to protect investors and the public interest by avoiding disruptions and uncertainty about the authority to act under the Code, the NASD is proposing to amend Section 3 of the Code to permit the duties and functions of the Director to be delegated by the Director or the Executive Vice President, Member Services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> B <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> )  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> (C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> )  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The original proposed rule change was published for comment by the SEC on October 26, 1993 in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33108.

First, any arbitration forum has the inherent right to limit access to its forum in order to preserve and direct resources to the disposition of cases in the manner it deems most efficient. The Code currently limits access to the forum to those cases where the dispute, claim or controversy occurred within six years of submission of the claim. Second, the Arbitration Department currently determines the eligibility of a claim for arbitration as a matter of the sufficiency of the allegations in a statement of claim. The Department examines the statement of claim to determine if it alleges events or occurrences on which the claim is based and which, on their face, are within six years of the filing of the claim. If it does, the claim is eligible for arbitration. If the respondent contests the eligibility of a claim, the issue is currently resolved by the courts or the arbitrators, depending on where the respondent pursued resolution of the issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Amir Taheri, Lutfi Shatarah, Khalil Matar, </F> 'Abd-al-Qawiyy al-Shami, and Naji al-Harazi: "French-Made Tank  Appears in Attack on Aden"]    [Excerpt] London, New York, Aden, Sanaa, Rabat, AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT -- Arab and international diplomatic endeavors were  stepped up yesterday to secure a peace formula in Aden amid the  escalating fighting in which the northern leadership in Sanaa is  trying to storm Aden or seize the oil refinery or other vital  installations there.    Eyewitnesses have said that three northern aircraft  bombarded  the oil refinery in Aden yesterday, causing damage to two  pipelines.    In a significant development, southern military sources have  stressed the northern forces' use of modern French-made tanks  which were not among the Yemeni Army's armament after  unification.    The sources pointed out that the tanks are part of the  military aid provided recently to Sanaa by two Arab states with  financing from a non-Arab Islamic state that has broadened and  reinforced its relations with the Sanaa regime, especially since  the Yemeni war broke out.    Northern forces intensified their bombardment of the  positions near Aden airport, damaging part of Aden Hotel, the  Badr Camp, and the al-Nasr Free Trade company. [passage omitted]</p>

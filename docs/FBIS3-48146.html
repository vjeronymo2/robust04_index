			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Communist guerrillas yesterday claimed  responsibility for Monday's killing of a security officer in an  automotive parts manufacturing company in Kalookan City.    The ambush came two days after the Alex Boncayao Brigade  (ABB) released to media its target list of 345 lawmen, officials  and civilians allegedly involved in drug trafficking,  kidnapping, prostitution and gambling.    Killed was Carmelito G. Valmonte, 62, a retired inspector at  the Western Police District Command. He died on the spot after  sustaining four gunshot wounds, police said.    Four men and a woman reportedly opened fire with .45 caliber  automatics on Valmonte as he was driving out of the compound of  UE Automotive Manufacturing, Inc. (UEAMI) where he was security  officer.    Paulo Ramirez, ABB spokesman, told the INQUIRER over the  telephone that Valmonte was responsible for the violent  dispersal of a workers' strike at the firm last year.    He said three workers were shot during the dispersal, one of  whom was seriously wounded and his foot had to be amputated.    Ramirez said Valmonte was not on the ABB list but is  considered "an enemy of the people and the revolution."    Mayor Alfredo Lim denounced the killing as "cowardly" and  directed Senior Superintendent Hermogenes Ebdane, Manila police  chief, to place his entire police force on alert.    Superintendent Romeo Maganto, Manila police chief for  administration, said the 6,000-strong Manila Crusade for Peace  and Democracy (MPCD) will be tapped to neutralize the ABB threat.    Maganto said the MCPD will serve as an intelligence network  to gather information on the activities of suspected ABB members.    "We are not alarmed and we are not afraid. Mga langaw lang  sila na nakadapo sa kalabaw (They are merely flies sitting atop  a carabao)," Maganto said.    Maganto said several ABB leaders operating in Manila have  already been identified, adding it would only be a matter of  time before they are captured.    President Ramos himself has acknowledged the capability of  ABB assassins to launch a fresh wave of attacks against hundreds  of lawmen and officials allegedly engaged in crime and  corruption.    Mr. Ramos said he has ordered a close watch on the ABB.    The Communist Party of the Philippines, led by Jose Maria  Sison, ordered the ABB to disband in 1992 amid a public outcry  against its indiscriminate killings. But anti-Sison cadres in  the ABB defied the order.</p>

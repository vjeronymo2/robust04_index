			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / French truck drivers accept outline accord: Slow progress in lifting blockades FRENCH TRUCK drivers' repre-sentatives yesterday accepted an outline accord on pay and working conditions, but vowed to keep up the pressure on the government in their nine-day stoppage. The move, which comes as some of the barricades are being dismantled, is a significant climbdown by truck drivers' organisations in the face of the government's determination to hold on to the principle of tough new licence regulations. Under the new rules, drivers could be banned if they clock up six penalty points. However, the organisations added that this was only the start of negotiations. Progress was slow in clearing the blockades which have left thousands of motorists and foreign truck drivers stranded. By the early afternoon the government reported that more than a third of the roadblocks had been lifted, though sporadic protests broke out in new areas. Farmers blocked trains in the Loire valley in protest against supply shortages and European Community agriculture policy reforms. The two main professional bodies, FNTR and Unostra, yesterday called on truck drivers to abandon their barricades, but to continue to strike. The shift from open anarchy to the first stages of negotiation came as a result of an overnight meeting between the government, unions and the two main driver employers' organisations to draft plans to soften the impact of the new rules, which came into effect on July 1. Truck drivers argued that the rules would put many of them out of work because they could not avoid breaking the law on the long distances that they have to drive. One-man subcontractors, who make up nearly 40 per cent of French haulage companies, have suffered from a sharp fall in rates since prices were freed in 1986, which has put pressure on them to drive longer and faster. Unostra, the subcontractors' organisation, said that Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, had promised to reintroduce fixed minimum rates for subcontractors. The group said it would call its men back to work once the government had confirmed 'the installation, as soon as possible, of subcontracting rates that enable carriers to cover costs'. The FNTR said this was 'only the opening of negotiations on improved working conditions'. The other main aspects of the eight-point deal are: to review working hours; to consider adjusting the application of the points system to truckers; to oblige employers to find other jobs for banned drivers; to pay for driving lessons for banned truckers; and to ban bonuses likely to reward unsafe driving. Few truckers are union members, but the trade unions involved in the talks recommended the deal, sensitive to union members in other industries who were laid off as a result of the truck siege. In another attempt to defuse labour unrest, the government has brought forward, by 11 days to July 20, the announcement of an aid package for farmers hit by EC agriculture policy reforms.

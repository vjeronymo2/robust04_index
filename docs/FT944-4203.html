			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / People: Reece: a class act for London Scottish For the second time in its history, Manchester's London Scottish Bank has turned to Great Universal Stores for its chief executive. Roy Reece, 47, group marketing director of GUS Home Shopping, has joined the consumer finance group as chief executive (designate). London Scottish Bank, which celebrates its centenary next year, has been seeking a new chief executive for some time since most of its senior executives are approaching the company's retirement age of 57. Jack Livingstone, whose grandfather founded the company, plans to retire as chairman next March and will hand over to Martin West, 56, who succeeded him as chief executive in 1988. West, who joined as finance director in 1976, says that the company wanted somebody who was young enough to take the group into the next century and bring some new ideas. West had known Reece from their time together at GUS and believes that Reece's marketing skills will complement his own finance background. Reece is not a banker, but West does not regard this as a problem and stressed that the type of people London Scottish deals with are the same as Reece's mail order customers. London Scottish, started in a terraced house in Wigan, has around 100,000 mainly working class customers and a network of over 100 offices around the country. It specialises in lending sums of around Pounds 600 to people who find difficulty getting credit from the High Street banks. With an average of 2m county court judgments a year, West says that there are plenty of people who are refused credit under traditional credit scoring techniques. Although London Scottish gets to know its customers through home visits, it still had bad debts of Pounds 2m out of Pounds 32m of gross income last year. Fortunately, the group has its own debt collection business which helps explain why profits are expected to be up by nearly a quarter to Pounds 5.6m this year.</p>

Does this  mean that the war between the Serbs and Croats is over?    [Jovanovic] The war has come to an end and both sides are of  the opinion that peace and prosperity are only possible with  normal relations. Thus, the opening of the offices in Belgrade  and Zagreb follows from it. Experience has shown that the  results of direct talks between the two sides are far more  successful than is the case if a third side, foreign countries,  interfere. The offices are only the first step to mutual  recognition.    [Vujovic] The greatest problem are the borders within the  former Yugoslavia....    [Jovanovic] The FRY does not have any territorial claims  against its neighbors. Thus, there is no border problem between  us and the former Yugoslav republics. However, the problem is  that individual republics have deprived the Serbian people who  have lived in these territories for centuries of the right to  decide on their future. It is the same right that these  republics used for themselves in order to become independent.  We do not have any territorial interests, but we only want to  protect the interests of the Serbs who live there. However, the  Serbs, for example, in the Krajina, can only decide on their  future alone. All the problems there can only be solved in  direct negotiations between Zagreb and Knin. We will accept  what is decided there.    [Vujovic] Does Belgrade have an influence on the Serbs in  the Krajina?    [Jovanovic] Of course, we have a certain influence on the  Serbs outside the FRY, but one must not underestimate this  influence.    [Vujovic] The question of the prisoners of war is certainly  one of the most important humanitarian questions at the moment.  What is the present situation?    [Jovanovic] We started to solve this problem as early as a  year and a half ago. At that time, we signed a document that  all prisoners are to be exchanged. However, as we ascertained  later, the Croatian side did not release all its prisoners of  war or, more precisely, not all were on the list. Therefore,  these talks will be repeated.    There are currently no Croatian prisoners of war on our  side.  On the other hand, however, we have a list of about 1,000  people, most of them missing persons from the former Yugoslav  People's Army. The Croatian side is prepared to examine this  list once again, to ascertain finally whether these people are  still alive. A commission of the two states is to investigate  this. We are also offering our help to rule out the possibility  that someone was forgotten or incorrectly registered by us.    [Vujovic] An issue that arises again and again is the  question of property rights....    [Jovanovic] In the Geneva conference there is a commission  that is responsible for the legal succession of the former  Yugoslavia. While the individual seceded republics advocate the  thesis that all the republics of the former Yugoslavia and the  FRY are together the legal successors of the SFRY, we take  another view. The FRY did not secede from the former Yugoslavia.  Therefore, we are not a legal successor, but the state with the  basic right. The second problem is FRY citizens' private  property that is in today's Croatia and Slovenia. There are  numerous houses, apartments, and summer houses with all their  furniture and equipment, which were confiscated or even  destroyed by the Croats. Our citizens must be able to enforce  the right to this property, which belongs to them.    [Vujovic] The interrupted relations resulted in many  problems in the life of the Serbs in Zagreb, Istria, Dalmacija,  as well as in the life of the Croats in Serbia....    [Jovanovic] I must stress that far more Serbs lived in  Croatia until Croatia's declaration of independence. Many of  these Serbs had to leave Croatia, and were often threatened.  According to our estimates, only 100,000 Serbs are living in  Croatia today, while up to 300,000 Serbs experienced "ethnic  cleansing." Most of these expelled Serbs are living as refugees  in the FRY, which is particularly difficult for us because of  the UN sanctions. All who want to return must be able to do so.  They should also have the right to their apartments and all  their other rights.    [Vujovic] Because of the participation of Croatian troops  and soldiers in the Bosnian war, UN sanctions against Croatia  were also demanded. What do you say to that?    [Jovanovic] No, no new UN sanctions should be introduced,  but the existing ones should be lifted. For the embargo against  us, which has been in force for two years, has shown one thing:  Such a thing does not serve peace, but it only aggravates the  situation.    [Vujovic] Can the visit of a higher-ranking Croatian  politician be expected in Belgrade soon, for example, a visit by  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to Belgrade or by Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic to Zagreb?    [Jovanovic] There had already been high-level contacts  before this normalization. So far, President Milosevic and  President Tudjman have had several meetings within the framework  of the Geneva peace negotiations. We expect Croatian Deputy  Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mate Granic to visit  Belgrade soon. It is only a question of when a meeting will be  held on an even higher level in Belgrade or Zagreb.</p>

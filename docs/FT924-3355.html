			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (1): Ever more complex - The industry hopes that the many studies and investigations currently being undertaken by regulators are part of a drive to deepen their understanding of the market, rather than a prelude to tighter regulatory controls IN THE past 10 years, the most creative engineering in the world of international finance has been concentrated in the huge and rapidly growing market for derivative products. Futures, options, swaps and related instruments today make up an estimated Dollars 10,000bn in investments traded both over-the-counter (OTC) and on regulated exchanges. Many exchange-traded futures and options contracts are now more liquid than the cash markets on which they are based. Innovative OTC derivative products sold directly by banks and securities houses to companies or fund managers, meanwhile, are rapidly being subsumed into the mainstream. This has fuelled the development of ever more complex variations as intermediaries, searching for higher spreads in an increasingly competitive environment, no longer offer just straightforward options but a seemingly endless variety of twists, such as caps and range-forwards, which slightly alter the degree of exposure to different market movements. The technology used in the derivatives market is often applied throughout a range of underlying products. Swap technology, allowing counterparties to exchange interest-rate and currency flows, is now being applied to the equity, commodity, and insurance markets. Although the exchange-traded business is more mature than the OTC business, the two halves of the derivatives market are interdependent. Banks which sell OTC products use exchange-traded markets to offset the risk they take on when writing options or swap agreements; so without the development of efficient and active futures trading, the massive growth in over-the-counter derivatives would have stalled. The OTC market's growth could not have happened, either, without the information technology revolution. The advent of the desktop personal computer has allowed investment bankers to construct complex products and transactions that could never have been designed, priced or monitored under the old system of writing trades into book ledgers. The technological changes came at a time - the early and mid-1980s - when banks and securities houses were looking to diversify. Tougher capital requirements for banks, imposed by international regulators, forced them to turn from their traditional lending business, where margins had been squeezed, while securities firms were looking for ways to move away from their reliance on their broking and underwriting businesses. The pool of derivatives users has grown rapidly. While only the biggest multinationals were involved with derivatives in the early days, now smaller corporations, pension funds, insurance companies, money managers and small to mid-sized banks are all jumping on the bandwagon. They have become familiar with the concept of using derivatives to hedge risk, balance portfolios and participate in new markets that might normally be outside their reach. Yet the dynamic growth of the OTC derivatives market - the International Swap Dealers Association (Isda) says it now totals Dollars 4,300bn in outstanding contracts (compared with Dollars 866bn just five years ago) - has created new types of risk and exposure for financial institutions. Bank and securities industry regulators find themselves in the rather uncomfortable position of supervising a business they do not always fully understand, and assessing asset-like instruments that do not show up on participants' balance sheets. There are also substantial variations in the way intermediaries handle risk, from the most sophisticated players using complex computer models, to some of the less sophisticated, newer participants, who may limit their use to more straightforward transactions, so that risk is more easily managed. There is also a fear among regulators that techniques applied to a broad variety of underlying markets ties markets more closely together, increasing the potential for shock in one part of the global financial system to be quickly transmitted to other parts. Mr Malcolm Basing, chairman of Isda, however, thinks those fears are overdone. He says: 'I'm at a loss to understand why people think that. If anything, markets are now more open between countries, which reduces risk.' The authorities are taking an especially close look at the practice of netting, a risk-reduction method whereby the payment flows involved in a large number of derivatives contracts between regular counterparties are 'netted out' to produce one single measure of credit exposure. Although netting is legally recognised in the US, with Isda providing an all-purpose master document for counterparty contracts, elsewhere the legal status of netting remains uncertain. This frustrates the market's biggest players, who believe that netting not only reduces counterparty credit risk but also frees up funds for expansion, because it lowers the amount of capital that banks and securities houses have to set aside under international capital adequacy rules. The industry hopes that the many studies and investigations into the business currently being undertaken by regulators are part of a drive to deepen their understanding of the market, and not a prelude to tighter regulatory controls on intermediaries and users of derivatives. One of the main problems with the derivatives market is in coming to terms with its size and the level of risk involved in transactions. The trillion-dollar figure that catches the interest of regulators and politicians covers the notional amount of derivatives contracts outstanding, and is useful only as a guide to business activity and the growth of the market. Bankers say that derivatives risk is best measured by calculating net replacement value - the cost of replacing netted contracts if a counterparty defaults. When measured by net replacement value, banks' exposure to derivatives risk drops dramatically to levels below comparable exposures to traditional lending activities. The ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's has calculated that the net replacement value of the Dollars 3,400bn of total outstanding swap contracts is slightly more than Dollars 90bn, or just 2.6 per cent. The problem with net replacement value accounting, however, is that derivatives are dynamic - the risk profile of each transaction changes constantly as markets and prices move. Intermediaries mark their books to market at the end of each day, but those snapshots of dealers' positions can be redundant within minutes. It is the fluid nature of the business that worries regulators, who fear intermediaries' risk measurement and risk management systems and procedures cannot keep tabs on the constantly shifting sands of derivatives. The more mature exchange-traded markets, meanwhile, also continue to expand. Although the big US exchanges in Chicago have seen their market share dwindle, because of competition from other exchanges and from the OTC market, growing numbers of western European countries now have their own futures exchanges, and new markets are being set up in developing countries, such as Latin America. Increasingly sophisticated information technology may cause a gradual shift away from the traditional trading of futures in trading pits. Last June, Globex, the round-the-clock futures trading system developed by the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuter, was launched after five years in development, at an estimated cost of Dollars 80m. So far, the Matif in Paris is the only European exchange to have signed up, but others, including the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, are in advanced discussions. Mr Leo Melamed, head of Globex, hailed the debut as 'the dawn of a new era'. Even if it does not fulfil expectations, Globex has sparked a reassessment of the future of exchanges by reviving ambitions to form links between exchanges, and for cross-listing of products. Whether it be new products such as insurance and pollution derivatives, or new trading systems like Globex, one of the chief characteristics of the exchange and OTC derivatives business is innovation. With large pools of users among companies and investment managers still to be tapped, and sizeable profits to be earned, the pace of growth is unlikely to slow significantly over the next few years.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- DERIVATIVES EXPOSURE (DOLLARS BN) The top eight US commercial banks  ----------------------------------------------------------------                          Total                       notional         Total                       value of   replacement                      contracts      value of                     originated     contracts  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Citicorp                 1,426          23.5 Chemical Banking         1,296          19.4 JP Morgan              1,014          20.0 Bankers Trust              958          21.6 Chase Manhattan            837          16.7 Bank America               795          18.4 First Chicago              387           7.2 Continental Banking        136           2.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Figures refer to exposure and contracts as of June 30,1992 Source: Standard &amp; Poor's  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Three persons -- Chief Segun Osoba, Mr. Jonah David  Jang, and retired Air Commodore Dan Suleiman -- yesterday  appeared before the Federal High Court [FHC] in Lagos on charges  of treason. The chief judge of the FHC, Mr. Justice Mohamed  Belgore, who was presiding over the case, directed that the men,  who are on bail should not be rearrested.    The defense had complained that the accused persons were  being harassed by the police and security agents. Mr. Justice  Belgore ruled that the police or security agents should not  interrogate, visit, or invite any of the three accused persons  without specific order from the court, pending the determination  of the case. He also directed that the bail of the accused  persons should continue under the present condition till  tomorrow when hearing of the case would continue.    Also, yesterday, Mr. Justice Belgore granted bail to a  Lagos-  based medical practitioner, Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti, standing  trial for treasonable felony. Dr. Ransome-Kuti was however  asked to sign an undertaking not to commit the same offense he  was charged with in the [words indistinct] bail. He was banned  from addressing any gathering, issuing press statements, or  participating in any public gathering, and he must remain within  his locality. In addition, he will produce two sureties and pay  a sum of 10,000 naira which would be forfeited in the event of  nonfulfillment of the conditions. Mr. Justice Belgore stressed  that any breach of the conditions would invalidate the bail.</p>

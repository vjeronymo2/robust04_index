			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING;  </P> <P> LOTS OF BIG BONITO HITTING THE HOOKS AT ROCKY POINT AND CATALINA ISLAND  </P> <P> Big bonito have invaded sectors of Rocky Point and Catalina Island. If the  surface water conditions remain steady, anglers can look forward to a wide-open  bite of the fighting boneheads.  </P> <P> Boats fishing Rocky Point have scored with the fighting fish going from six to  eight pounds.  </P> <P> Mickey Halderman of Long Beach, fishing on the Victory, caught a 12 1/2-pounder  on 10-pound test line.  </P> <P> At Catalina, boats report the explosive run has been going on for a week, with  plenty of yellowtail showing but refusing both bait and jigs.  </P> <P> The Venice Anglers third annual shark derby was held last weekend with 300  anglers participating.  </P> <P> The three top catches were made at the Redondo Canyon area. Duane McCutchin of  Redondo Beach caught a 134-pound mako from his boat the Full Force. It was  worth $2,500.  </P> <P> Don Snyder of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard his boat the Sea Wolf, caught a  122-pound mako that awarded him a week's fishing at Cabo San Lucas. Jason Tress  was also aboard the Full Force and his 109-pound catch awarded the Redondo  Beach angler complete tackle.  </P> <P> Another shark derby will be held Saturday and Sunday, sponsored by Southern  California Enterprises. This Marina del Rey derby raises funds for the Muscular  Dystrophy Assn.  </P> <P> Fishing will be from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. both days. Morning roll call will be at  Frenchy's sportfishing landing at 6. The Union 76 fuel dock at Bora Bora Way  will be the weigh-in station. Four anglers will be allowed per boat with  registration at $200. For information, call (619) 723-7470.  </P> <P> Vera Sampson of Harbor City, fishing aboard the American Angler at Benitos  Island off Mexico, had to work for her catch.  </P> <P> Using a live mackerel, she made a cast toward yellowtail that were chasing  bait. A yellow hit and headed to the rocks. Turning, the fish peeled all of her  25-pound test Izor line. Once around the deck she stopped it down.  </P> <P> After 32 minutes the yellow surfaced and again Sampson had to reel quickly as  seals were charging her fish. A deckhand with gaff ready beat the seals to a  meal.  </P> <P> Sampson won the jackpot when her catch weighed in at 46 1/2 pounds.  </P> <P> Nick Thompson is only 6 years old but this San Pedro boy showed the veterans  how it is done aboard the Matt Walsh Monday morning. While the anglers were  catching bass, Thompson hooked and landed two big barracuda. The fish weighed  seven and eight pounds each. Nick said he is going to save his money and enter  the jackpot the next time he goes fishing.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches:  </P> <P> Kevin McFindgar of Long Beach caught the whopper of the week when he pulled a  26 1/2-pound yellowtail out of the kelp.  </P> <P> Scott Fujinami of San Pedro, on a two-day trip aboard the Outerlimits, won the  jackpot with his 24-pound yellowtail caught at Catalina Island.  </P> <P> Walter Mechan of Long Beach won the jackpot aboard the Toronado with a 22-pound  yellowtail.  </P> <P> Harvey Baron of West Los Angeles captured the jackpot on the Spitfire with his  16-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Linda Beggs of Harbor City, fishing aboard the Annie B barge with 12-pound test  line, bounced to the deck a 14 1/2-pound halibut.  </P> <P> Fish Reports:  </P> <P> At Marina Del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire anglers hooked 251 sand bass, 10  bonito, six barracuda and four halibut.  </P> <P> The Happyman on two half-day trips chalked up 435 sand bass, 65 bonito and five  halibut.  </P> <P> The Betty O rock cod special returned with 375 rock cod and three cow cod.  </P> <P> At Redondo Sportfishing: The Sea Spray fished Rocky Point and found a wide-open  bonito bite with 135 going into the sacks, plus 25 sand bass.  </P> <P> The Redondo Special on a half-day trip to Rocky Point had a count of 85 sand  bass, 83 bonito and 11 barracuda.  </P> <P> The City of Redondo anglers hooked 95 bonito and two barracuda.  </P> <P> The Blackjack headed to Catalina and anglers sacked 212 bonito, 55 barracuda  and 37 calico bass.

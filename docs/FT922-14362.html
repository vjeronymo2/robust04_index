			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK steel town's revival inspires E Germans: East and west are starting to co-operate on urban regeneration EAST Germany's plums have gone. West German companies have piled in and bought the healthiest industrial plants or set up new operations to capture local markets. Now foreigners are being targeted in a hard sell of the rest. On the margins of big cities such as Berlin and Leipzig lie regions in desperate need of development if east German living standards are to be hauled up to those of the west. Some 300 UK companies and financial institutions have been invited to a seminar in London today to promote one of those regions, centred on the industrial city of Schwedt and the medieval market town of Angermunde, 50 miles north-east of Berlin. The groundwork for this promotion is a case study in how east and west can co-operate in planning the revival of a downtrodden regional economy, partly inspired by the experience of the Northamptonshire steel town of Corby. Marketing a remote corner of east Germany close to the bleak Polish border is an uphill struggle, especially when potential investors are suffering their own recession. But Schwedt has little choice. It is threatened by a haemorrhage of skilled workers to the west. The PCK oil refinery, focal point of the town of 52,000, once provided 10,000 jobs. By the end of next year only 2,600 jobs will remain, as capacity at the now privatised refinery is slashed and wage and productivity levels are raised to those of west Germany. The authorities in Schwedt, together with Angermunde, turned to the west for help. They hired Mowlem Europe, a division of John Mowlem Construction of the UK, which opened an office in Berlin in July 1990 and bought Bau-Tec, a German construction company, last November. Mowlem, in a joint venture with Conran Roche, UK planning consultants, began work on a development programme a year ago. The contract, worth about DM500,000 (Pounds 175,400), was funded from EC grants to Bonn for the regeneration of east Germany, which reached the region via the Brandenburg state authorities. Mr Jim Barrack, business development director of Mowlem Europe, emphasises the co-operation aspect. 'We didn't want to go in saying 'We know everything, let us get on with it.' We wanted them to be a part of it because at the end of the day they have to carry their economy into the new free market.' The region was evaluated, the data analysed, and 75 potential projects covering industry, services, agriculture and infrastructure were drawn up, requiring an estimated DM70m-DM80m in private sector investment alone. A dozen priority projects were then highlighted as those 'most likely to be attractive to the outside world and give benefit to the region.' The seminar will emphasise the region's strengths: its equidistance from Berlin and the Polish Baltic port of Szczecin; its location on the river Oder; its lakes and forests, suitable for leisure and tourism; its natural resources of timber and sand; its workforce which, though inexperienced in western managerial and commercial techniques, is skilled and willing. Most appealing, perhaps, is the hope that it will one day be situated on a vast east-west trading corridor, and benefit as a commercial hub when the first countries of eastern Europe join the EC. Back to today, the reality is one of inadequate roads, a run-down telephone system, and scarce hotel accommodation. So the investments being sought range from publicly-funded infrastructure projects - such as a new river harbour for Schwedt and a feeder road from the A11 north-south motorway - to private sector ventures such as a food processing plant. Other regions will be as eager, or desperate, to sell themselves, as Mr Barrack acknowledges. 'Achieving investment has become highly competitive. One can't expect to set out a scenario and wait for people to come and knock on the door.' That is why creation of an Economic Development Agency is a top priority. It would direct investments and provide advice, sites, start-up finance, job creation and links with other countries. During the study, the Germans were taken to Corby, which was revived as an enterprise zone after its main employer, the steel mill, closed in 1980 with huge job losses. It happens that Corby mirrors Schwedt's population of 52,000, and its steelworks also once employed more than 10,000. 'Corby gave them a very bullish presentation about how they tackled the problems and got new business in, and they found that very encouraging,' says Mr Barrack.</p>

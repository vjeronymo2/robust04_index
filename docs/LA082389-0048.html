			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The President's Advisory Commission on Federal Pay said that the pay gap  between the federal government and the private sector has grown to 28.6%, the  Washington Post reported. The cost of implementing a pay increase of that  magnitude would be $35 billion in the first year, according to the Office of  Personnel Management. Congress has agreed on a 3.6% annual increase next  January, and the White House is expected to go along. The annual report is  supposed to trigger an automatic increase to bring federal employees up to  "comparability" with private workers. However, federal workers have not  received full comparability increases since 1977.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Shutang (1728 0647 1016)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 10 Jun (XINHUA) -- The Supreme People's  Court today held a telephone conference to sum up achievements  attained during an earlier period in cracking down on economic  crimes and to make arrangements for further promoting the work  of hearing and adjudication major and serious cases of economic  crime by various people's courts so as to continue successfully  the anticorruption struggle.    Zhu Mingshan, vice president of the Supreme People's Court,  presided over today's meeting. Liu Jiachen, vice president of  the Supreme People's Court, spoke at the conference. He pointed  out: People's courts throughout the country have centered their  efforts on trying and adjudicating major and serious cases of  economic crime in the struggle against corruption, and the  overall situation is satisfactory. People's courts at various  levels have followed the guidelines of the party Central  Committee and the work arrangements of the Supreme People's  Court, have concentrated their efforts on quickly trying and  adjudicating a large number of major and serious cases of  economic crime, have heavily punished serious law offenders in  accordance with the law, and have attained significant results  in promoting and deepening the anticorruption struggle.    According to a statistical report, the cases of economic  crimes heard and adjudicated by people's courts in 1993 involved  152 cadres at and above the department level, including eight  cadres at the bureau level and one cadre at the vice minister  level.    Liu Jiachen pointed out: We should soberly understand that  the results achieved so far still cannot meet the demands of the  party and the people and the requirements in the current  anticorruption struggle. There are still some problems in the  trials of major and serious economic cases which must not be  overlooked. He said: In the next phase, people's courts  throughout the country will have a heavier task in hearing and  adjudicating major and serious cases of economic crime.  Therefore, leading cadres of people's courts at various levels  must personally take charge of the work and have the courage to  resist all interference and obstacles in the trials of various  cases. We must adhere to principles, rely on the party's  leadership, and ensure the proper trial of various cases. We  should handle various cases in a prompt manner with high quality  and efficiency. We should establish a sound working system and  guarantee the smooth flow of information. We should strengthen  propaganda and increase the results in handing cases.    At the telephone conference, Liu Jiachen also explained the  specific arrangements made by the Supreme People's Court for the  trial of major and serious cases of economic crime in the next  phase. He said: The Supreme People's Court, based on its  understanding of major and serious cases of economic crime being  handled at present, will promptly announce the results of trying  those cases throughout the country in the next few months.</p>

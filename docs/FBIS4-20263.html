			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ken Pottinger report: "Poverty Is Thorn on `Rose' of </F> Portuguese Democracy"]    [Text] Lisbon -- Twenty years after the April Revolution  set Portugal on the road to democracy, the peasants of the  Alentejo find their lot little changed. While modern  technologies have helped revolutionise the manufacturing sector,  agricultural penury persists. Tia Maria Silva, a 63-year-old  fruit picker in Lagamecas, edging the Alentejo, earns 2 pounds  an hour. She lives in one of the pockets of poverty and  underdevelopment described last week by President Mario Soares  as "thorns on the rose of Portuguese democracy".    But the country has also entered the modern era: it has one  of the highest rates of digital phone use in Europe; there are  projected new multi-media data highways, and plans for science  and technology parks and industry-oriented research centres.    The Auto-Europa plant, a Joint Ford-Volkswagen venture, is  evidence of Portugal's growing competitive edge since it entered  the EC in 1986. The project is credited with helping push the  country's manufacturing infrastructure into the next century.    The first generation of children born in the democratic era,  dubbed the "blue jeans and ecology set", are also coming of age.    Raised in a multi-party system that tolerates free speech,  their values are different to those of their parents, who lived  under the fascists and were taught to respect church and  authority.    But the new generation has its problems, mostly caused by  the  generally low standard of the universal and formerly free  education.    Schooling is a national Achilles heel, there were 16  governments between 1974 and 1987, each with its own education  programme.    The young are locked in a battle for jobs and security and  face a tide of hard drug and alcohol abuse. Racism, against  black immigrants is growing.    Senhor Eduardo Almeida Catroga, the Finance Minister,  recently warned that manufacturing competitiveness was being  compromised by poorly-trained managers, while "generally low  national levels of schooling" were hurting the modernisation  drive.    His concerns are shared by parents and students, whose  regular protests have rattled the government over the past two  years.    There was relief in Europe when the present ruling Social  Democrats won the first of two straight parliamentary majorities  and secured political stability.    The revolution restored democracy, opening the door to EC  membership, and Senhor Soares, then foreign minister and  Socialist Party leader, never tired of saying: "The EC is  Portuguese democracy's life insurance policy."    If one figure towers over the rest it is Senhor Soares.  Polls published this week show 54 per cent of those questioned  regard him as having the most significant influence on public  life since 1974. His efforts laid the groundwork for the modern  Portugal, and many citizens are clearly grateful.</p>

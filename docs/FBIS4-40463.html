			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Burbyga incorporating interview with </F> Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of Russian Armed  Forces General Staff; place and date not given: "So Just How  Big Is Russia's Military?"]    [Text] According to Defense Ministry data appearing in the  press, the Russian Army now has 2 million men. On 15 June,  however, during a meeting with the leaders of Amur Oblast,  President B. Yeltsin gave a different figure. Speaking about  the reform of the Army, he declared that its strategic goal is a  reduction from 3 million to 1.5 million men.    So just how many men are serving in the Russian Army, and  what is its authorized strength? In order to answer these  questions, we turned to the Ministry of Defense for an  explanation.    It turned out that the ministry itself had not prepared or  passed to the president any data on the size of the Armed Forces  during these days. In the opinion of the military, the  discrepancy in the figures which the president has now given and  which the Defense Ministry has announced at various times arose  because account is not always taken, when talking of the Army's  quantitative composition, of the fact that numerical strength is  subdivided into authorized strength (the number of posts  provided for by the prescribed strength level) and actual  strength (the number of servicemen actually fulfilling duties).  At the same time the authorized and actual strengths change  constantly. For example, as of 1 May 1992 the prescribed  strength level stood at 2.8 million servicemen, and the roster  at just over 2 million. The difference between the prescribed  strength level and the actual strength constituted the degree of  undermanning.    In the opinion of Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief  of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff, when speaking in Amur  Oblast the president might have had in mind all those who wear  military uniform in Russia. But these are servicemen not only  of the Defense Ministry but also of other ministries and  departments.    "In particular," M. Kolesnikov continued, "there are the  border troops, who number 50,000 men, the internal troops with  350,000 men, and the railroad troops with 70,000. The Ministry  of Communications, the Dalstroy [expansion unknown], and the  Moscow Special Construction Trust have their own military  subunits. In all, approximately 800,000 men in addition to the  Defense Ministry. If you add this number to our composition,  you will get a total of almost 3 million."    [Burbyga] What is the specific strength of the Armed Forces  as of 16 June?    [Kolesnikov] We have reduced them by 700,000 in the course  of two years. The authorized strength today is 2.002 million  men. But the actual strength is considerably less.    [Burbyga] How many of them are generals? The largest number  in the world, so the newspapers write?    [Kolesnikov] I would not dramatize this question. Speaking  of the world, we hold the "golden" mean, as it were. For  comparison: We have twice as many generals per serviceman as  the United States and China, but half the number of Britain and  France. We have provided for a significant reduction in  generals' posts. Whereas there were 4,343 of them in 1989,  2,070 are now left. A reduction to 1,780 is envisaged in the  long term.    [Burbyga] The Army is frequently rebuked for reforming  itself only slowly. Can the Armed Forces be reduced more  quickly?    [Kolesnikov] Reform is primarily the business and concern of  the state and the executive, not of the Army itself. We can  take the role of experts and executors. For some reason the  reform has been entrusted to us today. But all the executive's  attention to the reforms is limited to the following demand:  Carry out reduction more quickly.... But the Army needs  considerable funds to carry out the reform, and we do not have  them. It is a paradox, but it is more advantageous to us to  transfer an officer to the reserve than to discharge him. This  is because, before discharging an officer, it is necessary to  pay him a posting allowance, to provide him with housing....  Otherwise there could be a sharp increase in social tension in  society.    [Burbyga] It was reported recently that 25-30 people in the  Army die every day for one reason or another. Is this so?    [Kolesnikov] There are people who have made themselves a  career out of speculating with such figures. But the reality is  that an average of three or four people die in the Army every  day for various reasons. There are road transport accidents,  injuries, suicides.... In 1992 1,746 servicemen died, in 1993  1,359, and this year 417. We deeply regret every loss and death  and endeavor to take all measures to avoid tragedies.    [Burbyga] A final question: How is your relationship with  Army General Pavel Grachev, minister of defense? There are many  contradictory rumors about this.    [Kolesnikov] I will say bluntly that I cannot count myself  among the minister's personal friends. But we have a good  working relationship. The first report to the minister every  day is mine. I give him personally the most important documents.  He signs the overwhelming majority of them. This attests to  his trust both in me and in the General Staff.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MONTANANS GET UNUSUAL SIGHT -- THEY SEE THEIR AIR  </P> <P> The smog over western Montana valleys today was so unusual that the National  Weather Service put out a special advisory explaining to puzzled Montanans what  the crud was.  </P> <P> Visibility in Helena was only six miles this morning, virtually opaque by  Montana standards. Tuesday afternoon, the visibility was 40 miles.  </P> <P> The weather service explained that the dirty air was "a weather phenomenon  usually seen in the industrial Eastern United States."  </P> <P> "Generally speaking, high humidity, high pressure at the surface and a high  concentration of industrial pollutants combine in the populated Eastern United  States to produce a milky dirty sky during the day along with reduced  visibilities," the weather service said in an advisory that goes to radio  stations and newspapers.  </P></p>

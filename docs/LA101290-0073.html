			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LICENSE ACTION TARGETS BIGGEST BINGO PARLOR  </P> <P> Proceedings began Thursday to revoke the license of the largest-grossing bingo  parlor in Los Angeles, with city officials releasing affidavits by four  ex-workers of the Woodland Hills operation alleging they were illegally paid up  to $300 a night from skimmed cash.  </P> <P> At stake in an administrative hearing is the bingo license of Identity Inc., a  charity headed by Edith Ryan.  </P> <P> Identity has grossed $28.7 million in bingo proceeds since 1982, almost 20% of  the bingo take citywide.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, it was revealed that the state attorney general's office has  launched a separate civil probe of Identity to determine if the organization's  officers misused charitable funds. The Los Angeles Police Department also is  investigating possible criminal misdemeanor violations.  </P> <P> It is illegal under state law for people to receive a "profit, wage or salary"  from the proceeds of a bingo game, all of which, after expenses, are required  to go to charity.  </P></p>

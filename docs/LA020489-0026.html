			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGGING A DITCH AT THE BORDER  </P> <P> The silly season has just begun: The report from Washington officials to build  a four-mile ditch at the border as a solution to the illegal immigration and  drug trafficking problems ("U.S. Plans to Dig 4-Mile Ditch at Mexican Border,"  Part I, Jan. 25).  </P> <P> A four-mile ditch here, a four-mile ditch there. Where will it end? Let us be  realistic! Why not build a great wall around the United States! I say, put that  ditch in Washington, D.C. There are more drugs and money laundering in  Washington than in any other part of the country. Of course, those people there  are more honest and the business of drugs is more legitimate.  </P> <P> Building that ditch is like putting obstacles to thwart the red "sockeye"  salmon from reaching their spawning grounds. Or, like using a net to trap all  those King Monarch butterflies from coming to the California forest for the  summer.  </P> <P> PAUL T. CORRAL  </P> <P> Salinas  </P></p>

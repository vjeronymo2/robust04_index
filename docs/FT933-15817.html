			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Arts: The Man Who Strides the Wind - Opera Before his death in 1989 Bruce Chatwin had conceived the scheme of an opera, a collaboration with the composer Kevin Volans. The project was to draw on ideas from Chatwin's wonderful novel The Songlines, extending its meditations on the nomadic nature of man, and the focus was to be the life of Arthur Rimbaud, particularly the years he spent wandering around Africa, having abandoned his poetic career. Chatwin became too ill to complete any of the libretto, and the text for The Man Who Strides the Wind, which received its first performance at the Almeida last weekend, has been assembled by the writer Roger Clarke from sources that include Rimbaud's own poetry, Chatwin's travel notebooks and the classical texts - Hesiod, the Bible - closest to Chatwin's heart. Of the rash of operas that have been promised in recent years, this work-in-progress was perhaps the most intriguing and tantalising. Volans' instrumental and orchestral works have established him as one of the most distinctive voices in contemporary music, and the subject matter seemed perfectly suited to a composer who had derived so much flavour from his South African background. What has reached the stage, though, is a profound disappointment in musical and dramatic terms. The reasons for that failure are tangled and hard to establish: the negligible production by Peter Mumford (designs by Neil Irish) is certainly no help, and often clumsy in its effects, while Volans' score is realised tentatively under David Parry's direction. But both producer and conductor can claim some mitigation; there is something intrinsically unoperatic about a work whose first act revolves about a death-bed scene, the second is a sustained duet for tenor and baritone, and only a small fraction of the text is comprehensible. The weight of the intellectual argument in The Man Who Strides the Wind falls in that long (70-minute) second act, as Rimbaud and his servant/companion Djami wander through the Abyssinian desert while the former poet tries to come to terms with his restlessness, his inability to feel at home in any landscape. The first act sets up the discourse as the dying Rimbaud, returned home after 12 years' wandering, is tended by his sister and fearsome mother who know nothing of his former life. But the lack of drama and the lapidary text resist easy involvement; the opera always manages to hold its audience at arm's length. Most disappointing of all was the effect of the music itself. The vocal score promised a wonderfully subtle, teeming texture, full of the teasing polyrhythms and glistening, slender textures which Volans has made his own. In the claustrophobic Almeida acoustic, though, many of those effects were made to seem miscalculated and the instrumental playing (the combined forces of the Brindisi Quartet and the Almeida Ensemble, fine players all of them) lacked the precision and delicacy Volans' music always demands. Moments one looked forward to were totally lost - the very opening of the work, for instance, with a boy treble intoning fragments of Riombaud's verse as a backdrop to the utterance of the dying poet, emerged totally indistinct. While Volans' score contains much that might thrive in a different context, this is not a show from which the ENO's Contemporary Opera Studio can take any credit. Only the singers could be satisfied with their contributions: Thomas Randle made a fine, compelling Rimbaud, Meurig Davies a compassionate, boyish Djami; Susan Bisatt was the attentive sister Isabelle, Jennifer Rhys-Davies, the gorgon-like mother. David Newman provided the shimmer of treble in act one. Almeida Theatre; further performances July 9, 12 and 16</p>

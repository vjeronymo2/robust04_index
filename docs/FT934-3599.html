			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Observer: Blyth spirit The British Foreign Office may be trying to reduce staff numbers, but some diplomats have obviously got the message already. Take Ian Kydd, the 46-year-old head of the FO newsroom, who hopes not to be responding to media enquiries for almost a year if he gets selected to sail round the world on Chay Blyth's Ocean Challenge 1996-97. Kydd beat more than 2,600 applicants, only to be treated, during the final this weekend, to a chilly aquatic assault course in deepest Oxfordshire. If he makes it as one of the two lucky (?) crew members part-funded by The Times, he will at least know someone in every port, he says. With some experience of sailing Laser dinghies in Lagos harbour in his last posting but one, he is also a bit better-placed than some who sign up for Blyth's little outing without a clew. Observer wishes him luck in giving those media sharks the slip.</p>

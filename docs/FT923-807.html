			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Arts: After Columbus - Radio COLUMBUS's Atlantic crossing is being treated politically, romantically and imaginatively, but nowhere quite so inimically as in the World Service's six-week series, The Invaders' Legacy. Presenters Ruth Hogarth and Phil Gunson have visited six South American nations, and hated all of them. This week they told about the Cerro Rico, the 'rich hill', at Potosi in Bolivia. It is said you could build a bridge from Potosi to Spain with the silver mined from Cerro Rico. It is also said you could build the bridge with the bones of the peasants that died there, and indeed they still work a week of six 12-hour days. Modern open-cast techniques could improve things, but they are excluded, for the hill shelters Potosi from the cold North winds. The Bolivian government says that colonialism is ended, but legislation favours the middle-classes, never the peasants. Tomorrow's programme deals with Colombia, a nation of drug-dealers, left-wing guerrillas and opposing paramilitaries. The President's new constitution aims at halting the violence, even at helping the peasants, of whom 25 per cent live below the poverty line. Half-hour visits to troubled nations can be interesting even if inadequate. We have had the Dominican Republic, Guatemala and Mexico, and next week will end with Peru. At least it was Pizarro, not Columbus, that overthrew Atahualpa and the Incas. The Radio Times will help you find the World Service in the current issue, a service it offers only once a month. A happier anniversary is Alfred Tennyson's, who died in 1892, and is generously remembered by Radio 3. On Monday there was a recorded introductory talk by the late Sir John Betjeman, and some splendid readings. Dame Peggy Ashcroft gave us the whole of The Lady of Shalott, and In Memoriam was shared between C. Day Lewis, Robert Donat and Sir John Gielgud. It is the fashion in some quarters to belittle Tennyson; but spoken so beautifully, many lines displayed a golden touch. Radio 3's Sunday Play was Eduardo da Filippo's Napoli Milionaria, a sentimental look at wartime Naples, revised into Northern English by Peter Tinniswood for the RNT. Richard Eyre's stage production was directed for the radio by Jeremy Howe. Sir Ian McKellen was the contented Gennaro, who mid-war left his family for a while and returned to find his elder daughter pregnant by an American, his younger daughter fatally ill, his son a thief, his wife unfaithful. He did well under his disguise, Francis Barber too as his wife Amalia. The radio script by Chris Barton was long and repetitious. The most enjoyable item this week was an interval talk in last Saturday's Radio 3 relay of Verdi's Force of Destiny. It was about St. Petersburg and Italy, and its special charm came not only from the close knowledge of the city's growth under the Tsars, but to the outstandingly pleasant delivery of the presenter, Svetlana Lloyd - a former Dior model born in Kiev, brought up in St. Petersburg, and now possessor of the perfect English broadcasting voice. The talk glittered with the names of Italian architects, sculptors, ballerinas and so on, But Svetlana Lloyd may talk on any subject she chooses, and I shall try to listen.</p>

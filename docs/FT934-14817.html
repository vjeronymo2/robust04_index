			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Survey of International Standards (4): Meaningful explanations - Charles Batchelor interprets the jargon used in international standards Accreditation. Sometimes confused with certification but in fact a procedure for guaranteeing that the certification bodies themselves are up to scratch. There may be many competing certification bodies in a particular field but each country will normally have only one accreditation organisation. In the UK this is the National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies (3 Birdcage Walk, London SW1H 9JH. Tel 071 222 5374). The growing demand for standards around the world and the large numbers of certification bodies involved have prompted the spread of the idea of accreditation. CE Mark. This is probably best known to the public because it appears on the packaging for toys but it is applicable to a wide range of products covered by the 'new approach' directives. In some cases manufacturers may apply the CE mark simply by declaring that their product meets the required standards but other products require independent certification that the standard has been reached. Toys may be labelled on the basis of self-certification but in the UK at least, many large retailers insist on independent certification. CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation. CEN groups the national standards bodies of the 12 European Community member states and the six members of the European Free Trade Association. A further seven countries, mainly from eastern Europe, have affiliate status. CEN was established in 1961 but had little to do for its first 24 years because standards setting was dominated by the national organisations and ISO/IEC. But in 1985 the European Community instituted a new approach to standard setting because it needed standards to back up the directives it was starting to produce for its single market initiative. CEN attempts to avoid duplicating the work of other organisations, so where possible its standards are based on national or international ones. They carry the EN - Euro-norms - prefix. Address: Rue de Stassart 36, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium. Tel 322 519 6811. In common with ISO, CEN has no responsibility for the electrical industry. This is handled by CENELEC, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation, (rue de Stassart 35, B-1050 Brussels. Tel 322 519 6871) while telecommunications standards are dealt with by ETSI, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. Certification. The process of guaranteeing that a product or service conforms to the requirements of the relevant standard or technical specification. The product or company may then carry the 'tamp' of the certification body. For example, in the UK, this may involve the 'kitemark' of the British Standards Institution (2 Park Street, London W1A 2BS. Tel 071 629 9000). Third party certification - by an independent organisation - allows a supplier to demonstrate to his potential customers that he meets certain standards. European Organisation for Testing and Certification (EOTC). Set up in December 1992 following a two-year pilot to establish the mutual recognition by certification and testing organisations in Europe of each other's work. The EOTC also includes in its aims the influencing of European policy on technical trade barriers and on the development and harmonisation of standards. Its membership comprises the standards organisations from 16 countries and 12 pan-European standards, consumer and industry associations. It has established three committees to look at mutual recognition in the fields of information technology, electrical products and water supply. Address: Egmont House, rue d'Egmontstraat 15, B-1050 Brussels. Tel 322 502 4141. ISO, the International Organisation for Standardisation. Set up in 1947, the ISO is a federation of 92 member countries which appoint committees to establish international standards. More than 8,600 international standards, bearing the ISO prefix, have been created. Responsibility for heading each standards committee is allocated to a country with experience in that area, with the result that seven members carry out 90 per cent of the work. Germany leads with 24 per cent of standards, Britain with 23 per cent and France with 22 per cent. If ISO creates a standard it takes precedence over national and European standards. The only area where ISO is not active is in the electrical industry. Electrical standards are the responsibility of the International Electrotechnical Commission, set up in 1907. Address: 1, rue de Varembe, PO Box 56, CH- 1211, Geneve 20, Switzerland. Tel. 41 22 749 0111. New approach directives. These represent a more flexible method of achieving free trade within the European Community. They allow for directives which lay down the mandatory requirements for assessing the safety of products but which leave the detailed criteria to be set down in voluntary, harmonised standards. Before 1985 directives had, with one exception, included detailed annexes setting out the technical requirements for the product. Keeping the annexes up to date proved an unacceptable burden. The new approach directives were based on the model of the 1973 Low Voltage Directive which was more flexible. New approach directives have been issued in fields such as toy safety, electromagnetic compatibility, construction products, heart pacemakers and gas appliances. Products meeting the criteria laid down in these directives and their supporting standards may carry the CE mark. Quality. In a general sense, quality, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder but in a trade context supplier and customer need to be talking an agreed language. ISO9000, the international quality standard, is based on an organisation's ability consistently to deliver a product or service that satisfies its customers' requirements The commitment to 'consistency' has prompted criticism that a company could deliver a poor product but as long as it was consistently so it would still comply with the requirements of ISO9000. In practice, defenders of the standard argue, a company committed to the idea of quality would not wish to interpret it in this minimalist way.</p>

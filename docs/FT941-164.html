			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Fading power Britain's prototype fast-breeder reactor in Dounreay, which generates its last electricity today after 19 years of operation by the Atomic Energy Authority. The government decided in 1988 to stop funding fast-breeder reactor research. Decommissioning the plant will provide jobs for more than 1,000 people until the next century.</p>

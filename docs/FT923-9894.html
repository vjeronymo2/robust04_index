			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Pretoria warns of job losses as S Africa braces for strike SOUTH AFRICA faces widespread disruption this morning as a 48-hour general strike starts a week of protest intended to force an early transition to majority rule. Government and business leaders have warned that job losses are inevitable and billions of rands will be lost, undermining an economy now in its third year of recession. But both government and employers - a group of whom unsuccessfully attempted to avert the strike last month - have resorted to a generally low-key response, prepared to sit out a campaign which most of them believe will run out of steam after the first two days. The main fear on all sides is that the protest could lead to clashes between rival black parties, and confrontations between strikers and the security forces. Speaking at a meeting in the eastern Transvaal town of Driefontein yesterday, Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress president, said: 'All we want to do is to pressurise the government into accepting an interim government and democratic elections. 'If the government shows signs of good faith, the ANC would return to Codesa' - the negotiating forum where talks ended in deadlock last May. A less conciliatory note was struck by Mr Ronnie Kasrils, a member of the South African Communist party and one of the main organisers of the protest. The massacre in June of 42 residents of the township of Boipatong made people realise that President FW de Klerk 'has blood on his hands', he said. Strong opposition to the strike, and the three days of rallies and sit-ins that are to follow, has come from Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party. Inkatha supporters have said they will defy the strike, organised by the ANC and its Communist party and trade union allies. Also opposed to the strike is the radical Pan Africanist Congress - usually part of an uneasy alliance with the ANC - which last night complained that 'massive intimidation' was 'rampant'. As significant as the strike is the presence of a 10-member United Nations team of observers which arrived in the country yesterday. The team is more symbolic than practical, its members being spread out across the country. But it marks the first stage in the UN's involvement in efforts to end South Africa's political violence and break the deadlock in constitutional negotiations. Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy who completed a fact-finding visit on Friday, is expected to propose an expanded UN role when he reports back to the security council this week.

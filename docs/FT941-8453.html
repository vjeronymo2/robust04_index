			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / International Company News: Harwanne buys stake in Belgian mines group Compagnie Fonciere du Chateau d'Eue de Paris (Focep), a subsidiary of Harwanne, the Swiss financial group, is to acquire 64.7 per cent of Compagnie Royale Asturienne des Mines' the Belgian mining group, at BFr880 a share, which values Asturienne at BFr2.9bn. Most of the 55.92 per cent stake in Asturienne is being sold by Union Miniere, the Belgian metals and mining group, as part of its strategic plan to dispose of some non-strategic assets to fund investments in its core business. The rest of the Asturienne shares will come from UM's parent, Societe Generale de Belgique. Harwanne will fund the acquisition from its cash flow and intends to maintain Asturienne's Brussels market listing. Banque Degroof, Focep's adviser, 'will implement a procedure to maintain the price of the (Asturienne) shares for the benefit of other shareholders', the company promised. Focep said the acquisition was in line with its expansion of its minerals activities and that it was particularly keen to expand Asturienne's Cogebi division which has operations in Belgium and the US and claims to be a world leader in mica-based insulation products. Asturienne owns La Compagnie Miniere de Toussit which operates a lead-silver mine in Morocco. In 1992 this produced concentrate containing about 55,000 tonnes of lead and 1m troy ounces of silver. Asturienne's 1992 accounts showed a BFr14m (Dollars 388,888) net loss. Most of the loss was accounted for by another mine in Morocco, Societe Miniere du Djebel Aouam (SMA), which was subsequently closed. While giving no details until the accounts are finalised, UM said Cogebi 'generated a healthy profit in 1993'. Focep's minerals interests include Kaolins du Morbihan and Denain Anzin Mineraux which operate profitably in France and Portugal.</p>

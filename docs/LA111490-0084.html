			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL SAYS REGULATORS IGNORED BAILOUT ADVICE  </P> <P> Top federal regulators ignored early warnings that the savings and loan  industry cleanup could cost hundreds of billions of dollars, congressional  investigators said Tuesday.  </P> <P> A 1988 investigation by Dallas-based regulators warned that the bailout  eventually could cost hundreds of billions, while senior regulators in  Washington were estimating that it would cost just $15 billion.  </P> <P> The report, just made public, indicates that "much more was known by the top  regulators in Washington than was previously acknowledged about the extent of  the thrift problems," said Rep. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), chairman of a  congressional task force on urgent fiscal issues.  </P> <P> The report was available to top regulators two years ago, Schumer said. They  ignored it, he contended.  </P> <P> "It's as if an army general discovered a ticking nuclear bomb under his  compound, simply walked away and said, 'We'll worry about it later,' " Schumer  said.  </P> <P> "There is compelling evidence that at least one top regulator was deliberately  low-balling the estimate of the thrift bailout cost," he added.  </P> <P> Industry experts now say the cost of the thrift cleanup could reach $500  billion, including interest.  </P> <P> Schumer also said the investigation found favoritism toward industry executives  by directors of the Dallas Federal Home Loan Bank, who often regulated the same  thrifts at which they were themselves executives. The home loan bank system had  responsibility for savings and loans before the system was restructured under  the 1989 thrift bailout bill.  </P> <P> There also was a cover-up of billions of dollars in losses, and company  officials were paid multimillion-dollar bonuses "while the thrifts they  controlled teetered near insolvency," Schumer said.  </P> <P> "The severity of these findings should have sent shock waves through Texas, the  rest of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, the Administration, Congress and the  American people," he said.  </P> <P> But the study was left "on the dusty shelves of the top federal overseers in  Washington," Schumer said.  </P> <P> The five officers from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati who carried out  the 1988 investigation described the attitude of Dallas regulators as  "lackadaisical."  </P> <P> "After a few days, we developed what we called the Texas stare, we were so  flabbergasted by what we saw -- the files in the bank were in disarray," said  Gerald Summers, senior supervisory agent at the Cincinnati Federal Home Loan  Bank.  </P> <P> "It was pretty obvious the Dallas bank had a philosophy to under-report  (thrift) losses," he said.  </P></p>

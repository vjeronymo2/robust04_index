			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, 2 Mar (XINHUA) -- Jin Yongjian, head of the  Chinese delegation to the 50th session of the UN Commission on  Human Rights, pointed out in his speech to the session today:  China is firmly opposed to interference in the internal affairs  of a sovereign state or the exertion of political pressures  under the pretext of human rights.    Jin Yongjian said, "In the field of human rights, we believe  that in the spirit of international cooperation and equal  consultations as underlined in the `Vienna Declaration and  program of action,' all countries should strive for greater  understanding and broader cooperation by means of dialogue on  the basis of an equal footing and mutual respect." He pointed  out: Some Western countries, in repeatedly concocting a draft  resolution on the so-called human rights situation in China, are  deliberately turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to China's  progress and development and to the fact that the Chinese people  are enjoying a broad range of human rights and fundamental  freedoms. This is a typical example of politicizing human  rights issues and of applying pressures on China under the  pretext of human rights. The Chinese Government is firmly  opposed to such an attempt.    He emphasized: China is a developing country with a huge  population. In light of China's realities, the Chinese  Government has always accorded primary importance to developing  its national economy and improving the people's living  standards. He said: Developing the economy and improving the  people's living conditions are a basic guarantee for the greater  enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Political  reform must conform to the country's specific conditions, ensure  social stability, and promote smooth economic development.    Jin Yongjian pointed out: At present, the Chinese people, in  following a development path suitable to the conditions of their  country, are focusing their energy on economic development while  at the same time endeavoring to strengthen democracy and the  legal system and while carrying out political reform. In view  of the different historical and cultural backgrounds and  different stages of development of different countries, peoples  have the right to choose the social systems and development  paths suitable to the conditions of their own countries. No  country should impose on others its own ideology and pattern of  development.    In conclusion, Jin Yongjian said: China is consistently  devoted to upholding the purposes and principles of the "U.N.  Charter," and it supports the positive efforts of the  international community to protect and promote human rights.  The Chinese Government has acceded to eight international human  rights conventions and has been fulfilling its obligations  strictly in accordance with those conventions. China has been  playing a positive and constructive role in international human  rights affairs. In the days to come, the Chinese Government  will, as always, continue to contribute to the protection and  promotion of human rights.</p>

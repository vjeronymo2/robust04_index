			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Russia to form its own army MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, yesterday signed a decree clearing the way for the restoration of a purely Russian army, 75 years after its defeat in the First World War precipitated the Bolshevik revolution. The decree, signed when Mr Yeltsin returned from holiday, creates a Russian defence ministry of which he will take temporary charge while the military forces are created and lines of command cleared. This is a break with both Soviet and Russian Tsarist tradition under which the post was held by a military officer. General Dmitri Volkogonov, a military adviser to Mr Yeltsin, told a meeting of Russian deputies last night that the armed forces would take two years to create and might number between 1.25m and 1.5m men. That compares with the 3.7m-strong former Soviet army, now under operational federal control of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The timing of the move may be meant as a show of strength in the face of demonstrations planned in central Moscow today by communist diehards and resurgent nationalists, which the organisers claim will be heavily supported. It may also be an attempt to set the agenda before Friday's crucial meeting in Kiev of CIS leaders, which will consider the division of the old Soviet army's assets and future military structures. Russia is anxious to extricate its men  - who make up the bulk of the former Soviet army  - from the growing number of trouble spots around the former Union, most notably Nagorno-Karabakh. Yesterday's decision shows that Russia can no longer afford, and does not wish, to intervene in conflicts outside its influence. The Russian leadership is reluctant to cast aside the CIS military command altogether, in part because it will continue to control the strategic nuclear forces for at least the next two years. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the Russian deputy prime minister, said the new army would be created within the bounds of the CIS armed forces. Almost all the former Soviet republics are committed to forming their own armed forces  - although only Azerbaijan, Belarus and Ukraine have said they will do this outside the CIS framework. Russia's decision to create its own military is likely to force the other republics rapidly to build up their own defence forces  - with the CIS being confined, at best, to a loose co-ordinating role. Mr Yeltsin's decision to take over the defence ministry was in part to avoid a 'conflict between the democrats and the military' over whether the defence minister should be a general or a civilian, said Mr Shakhrai  - giving a glimpse into the still-existing power of the generals. He said such a struggle 'could lead to grave consequences'. Mr Andrei Kokoshin, deputy director of the USA Canada Studies Institute and the most prominent civilian candidate for the post, said he believed his candidacy was still in play once Mr Yeltsin stepped down from the ministry after the initial period of creating the military forces had passed. Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan, chose yesterday to announce the formation of a national guard dedicated to guarding the constitution, the republic's vital interests and citizens' freedoms. No mention was made of the size of the guard.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Compensation will be amended THE LAW DEBENTURE TRUST CORPORATION v THE URAL CASPIAN OIL CORPORATION LTD AND OTHERS Chancery Division: Mr Justice Hoffmann: March 9 1992 A TRUSTEE for ex-shareholders with rights to foreign compensation for confiscation of company assets, has no contractual cause of action against a person to whom the company transfers those rights in breach of agreement with the trustee, nor against a subsequent transferee, if the transferees acquired the rights with knowledge of the agreement but were not party to it. And as the second transfer deprives the trustee of the remedy of retransfer as against the first transferee to undo the consequences of the tort of interference with contractual relations, he may have a cause of action in tort as against the second transferee for interference with the remedies arising out of a broken contract, which would enable him to seek a court order for retransfer to the first transferee and then to the company. Mr Justice Hoffmann so held when striking out parts of the statement of claim and giving leave to amend it in an action by Law Debenture Trust Corporation against Ural Caspian Oil Corporation Ltd, North Caucasian Oil Fields Ltd, New Schibaieff Petroleum Co Ltd, Grozny-Sundja Oil Fields Ltd ('the Russian companies'), Hilldon Ltd and Caspian Resources Ltd. HIS LORDSHIP said the Russian companies were English-registered companies which carried on business in Russia before the revolution. The Soviets confiscated their assets and for many years rejected their claims for compensation. In April 1986, Leisure made an offer for the entire issued share capitals of the Russian companies. The controlling shareholder in each company was Shell Petroleum. It agreed to accept the offer on condition that Leisure and the companies entered into covenants to apply any compensation for the benefit of existing shareholders. By four agreements dated May 2 1986 each of the Russian companies and Leisure entered into covenants with Law Debenture Trust as trustee for the shareholders. Each company covenanted to pursue its compensation claim, and to pay any compensation it received to the trustee. In each agreement, Leisure covenanted to procure that the company would perform its covenants, and not to part with control of the company unless the transferee entered into similar covenants. After execution of the agreements, Shell and certain other shareholders transferred their shares to Leisure. On December 15 1989, the Russian companies were paid Pounds 7.2m compensation. Shortly before payment, Leisure agreed to sell its entire shareholding to Hilldon, an Isle of Man company. In breach of covenant, it imposed no requirement that Hilldon should covenant with the trustee, and Hilldon did not do so. On March 5 1990, the shares were transferred to Hilldon. A further Pounds 6m compensation was paid on June 4. In October, Hilldon transferred the shares to Caspian. The Russian companies refused to pay the compensation to the trustee. It commenced proceedings against the companies, and against Hilldon and Caspian. The statement of claim alleged against Hilldon that by accepting the shares knowing the terms of the agreements, it procured Leisure to breach of covenant. Hilldon admitted the allegation disclosed a cause of action in tort. However, it was further alleged that Hilldon and Caspian, knowing of the agreement, each came under a contractual 'implied collateral obligation' to the trustee to perform similar covenants. Hilldon and Caspian applied under RSC Order 18 rule 19, to have the claims in contract struck out. Neither of them was party to a contract with the trustee. Nor were there any grounds for implying a collateral contract. Part of the statement of claim was liable to be struck out as against Hilldon, and the whole as against Caspian. Mr Crystal for the trustee applied for leave to amend the statement of claim. A proposed new paragraph said that because Hilldon took the shares with knowledge of the agreements and their breach by Leisure, it also took the burden of those covenants and came under an obligation to perform them. Similar allegations were made against Caspian. Mr Crystal submitted that the obligation to perform the covenants arose either under the principle of De Mattos v Gibson (1958) 4 De G&amp;J 276, 282, or under a developing principle relating to benefits and burdens. The De Mattos principle was that as a general rule, where a person acquired property with knowledge of a previous contract to use the property in a specified manner, he should not use it in a manner not allowable to the giver or seller. The principle permitted no more than the grant of a negative injunction. In Lumley v Wagner (1852) 1 De GM&amp;G 618 the defendant was restrained from singing at Covent Garden and Mr Gye was injuncted from employing her there, but she was not ordered to sing at Her Majesty's Theatre and he was not ordered to procure that she did so. There was not a single case in which the De Mattos principle had been used to impose a positive duty to perform the covenants of a predecessor. In the alternative, the trustee relied on the principle that he who took the benefit of a transaction must also take the burden. The 'pure principle' of benefit and burden was that the right and burden, although arising under the same instrument, were independent of each other: 'X grants a right to Y and by the same instrument Y independently covenants with X to do some act' (Tito v Wadell (No 2)(1977) Ch 106). In the present case, the right and burden did not arise under the same instrument. The shares were transferred to Leisure from registered shareholders, while the covenant was made by Leisure with the trustee for all shareholders. A covenantee's right to enforce his covenant against an assignee depended on the circumstances of a transaction to which he was not a party (see Tito). One must be able to infer from that transaction that the assignee was intended to assume the burden. No such inference could be drawn here. On the contrary, the trustee asserted that the whole object of the transaction was to ensure that Hilldon and Caspian would not be subject to the burden of the agreements. Finally, the trustee claimed extension of relief for the tort of inducing breach of contract. In Esso Petroleum (1974) 1 QB 142 an order was made to undo the consequences of a tort which could have been restrained before it was committed. Under that authority, the court could have ordered Hilldon to retransfer the shares to Leisure for it to procure performance by the Russian companies. An order was no longer possible because Hilldon had transferred the shares to Caspian. The trustee therefore asked for orders against Caspian to retransfer the shares to Hilldon, and against Hilldon to retransfer them to Leisure. For an injunctive order against Caspian, the trustee must demonstrate a cause of action. It had no cause of action in contract. The question was whether it had a cause of action in tort. Caspian was not alleged to have played any part in inducing Leisure to break its covenant as to disposal of the shares. The effect of the transfer to Caspian was not to interfere with contractual relations, but to deprive the trustee of the Esso remedy of retransfer which it would have had for inducement of the earlier breach by Hilldon. That raised the question of whether the Lumley principle could be extended beyond interference with contractual relations to interference with the remedies arising out of a broken contract. There was no authority for such liability, but on an application under RSC Order 18, rule 19 it could not be said that that an affirmative answer could not be given. Such a claim should not be struck out but should be argued at trial when the relevant facts had been established. As against Hilldon the claims in contract were struck out. As against Caspian, the whole statement of claim was struck out but the action was not dismissed. Leave was given to serve an amended statement of claim against all parties, though not in the form for which leave had been sought. Counsel would reconsider the draft in the light of the judgment. For the trustee: Michael Crystal QC and John Higham (Linklaters &amp; Paines). For Hilldon: Robert Kirk (Jerrard Saunders Donn). For Caspian: Robin Potts QC and Richard Snowden (Hill Taylor Dickinson). In Davy Offshore v Emerald, FT March 16, leading counsel for Emerald was VV Veeder QC.</p>

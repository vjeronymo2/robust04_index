			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Argentina on time with budget ARGENTINA unveiled on Monday evening a draft 1993 budget totalling Dollars 40.05bn (Pounds 20.3bn), against a backdrop of government infighting and debate over alleged government insensitivity to the social costs of its orthodox adjustment policies, John Barham writes from Buenos Aires. Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, said when presenting the budget to Congress that although federal spending would increase by 17.4 per cent over 1992, the budget would be balanced, with revenues of Dollars 40.05bn - equivalent to 24 per cent of GDP. Public spending, including local government, is forecast at 42 per cent of GDP. Central and local government will increase social spending to Dollars 47.5bn, or 28 per cent of GDP in 1993. This is only the second time in 40 years that an Argentine government has submitted its budget to Congress for approval on time.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras from the </F> "Doing Radio" newscast]    [Text] The 33d anniversary of the founding of the Interior  Ministry [Minint] is being celebrated today. The "Doing Radio"  newscast sends all its self-sacrificing fighters its most  fraternal greetings.    The revolution has waged a constant struggle against those  who have tried to crush the achievements of this process  throughout three decades; and, within that struggle, the Minint  fighters have played a role that deserves full recognition.  Tasks which deal with the prevention of crime and repression of  activities which conspire against the security, integrity, and  assets of the people and the citizens represent difficult,  self-sacrificing work that entails sacrifices, total dedication,  and -- many times -- serious risks because many Minint fighters  have lost their lives in the line of duty.    These tasks require honest men because nothing is more  damaging than the abuse of power or the use of that authority  with intentions other than those granted by the revolution and  the law to the organizations and the men who serve it. Minint  fighters have achieved success in their tasks because they have  had the people's full support. In a revolution like ours, the  repression of criminal activities, whatever their nature, always  has the people's support. This is one of the keys of the Minint  fighters' success in their various activities.    Today, when we mark the foundation of the Minint, which was  formed with a nucleus of men from the rebel army and clandestine  groups, "Doing Radio" joins the people in greeting those  fighters with strong principles, convictions, and determination  to serve the people, which is the source of their authority.</p>

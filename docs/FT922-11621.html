			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India disappointed with oil round bids India's Ministry of Petroleum received a disappointing 24 bids for the 72 onshore and offshore blocks thrown open for exploratory drilling in the fourth licensing round, writes KK Sharma in New Delhi. The ministry had hoped for more interest in view of various incentives and concessions, including production-sharing and tax benefits, that were offered for the first time. The incentives were offered because the country urgently needs new fields. For the past two decades India's oil production has stagnated at about 240m barrels a year. Because of the growing demand India has to use scarce foreign exchange to import more than 150m barrels of crude and petroleum products every year. The foreign companies that bid included Royal Dutch/Shell, Amoco and Arco of the US and smaller US firms like Andarco, Albion and Pan Energy Resources. Private Indian bidders included Tata Industries, Hindusthan Oil Exploration Corporation and Gujarat Gas of the Mafatlal group. Some foreign companies that bid in previous rounds stayed away this time. They included Chevron of the US, BHP of Australia and International Petroleum of Dubai. Exxon and Mobil had also bid in earlier rounds. Indian companies that were expected to bid but abstained were the Aditya Birla group, the Ambanis and the Ruias of Essar. The 24 bids received were for 13 blocks, eight offshore and five onshore. Bids were made for onshore blocks in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra, Maharashtra and West Bengal.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Victoria Carpet holding margins Both turnover and profit at Victoria Carpet showed reductions for the year ended March 31. Turnover of this manufacturing group dropped 8 per cent, from Pounds 36.7m to Pounds 33.8m. Margins were maintained, however, for a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.74m, against Pounds 1.9m. Mr John Bettinson, chairman, said there were improvements in the UK, but a reduction in Australia was compounded by a high level of business failures. Earnings per share slipped to 18.08p (19.15p). The dividend, however, is held at 4.5p at a cost of Pounds 285,000 (Pounds 276,000) after waivers.</p>

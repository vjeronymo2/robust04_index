			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Yorks Electricity rises to Pounds 74m - Dividend increased by 15% 'about average for the sector' Yorkshire Electricity provided shareholders with an interim dividend increase of 15 per cent after increasing pre-tax profits from Pounds 42.5m to Pounds 74m. The dividend rise was less than that of several regional power companies but Yorkshire said that, unlike them, it was not rebalancing the pay-outs between the two halves. Mr Malcolm Chatwin, chief executive, said the increase was about average for the sector and consistent with previously stated policies. The published pre-tax profits showed a 74 per cent rise on turnover of Pounds 587.2m (Pounds 590.7m). However, unlike other regional companies Yorkshire has not restated its accounts to reflect changes in coal contracts. Taking this into account the underlying growth in profits was said to be 22 per cent. Earnings per share were 27.8p (14.8p), with underlying growth of 32 per cent. The dividend is 6.9p (6p). In the half year staff was cut by 329. The company said it was on target to deliver a 550 reduction by the end of year, a fall of 10 per cent. In the core business operating costs fell by 2 per cent during the half. Units distributed increased by 1.6 per cent, or 0.6 per cent when adjusted for weather. The company said this 'provided evidence of an upturn in the region's economy'. Retail is continuing to benefit from efficiencies following the setting up of a joint venture with East Midlands Electricity. But Mr Chatwin said it made a small loss in the half year and was facing difficult trading conditions. COMMENT Once a star of the sector, Yorkshire's sparkle has faded somewhat in the last year. Assuming an annual dividend of 23.2p, the shares are on a prospective yield of about 4.3 per cent, signifying concerns about relatively low dividend cover and the company's progress in cutting costs. That may seem strange for a company that cut more than 300 jobs in the half year, above the average. But some analysts believe its cost base remains higher than most regional electricity companies and that it may be penalised by the regulator in the forthcoming distribution review as a result. The contrary view is that Yorkshire will start to benefit soon from innovative restructuring of its core business into more competitive units. In these results the management showed its value by building the Brigg generating plant to programme and at a saving of about Pounds 5m to budget. In the end Yorkshire's steady, 'managed growth' approach may pay off but investors may wait until after the review before re-assessing their opinions. The shares are meanwhile worth holding on to.</p>

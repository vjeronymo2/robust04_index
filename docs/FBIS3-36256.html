Nikolayev added that this also meant the use of firearms  against transgressors if they failed to obey orders by border  guards.    As concerns the mass violation of the Russian border near  the  southern Kuril Islands by Japanese shipping vessels on January  21 and 22, Nikolayev said that the transgression of the Russian  border by 130 Japanese boats must have been preplanned. To all  appearances, it was a reaction to the detention of a Japanese  schooner under Captain Keinichi Noto by Russian coast guards in  the same area at the end of November. Firearms were used after  the Japanese captain declined to obey orders. He was wounded.    Nikolayev said Keinichi Noto will soon face trial by a  Russian court which will decide on the fate of the captain and  his schooner.    Soon after Captain Noto's schooner was detained, the  Japanese  Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanded in a note to Moscow that  the captain and two sailors, as well as the boat, be released.  The two sailors returned to Japan in January.    Nikolayev stressed that the Russian border units in the Far  East "will protect the state border in accordance with the  principles defined by the Russian president and government".    "No one should have any doubts that we will firmly guard our  country's economic interests," he said.</p>

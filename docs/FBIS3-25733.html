Correspondent Tunde Odunkorude reports that the Army chief, who  spoke to newsmen in Fanda in Ondo state, explained the presence  of Nigerian troops at the Bakassi Peninsula in Cross River State:    [Begin recording] [Odunkorude] Maj. Gen. Chris Alli told the  newsmen that the country has no intention to go to war with any  of our neighbors.    [Alli] Well, I do not know what you mean by position, but we  are in our territory in Bakassi and that is just what we are  doing, protecting our citizens. (?Our people) have been fired  at occasionally by the gendarmes, but we are restraining  ourselves. I would not talk about aggression between two  brothers, would I?    [Odunkorude] The chief of Army staff was in the state to  inspect officers in the ranks of lieutenants drawn from all Army  formations in the country, who are undergoing practical  examinations to the rank of captain. Gen. Alli urged them to  place more emphasis on their military assignments and noted that  their individual contributions to the development of the Army  will go a long way in solidifying the foundation put in place by  the founding fathers of the Army. Speaking during a courtesy  call on Alayi of Ekon Alayi, Gen. Alli said the Army is training  and retraining its officers and men to keep them in constant  readiness for the protection of the nation's territorial  integrity. The Alayi Oba Emmanuel Aladujari noted the need for  the country to remain one in line with the principles of our  founding fathers. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> EPA STAFF BARRED FROM URANIUM PLANT  </P> <P> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and its counterpart at the state level  have barred their employees from visiting the federal government's uranium  processing facility in southwest Ohio because of the risk of exposure to  radioactivity, a spokeswoman confirmed. EPA Regional Administrator Valdas  Adamkus, in a letter last week, said tests showed that agency personnel were  exposed to uranium oxide when they went to the Feed Materials Production Center  at Fernald and that no EPA personnel would go to the site "until this health  risk can be satisfactorily addressed." The Ohio EPA followed suit, said  spokesman Allan Franks. But the plant's operator said that routine urine tests  to detect exposure ensure that the workers are protected. "We think the plant  is safe," said William H. Kelley, spokesman for Westinghouse Materials of Ohio,  the contractor running the plant for the Energy Department.  </P></p>

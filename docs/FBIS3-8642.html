			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, March 13 (AFP)--Bosnian Croats and Moslems  reached an agreement here Sunday [13 March] on creating a canton  for each group in central Bosnia, authoritative Croat sources  announced.    The accord came after talks on forming a Croat-Moslem  federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina resumed at the U.S. Embassy,  amid signs that negotiators would probably reach an overall  agreement later in the day.    Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic earlier said: "We  shall  try to finish up this morning," while Bosnian Prime Minister  Haris Silajdzic said he was "still optimistic."    Croat sources said late Saturday [12 March] only "a few  technical problems" remained and a global accord would probably  be announced Sunday.    The behind-closed-doors talks began here on March 4 after  Granic and Silajdzic signed an initial agreement on March 1 in  Washington.</p>

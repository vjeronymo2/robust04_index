			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (3): Longer and deeper cycles - The pulp industry THE MAIN challenge facing the world's pulp industry is a familiar one - a massive imbalance of supply and demand. But there is no obvious remedy for the sector's dire operating rates, prices and profitability. The predicament is all the more grim because, for a brief moment at the beginning of the year, it thought the market had turned the corner. At that stage, prices for northern softwood had tumbled from a peak in 1989 of Dollars 840 a tonne to as low as Dollars 460. The industry reckoned that Dollars 460 was the bottom, and during the first quarter of this year started to push through price increases. At first, pulp producers' optimism seemed justified. During the first six months, prices headed upwards, with list prices even reaching Dollars 600 a tonne, although there was still considerable discounting. World shipments in Europe to the end of July increased by 12 per cent, compared with last year's admittedly depressed volumes, says Mr Roger Wright, of Hawkins Wright, the marketing and research consultants. But then the market turned. 'Over the last few months, the psychology has reversed,' says Mr Stephen Zinser, managing director of European paper and packaging at Chase Manhattan Bank. 'Customers built up inventories in anticipation of a strike in British Colombia. That proved shorter than expected, and prices started heading down.' 'The recovery was artificial - an illusion,' says Mr Wright. 'All that happened was that inventories moved from producers to users, who thought prices were going to move upwards. Paper consumption remained depressed, leaving customers with higher stocks. Naturally they cut back on pulp orders.' One observer says it would not be an exaggeration to say that prices are now in free-fall, with list-prices for northern softwood at about Dollars 560, but discounted transaction prices at as little as Dollars 450. Payment terms are also becoming more generous. Prices in real terms are lower than ever before, admits Mr Timo Teras, senior vice-president of market research and planning at Finncell, the Finnish pulp marketing organisation. The question facing the industry is whether this is part of a normal cycle, linked to the slow-down in the growth of the world economy, or whether something more structural is occuring. Certainly, the pulp industry's cycles appear to be getting longer and deeper, according to Mr Sverker Martin-Lof, chief executive of the Swedish group SCA. The structural problems are not hard to identify. The most significant is massive overcapacity. World supply is 34.8m tonnes, a 6 per cent increase on 1991. But world demand is only about 29.9m tonnes, and growing more slowly - up 3 per cent on last year. On the demand side, virgin pulp is facing increasing competition from recycled fibre, whose growth has been pushed by environmental legislation, particularly in the US and Germany. 'The fastest-growing 'forests' (waste paper awaiting collection) are in the cities of Europe,' admits Dr Jan Remrod, director general of the Swedish pulp and paper association. The plight of some grades is worse than others. For northern softwood pulp, the position is far worse, because it is losing market share to southern softwood: annual capacity is at 9.3m tonnes, while demand is almost static at 7.7m tonnes, according to Mr Wright. The industry's difficulties have also been exacerbated by increased integration over the past few years. European groups have added paper machines to their pulp plants, reducing the size of the traded pulp market, says Mr Teras, at Finncell. That has led to exaggerated swings in prices. On the supply side, the imbalance is partly caused by pulp manufacturers starting construction of new capacity simultaneously during the late 1980s. But a structural shift of the economics of pulp production, between the northern and southern hemispheres, is also taking place. 'The major threat to us is from countries like Chile and Brazil,' says Mr Bernt Lof, chief executive of MoDo, the Swedish group. He explains that a eucalyptus plantation in Brazil can be harvested in only eight years, while pine in Chile can be cut after 30 years. That compares with a period in Scandinavia of 80 to 100 years, because of the limited short growing season during the short summers of northern climes. Mr David Walker, vice-president of corporate analysis at Jaakko Poyry Oy, the paper and pulp consultants, estimates that wood costs in Chile are a third of those in Scandinavia. In addition, the cost of transporting wood in Scandinavia is higher, because a greater surface area is needed to supply the pulp mills, says Mr Lof, at MoDo. Harvesting costs are also less, because of lower wages in South America. The build-up of South American production has been rapid and substantial. In Brazil, Aracruz has just completed a Dollars 1.2bn expansion programme, including a new 525,000-tonne a year line at its plant in Espirito Santo, north of Rio de Janeiro. In addition, Bahia Sul has started production at a plant. Eventual yearly production will exceed 400,000 tonnes, but a 250,000 tonnes a year paper plant should start next year. Chile has added capacity of 1m tonnes a year over the last 18 months, three-quarters of which is pine-based with the balance provided by eucalyptus. With supply outstripping demand and prices still poor, operating rates remain terrible, says Mr Wright. Manufacturers, whose inventories are building up, are likely to close plants for maintenance for extended periods, he reckons. Most pulp producers are busy cutting costs. MoDo, for example, is believed to have saved about SKr1bn (Pounds 96.7m) over the last three years through cost- cutting. Mr Lof says a further SKr1bn will be saved next year and another SKr300m could follow, but after that he'll start praying. Finnish groups have also been cutting their cost-base. A combination of the devaluation of the markka and reduction in labour and energy costs have helped to some extent, says Mr Teras, at Finncell. 'We need every margin possible,' he adds. Mr Jan Remrod, director general of the Swedish pulp and paper association, points out that Scandinavian costs are falling as those of South American producers start to rise. But in spite of cost-cutting, a structural imbalance remains. There is little sign of an upturn in the world economy to allow demand to catch supply. The economies of Germany and most of the rest of Europe appear to be slowing, as is that of Japan. The US may be beginning to pick up, but the growth in market pulp there is limited because so much production is integrated into paper production. The most obvious way to solve the crisis would be to close capacity. Mr Lof, at MoDo, points the finger at Canadian producers. 'Their pulp mills are small and old. It will cost a fortune to improve their environmental performance. They are obvious candidates for closure.' Nevertheless, the barriers to exit are formidable. The Scandinavians' position may be less precarious. The Swedes have slashed costs, while investing heavily in new plant to produce the totally chlorine-free pulp now increasingly demanded by German, Austrian and Swiss consumers. Mr Wright says that, although Nordic wood costs are still more than 80 per cent higher than in the US and Chile, they should continue to fall through the 1990s as more softwood resources reach maturity. Finnish companies are also making efforts to become more cost-competitive. Whether such measures are enough to secure the long-term future of northern hemisphere manufacturers remains to be seen.</p>

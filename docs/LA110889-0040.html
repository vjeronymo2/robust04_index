			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GASTELUM, AGUIRRE FAVORED IN CROSS-COUNTRY PRELIMS  </P> <P> Brian Gastelum of Birmingham High and Obed Aguirre of San Fernando figure to be  the top contenders for the boys' individual title in the City Section  cross-country preliminaries at Pierce College today at 2 p.m.  </P> <P> In the team race, Belmont's seven-year reign as City champion is on the line  against Taft, which pounded the Sentinels, 20-43, in a nonconference meet in  September. Birmingham, the Valley Pac-8 Conference champion, also is expected  to make a strong bid for the title.  </P> <P> Gastelum has the City's fastest time on the three-mile course this season -- a  14-minute, 55-second clocking in the Braves' dual meet with Monroe on Oct. 26.  Aguirre registered a personal-best 15:08 in winning his second Northwest Valley  Conference championship last week.  </P> <P> The City's top returnee, junior Martin Morales of Wilson, started racing again  two weeks ago after being sidelined because of injury.  </P> <P> In the girls' competition, four of Wilson's top seven runners from a year ago  have graduated and the Mules will be hard pressed to win their fourth  consecutive City title. The top four runners in 1988 for Garfield, last year's  runner-up, also have graduated.  </P> <P> The City finals will be held Nov. 18 at Pierce. MIKE GLAZE  </P></p>

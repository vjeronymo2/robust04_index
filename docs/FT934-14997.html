			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Israel and PLO set out peace timetable ISRAEL AND the Palestine Liberation Organisation briskly and cordially began implementing their outline peace deal yesterday. The two sides set a tight timetable for further detailed negotiations and established two additional committees on economic and regional co-operation. At separate talks in Cairo and Taba, on Egypt's Red Sea coast, the two sides agreed on the institutional structures necessary for detailed negotiations. They also opened continuous talks on the terms for an Israeli military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho, which is due to begin on December 13. Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, wrapping up the first one-day meeting of a joint PLO-Israeli liaison committee, said in Cairo: 'We shall make a supreme effort to meet the time (for withdrawal) and if possible, attempt to do so earlier'. Both Mr Peres and Mr Mahmoud Abbas, who headed the PLO delegation, emphasised the 'positive' spirit of the talks, meeting privately before the inaugural two-hour session of the liaison committee. Outside, sharp-suited Israeli and Palestinian security agents milled side by side, stonyfaced, in the corridors of the Semiramis Intercontinental Hotel. The leaders of the two delegations were relaxed and occasionally smiling, Mr Peres at some points translating for his counterpart. Speaking for both, Mr Peres told reporters: 'We want to build a real commodity, and that is goodwill.' He added: 'Both of us have agreed that the purpose of our delegations is not to argue and create problems, but to build bridges, the right atmosphere and the right approach.' Mr Abbas declared: 'We will work day and night, without being restricted by time, to solve all the pending issues which need to be settled by the deadline, in accordance with the agreement.' In a communique, the two sides announced that: The Cairo liaison committee will meet every two to three weeks at ministerial level and may create sub-committees to address the following problems; The Taba negotiations on limited Israeli withdrawal will be continuous; the two sides hope to reach agreement on withdrawal within two months; A ministerial-level committee will be formed on economic co-operation, the dates and venues for which are to be decided; Further committees embracing the Palestinians, Israel and Jordan will be formed in order to hold discussions on 'issues of common concern'; Separate talks should resume as swiftly as possible in Washington over next year's Palestinian elections in the West Bank and Gaza. No date has yet been set for the twelfth round of Washington peace talks, which would also include bilateral talks between Israel, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The communique also said that the question of tens of thousands of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel and the remaining Palestinian deportees whom Israel despatched to south Lebanon in December last year, would be referred to the separate talks on limited self-rule in both Gaza and Jericho. 'The issue will be dealt with in good faith ..taking into consideration the importance that the Palestinian side attaches to it,' the statement added.</p>

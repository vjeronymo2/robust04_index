			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: NY exchange cuts gold and silver trading costs THE UP-FRONT cost of trading precious metals futures on the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) has fallen for the second time this month, making it even cheaper to trade those contracts. Comex yesterday lowered the minimum margin, or good-faith deposit, that it requires customers to put down to trade futures on gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper. The smaller deposit requirements reflect flat price action in those contracts in recent months. Most US futures exchanges, including Comex, calculate margins on a formula linked to a commodity's price volatility. An exchange official explained that, despite recent weakness in precious metals prices, long-term price movement in these contracts, particularly in silver futures, has held narrow ranges. Comex last lowered margins on October 14. The exchange's requirement for a small customer to trade one gold futures contract fell to Dollars 931 yesterday, compared with Dollars 1,064 two weeks ago and about Dollars 1,300 a year ago. The silver margin fell to Dollars 665 a contract, from Dollars 798 two weeks ago and about Dollars 1,064 a year ago. So far this year volume in the Comex's precious metals pits is below the 1991 level and sharply below the 1990 turnover, which included the turmoil linked to the Gulf war. J In the first nine months of 1992, Comex silver volume dropped to 2.4m contracts, from 3.3m in the same period in 1991. Comex gold volume, while gaining in September, is also down, at 4.8m contracts in the first nine months, compared with 5m last year. Precious metals prices are in an extended slump, partly because of the deflationary aspects of the world economy, analysts say, and more recently because of sizeable sales by producers.</p>

Neither Does the Latter's Initiative Meet With Support in Kiev"]    [Text] The POSTFACTUM news agency has learned from sources  close to the government of Turkmenistan that Republic Vice Prime  Minister Valeriy Otchertsov, in charge of financial matters, has  declined to meet with Avtovaz president Petr Nakhmanovich, who  has arrived in Ashgabat. Other high Turkmen officials also  ignored the invitation for a meeting. P. Nakhmanovich's trip is  known to be connected with Avtovazbank's intention to buy  Ukraine's debt to Turkmenistan for gas deliveries that stands  today at $800 million.    Abad Kurbanmuradova, head of the trade department of  Turkmenistan's cabinet, said in a POSTFACTUM interview regarding  this that the question of Ukraine's settling its debt for  Turkmen gas imports would be solved with the participation of  the Ukrainian "Republic" corporation through which many  Ukrainian enterprises effect economic relations with Turkmen  enterprises. It is supposed that 30 percent of the debt will be  paid to Turkmenistan in hard currency right away, while the  balance will be paid in commodities in the course of 1994.  Turkmen authorities have already agreed to carry out this  project. Now it has been sent to the Ukrainian Government for  approval. This information is also being confirmed in Kiev.  The Ukrainian side declares that there have been no talks  between Ukraine and Turkmenistan on reselling the debt.    Thus, Avtovazbank's initiative has won no backing and only  caused bewilderment in the capitals of both states. POSTFACTUM  reports that according to a confidential source, no Avtovazbank  chiefs had consulted Ukrainian authorities on the matter, and  the Republic would have hardly opted for such a step anyway.</p>

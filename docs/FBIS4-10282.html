			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" Newscast] </F>   [Text] The current big question is: What is happening to  peace in Chiapas? The answer remains silence. After 15 days  away, Peace and Reconciliation Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis  has returned to Chiapas. Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno  seems worried because the situation is worsening with regard to  the governability of the state. Juan Carlos Santoyo has this to  report.    [Begin recording] [Santoyo] It was a very important meeting,  called to evaluate state governmental actions, to strengthen  peace negotiations. What is the meaning of this meeting?  Manuel Camacho Solis readdressed the Chiapas issue, especially  its peace process, for the first time after 23 years, I mean,  after 15 days.    The first person to speak at the meeting was the Chiapas  attorney general; the Chiapas Supreme Court of Justice president  and the Chiapas Congress president also spoke. The three  Chiapas Government officials pointed out that the main thing to  do is to reform the Constitution, as well as state laws ranging  from labor to agricultural justice. They also talked about the  creation of an Indian Rights Ombudsman's Office. All these  issues combined will make the Javier Lopez Moreno government  submit more than 13 draft bills to the state congress. These  drafts will probably be made public on 12 April.    The meeting laid down the guidelines for the governor to air  a panorama that, as you already mentioned, is very difficult for  Chiapas. Lopez Moreno said: We are experiencing a crisis;  better yet, the crisis already experienced us. This crisis can  belittle or change us should we behave as we usually do; that  is, should we behave as though nothing happened.    Governor Lopez added: What we are currently facing is not  the exception to what usually happens. The state government is  reacting according to nonconformities, because we cannot halt  legitimate rebelliousness, or at least, we cannot constrain  social energy. Agricultural laws are about to be modified to  improve the daily life of Chiapas residents. Searching for  peace must mean that all Chiapas social sectors have to truly  work hard. He said something very important: In view of what  the EZLN [Zapatista National Liberation Front] did, it is  imperative to humanize power in Chiapas. This will constitute a  great lesson for all federal government and presidential  candidates. Governor Lopez concluded that humanizing power  means accepting that power must be shared and that people must  be patiently listened to, especially those who complain and  stage protests. However, for Javier Lopez Moreno, the important  aspect of the meeting was the message he delivered to the peace  commissioner:    [Lopez] Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis: We are ready; we are  already moving forward, and so are the commitments. This is how  we are heeding social complaints to embark on an authentic  agrarian justice, on flesh and bone human rights, on effective  law enforcement, and on holding honest elections. These are  democratic commitments that will lead us to reach genuine peace.  We Chiapas residents will continue to comply with such  commitments. Now, it is your turn. We ask you to resume  negotiations with the EZLN as soon as possible; we ask Bishop  Samuel Ruiz to resume his great efforts. The truce is good, but  peace is urgently needed. Uncertainty and unfounded reports  have saturated our atmosphere since the aberrant murder of Luis  Donaldo Colosio; only peace will end ambiguity.    No Chiapas resident wants hostilities to return. Reinstating  war would be even worse, because we will lose everything,  including our future, should weapons replace understanding. We  refuse to accept the silence of rifles; we want them to  disappear for good. This is why we are struggling for justice  to reemerge. We have no time to waste. No one must lose the  war; we all must win peace. Commissioner Camacho, you have the  last word; it is your turn. [end recording]</p>

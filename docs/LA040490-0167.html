			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEW YORK OVERNIGHT;  </P> <P> EX-GRIDDER MCCONKEY ANNOUNCES HOUSE RACE  </P> <P> EX-GIANT McCONKEY WILL RUN FOR CONGRESS: Just as we told you he would, former  Giants football player Phil McConkey announced Tuesday that he's running for  Congress as a Republican in New Jersey. He will seek the House seat vacated by  Rep. Jim Courter, who ran unsuccessfully for governor.  </P> <P> McConkey, who is currently with the San Diego Chargers, told a gathering at the  Somerville (N.J.) Inn that he will retire from football if elected.  </P> <P> "Some people have criticized me for running for Congress because I wasn't born  in New Jersey," said the Vietnam veteran. "Well, I bet my grandmother in Italy  and my grandfather in Ireland never dreamed I might someday be in Congress."  </P> <P> His opponent for the GOP nomination, Rodney P. Frelinghuysen III, traces his  family to the Mayflower.  </P> <P> Phil, now living in Flemington, N.J., made the announcement with his father,  Ed, and his girlfriend, model Diane Arabia, at his side.  </P> <P> HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, the ex-Buffalo Bills quarterback, urged him to run. "I  told him that seats in Congress don't open up that often," Kemp said.  </P> <P> RON'S LETTER MAY FETCH SMALL FORTUNE: Back in '62, the note was just a friendly  missive from a movie star to a frustrated playwright. But a lot has happened to  Ronnie Reagan since he starred on TV's "G.E. Theater." And now, the Herman  Darvick autograph people figure the note may fetch $1,800 at Thursday night's  auction in the Sheraton City Squire Inn.  </P> <P> The letter was written in April, 1962, to a "Miss White," who'd sent him a  play. "I must apologize for not getting back to you sooner about your play  which you kindly forwarded," wrote Reagan. "Frankly, I was motivated by  selfishness. Since Jan., we've been hanging motionless waiting to see if there  would be a G.E. Theater next year. Now the ax has fallen. . . . I hope you  won't mind but now that I know we aren't in the market, I'm taking your play to  another producer whose show is going &amp; who might be interested."  </P> <P> LITTLE THINGS MEAN A LOT: Hey, Broadway. Think small. At least musically, says  Martin Charnin, because most of the big houses are occupied with hits. That's  why Charnin, Jimmy Webb and Peter Stone are writing a "small piece for 10 to 12  actors" called "Love Me, Love My Dog." Marty will direct, Peter will write the  book and lyrics, and Jimmy will do the score.  </P> <P> "Peter found an old play by Bill Manhoff, who wrote 'The Owl and the Pussycat,'  " Charnin said.  </P> <P> "It's a very strange, exotic and bizarre little adventure. It'll be done  sometime in our immediate lifetimes but all things being equal, that'll be late  next season."  </P></p>

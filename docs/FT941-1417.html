			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / 'Technofear' hits used car prices Used car buyers are coming to fear expensive new technology so much that standard models are starting to have a higher resale value than top-specification vehicles of the same type, a senior executive of Glass's Guide, the used car values directory, said yesterday. Mr Leslie Allen, director and managing editor of the guide - regarded as the motor trade's bible - also predicted that the higher resale value of diesel cars compared with their petrol counterparts will have been eliminated by the middle of next year, as supply and demand for diesel cars came into balance. Glass's conclusions about growing technophobia in the used car market are potentially very bad news both for volume carmakers, which earn high margins on vehicles laden with electronic systems, and executive and luxury carmakers. Volume producers already face having to make less well-equipped new cars because of new company car tax legislation, effective next month, which links employees' personal tax bills directly with cars' list prices. The trend can only be accelerated by the prospect of steeper falls in residual values of high-specification models if used car buyers - almost always private motorists - shun them as the cars move from company fleets to dealer forecourts. It may also increase the depreciation rate of executive and luxury cars, typically loaded with complex electronic systems such as traction control and multi-mode automatic gearboxes which private motorists fear will be expensive if they break down. Electronic control modules alone for such systems can cost several hundred pounds. Mr Allen said: 'We have reached the threshold of the ridiculous state where a bog-standard Carlton, for example, will make more money than the all-singing and dancing version.'</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / BAT sees sharp rise in pre-tax profits REDUCED mortgage indemnity losses helped BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, increase pre-tax profits by 55 per cent to Pounds 645m in the six months to June 30. Group revenue rose 5 per cent to Pounds 9.42bn. Eagle Star, the group's insurance subsidiary, which has been hit heavily by UK domestic mortgage losses, cut its first-half loses from Pounds 175m to Pounds 47m. The improvement in Eagle Star's general business allowed the group to use more Advance Corporation Tax, cutting its tax rate from 57 per cent to 42 per cent. Earnings per share more than doubled to 22.9p (10.1p) and the interim dividend was lifted by 9 per cent to 14.6p. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said the dividend increase was in line with BAT's commitment to sustained dividend growth in excess of inflation, and was a rate he expected to be at least maintained. BAT's shares closed 22p higher at 756p. The group said the 6 per cent increase in tobacco's trading profit to Pounds 475m reflected good performance in most domestic and export markets. Export volumes grew 20 per cent and now account for a fifth of total cigarette sales. Trading profits from BAT's financial services businesses jumped to Pounds 252m from Pounds 83m. Farmers - the group's US arm - increased its contribution from Pounds 168m to Pounds 204m. During the second quarter, BAT said Farmers had become the fourth largest property and casualty insurer in the US, having progressed from eighth largest in 1988. Sir Patrick said the sustained improvement in Eagle Star's underwriting performance was especially encouraging, and had been aided by fair but rigorous claims handling procedures. Eagle Star made provisions for losses on its domestic mortgage business of Pounds 49m, compared with Pounds 121m previously. Claims are triggered when the proceeds from the sale of a repossessed property are less than the value of the outstanding mortgage. Sir Patrick said talks were continuing with building societies to see whether they could agree a new system, whereby both insurers and building societies groups 'shared the pain' of a fall in the house prices.

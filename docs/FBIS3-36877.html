Admittedly, of Weapons It  Does Not Need"]    [Text] Minsk -- Last year Belarus took its first steps as  an arms exporter. The government has made the especially formed  "Beltekheksport" foreign trading organization responsible for  dealing with the republic's new business. V. Tur, the  enterprise's deputy general director, reported that in 1993 it  sold more than $9 million of arms on the foreign market. In  addition, contracts worth another $23 million were signed.  According to expert estimates Belarus has surplus weapons,  combat equipment, and ammunition with a total value of over $1  billion.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Freeport plans Spanish copper expansion FREEPORT-MCMORAN, the US natural resources group, plans to expand capacity at the Huelva copper smelter in Spain by nearly half if its negotiations to buy the plant succeed. Huelva's capacity would be boosted from about 90,000 tonnes to 130,000 tonnes a year, says Mr James Moffett, Freeport's chairman. This would enable the Spanish smelter to treat more copper concentrate (an intermediate product) from Freeport's rapidly-growing copper-gold mine in Indonesia. Freeport is also involved in a project to build a 150,000-tonne copper smelter in Indonesia, of which Metallgesellschaft of Germany would be the majority shareholder and operator. However, Freeport would supply only half the Indonesian smelter's concentrate and would welcome some more 'captive' smelting capacity. The Huelva smelter is owned by Rio Tinto Minera, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ercros, the troubled industrial group 39-per-cent owned by the Kuwait Investment Office's Spanish holding company. Freeport has been negotiating since April to buy RTM and Ercros's loss-making fertiliser operation, Fesa-Enfersa. Management changes at Ercros and the KIO have delayed negotiations but Mr Moffett says Freeport is still very interested and still talking to Ercros. He insists, however: 'We won't buy the assets unless the old losses are dealt with by the people in charge when those losses were made'. Some analysts suggest Mr Moffett is unlikely to be able to work out a deal because Ercros's banks would have to forgive most of its debts and there are great difficulties over Ercros's under-funded pension scheme. Meanwhile, the KIO has left Ercros to sink or swim on its own and is unlikely to offer Freeport any guarantees on behalf of its associate. Freeport's 74-per-cent-owned subsidiary, Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold, is continuing to explore in Indonesia in an area where it already has, in the Grasberg mine, the western world's fifth-largest open pit copper reserve and the biggest single gold mine reserve. The company expects to sell 650m lb of copper and 620,000 troy ounces of gold this year. Expansion of mining and milling facilities in Indonesia to 57,000 tonnes a day has only recently been completed but Freeport is spending USDollars 90m to boost output to 66,000 tonnes a day by the middle of next year. A further expansion to 90,000 tonnes a day, costing Dollars 545m, is expected to be completed by mid-1996, enabling Freeport to produce about 1bn lb of copper a year plus 1.2m to 1.5m ounces of gold. Mr Moffett says the Dollars 450m finance for the Indonesian smelter, in which Metallgesellschaft is expected to take 55 per cent, and Freeport and Nippon Mining about 20 per cent each, is virtually completed. The smelter will be located at Gresik, near the port of Surabaya, where the Indonesian government has a large fertiliser production complex. Mr Moffett says that Dollars 50m was lopped off the smelter's cost by the choice of site and sulphuric acid generated by the smelter will replace 150,000 tonnes of sulphur at present imported for fertiliser production.</p>

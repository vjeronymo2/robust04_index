			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Women's skills highlighted EMPLOYERS must not ignore the skills of women as Britain comes out of recession, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said yesterday. Launching a national campaign to raise women's awareness of opportunities for work, training and voluntary service, she said it aimed to extend and broaden Opportunity 2000, the private-sector initiative designed to get more women into industry. The campaign's centrepiece, an exhibition called New Horizons for Women, opened in Manchester and will tour the country for the rest of this year, as well as being staged at the Royal Agricultural Show. Mrs Shephard conceded unemployment would lag economic recovery but said: 'Now is the time to remind employers to exploit the skills of everyone in the economy.' The labour market had changed with new technology so there was also a need to remind individual women of their capacity to become more entrepreneurial. She wanted enhancement of their individual skills. The exhibition indicates that only 8 per cent of 144,000 managers in large companies are women, three times as many men as women hold public appointments, 46 per cent of university students are women but 97 per cent of professors and top lecturers are men, and one in 10 of 1.69m construction workers are women. Mrs Shephard said the government's decision to abolish wages councils, which set minimum pay for 2.5m people, would not affect particularly women in the hotel and food industries, as critics claimed. Two thirds of people covered by the councils already earned above recommended minimums, she added.</p>

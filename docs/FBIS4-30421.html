			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 27 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government is mulling the suspension of the joint Korea-U.S.  Team Spirit military maneuver tenatively set for coming November  if an inter-Korean summit is realized as proposed and a  breakthrough is provided in the resolution of the nuclear  question.    A senior official said on Monday Nuclear Affairs Ambassador  Kim Sam-hun would convey this position to the United States when  he visits Washington this week.    His visit would be to put final touches to a  Seoul-Washington  stratgegy toward the third-round U.S.-North Korea high-level  talks taking place on July 8.    A source said the government would ask Washington not to  take  up the Team Spirit issue at the upcoming third-round talks since  the issue of whether to resume the annual exercises hinges  rather in the allevation of tension on the Korean peninsual than  in the nuclear issue only.    Through Ambassador Kim, the Seoul Government would also  express its support for the U.S. plan to exchange permanent  liaison missions between Washington and Pyongyang if North Korea  firmly guarantees the transparency of their nuclear past,  present and future, the official said.    The government would further convey to the United States its  existing stand that Seoul sees no reason why it should oppose  diplomatic normalization between Washington and North Korea if  North Korea resolves pending problems other than the nuclear one  such as the suspension of missile exports and renouncement of  terrorism.    Regarding the question of replacing North Korean atomic  reactors with light-water ones, a working-level meeting opening  in Washington this week among South Korea, U.S. and Japan would  explore the possibility of South Korea and Japan furnishing  funds and the United States technical knowhow to North Korea for  the project, the official added.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Control Data Corp. posted a profit of $1.7 million in 1988 against 1987 profit  of $19.3 million. The Bloomington, Minn.-based computer maker said poor results  at its mainframe and supercomputer operations, its mainstay business, and its  semiconductor subsidiary offset gains in the company's disk-drive subsidiary  and many of its services operations during 1988. For the fourth quarter, the  company posed a $12.8-million loss.  </P></p>

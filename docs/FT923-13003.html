			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Parcelforce faces imminent privatisation PARCELFORCE, the loss-making parcel delivery arm of the Post Office, is to be privatised as soon as possible, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, said yesterday Announcing the plans, Mr Heseltine emphasised there would continue to be a universal parcel service at a uniform and affordable tariff. 'That is not negotiable,' he told MPs, indicating that the tariff would remain a matter that ministers decided. The government has yet to decide how privatisation is to be achieved, though Mr Heseltine indicated that financial support would be made available so that management and employees could make a bid. Other potential bidders might include rivals United Parcels Service, TNT, and Securicor. Parcelforce has the leading 34 per cent share of ordinary parcel deliveries but only 2 per cent of the premium 'next day' market. Its turnover for 1991-92 was Pounds 508m and it sustained a loss of Pounds 24m. Parcelforce management points to a profitable second half of the year and an improvement from the losses of Pounds 131m in 1990-91. Mr Heseltine said Parcelforce was the only part of the Post Office that would be affected, but the decision prompted speculation that it would be followed by moves to privatise the Royal Mail. The election manifesto said only that the government was committed to maintaining a nationwide letter service with delivery to every address in the UK with a uniform price structure, and a national network of post offices. Most post offices are already privately run. Reaction from trade unions representing Parcelforce's 12,500 employees was hostile, although Mr Terry Deegan, general secretary of the Communication Managers' Association, said a management buyout 'might well be the least undesirable privatisation option'. The Union of Communication Workers, which represents the bulk of Parcelforce workers, called for assurances on protection of the pension fund, job security and continued union recognition. It also raised fears about the future of rural parcel deliveries. Sir Bryan Nicholson, the chairman of the Post Office, said his board supported the government's view that privatisation would 'provide the commercial framework and access to capital that Parcelforce needs'. The operation would need 'continued significant investment' to secure a strong future, he said. Labour accused the government of indulging in 'privatisation for privatisation's sake', and warned that the move threatened to undermine more than 100 years of a universal parcel service.</p>

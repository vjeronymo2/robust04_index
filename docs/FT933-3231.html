			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Ministers 'fought arms trade rules' BRITISH TRADE ministers were involved in an apparent attempt to persuade the government to breach its own export regulations in the 1980s, a Foreign Office official told the Scott inquiry yesterday. Mr David Gore-Booth, Britain's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said he had come to that conclusion on the basis of interdepartmental correspondence he had seen while serving between January 1989 and January this year as assistant secretary of state at the Foreign Office, responsible for the Middle East. He made his view clear in an internal Foreign Office memo which had been made available to the inquiry. Earlier Mr Gore-Booth told the inquiry that the Foreign Office had been virtually powerless to prevent the export of British machine-tools to Iraq in spite of receiving intelligence that they were contributing to a build-up of the country's defence capability. Under repeated questioning from Lord Justice Scott and his counsel Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, Mr Gore-Booth suggested that part of the reason was the inadequate way in which intelligence information was disseminated in Whitehall. He said: 'I don't myself feel that we lacked an assessment within the Foreign Office of the risks we were running as a country. What I am by no means clear about is to what extent the pieces of paper (intelligence) were part of the decision-making process of other Whitehall departments.' He said that if the intelligence made available to the Ministry of Defence and other government officials had been shared more fully with the Foreign Office it would have been more successful in restricting exports to Iraq. 'It is possible that if Mr (William) Waldegrave (then foreign office minister) had waved a particular piece of paper it might have influenced decisions another way,' he said. Documents made available to the Scott inquiry show Mr Gore-Booth unsuccessfully attempting to resist pressure from the Department of Trade and Industry and the MoD to support defence-related exports to Iraq. In 1989 Mr Waldegrave agreed with other ministers to award Matrix-Churchill, the Midlands-based machine-tools company, licences for 'general engineering' machines which were used to make fuses and missiles. Mr Gore-Booth, who on Monday clashed with the inquiry officials over what he claimed was their failure to understand the working of the Whitehall machinery, was yesterday less hostile, suggesting that government might have something to learn from the inquiry. The hearing continues today.</p>

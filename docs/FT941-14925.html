			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: More not less in the prize kitty Sir, I can reassure both Mr I G Baillie and Mr J H Shimmins (Letters, January 13). There will be no reduction in the number of smaller premium bond prizes when the Pounds 1m jackpot prize is introduced in April. The overall size of the prize fund has been increased to accommodate the new structure for prizes in the Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 1m range. And we will continue to pay out more than 185,000 of the smaller value prizes of Pounds 50, Pounds 100, Pounds 500 and Pounds 1,000. So the chances of winning have not become more remote as Mr Shimmins suggests. The odds of any single Pounds 1 bond winning a prize in any monthly draw remain unchanged at 15,000 to one, but there will be more money to be won.

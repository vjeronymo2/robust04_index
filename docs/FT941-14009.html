			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Financial advisers warn over PIA The National Federation of Independent Financial Advisers yesterday warned that it might support calls for statutory regulation of financial services, Alison Smith writes. Mr Bill Raynes, chairman, said the federation did not want statutory regulation but was not prepared to accept the version of self-regulation proposed for the personal investment authority (PIA). The latest controversy was sparked by the PIA's decision that only nine of its 19-strong board should be working in the industry. This prompted the resignation from the board of Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life, who argued that this could not amount to self-regulation. Mr Garry Heath, federation chief executive, said: 'Too many product providers have locked the door of their closet and despite Jim Stretton's principled stand have not come out and been counted.' He added, however, that the federation had dropped plans to apply for judicial review into the PIA board structure.</p>

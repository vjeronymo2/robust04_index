He also held foreign  postings as director of the Moscow Narodny Bank's branches in  London, Lebanon, West Germany and Singapore. The CBR has come  under increased attacks for its inflationary policies by the  finance ministry, leading economists and newspapers alike. In  an interview with Interfax, Gerashenko was trying to rebuff  those accusations.    IF [Interfax]: What sort of a relationship will there be  between the Central Bank and the finance ministry following  Boris Fedorov's resignation?    GERASHENKO: To begin with, relations between the State Bank,  the Central Bank and Finance Ministry have always been  business-like at all levels. I do not think there was anything  unusual in my relations with the former finance minister as far  as cooperation between the two departments is concerned. The  Bank of Russia has never tried to put a spoke in anyone's wheel.  On the contrary, we met with senior Finance Ministry officials  at the end of last year to stabilize money supply.    As for the differences we had, this must be seen as a normal  thing in any country with a compounded economic, social and  political situation. The fact that this should have been leaked  to the press or become the subject of formal and informal  conversations is not our own fault.    As for Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin, he is a  newcomer in the ministry but I have known him as deputy chairman  of the state committee for CIS economic cooperation. I know him  as pragmatist who has always looked for optimal solutions to any  deadlock relating to the country's economic situation and the  need to use austerity measures in budgetary or crediting  policies. We have never had any major differences. I met  Dubinin more often than the minister himself, so I can see no  problems ahead.    IF: What are the main parameters of the budget for the first  quarter of this year?    GERASHENKO: There are none so far. The finance ministry has  been working hard in the past three weeks to try to cut spending  and find new sources of revenues. Its task is to try to bring  in whatever resources there are in the country but economic  methods must be used to do so. The ministry also faces the task  of resorting as less as possible to the CBR's emissions  mechanism which may cover any outstanding expenditure but step  up inflationary processes.    IF: During a recent visit to Orel (Central Russia) together  with the Prime Minister, you mentioned about Rbl 4 Tn worth of  "free money" accumulated by the commercial banks. Will the  government try to bring it into play, do you think?    GERASHENKO: This can be done only on a voluntary basis. In  fact, commercial banks are in need of incentives to invest into  the vital sectors if the economy is to survive as a whole.  These include tax benefits or interest rate subsidies. With  the interest rate such as it is now, there can be no question of  investments. What is needed is full confidence that the  government economic policy approved by parliament will ensure  support to key sectors such as energy, transport and housing  construction. That is, investments by the commercial banks must  to an extent be guaranteed by the country's economic policy  itself.    A clear signal must be sent to the private sector that the  government has serious plans of developing a securities market,  especially government bonds. Similar bonds can be issued by  first rate companies involved in key sectors designed to ensure  the country's survival. A commercial bank must be assured that  government or company securities can help it survive in the  event of liquidity with the help from the Central Bank. The CBR  must, as it were, promise to play the role of a secondary  market. But this is something unknown in this country, so the  details will have to be worked out together with IMF experts.    IF: What do make of media allegations saying the key  reformists were dropped out of the cabinet following last  month's government reshuffle?    GERASHENKO: I do not hold with such assertions at all  because  the need for government reforms arose back in the mid- 1970s  when most of its members must have been post graduates.  Unfortunately, the then government was not ready for such  reforms which were delayed for 12 years at least. In fact, the  policy of reforms started in 1987 and the main dispute is about  methods and timing rather than strategic goals.    I cannot say the government has been reformed. The cabinet  was trimmed down, especially in the number of Vice-Premiers, on  a proposal from Boris Fedorov himself. Generally speaking, I  think Gaydar and Fedorov resigned for entirely different reasons  though using a similar smokescreen.    IF: In his speech at Orel, Chernomyrdin made it clear the  Rbl  4 Tn debt to the defence and farming sectors would have to be  repaid. In what way is this likely to affect the budget?    GERASHENKO: This is something that Russia's freedom loving  press is reluctant to write about. The huge debt owed to the  defence and farming sectors is left over by the finance ministry  last year. This also includes salaries to the non-industrial  sector comprising teachers, physicians, the army, the police and  so on. Such things must be taken very seriously. I think that  as a good professional, Boris Fyodorov is well aware of the  difficulties facing the country in the first quarter of this  year and throughout 1994 as a whole. I think Fedorov is partly  trying to pull off a face-saving exercise.    IF: But the Rbl 4 Tn debt will have to be repaid after all.    GERASHENKO: The question is how to extend the schedule of  repayment. Some of the debt will have to be repaid now to help  to break the chain of mass defaults and raise some revenues.  But the rest of it will have to be suspended to avert excessive  money supply in the first quarter of the year. This is a  formidable task.    The CBR is in search of new ways to break the deadlock  including the issue of securities or orientating the resources  of all sorts of funds. Regrettably, the existing legislation  does not provide for such eventualities apart from distributing  credits among commercial structures. In the meantime, their  resources are at risk because of a certain threat of bankruptcy.</p>

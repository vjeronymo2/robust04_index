			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: LIMA;  </P> <P> ROUND 2 IN PERU  </P> <P> Peruvians elect their next president Sunday, and the winner is certain to be a  man making his first run for public office.  </P> <P> Agronomist and university administrator Alberto Fujimori, a centrist with  vaguely defined proposals for economic reform, is the surprise front-runner in  the two-man runoff ballot. Famed novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, offering a more  detailed -- and harsher -- program for a pure free-market economy, is trailing  in the polls but narrowing the gap.  </P> <P> Whoever wins will confront galloping inflation, a leftist guerrilla war, abuses  of human rights and widespread coca cultivation in the jungle interior.  </P></p>

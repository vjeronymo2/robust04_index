			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (2): Industrial clean-up on a grand scale - Ruhr Valley becomes a world centre for developing environmental technologies WITH 2,300 enterprises involved in environmental technologies, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia is home to 25 per cent of all German companies working in this sector. Two-thirds of these businesses are located in the Ruhr itself - and a third of them were launched within the last 10 years. For Mr Klaus Matthiesen, environment minister for North Rhine-Westphalia, this development is a good indication of the way Ruhr industry is being restructured. 'Our concern for the environment is a major factor in creating new jobs,' he says. More than 150,000 people now work in environment-related industries. The Ruhr has proved to be a leading area for companies wanting to diversify into environmental technology. According to Mr Matthiessen, DM6bn will have been invested by 4,500 companies in the region to meet environmental air standards alone, between 1990 and 1994. This follows DM13bn invested in clean air technology between 1983 and 1989 when the level of dioxide emissions in the region was cut by 80 per cent. With three times the population density of other German states and the largest concentration of heavy industries in Europe, North Rhine-Westphalia has been at the forefront new environmental standards in Germany. Much remains to be done to make the Ruhr a clean place, however. There are still 3,500 abandoned industrial sites which are thought to be polluted. But great progress has been achieved over the last 20 years - 'the bulk of the cleaning-up in the Ruhr is done,' says Mr Mattiesen. 'The market created by strict environmental standards has fostered an industry which, today, is at the leading edge of environmental technology.' 'Efforts are now focussed on pollution prevention, rather than just repairing past damage.' Investment in clean-up projects reached a peak in 1987-88. Companies in the region anticipate big opportunities for exporting environmental equipment and services. The Ruhr is home to some of the largest names in the business, including Thyssen, Babcock and Steinmuller. Thyssen, for example, achieved sales of nearly DM2bn in 1991-1992 with products and services for reducing pollutants. Its subsidiary, Thyssen Engineering, makes equipment for desulphurisation and the removal of nitrogen in power plants and garbage incinerators. Thyssen Sonnenberg has been active in recycling activites, including the running of one of the largest shredder plants for scrap metal in Germany. Babcock has also been a leading player in the sector for 25 years, having installed dozens of waste incineration plants across the country. Meanwhile, new projects are under way which will strengthen the Ruhr as a leading centre for environmental technology. For example, in Duisburg, in the heart of the region, RWE, the German power group, plans to build one of Europe's largest waste-recycling plants. Construction begins next year and the complex could be operational by 1997. The investment, funded by RWE and Thyssen Handelsunion, is estimated at DM600bn. The aim of the two companies is to position themselves as the most cost-efficient recyclers in Germany. The project aims to take advantage of strict 'green laws' being considered by the government to force manufacturers of consumer goods to recycle most of their waste products. Clearly, this type of project is an important boost for regional subcontractors. According to Mr Michael Stock, technical director, at least 48 per cent of the investment goes to German companies while the rest is handled by foreign enterprises. However, these highly-automated plants provide relatively few jobs in the Ruhr. The entire plant will employ less than 200 people. 'Structural changes in the Ruhr won't solve the problem of unemployment from former heavy industries,' says Mr Matthiesen. 'The jobs lost in the steel mills and coal mines will not be replaced by companies producing environmental technology.' According to a study by the Westdeusche Landesbank, more than half of the environment-related companies employ less than 100 people - and 86 per cent of them have less than 500 workers. For Mr Matthiesen believes it is important that tax advantages - begun in the 1970s - are re-introduced for companies investing in cleaner industrial environments.</p>

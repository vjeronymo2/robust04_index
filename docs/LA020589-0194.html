			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS DEBATE WAYS TO REDUCE INFLUX OF ALIENS  </P> <P> The federal government, in a quandary over how to handle the massive influx of  Central Americans seeking political asylum, is debating a range of approaches,  including detention centers, Bush Administration sources said Saturday.  </P> <P> One source said that idea, which drew immediate criticism from immigrant  advocates, is at the "conservative end of the scale." At the "liberal end,"  officials within the Justice Department are advocating a special status called  extended voluntary departure that would allow the immigrants to remain in this  country until the situations in their homelands become stable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stemming Immigrant Flow  </P> <P> Also, officials said, the Administration is casting about for ways to press  Mexican officials to help stem the flow of undocumented immigrants through  Mexico en route to the United States.  </P> <P> "We're looking for Mexican help to cut them off," said an Administration  official, referring to the Central American immigrants. However, the official  acknowledged that this tack runs the risk of angering Mexicans who might view  it as intervention.  </P> <P> The other possible solutions also are fraught with problems, making the  situation a proverbial political mine field for the new Administration.  Meanwhile, a federal judge's order last week gives the government until Feb. 20  to come up with a way to handle the continuing flow of immigrants.  </P> <P> The Immigration and Naturalization Service reports that since July, 30,000  Central Americans -- about half of them Nicaraguans -- have poured across the  border into Texas. Activists say the focus on Texas is causing immigrants to  turn increasingly to other routes. Once in the country, most of the immigrants  disperse to Florida and California, with a sizable number settling here in the  nation's capital.  </P> <P> What the Administration will do to handle the continuing influx "is still up in  the air," said Loye Miller, director of public affairs at the Justice  Department. "It's a damn tough problem."  </P> <P> For the last seven months, immigrants from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala  and Honduras have fled their homelands in increasing numbers, joining hundreds  of thousands already here. They enter this country mainly through South Texas  and seek political asylum on grounds that they have a "well-founded fear" of  persecution in their war-torn home countries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Judge Stays INS Rule  </P> <P> The INS, asserting that almost all such claims from Central Americans are  frivolous, last December issued rules that made the immigrants wait at the  point of entry while their claims were processed. In Brownsville, Tex., last  Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela issued a 20-day stay of the INS rule,  making it possible for the immigrants to apply for asylum any place in the  nation and avoid the possibility of being trapped in squalid camps in South  Texas.  </P> <P> At the same time, the judge indicated that he is likely to allow the INS to  begin holding immigrants in South Texas when the order expires in less than  three weeks, saying the INS was within the law in issuing the rule last  December.  </P> <P> Even if the judge sides with them, INS officials realize they must find a way  to handle the huge numbers of immigrants who would be concentrated in the  Brownsville area.  </P> <P> "Putting up some kind of detention centers (in the border areas) addresses the  issue of meeting their human needs," one Administration official said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seen Violating Spirit of Law  </P> <P> But the lingering criticism of the federal policy that put Cuban and Haitian  immigrants in such centers after their arrival in 1980 weighs heavily against  the plan. "The notion of alien detention centers on U.S. soil is disturbing  because it violates the spirit if not the letter of the Refugee Act of 1980,"  said Wade Henderson, associate director of the Washington office of the  American Civil Liberties Union.  </P> <P> Carmen Monico, national coordinator of the Central American Refugee Committees,  said activists would "start a campaign" to prevent the INS from operating the  centers. "We don't need more detention centers," she said. "We need a fair  refugee act, including every consideration of extended voluntary departure."  </P> <P> Over the years, this status, granted at the President's discretion, has been  applied to numerous countries deemed unstable and unsafe, revoking it when  conditions return to normal. Currently, Ethiopians, Poles and Afghans are  allowed to stay in the United States under this policy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Faces Attack From Right  </P> <P> However, the conservative Bush Administration, like Ronald Reagan's before it,  faces a barrage of criticism from the right if it offers refuge to Salvadorans  -- that would be perceived as an acknowledgement that the Salvadoran  government, a U.S. ally, is oppressive. (In 1987, then-Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese  III took steps to make it easier for Nicaraguans to obtain refugee status, but  immigrant advocates say the move was only "symbolic.")  </P> <P> The Administration's dilemma has given new hope to advocates of congressional  legislation that would halt deportations of Salvadorans and Nicaraguans for 18  months while the government studies conditions that led to their immigration.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, for President Bush, there seems no easy way out of a sticky  situation. He strains Texas tempers and resources if the immigrants are held  there. But if they are allowed to move on to Miami and Los Angeles, Floridians  and Californians complain.  </P> <P> "Bush has a tremendous following in Florida, and he's from Texas," said an  Administration official, summing up Bush's geopolitical problem.  </P></p>

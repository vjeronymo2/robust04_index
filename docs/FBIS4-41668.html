			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Nadein: "Premier Chernomyrdin's Visit </F> to the United States Went Even Better Than Expected"]    [Text] Washington -- On completing the main, Washington  section of his visit to the United states, Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin described it as extremely  successful, and the figures bear out this assessment.  <H5>  The Visit in Figures </H5>   $400 million is the cost of the joint work on a space  station. U.S. Vice President Al Gore said at a press conference  on Thursday that Russian participation will make the project  "better, cheaper, and quicker." Stressing another aspect,  Viktor Chernomyrdin said that Russians "are not doing anyone  favors," inasmuch as we have managed to get a decent price for  our endeavors. But the main point clearly is that money to keep  our space industry as a going concern will continue to come in  from the United States.    The overall cost of the project, according to the  pessimists,  is $30 billion. The pessimists in the House of Representatives  numbered 215 -- that's a pretty large number, but it was one  less than the optimists, and that proved sufficient for the  project to start to implemented.    $820 million is the promised and repromised money for  systemic transformations which was allocated Russia in Tokyo one  year ago, but it has all been deferred because of inflation and  delays with reforms. The World Bank is now granting the money  and promises to allocate even more -- all of it, of course, has  to be repaid.    The IMF has allocated $300 for highway repairs, $200 million  for the development of Russian banks, $240 million for private  farms, and $80 million for measures connected with land reform.  Is it necessary to remind people that the IMF -- a purely  commercial organization -- grants money for projects which it  regards as promising and will recover it all with interest -- by  hook or by crook.    These are all sizable figures, but they are not the biggest.  That comes next.  <H5>  $9 billion and 10 Affable Jews </H5>   The Russian premier began his stay in Washington with a  problem that he had never dealt with in his life and ended it  with a matter that he has dealt with throughout his life. It is  rare occurrence when such diverse questions are so closely  linked.    The premier began his visit with a meeting with leaders of  American Jewry. This happened immediately after his arrival --  this meeting, which was certainly scheduled in advance, was not  announced on the itinerary of the visit and was known to only a  very restricted circle of people in the embassy.    During the course of the 90-minute meeting the 10 delegates  from the National Conference on Soviet Jewry asked the head of  government the most varied questions connected with the  emigration of fellow-Jews who want to leave Russia and with  ensuring a decent life for those who wish to remain there.    Viktor Chernomyrdin showed patience, gave exhaustive  answers, and was well disposed toward them. He gave assurances  regarding the small number of refuseniks (less than a dozen) who  have not obtained the right to leave because of their access,  according to the Russian authorities, to state secrets. He  outlined a government program to combat anti-Semitism. He  promised close cooperation wiith Israel's ministries of culture  and national education [as published] in drawing up appropriate  programs in Russia.    In short, the premier so pleased his interlocutors that they  promised him their full support and subsequently themselves  telephoned various news agencies to ensure that they reflected  the deep satisfaction felt by these influential representatives  of an influential community at their meeting with the premier of  the new Russia.    A meeting immediately followed with former Congressman  Vanik,  coauthor with legislator Jackson, now deceased, of the  well-known amendment which bears their names. The Jackson-Vanik  Amendment, which became law at the height of the Cold War,  forbids the granting of most-favored nation status to a country  where human rights are violated in the form of people being  prevented from leaving the state.    Given that it is not difficult to leave Russia now, the  codrafter of the law recognized it was obsolete. As a  high-ranking member of the delegation reported, "Vanik said that  he now regrets having proposed such a law."    Although there is more politeness than truth in that remark,  the problem is now becoming both more serious and bizarre.    If present-day Russia maintains its course, the U.S.  president will certainly extend most-favored nation status each  year. This will virtually have no effect on many kinds of  commercial exchange.    However, ultralarge, long-term investment becomes a  top-level  matter so long as the amendment is not repealed. No one wants  to risk many billions of dollars which may turn a profit only  after decades. The advent of a new government -- and not just  in Russia but in the United States too -- becomes potentially  dangerous.    It is very difficult to change laws in America. It is  difficult to pass them. It is difficult to repeal them.  Thousands of proposed amendments remain simply vain endeavors,  mustering just one or two votes.    But laws are repealed by the same procedure. And that is why  Viktor Chernomyrdin needs not just the sympathy but the active  help of the Jewish community in the United States to repeal the  Jackson-Vanik Amendment. The community put immense effort into  getting it passed at the time. Today the Russian premier,  acting in a completely new sphere for him, is doing his utmost  to ensure that the Jews of America help Moscow, as they did  during War II.    The delegates of the Jewish community promised to do this  after their uplifting meeting with him, which is why the work  with which Chernomyrdin has been professionally occupied all his  life has now become realizable in practice.    During his last visit here last September the Russian  premier, who is a gas and oil industry man by profession,  devoted a lot of time to the Marathon Oil company. This oil  concern -- a pretty major company, albeit not a giant -- enjoyed  his special attention during his visit to Houston, Texas. Some  Russian experts claimed at the time that Marathon was developing  a very profitable project for Russia involving work at Sakhalin.    Marathon has now become the leading company in the Sakhalin  Energy Investment consortium, which is investing #9 billion in  developing the Sakhalin shelf, with its rich reserves of oil and  natural gas.    In the opinion of experts from the Chernomyrdin-Gore group,  total U.S. investment, which now stands at approximately $1  billion, will grow to $40-50 billion by the end of the decade.    True to himself, the prime minister preferred to talk about  the economy, but you can't escape politics in his job.  Moreover, the meeting with Clinton took place the day after the  signing of the agreement with NATO in Brussels -- you couldn't,  in general, devise a better situation.    But the premier himself has been persistent in creating an  atmosphere of openness, friendship, and understanding that a  partner has national interests; and most importantly, whether  assenting or dissenting, he has sought to speak the same  language in both politics and economics.    Only one sticky moment arose. On Thursday, from early  morning on, all Washington political circles were discussing an  article in THE NEW YORK TIMES claiming that the Russian  Government is not providing full information on work on chemical  weapons, that is to say, improvement of binary gases is  continuing, and that the revelations by the chemist Vil  Mirzoyanov, whom the Russian authorities -- with staggering  clumsiness -- tried to imprison, are confirmed by other sources  at CIA and military department level.    Nevertheless, CIA Director R. James Woolsey and Joint Chiefs  of Staff Chairman Shalikashvili advised the legislators to  ratify the treaty on the prohibition of chemical weapons. And  although doubts among the congressmen are considerable, the  majority do seem inclined to ratify it if Russia is more frank  and honest in furnishing information.    Whether Chernomyrdin failed to be briefed by his aides or  whether he himself failed to pay heed (perhaps out of dear  Moscow habit he thought it doesn't matter what they write in the  newspapers there), his answer at the press conference was  brusque but unconvincing: This is all nonsense born of utter  ignorance.    That may be the case, of course. However, in America they  have somehow gotten used to the idea that if THE NEW YORK TIMES,  the CIA, and the Defense Department make a claim it is better to  attempt to rebut it with more proof and less emotion.    Vice President Al Gore hurried to help out his colleague and  cochairman, suggesting that in Moscow, unlike Washington, the  top leaders don't have time to read the newspapers first thing  in the morning.    But that was merely a sideshow. On the whole, the current  premier, who, even one year ago frightened capitalist-raised  kids here, has proved to be fully deserving of the assessments  which World Bank President Jacques Camdessus [name and title as  published] brought back from Moscow in the spring.    In a number of interviews and private discussions Jacques  Camdessus expressed complete satisfaction at not just his week  spent in Moscow but -- most importantly -- the approach to the  economic realities by the Russian premier himsslf.    Camdessus would most likely not have experienced such a  happy  shock had Gaydar still been in that high post. They had  probably not expected from Chernomyrdin such commitment to tough  monetarist policy, steadfastness in pursuing a market course, or  readiness to crush all who stand in the way of the country's  financial recovery. Had Camdessus understood the real meaning  of the Soviet expression "our man," he might well have used it.    The World Bank president's views had merely grown stronger  by  the time of Viktor Chernomyrdin's arrival. Demonstrating in  every possible way his support for Russia (for lack of which he  severely criticized Vice President Al Gore and Deputy Secretary  of State Strobe Talbott), he said that Russia "is making  determined efforts in favor of reforms and stabilizations."    Reflecting the growing opinion here that Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin has serious chances of becoming Boris Yeltsin's  successor, the U.S. vice president said: "Mr. Chernomyrdin is a  tremendous leader of Russia as regards the active implementation  of reforms."    Relations between our countries do not simply develop  dynamically, they also have their ups and their downs. It now  looks as if the latest up following a down has begun. All 22 of  the documents prepared in advance have been signed, including  those regarding whose prospects very serious misgivings had been  voiced.    For example, the treaty stopping the manufacture of  plutonium  looked to have slim chances of survival. Russia demanded  compensation, the United States did not understand why, strictly  speaking, it should pay, given that it is doing the same thing  back home on a reciprocal basis.    They have agreed to an apparently strange compromise. The  treaty was signed not by ministers, as envisaged, but at a  higher level -- by Chernomyrdin and Gore. The United States  won't give money for the shutdown of production. However, it  will allocate $1 million for research work in two Russian  scintific research institutes.    Of course, no single meeting clears up absolutely  everything.  The problems of chemical weapons remain for Naples, where Boris  Yeltsin will go to talk with the G-7 leaders. Decisions are  still awaited on the question of NATO, nearby foreign parts,  peacemaking efforts, and so forth, on which neither side has  given an exhaustive answer to date. And this is unlikely to  emerge by September, when Boris Yeltsin will be coming to the  United States.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / PIA kicks off by seeking financial views An extensive programme of consultation with the financial services industry is being planned by the Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog to protect the private investor which becomes operational today. In the coming months the PIA will ask for views on a range of issues, such as the registering of all individuals who work in retail financial services, and training and competence requirements. Starting work against a background of suspicion and reluctance even among some of the 3,500-plus organisations which have applied to join, the PIA believes that relations with those it regulates will have to be an important, continuing element of its work. At the same time, it knows it must not become so close to the industry that it forfeits people's confidence in financial regulation, instead of reinforcing it. Some of the issues on which the PIA is planning to consult are inherited from the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, and the existing regulators for the life insurance industry and independent financial advisers, which the PIA is replacing. Others have arisen from the wider debate generated by the controversy the PIA has aroused. The most immediate issues are consultation about how companies and individuals should disclose on their stationery and advertising that they come under the new regulator, and the timescale on which this changeover should take place. A more substantive task is devising and consulting on the PIA's own training and competence proposals. The setting up of a register of all individuals working in retail financial services, one of the recommendations of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs, is also to be pursued quickly - with a consultative paper in the autumn, and the prospect of implementation in the course of next year. The PIA will consult in the autumn on extensions to the new regime for giving customers more information about financial products. This regime will come into effect on January 1, and work is in hand to try to ensure that it could apply then, not just to life insurance and investment products as already planned, but also to unit trusts. Separately, the regulator will seek views on extending the disclosure requirements to term assurance, policies concerned solely with protection against particular contingencies and not with investment. Perhaps the most difficult issue facing the PIA will be the work it takes over from the SIB in ensuring that compensation is paid to anyone who has been disadvantaged by following poor advice to take out a personal pension. Ms Colette Bowe, PIA chief executive, said yesterday: 'Our main work in the months ahead is to build public confidence in the industry we regulate. We have big tasks to carry out in disclosure, training and competence and our ongoing work of monitoring and supervision.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] South Korea's Kim Dae-chung, currently visiting  Manila, believes a unified Korea will be beneficial not only for  Koreans but for the people in the Asia-Pacific Region as well.    In yesterday's press conference at the Shangri-la Edsa Plaza  Hotel, he discussed his recommendation to consider a  "`negotiating package' to overcome the current nuclear stalemate  and regain momentum for a gradual and controlled three-stage  process for Korean unification."    He said the North Korean nuclear program threatens security  and peace in the region, and suggested a base on which peaceful  reunification of the Korean Peninsula can take place.    His "negotiating package" calls for the United States'  recognition of North Korea "as a legitimate member of the world  community" and for the establishment of diplomatic and economic  relations between the two countries.    He also reiterated that the "Team Spirit" military exercise  in South Korea needs to be suspended or better yet abolished.    On the other hand, North Korea should accept International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections, abandon its nuclear  ambition, and stop any hostile policy against Seoul.    He also presented his proposed model of gradual  reunification  which needs to be achieved through three peaceful principles of  coexistence.    Stage one is the "confederation of two independent  governments, where each maintains authority in foreign affairs,  national defense, and internal administration." Among its  features is the equal number of representatives from each  government to the Korean Republics and the consensus needed  before any measure is passed. The confederation would aim to  achieve the principles of peaceful coexistence, peaceful  exchange, and peaceful reunification.    The second stage is the Korean federal system which is  composed of two local governments given autonomy on internal  matters but where foreign affairs and national defense are the  responsibility of a federal government.    Stage three will be complete reunification which he believes  may be more than a decade away.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 30 (CNA) -- Taiwan will seek to sign a  multilateral government procurement agreement in line with the  Uruguay Round codes of the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT) sometime next year, the Council for Economic  Planning and Development (CEPD) said Saturday [30 April].    But, the council noted, Taiwan hopes to follow the example  set by Hong Kong and South Korea to postpone acting on the new  government procurement agreement until 1996.    Previously, Taiwan rejected the agreement because of the  great number of state organizations which would be affected. It  now needs to sign the accord in order to facilitate its entry  into GATT.    Taiwan was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and  hopes to become a full member by the end of this year and before  GATT is superseded by the World Trade Organization.    CEPD Vice Chairman Hsueh Chi said that the council will  establish a task force to overhaul Taiwan's government  procurement practices to come into line with the GATT  requirements.    Dozens of rules and regulations concerning government  procurement will be revised and updated, Hsueh said. In  addition, he said, the base price for open tenders will be  lowered and all the bidding procedures will be completely open  and transparent.    When the domestic government procurement market begins to  open, he noted, the government will seek to exclude the  International Telecommunications Administration, Taiwan Power  Company, Chinese Petroleum Corp., and China Steel Corp. from the  agreement.    Abrupt market opening might trigger unfair competition and  thus adversely affect these state-run companies in view of  Taiwan's weak competitiveness in power, telecommunications,  energy, and steel, he explained.</p>

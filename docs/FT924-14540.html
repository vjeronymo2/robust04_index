			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: BNP disappoints with fall of 13.4% in first half BANQUE Nationale de Paris (BNP) yesterday added to the stream of disappointing interim results from France's big banks by announcing a fall in first-half profits. BNP, like other French banks, was affected in the first half both by economic slowdown and by the need to raise provisions, mainly because of the depressed French property market. Net profits fell by 13.4 per cent to FFr1.33bn (Dollars 271m) in the first six months of this year from FFr1.54bn in the corresponding 1991 period. Mr Rene Thomas, chairman, commented that banking had become 'a dangerous business' in the uncertain economic climate. The French banking sector, in which BNP is the third-largest, has become increasingly competitive. The market is overcrowded and relatively high French interest rates in the late 1980s and early 1990s has dampened demand for consumer and corporate credit. BNP has been in the vanguard of the attempts by French banks to improve their competitiveness. It managed to contain the increase in its own overheads to just 1.9 per cent in the first half - with FFr13.88bn, against FFr13.61bn in the first six months of 1991 - thanks to cost controls. The increase in BNP's costs was below both France's annual inflation rate - at around 3 per cent - and its 3.3 per cent increase in first-half net banking income to FFr19.48bn from FFr18.86bn. As a result, operating profits rose by 6.8 per cent to FFr5.61bn from FFr5.25bn. But BNP was forced to raise provisions by 13.6 per cent to FFr4.11bn from FFr3.62bn because of the economic slowdown on its property holdings and corporate loans. Mr Thomas warned the situation was unlikely to improve in the second half. BNP is the latest French bank to report a drop in interim profits. Credit Lyonnais just managed to break even, after a hefty rise in provisions. Banque Indosuez was in a similar situation and Paribas only avoided a dramatic decline in its interim profits though the proceeds of its disposal programme. Credit Local de France (CLF), the French bank which last autumn became the first candidate for the government's partial privatisation programme, expects to increase net profits by up to 10 per cent this year, according to Mr Pierre Richard, chairman. CLF recently bucked the trend in French banking by announcing a 6 per cent rise in net profits to FFr663.9m.</p>

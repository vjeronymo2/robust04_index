			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Italy ends crisis over PM: Amato asked to form government after Craxi steps aside PRESIDENT Oscar Luigi Scalfaro last night announced that he would formally invite Mr Giuliano Amato, a former Socialist finance minister, to be the 51st Italian prime minister since the war. A seemingly impossible deadlock over the choice of a new prime minister following the April 5 election was unblocked yesterday morning when Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, agreed to withdraw his candidature for the premiership. In stepping down, Mr Craxi proposed three fellow Socialists who were considered more likely to gain the support of possible coalition partners. Mr Amato, a law professor and highly respected in parliament as a senior member of the Socialist Party, was from the outset the most likely candidate once Mr Craxi withdrew. Mr Amato is in charge of a special party commission looking into the Milan municipal corruption scandal. Though using guarded language, Mr Scalfaro made it clear that the next prime minister would need to reflect the reality of the large protest vote against the coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals in the April 5 election. The candidate also had to reflect the need for clean government in the wake of the corruption scandals. President Scalfaro is also anxious to see a slimmed down government and the likely emphasis will be on technical competence rather than party loyalty. This effectively excluded Mr Craxi, who based his election campaign on a renewal of the four-party coalition and whose image has been damaged by his links to party members involved in the Milan scandal. It was not clear whether Mr Craxi decided to stand down on his own initiative or was persuaded to do so by Mr Scalfaro. Mr Craxi, prime minister from 1983 to 1987, had assumed before the elections he would get the job, backed by the Christian Democrats. Until now he has insisted on being the Socialists' candidate for the premiership despite growing dissent within the party and lukewarm support from the Christian Democrats. His insistence also blocked much-needed support from the small Republican party or the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The immediate Christian Democrat reaction was favourable. The party has recognised that, with one of their number newly elected as president, a likely balance was a Socialist prime minister. Equally important, the PDS appeared willing to back a Socialist prime minister and shifted the emphasis to the nature of the next government's programme. A prominent Socialist in northern Italy Renato Amorese, killed himself after going to see authorities investigating a major city hall corruption scandal in Milan, police said yesterday.

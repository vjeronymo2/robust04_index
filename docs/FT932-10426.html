			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Markets: Local boy makes good: official - London The FT has received the following transcript, which appears to be a speech by a local dignitary in a small town in northern Cyprus. FELLOW Citizens, we gather today to welcome back to his homeland our country's most distinguished businessman, Mr Asil Nadir. His return fills our hearts with joy. Yet again we have triumphed over the bungling and incompetence of our former colonial oppressors. It is splendidly ironic that Asil Nadir's persecutors should carry the name of the Serious Fraud Office, when the world knows they are about as serious as the Keystone Kops. It would be wrong to let this occasion pass, however, without devoting a few moments' thought to the deeper issues that underlie Asil's presence here among us. I refer, of course, to the lamentable performance of the London stock market. Not only has the Pounds 2bn at which Polly Peck was valued in 1990 disappeared into thin air - something which can only be attributed to the machinations of those faceless conspirators known as 'the institutions' - but there have also been more recent unhappinesses. Since the beginning of the year, shares in Spring Ram have dropped by 35 per cent, those of Fisons by 31 per cent, and those of Tiphook by 30 per cent, to mention only three of the worst performers among that rogues gallery known as the FT-SE Actuaries 350. All three of these have undergone misfortunes of various sorts - accounting upsets at Spring Ram, continued product problems at Fisons, and accusations that there might have been insider trading in the run-up to a profits warning by Tiphook. To us, perhaps, those are little-known companies in a far-off land. Others, however, with reputations that extend as far as Larnaca, have also suffered: Glaxo is down 25 per cent, Boots down 22 per cent and Sainsbury down 20 per cent. This has happened at a time when the random ragbag of numbers which pass for British official statistics has indicated an end to the recession of which Asil Nadir was so prominent a victim. It is scarcely surprising, perhaps, that our brother Asil chose to turn his back on Britain in the week when the FT-SE 100 index has dropped another 26.8 points, falling on three successive days, to close the week at 2793.7, only 3 per cent higher than a year ago. Nor is that all. Sterling, which managed a pitiable recovery from its lows of late February, has failed to make a decisive crossing of the DM2 50 level. As you know, London is a primitive place, where the necromancers they call currency analysts are given a credence way beyond their predictive powers. We know better than to trust such foolishness. But for what it is worth, some of these soothsayers now believe that sterling's forward momentum has faded, and that the prospects of further appreciation are limited, in the short term at least. Similarly, long-term interest rates have continued to rise. The yield on the 10-year government bonds known by the sadly tarnished name of 'gilts' is still 8.08 per cent, showing only the most minuscule improvement over the previous week. The outlook for short term interest rates is also uncertain, with many people fearing that a summer pickup in inflation may force a rise, even though such rates are falling elsewhere in Europe. Perhaps the dire performance of the Major puppet regime in Thursday's so-called council elections will lead the government instead into a panic rush to cut rates in the next few weeks; we shall see. Note the way in which London share prices have broken away from the pattern established in Wall Street, that far more important market across the sea. Since late April, US share prices have moved upwards; those in the UK have resolutely refused to take such a path, continuing the scarcely broken downtrend established in early March. In short, our brother Asil has little to regret in his heroic decision to leave a place that has caused him so much pain. Still, many of our fellow-countrymen remain trapped there, often by mortgages worth more than the north London houses on which they are secured. Alas, that imprisonment may linger. This week, I fear, has seen some signs that UK inflation may not rise as much as our imprisoned mortgage-holders might wish. One such example: sun-cream, that vital commodity to all who visit our beautiful beaches, has become the subject of a price war between Boots, which supplies 47 per cent of UK demand, and Superdrug, which is prepared to surrender some profit in order to gain market share. Similarly, Direct Line, the Royal Bank of Scotland's low-cost insurance subsidiary, is taking its own price-war into other sectors of financial services. As long as such battles are at work, UK inflationary pressures are likely to remain lower than desired by those of our compatriots with mortgages to repay. We salute our comrades, hostages to the British disinflationary process. And we express solidarity with all other such hostages, including those shareholders trapped by the forced levy known as the 'rights issue'. Yet again this week, innocent law-abiding citizens, wishing nothing more than to enjoy their dividends in peace, have been forced to send cash the other way, contributing Pounds 404m at the metaphorical equivalent of gunpoint to Royal Insurance's coffers. A further such ransom demand is on its way from Zeneca, the ICI subsidiary. Is this fair, fellow citizens? It is not. Surely, Asil Nadir deserves our praise and admiration for so decisively rejecting the tired mores of a discredited mercantile clique. We cheer his return among us, to enjoy in peace the fruits of his labours in foreign fields. Brother Asil, welcome home]</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Medeva shares hit by profits warning MEDEVA, a rapidly growing UK-based drugs company, yesterday saw its stock market value collapse from Pounds 589m to Pounds 316m after it issued a profits warning. Mr Bernard Taylor, chairman, said pre-tax profits for 1993 would be about Pounds 10m below market expectations of Pounds 53m-Pounds 57m. In exceptionally heavy selling, Medeva's shares lost nearly half their value, falling from 216p to 116p. Investors were most disturbed by news that Medeva had closed MD Pharmaceutical, a US subsidiary making amphetamines, for two weeks to comply with operational changes required by the Food and Drug Administration. Mr Taylor said Medeva did not know when the FDA would determine whether the changes made were adequate. Medeva's share price collapse came less than three months after the group raised Pounds 94m in a rights issue at 180p. That cash call helped fund an acquisition in Germany but also repaid debt and gave Medeva a war chest with which it had hoped to make further acquisitions up to a value of Pounds 100m. Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, managing director and architect of Medeva's rapid growth since it came to the stock market in 1987, said there was nothing wrong with the strategy to expand by acquisition rather than drug companies' more conventional route of research and development. 'The company is still on track to increase profits this year,' he said. 'We are still en route to being one of the most successful companies in corporate British history.' The bulk of the problems arose at IMS, a Californian subsidiary that makes drug delivery systems such as plastic tubes. It was acquired for Dollars 29m in June 1992. Medeva said it discovered last week that stock levels at the warehouses of independent wholesalers had doubled since the acquisition. Stock reduction and lower production levels for the rest of the year meant IMS would be unlikely to make a profit in 1993. Medeva bought IMS for a drug used to treat heart attack victims, which it hopes will soon receive FDA approval. Mr Taylor said the group had shut the plant at MD Pharmaceutical which makes methylphenidate, an amphetamine, to deal more easily with the FDA concerns. Mr Gowrie-Smith said the FDA had been most concerned about the way in which MD dealt with complaints and that procedures had been tightened.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From 12 January RAHVA HAAL, POSTIMEES, PAEVALEHT, </F> HOMMIKULEHT, pp 2,3]    [Text] Wednesday, January 12 -- Prime Minister Mart Laar  described the recent events as a crisis of power rather than of  government, stressing that the coalition had remained firm. He  added that the constitution is inadequately expressed and needs  a number of additional laws to guarantee the actual balance of  power.    Laar rejected the president's accusations of inopportune  moment for the reshuffle. "I consider the change of ministers a  significant factor guaranteeing Estonia's stability.  Considering the hard times ahead, we should go on with a  monolithic government which effectively cooperates with the  parliament," he said.    The prime minister admitted that the presidential speech  contained a number of correct critical points, but added that  Meri had not expressed his criticism so directly at the previous  meetings. Laar also stressed that the government had been  paying "constant attention" to the infiltration of the Russian  capital into Estonia.    "Fatherland" faction chairman Tiit Sinissaar described the  accusations as surprising and questioned the arguments used by  the president. Deputy faction chairman Kalle Jurgenson stressed  that the "Fatherland" sees no reasons for the resignation of the  prime minister.    "Fatherland" MP [member of parliament] Mart Nutt and  Moderate  Vello Saatpalu stressed that Estonia is a parliamentary state  and the president exceeded his authority. Centrist Andra  Veidemann described the situation and the presidential  expression of no confidence to the prime minister as  "interesting and unprecedented". Coalition Party MP Ulo Vooglaid  expressed his surprise and delight at the president's frank and  honest analysis of the critical problems.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Books: Obsessed with truth and falsity - AC Grayling reviews an unreasonable book VOLTAIRE'S BASTARDS by John Ralston Saul Sinclair-Stevenson, Pounds 20 640 pages WESTERN civilisation is in crisis, says John Ralston Saul, because we believe in reason. We live in thrall to a Utopian ideal of rational society, first mooted by Enlightenment thinkers in the 18th century; but the result, contrary to Voltaire's hopes, has not liberated humanity but enslaved it to a bureaucratic corporatism which stumbles, unconstrained by moral purpose, from one disaster to another. Saul's thesis is that Enlightenment philosophers sought to rescue people from the arbitrariness of royal or priestly power and to replace it by the rule by reason. But their dream collapsed because of reason's own limitations. All that happened was an increase in influence of technical elites. The world, in short, became the fiefdom of managers. Owners of capital do not control capital; voters do not control politics; everything is run by managers who alone know how to manipulate the structural complexities of society. And the managers' goals - profits, election victories - are not shaped by morality. This technocratic corporatism applies as much to the recently-collapsed Eastern bloc as it does to the West. Indeed the East-West distinction, like that between Left and Right, is not a real distinction at all, Saul argues, but a fiction of the managerial strategy by which the Age of Reason sustains itself. Simply by listing the problems of contemporary civilisation anyone can make telling points. Saul does so eloquently enough. Politicians, he reminds us, get away with speaking literal nonsense because what counts is the manner, not the content, of their utterances. Governments brazenly continue despite their failures, because the concept of responsibility no longer applies. Television, advertising and the worship of artificial heroes like soap-opera stars blind people to the world predicament. These phenomena and many besides, are symptoms of deep malaise. Worse still are such examples as the arms trade, encouraged by governments which make pious pronouncements about peace and freedom, but which subvert both by their participation in gun-running. And this is only part of a story in which military establishments flourish, drunk on obsessions with management and technology; and in which most parts of the world are perennially engulfed in war. Although Saul's compendium of problems contains nothing new, his restatement of them serves to keep us alert. But he misdiagnoses the source of the problems, and has an unfortunate propensity to overstate them: with the result that his book quickly becomes tiresome and implausible - tiresome because of its monotone of complaint and disparagement, and implausible because it lays all the blame on one ill-defined abstraction, 'reason'. At first Saul claims that reason cannot be defined, and then proceeds to define it. Reason is, he says, an obsession with truth and falsity. It is also an obsession with efficiency. It expresses itself in 'control of structures' and as the technique of finding 'simple and absolute' solutions to problems. It is essentially technocratic. Worst of all it is amoral and blind. This is illustrated by the fact that 'the murder of six million Jews was a perfectly rational act.' It has led to managers, corporatism, and almost everything objectionable in recent history. These claims are of a piece with much of Saul's discussion, which is too often superficial and general. His chief mistake is to blame an abstraction; his second is anyway to misunderstand its nature. Blame for the world problems rests not with a concept but with people. Reason is merely an instrument which, correctly employed, helps people draw inferences from given premisses without inconsistency. Choosing sound premises is what matters, and it is solely a human responsibility. Blaming 'reason' is as meaningful as blaming 'memory' or 'perception'. It was the racism of Nazis, not the logic they applied to put their hatred into effect, which caused the Holocaust. Can Saul mean that the use of reason is bad without qualification? I imagine him at a word-processor, answering the telephone, taking antibiotics for his sore throat, flipping switches to get warmth and light as cold night falls. Are all these products of reason contemptible? The muddle in Saul's thinking appears when we examine his alternative. Early on he says the opponent of reason is 'reasonableness', which 'practical humanists' like Jefferson had. This is mere word-play, if not contradiction. But at the end of the book we get a list of virtues to put in reason's place. They are 'spirit, appetite, faith, emotion, intuition, will, experience'. One immediately notes that all but the last, if ungoverned by reason, are exactly the stuff which fuels fanaticism and holy wars. Here lies the poverty of Saul's account. Indeed for all that Saul's book is long and amazingly eclectic, ranging from potted histories of Renaissance art to accounts of nights spent in the desert with guerillas (the relevance to the main theme is often opaque), it says very little.</p>

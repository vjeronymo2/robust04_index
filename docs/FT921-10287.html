			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / World Trade News: UK's cure for Moscow bread queue LONG queues for stale bread in the Soviet Union could be a thing of the past if a plan financed by the British government and UK bakeries is accepted by Moscow city council, writes Judy Dempsey. The plan, drawn up by Andersen Consulting, the London-based company, involves finding out if privatisation, a reorganisation, and an injection of capital in Moscow's 1,420 bread shops and 24 bakeries, would make bread last longer and taste nicer. A Muscovite loaf lasts a mere 12 hours. Why? 'It is not wrapped up,' said Mr Mark Aston, a partner with Andersen. 'One bakery told us that when they tried - 10 years ago - to wrap the bread, it went green. We found out the reasons. They did not bother first to cool the bread,' Mr Aston said. The other problem is that the capital's old bakeries, which together produce 2,400 tons of bread for 10m people per day, are far away from retail outlets. Andersen is recommending the setting up of private, small bakeries near residential areas. A team of UK bakers is now working in a Muscovite bakery to see how recommendations can be adapt to reality, instead of coming up with half-baked ideas.</p>

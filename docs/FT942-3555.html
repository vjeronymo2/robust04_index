			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Oriflame advances 17% to Pounds 14m - Better than expected growth in Latin America and eastern Europe Strong growth in new markets has encouraged Oriflame International, the door-to-door cosmetics group, to give shareholders their first dividend increase in four years. Oriflame accompanied this with the announcement of a 17 per cent rise to Pounds 14m in pre-tax profits for the year to March 31. Sales growth, held back by currency movements, increased by just 4 per cent to Pounds 86.7m. Mr Robert af Jochnick, chairman, said the three years of steady profits growth had left Oriflame well positioned for a dividend increase. The payment was raised 9 per cent to 8.7p for a total 8 per cent higher at 13p. Earnings were 10 per cent up at 22.4p. The shares rose 6p to close at 270p. Mr af Jochnick said Oriflame had enjoyed better than expected growth both through its own efforts in emerging markets such as Latin America, and through Oresa, its eastern European sister company. Oriflame founded Oresa three years ago to tackle the newly-opened eastern European markets. To minimalise risk, Oriflame had limited its stake to 24 per cent. The UK-quoted group receives royalties for use of the Oriflame brandname and supplies product from its Irish factory. Oresa contributed a total of Pounds 5m to overall profits last year, Mr af Jochnick said. Aco, the Swedish toiletries brand acquired in 1991, continued to exceed all expectations, Mr af Jochnick said. Sales were 9 per cent ahead in local currency, although exchange rates left the sterling contribution 5 per cent lower. Aco contributed a further Pounds 5m in profits to the overall group. The chairman said Oriflame was confident of substantial growth this year through its focus on emerging markets such as Latin America and Asia. These were showing a substantial improvement in sales for the first two months of the year, albeit from a small base. He expected emerging markets to account for about Pounds 15m of turnover by the end of the year.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Norway budget The Norwegian budget for 1993 leaves the welfare state intact but raises the deficit to a new record, Reuter reports from Oslo. Announcing a NKr49.2bn (Pounds 4.87bn) deficit, an increase of around NKr8bn over 1992, the Finance Ministry added: 'The main task now is to lay the conditions for increased employment on a permanent basis.' Total spending will rise 5.4 per cent to NKr371.8bn, relying heavily on North Sea revenues from oil and gas. Total income is forecast to rise 3.5 per cent to NKr322.6bn. Some price subsidies will be cut, saving NKr730m, and the defence budget is to be trimmed by NKr480m. GDP growth is expected to slow to 1.5 per cent next year from 2.5 per cent in 1992. The current account surplus is estimated to rise to NKr17.5bn.</p>

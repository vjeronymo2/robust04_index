			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Husni Mubarak on the 12th anniversary </F> of the liberation of Sinai; place not given--live or recorded]    [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.    Brother citizens: On this day in 1982, the great Egyptian  people achieved what is regarded as one of the great historic  events immortalized by time and thus etched forever in its  annals, alive and forever in the people's conscience, and  continue to spread their fruits and blessings everywhere until  judgment day.    This date will always remain one of Egyptian nationalism and  a symbol that embodies the people's ability to give endlessly  and its determination to sacrifice all that is dear for the sake  of our land and sovereignty and in defense of the homeland's  supreme interests and its right to live in security and peace  with other peoples and nations. This will continue to add to  humanity's assets and contribute to the process of renaissance  and progress.    This great achievement could not have come from a void nor  have happened because of any historic coincidence. It was the  logical and natural outcome of several antecedents and  successive positive events that all came together to create this  resounding victory and coordinated process that constituted a  magnificent epic the like of which history rarely hands out.    The people understood the course it had to take and set out  its supreme national interests with a clear scientific vision  that did not confuse between reality and dreams or between the  possible and the impossible. It then expressed the sincere  intention to achieve these objectives in accordance with the  right priorities and regardless of the sacrifices. The  tumultuous masses competed in the national action process with  full seriousness and commitment to the objective. Not one  Egyptian who loved his country deviated from the noble national  consensus.    With its unique sense of history and its shrewdness, the  people realized that it had no life, present, or future without  liberation of the land and honor and the retrieval of every  single inch of the sacred land of a homeland blessed by Almighty  God. It was incumbent on every Egyptian who cared deeply about  his country and its honor to regard the objective of liberation  as above all other considerations and to give it priority. No  person, regardless of his status, can have dignity if his  homeland does not hold its head high and has no dignity.    The people, who have a rich civilization, knew that the  road to liberation was difficult and bitter and that it was not  strewn with roses, rhetoric, or wishful thinking. The people  knew that the road to liberation needed constant hard work,  sweat, and tears in a solemn national procession in which wills  were united, abilities merged, and differences eliminated. Thus  it was certain that the march would continue to its triumphant  goal.    The struggling people knew that liberation could not be  achieved on one, but on several twisting paths in which decisive  military action would mingle with active political action and  where every citizen had a role to play, because the liberation  battalions were not only confined to fighting soldiers, but  included other builders of glory and civilization in every  field. The real touchstone for testing a citizen's ability to  participate is his readiness to make efforts and sacrifices  within the framework of one national structure free from  selfishness and personal interests at the expense of the  interests of the public.    Since the first spark of the liberation war in those blessed  hours of October 1973, the people realized the goal of the war.  They realized that it was not an end in and of itself, but a  means to achieve a fair and lasting peace based on the  provisions of law and legitimacy and striking a balance between  rights and various interests. Thus Egypt's noble people met the  challenge of peace with the same resolve and determination with  which they fought the glorious October war. They were not  frightened by claims about the adversary's superiority and its  great abilities and resources. They entertained no doubts about  their ability to meet the challenge. It was inevitable that  they would triumph and liberate their land and their will, the  region would witness the birth of a new age in which broad  horizons of peace would be opened, there would be coexistence,  and violence and suffering, bloodshed, and the exhaustion of  resources would end.    We place this great achievement, which the Egyptian people  attained through war, peace, and self-confidence, at the service  of peace and security for all the people of the region. We will  use this achievement to serve the fateful pan-Arab issues,  particularly the principle of total withdrawal in return for  comprehensive peace, to guarantee balanced security for all the  parties, and enhance cooperation based on acceptance and free  choice. No one should be harmed and no one coerced into  anything. There should be fruitful cooperation for the common  good.    We are following with great attention and anticipation the  ongoing talks on the various tracks. We are confident that the  people's will will prevail and triumph. We are also confident  that the differences that surface occasionally are temporary,  not an obstacle to the march of history. All the parties  realize that there is no alternative to a comprehensive and just  peace. No one can stop the current for change or tie the region  up in the shackles of subversion and stalemate. The world is  witnessing exhilarating developments and an unprecedented, great  technical revolution.    All our achievements and all the horizons that peace will  open up for other peoples with whom we share a common interest  and fate inspire us to double national work at home with firm  resolve and renewable energy, spreading glory, cultivating hope,  making progress, and opening great vistas for innovative and  creative work for every Egyptian.    The current comprehensive reconstruction and development in  the blessed land of Sinai is a good example and a true mirror of  the future throughout Egypt. It is a future full of dreams and  hopes, replete with good fortune and bounty for every hand that  lays a stone in the great building of renaissance, for every arm  that safeguards the homeland, and for every eye that guards the  country and the people's security.    May God grant success to us all. May He protect our march.  He is the best protector. May God's peace and mercy be with  you.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / GPA shelves planned preference issue GPA Group has shelved its Dollars 350m (Pounds 225.80m) convertible preference share issue which it planned to complete by the end of the year, writes Roland Rudd. Nomura International, the Japanese investment house working on the convertible, has told shareholders that GPA's failure to raise Dollars 752m from Alps2 (the securitisation of aircraft leases) means the convertible can no longer go ahead. One of GPA's biggest shareholders said: 'We have been told that the convertible has been aborted. I do not believe the group will try again to persuade shareholders to raise additional finance.' Another investor said: 'Shareholders are not willing to take part in any refinancing of the group while there is a chance than the group could be in breach of its covenants.' Nomura had hoped that 65 per cent of GPA's shareholders would make irrevocable commitments to take about two-thirds of the new shares by Wednesday. It planned to place the remaining one-third of the shares with new investors over the next week in order to launch the new share issue on November 20. However, one of GPA's financial advisers said: 'The convertible was based on a whole range of business assumptions which are no longer viable.' Nomura would find it impossible to go back to share-holders with the same plan, he added. Nomura has 1.75m GPA shares, most of which it bought at an average of Dollars 20 a share compared with the Dollars 8 conversion price of the shelved convertible. Although the investment bank is not involved in advising GPA in its talks with its banks, it hopes to continue its relationship with the group. GPA has written to its investors detailing its current financial situation. A GPA executive said yesterday the group took heart from its core leasing business which continued to perform will under Mr Phil Bolger, deputy chief executive of GPA leasing.</p>

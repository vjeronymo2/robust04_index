			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AIRPORT NOISE STRIKES WRONG CHORD;  </P> <P> LAND-USE: HOMEOWNERS SAY ORANGE COUNTY'S REFUSAL TO BUY THEM OUT MAKES IT  IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO MOVE ELSEWHERE.  </P> <P> When Mariann Towersey came to this agricultural strip near Newort Beach 10  years ago, she and her husband knew there was going to be noise from nearby  John Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> But in those days, Towersey recalls, flights were fewer and farther between,  and the commotion seemed tolerable.  </P> <P> Things today are different. Last week, as Towersey described half a decade of  battles that she has waged with the county, flights departed every few minutes,  forcing her first to shout and then wait silently, burning with anger, until  planes passed.  </P> <P> "How do you like that?" she yelled, glaring daggers at one offending Alaska  Airlines jet as it drowned all conversation. "What are we supposed to do about  that?"  </P> <P> Towersey is one of a dozen or so neighbors strung along Birch Street, a  two-lane road just beyond the end of the airport runway, who want county  officials to buy them out. So far, however, the county has been unwilling to  meet their price.  </P> <P> "We're trapped here," said resident Fred Peterson, a business teacher at  Newport-Mesa Alternative Education Center. "The county's willing to pay me  $363,000 for this place. I can't buy anything like this in Orange County for  that amount of money, so I have to sit here."  </P> <P> It's not that the county has failed to recognize noise as a problem. After a  long review of the land-use for the area in the early 1980s, the county  determined that the area around Birch Street would be more appropriate for  offices than homes.  </P> <P> The land was rezoned, and the transition took hold.  </P> <P> By most measures, it has been a rousing success. New offices are springing up  along the street, and construction is booming. County planners envision a  vibrant office park within a few years, one that works in tandem with the  expanded airport and its new opportunities for business.  </P> <P> "I really think the economic engine that is driving that area is the airport,"  said Tom Mathews, the county director of planning. "What you see out there is  really progressive."  </P> <P> But that's not a view that's widely shared on Birch Street.  </P> <P> Like his neighbors, Peterson's options are limited: He can't sell his house to  another homeowner because the area is zoned for office complexes. But his  property is too small to hold an entire office building, so he's had trouble  finding a developer willing to complete a deal for the land.  </P> <P> Peterson said he's entered into negotiations for the property five times, only  to have escrow fall through. Several doors up the street, a neighbor living  near a new construction site echoed those complaints, pointing as he did toward  the growling heavy machinery a few feet away.  </P> <P> "You think the airplanes are loud," he said. "Try living next to those."  </P> <P> The neighbors blame the delays and frustrations squarely on County Supervisor  Thomas F. Riley, saying he pursued the airport expansion with a vengeance and  ignored the plight he was creating for his constituents living in its shadow.  </P> <P> "He knows what we've been through, and he hasn't done a thing," Towersey said,  as a neighbor nodded in agreement. "We were promised that no one here would  suffer, and I blame him totally."  </P> <P> Riley said last week that he was sorry to hear of his constituents' complaints  but added that he's available to help if they want his support. "I think you  know that my door is always open," he said. "I'd be happy to hear their  complaints."  </P> <P> Some of the area residents did get out, having taken advantage of a county  purchase assurance program years ago. But even they say the process was  infuriating and left them battered.  </P> <P> "It was incredibly frustrating," said Jack Mullan, who once lived just around  the corner from the Towerseys. "I feel sorry for the people who are left.  They're getting the shaft."  </P> <P> The Towerseys agree. Their house lies in the area that the county has  identified for a reconfigured Birch Street, and a new arterial street project  would run directly across the Towerseys' property, so no developer is likely to  touch it.  </P> <P> But the county still has not funded the road project, so officials say they are  not prepared to buy out the Towerseys, at least not yet. That leaves the family  without any likely buyer, and they remain stuck for the indefinite future.  </P> <P> "At this time . . . no particular date has been established for implementation  of the (street project) improvements," according to a status report written  this week on what is known as the Mesa/Birch realignment. The report adds that  it is "not possible to put a time estimate on the implementation."  </P> <P> Mathews, citing litigation that the Towerseys have brought against the county,  declined to comment on the specifics of their case.  </P> <P> Meantime, Towersey says she's left in a home that becomes increasingly  unlivable as the airport becomes increasingly successful: The airport added  several flights a day to its expanded operations last Monday.  </P> <P> When their kitchen trash compactor recently broke, the Towerseys left it  unrepaired. Why improve a home that the family only hopes to leave? Towersey  asked.  </P> <P> "This has just gotten us so depressed," she said. "And the worst of it is that  we can't appeal to our elected officials because they're the ones behind it.  What do you do when your representative is the one torturing you?"  </P></p>

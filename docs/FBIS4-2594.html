			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 11 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam today expressed the hope that the enhancement of  cooperation between South Korea and China will promote further  development of the relations between the two countries.    Kim made the remarks when meeting with Wu Xueqian,  vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference (CPPCC), in the Presidential House here Monday [11  April].    He said that he held talks with Chinese President Jiang  Zemin  and Premier Li Peng during his recent visit to China. "We  exchanged views on bilateral relations and issues of mutual  concern. The talks are very useful," he added.    President Kim paid an official visit to China from March 26  to 30 at the invitation of President Jiang Zemin.    He noticed that great achievements have been made in China.  "I saw with my own eyes the situation of the open-door to the  outside world and the rapid economic development in Shanghai and  Tianjin."    Wu said that the establishment of diplomatic ties between  China and South Korea in August 1992 has restored long-standing  ties of the two countries in the history.    Kim's China visit has made important contributions to the  promotion of further development of the relations between the  two countries, he said.    Wu arrived here Sunday for an eight-day good-will visit at  the invitation of South Korean Foreign Minister Han Song-chu.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 10 (YONHAP) -- South Korea has  reportedly reconfirmed its policy on postponing the third round  of high-level U.S.-North Korean talks slated for March 21 in  Geneva if Pyongyang delays an inter-Korean envoy exchange by  insisting on four requirements as conditions for the exchange.    At a high-level strategic meeting presided over by Prime  Minister Yi Hoe-chang on Thursday morning, the government  discussed other measures against North Korea in the wake of  Wednesday's unsuccessful meeting on exchanging envoys, informed  sources said.    Among the measures is resumption of preparation for this  year's joint "Team Spirit" military exercise with the United  States if North Korea does not cooperate in international  inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites and if the third  round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks is postponed.    The meeting focused on whether the next high-level  U.S.-North  Korean meeting should be held if an agreement is reached before  March 21 to exchange envoys after this date, sources said.    In case either North or South Korea sends an envoy to the  other side, instead of a mutual exchange, the government will  support holding the next high-level Washington-Pyongyang meeting  on March 21 as scheduled.    The government will discuss this policy with U.S. Assistant  Secretary of State for Military and Political Affairs Robert  Gallucci when he arrives on Thursday evening.    Attending the meeting were Deputy Premier and Unification  Minister Yi Yong-tok, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense  Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Senior Presidential Secretary for  Foreign and National Security Affairs Chong Chong-ok.</p>

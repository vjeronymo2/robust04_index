			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, April 2 (AFP) -- Pro-government newspapers  in Lebanon Saturday [2 April] criticised the head of the  Maronite Christian Church, Patriarch Nasrallah Sfayr, for a Good  Friday speech in which he accused the Syrian-backed government  of discrimination against Christians.    The AL-SHARQ daily asked whether the patriarch's homily was  "a call to rebellion," adding that if it was, "it would be  extremely dangerous."    The remarks of Monsignor Sfayr, spiritual leader of the  largest Lebanese Christian community, "go against national  understanding, while the patriarchate should be the meeting  place for all Lebanese," the paper said.    Meanwhile, the AL-SAFIR newspaper accused Monsignor Sfayr of  saying "things that are pleasing" to supporters of Samir Ja'ja',  head of the former Christian Lebanese Forces (LF) militia, and  General Michel 'Awn, the anti-Syrian former prime minister  exiled to France in 1991.    Monsignor Sfayr said Friday Christians were living in  "anguish and bitterness" because they were not treated "on an  equal footing" with Moslems.    He charged that Christians did not receive a fair deal in  the  provision of state jobs and in the protection of property and  said Christian leaders had been forced to leave the country.    "Christians are not claiming privileges and do not wish to  impose their will on anyone. But they want to feel that Lebanon  belongs to all its citizens, who enjoy equal rights and  responsibilities."    Private radio and television stations have been banned from  broadcasting news and political programmes since March 23. The  government has restricted all news coverage to state-run Tele  Liban and Radio Liban.    The move came as the authorities launched an investigation  into a church bombing last month that killed 10 worshippers and  wounded 54 others.    The authorities accused seven members of the Lebanese Forces  of involvement in the attack. They arrested the group's deputy  Fu'ad Malik and outlawed the LF, which formed a political party  in 1991.    The LF was one of the militias widely held responsible for  much of the bloodshed and destruction in Lebanon's 1975-1990  civil war.</p>

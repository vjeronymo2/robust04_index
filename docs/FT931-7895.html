			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: GM offers salaried staff paid leave in job cuts plan AS PART of its cost-cutting drive, General Motors, the largest car manufacturer in the US, is offering salaried employees paid leave of between six and 15 months if they agree to leave the company once the leave is completed. GM hopes that the plan, combined with natural attrition, will reduce its white-collar workforce by 8,000, or 10 per cent, before the end of the year. Only salaried employees who have been with the car maker for more than a year are eligible for the plan. The company has already had success with its early retirement programmes for white-collar workers over 50 years old, which have helped reduce the salaried workforce from 91,000 to 76,000. Overall, GM is trying to cut 74,000 white and blue-collar jobs. Toyota, Japan's leading car maker is considering manufacturing pick-up trucks in the US after the collapse of talks with General Motors over a joint venture, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo. Toyota said it would start looking at whether to set up its own production facilities in the US after GM rejected proposals for a joint venture to make the Toyota T100 truck. 'Partnership with GM was one of our choices,' it said. Toyota started exporting its T100 truck to the US last autumn, but sales have been restricted by the 25 per cent tariff charged on imports. This led Toyota to consider manufacturing the truck in the US.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Government Bonds: Buyers move back into German bunds and futures German government bonds and futures built on last Friday's gains yesterday as news of a further delay in the publication of the M3 data for December prompted buyers to move back into the market. The March bund future on Liffe traded at 100.53 in moderate volume in the late afternoon, up 0.16 points on the day. The Bundesbank said that the data would not be ready until later this week due to technical difficulties caused by changes in their compilation. Mr Klaus Baader, senior international economist at Lehman Brothers in London, said that the delay had lessened the impact of a poor December figure and was encouraging the market to focus on the M3 data for January, which is expected to show an improvement. The delay in the December number also prompted market participants to cast their bets on whether the Bundesbank would cut interest rates at its fortnightly council meeting on Thursday. Dealers said that last week's favourable inflation data and the likelihood of weak industrial production data for the fourth quarter had raised hopes that the Bundesbank would cut rates by between a  1/4 and  1/2 point. Some dealers said they believed that there was a 50 per cent to 70 per cent chance of a cut on Thursday. However, some economists said that the Bundesbank would be reluctant to cut rates during the current round of wage talks in Germany. UK government bonds rose by up to  1/2 point at the long end as the release of a lower than expected M0 money supply figure for January revived hopes of an early cut in UK interest rates. 'The soft M0 number showed that the economy is moving ahead rather than flying ahead,' said Mr Kit Juckes at S. G. Warburg Securities. He added that the recent media reports highlighting the competition in food prices gave further support to the favourable outlook for inflation. The market also appeared to be more comfortable now that most of the unwanted supply from last week's gilts auction had found a home, Mr Juckes said. The March long gilt future on Liffe traded at 119 1/4 in the late afternoon, up  7/16 on the day. Italian government bonds and futures held their ground as the market awaited the results of 10 and 30-year bond auctions which were released just after the market closed. The auction results showed net yields easing on both issues. The March Liffe contract rose 0.33 on the day to 118.75. Japanese government bonds and futures recovered their poise in London trading after tumbling in Tokyo in reaction to the surge in the Japanese stock market. Expectations that the long-awaited fiscal stimulus package would be announced this week had also contributed to the fall in Tokyo. Market forecasts for the overall size of the fiscal stimulus range from Y14,000bn to Y16,000bn. The yield on the benchmark No 157 JGB rose by 10 basis points to 3.55 per cent at the close in Tokyo but fell back to 3.53 per cent in London. The March futures contract went as low as 112.74 in Tokyo before closing at 113.25, down 0.65 from Friday's closing level. However, it clawed back to 113.43 in London. Mr Adam Chester, international bond strategist at Yamaichi International in London, said he believed that the yield on the No 157 would not breach 3.6 per cent since the market was now looking cheap. The prospect of a  1/2 point cut in the discount rate at the beginning of March could help the yield to go back below 3 per cent, he added. Longer-dated US Treasury bonds retreated yesterday after a firming trend in commodities undercut the reassuring effect of comments by the Federal Reserve Board chairman. Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 down at 100 1/16 , with the yield rising to 6.238 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note edged  3/32 lower to 99 23/32 , to yield 4.132 per cent. The market was pleased, but not surprised, by the testimony of Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, before the joint economic committee to Congress. In discussing the US economic outlook, he stressed the difficulty facing the central bank in detecting latent inflationary pressures in time to contain them. He cited data distortions arising from the recent cold weather, the Los Angeles earthquake and modifications in methods used in compiling employment figures. But he emphasised that monetary policy 'must not over-stay accommodation', which was taken as a signal that the Fed may soon move towards a more restrictive bias. The vigilant tone of his remarks, just ahead of the Fed's policy session later this week, brought a modest improvement to the long end, which is most sensitive to signs of higher inflation. At the short end, prices softened on the prospects of a move to boost short-term rates. In the afternoon, traders turned their attention to the commodity markets, where prices for oil and basic metals were rebounding from earlier lows. In response, the long bond retraced its earlier gains amid profit-taking and slipped into negative territory.</p>

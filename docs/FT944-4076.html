			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (1): Expectations are down to earth - Overview / It is now clear that commercial property will, like the wider economy, pull slowly out of recession After the worst property downturn for half a century, some over-reaction during recovery was probably inevitable. Expectations were raised to unsustainable heights during the early months of the year and have since been brought back down to earth. It is now clear that commercial property will, like the wider economy, pull slowly out of recession. This is not to deny the scale of the gains so far. Investment returns from commercial property this year will be substantial, outperforming both bonds and equities. In the year to the end of October, the Investment Property Databank (IPD) monthly index showed capital growth of 12.6 per cent and a total return of 22 per cent. But the October figures also confirmed that property values were falling in the office and industrial sectors and no longer rising in retail. If the trend continues, the total return from property during 1994 is likely to be about 15 per cent. While property will still comfortably outperform gilts and equities, that result would be a disappointing outcome after the euphoria of the first quarter. Rising bond yields are the most obvious reason for this change of sentiment. The yield on long-dated gilts has risen from less than 6.5 per cent in January to 8.5 per cent. Since fund managers choose between investment markets, a bear market in bonds was likely to spill over into property. The overhang of over-rented properties - with tenants paying rents above market norms - has made the link between bonds and property stronger still. Bond yields would matter less if rents were rising. But expectations that rental growth would be well established by the middle of this year proved wide of the mark. As the sceptics predicted, rental growth prospects did not justify the low yields at which investment properties were changing hands in the spring. According to IPD figures, rents were still falling in the industrial sector during October, level in offices and barely rising in retail. It now seems unlikely that rents will rise significantly across the market until the middle of next year. Against this background, the immediate outlook for commercial property values is unexciting. The London Business School forecasting model, sponsored by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, predicts that capital values will rise by 9 per cent this year and 2.6 per cent in 1995. In June, the model was forecasting capital growth of 18 per cent this year and 7 per cent next. The stock market proved a useful leading indicator of where property values were heading. Property shares have underperformed the wider equity market by 15 per cent since last December. The flow of rights issues and flotations has dried up. Despite these set-backs and lower expectations, the next stage of the property market recovery should have firmer foundations than the bond-driven gains of the past 12 months. Business confidence - which ultimately drives commercial property rents and values - is stronger than a year ago. Rents on better-quality properties have already returned to an upward path. After three years in which development activity ground to a halt, there is a shortage of good modern space in many areas. The London office market is a microcosm of these pressures. Supply of large modern offices in the West End is already exhausted. In the City of London, there are only a handful of large spaces still vacant. Rents for prime space look likely to rise by about 10 per cent this year. Like other areas of the country, though, London offers a tale of two cities. While modern space is scarce, there is still a vast overhang of unwanted offices. In a slow-growth, low-inflation environment it is doubtful whether many of these buildings will ever be filled. Owners must face the difficult choice of either converting properties for alternative uses or sending in the bulldozers and redeveloping sites. Landlords are also faced with the continued threat of government intervention over the structure of commercial leases. The threat of legislation to curb upwards-only rent reviews and confidentiality clauses appeared to fade in July, when the government said it would not legislate in this area. But it asked landlords and tenants to come up with a voluntary code of practice to make sure that market forces were operating efficiently. Unless all parties can agree a code of practice which leads to more flexible leases, the legislative threat could return. Still, legislation to clarify liabilities relating to contaminated land now looks likely to please many in the property industry. This is a far cry from the furore over the government's 1990 proposals to create public registers of contaminated land, which could have blighted industrialised regions. The interventionist approach to planning policy favoured by Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has caused some upsets over the past 12 months. The big food retailers in particular have had to adapt business plans to take account of the government's desire to promote town-centre development. Others see the new direction of planning policy as an opportunity. Institutional investors have been snapping up regional shopping centres on the grounds that development curbs will add to the scarcity value of existing malls. For many pension funds and life insurance companies, though, the question is whether to invest in commercial property at all. The average pensions fund now holds only about 6 per cent of its assets in property, compared with about 20 per cent at the start of the 1980s. Life insurance companies have also reduced their exposure during this period. If property is going to survive as an institutional asset class, certain things will have to change, whatever the economic cycle brings. Poor liquidity and high transaction costs are the areas of greatest concern. Changes to the legal mechanics of property transactions and the development of new financial instruments could provide the solutions. The technical and cultural barriers to change are enormous. But without the support of mainstream institutional investors, property will be pushed to the margins and the property market will be poorer as a result.</p>

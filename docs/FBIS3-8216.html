			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We've just heard that French UN troops again came  under attack last night in Sarajevo in what they described as a  deliberate Serb attack. Luc Lemonnier has this report from  Sarajevo:    [Lemonnier] The incident once again took place at the Jewish  cemetery, close to the center of Sarajevo, in the hills where  Serbs and Muslims are separated by only a few dozen meters. A  detachment of French UN troops is also in this frontline sector.  Earlier in the week they had already returned fire against the  Serbs with their heavy machine-guns. Last night, just after  2000, they were the targets of deliberate fire, which a  high-ranking UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] official said came  from Bosnian Serb lines. The French soldiers returned fire for  a few minutes with their machine guns, and one French soldier  was injured by splinters of stone during the clash. Such  incidents are a daily occurrence in Sarajevo, especially in the  evening, and Generals Cot and Rose warned two days ago that  without a significant increase in UN troop numbers, such  incidents could end up threatening the cease-fire and the whole  peace process.</p>

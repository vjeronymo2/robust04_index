			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHWEST ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KLINGLER (48 FOR 76) LEADS HOUSTON VICTORY  </P> <P> Houston quarterback David Klingler had a record-setting day as the No. 9  Cougars defeated Southern Methodist, 44-17, in a Southwest Conference game  Saturday at Dallas.  </P> <P> Klingler completed 48 of 76 passes for 461 yards and five touchdowns, three  going to Manny Hazard, as the Cougars extended their winning streak to 10  games, longest among major-college teams.  </P> <P> Klingler, the nation's total offense leader, broke NCAA single-game records of  45 completions, set by Sandy Schwab of Northwestern in 1982 against Michigan,  and 73 attempts, set in 1989 by North Carolina State's Shane Montgomery against  Duke.  </P> <P> Klingler threw touchdown passes of 17 and eight yards to John Brown in a  20-point first quarter, then connected with Hazard on scoring passes of nine  and seven yards in the second quarter and three yards early in the fourth.  </P> <P> It was the fifth time in six games that Klingler passed for more than 400  yards. He had 390 in the first half, which ended with Houston leading 34-7.  </P> <P> Klingler completed 17 of 29 passes for 184 yards, two touchdowns and a 20-0  lead in the first quarter alone. Houston was going into a stiff breeze, but the  Cougars benefited from three SMU fumbles and an interception.  </P> <P> Houston Coach John Jenkins said he wasn't disappointed his team fell short of  its 1,000-yard performance of last year, when Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware  quarterbacked a 95-21 thumping of an SMU team coming off two years of  NCAA-imposed inactivity.  </P> <P> "Whether we win by one point or 200-0 doesn't really matter to me. All that  matters is that we win the game," Jenkins said. "We played very well today,  especially in the first quarter."  </P> <P> Jenkins' 6-0 start is the best ever by a first-time, first-year head coach in  the Southwest Conference. The Cougars are 5-0 in the SWC. SMU is 1-5 and 0-3.  </P> <P> SMU Coach Forrest Gregg said he was proud of his players' effort.  </P> <P> "When you consider that Klingler threw more passes today than any other game in  history and we gave them six turnovers, it could have been much worse," Gregg  said  </P> <P> Roman Anderson added field goals of 27, 22 and 35 yards.  </P> <P> SMU scored on Kevin Love's three-yard run in the second quarter, Brian Berry's  seven-yard pass from Mike Romo in the third quarter and Russell Anderson's  27-yard field goal in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Houston also set NCAA records with 52 plays, 32 completions and 48 attempts in  the first half.  </P> <P> No. 25 Texas A&amp;M 20, Baylor 20 -- Michael Moore scored on an 11-yard  touchdown run and Jeff Ireland kicked the extra point with 8:23 left to lift  Baylor to the tie in a SWC game at College Station, Tex.  </P> <P> Texas A&amp;M, 4-2-1 overall and 1-1-1 in the SWC, got a gift with 3:33 left  when Moore fumbled and Quentin Coryatt of the Aggies recovered at the Baylor  36. But the Bears (3-3-1, 2-1-1) held on three running plays by Darren Lewis,  and Layne Talbot hooked a 46-yard field-goal attempt to the left with 1:39  remaining.  </P> <P> Lewis rushed for 179 yards in 34 carries, the 23rd time in his career that he  rushed for more than 100 yards.  </P> <P> Texas A&amp;M led 10-6 at halftime on Talbot's booming 59-yard field goal as  time ran out. The ball rode a 25 m.p.h wind and just made it over the crossbar.  </P> <P> Talbot's previous longest field goal was 46 yards. It was the third-longest in  A&amp;M history, behind kicks of 65 and 64 yard by Tony Franklin, also against  Baylor, in 1976.  </P> <P> Rice 42, Texas Tech 21 -- Quarterback Donald Hollas ran for four touchdowns and  passed for a fifth to lead the Owls (3-4, 1-3) over the Red Raiders (2-5, 1-4)  in an SWC game at Houston.  </P> <P> Hollas scored on runs of eight, five, four and five yards and added a five-yard  scoring pass. Running back Trevor Cobb added 203 yards in 38 carries and scored  a touchdown.  </P> <P> The 42 points by the Owls was the most for them in a SWC game since they  defeated Tech, 42-7, in 1961.  </P> <P> Southwestern Louisiana 25, Tulsa 13 -- James Freeman came off the bench to pass  for two touchdowns in the second half to lead the Rajin' Cajuns in a  nonconference game at Tulsa, Okla.  </P> <P> Freeman completed 11 of 20 passes for 186 yards as the Rajin' Cajuns (3-4)  ended a four-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Ron Jackson rushed for 156 yards in 33 carries and a touchdown for the  Hurricane (1-7), which lost its sixth consecutive game.  </P></p>

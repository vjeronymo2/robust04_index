			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: SKF dives 91.8% to SKr59m SKF, the world's leading roller bearings manufacturer, recorded a 91.8 per cent slide in its first-quarter profits after financial items due to falling demand for its products. The drop was to SKr59m (Dollars 9.4m) from SKr721m for the January-March period of 1990. The company's net sales fell by 2.7 per cent to SKr6.92bn from SKr7.11bn. Income per share was SKr0.90 after tax, compared with SKr3.7 last time. The return on shareholders' capital for the most recent 12-month period was 2.9 per cent, compared with 7.3. At the end of March this year, SKF's production level was 20 per cent below what it was at the same time last year, with most plants operating well below capacity. SKF said its 60,000 workforce had been cut by 1,800 over the first three months of the year. Inventories were virtually unchanged as at the end of 1990, at 35.2 per cent. The company blamed the continuing fall in demand for its products in its biggest European markets as well as in the US and Brazil. SKF forecast continuing low demand over the next few months, with more costs incurred by a further reduction in manpower. The company said a further 4,000 to 5,000 jobs may have to go this year if weak demand for its products continued. Profits after financial items for SKF's bearings divisions fell to SKr77m, compared with SKr600m for the first quarter of 1990, although this year's first-quarter result was better than the SKr110m loss sustained by bearings in the fourth quarter of last year. Net sales were also down to SKr5.47bn, from SKr6.04bn. The company said bearings sales in the German car industry and in the Far East had been maintained. In its tools business, SKF suffered a SKr11m loss, compared with a SKr29m profit for the same period of 1990 and a SKr29m loss in the fourth quarter of last year. Tool sales increased to SKr597m in the first quarter from SKr368m last time.</p>

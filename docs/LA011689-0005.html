			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> PILOTS HELD IN SMUGGLING  </P> <P> The pilot and co-pilot of a Salvadoran jetliner were arrested at Los Angeles  International Airport on suspicion of attempting to smuggle a cache of firearms  to El Salvador. Customs agents said they recovered seven semiautomatic pistols  and a .12-gauge semiautomatic shotgun after receiving a tip from an informant.  The agents said it was not immediately determined whether the weapons were  intended for any organized group. Special Customs agent Ed Adamson said the Los  Angeles office received a tip Friday night saying that the cockpit crew of  Flight 2511 of TACA International Airlines would be attempting to smuggle guns  out of this country. Agents found the weapons in luggage being carried by two  TACA flight attendants. Customs agents boarded the plane shortly before it was  scheduled to take off and arrested pilot Francisco Jerez, 30, and co-pilot  Francisco Panameno, 29, without incident. They were booked into the federal  detention center in downtown Los Angeles on suspicion of violating the  Neutrality Act, which prohibits the export of weaponry without a State  Department license. Agents said the flight attendants, who apparently had no  knowledge of the weapons, were not arrested. The airline had no immediate  comment.  </P></p>

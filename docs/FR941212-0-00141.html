			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) The RJA may arrange to make local witnesses available for the injured party's attorney. With approval from USARCS, the RJA may arrange to make other Army witnesses available for the injured party's attorney if it is in the Government's best interests to do so. Any such request must be submitted as far in advance as practical. The appearance of present and former DA military and civilian personnel as witnesses is governed by AR 27&hyph;40, Chapter 7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The RJA should immediately terminate a representation agreement and independently pursue the Government's right to recover if the injured party's interests conflict with the Government's interests, or if the injured party's attorney fails to keep the RJA informed of developments or otherwise acts in a manner inconsistent with representing the Government's interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If the injured party or his attorney fails to cooperate with the claims office, the RJA is authorized to direct the MTF personnel to withhold billing information and should vigorously pursue the Government's right to recover. In addition, as outlined in 32 CFR 537.23, the RJA is authorized to direct the MTF to withhold release of medical records until the injured party provides the statement and other information required by &sect;536.226(a)(2); the RJA may not, however, direct the MTF to withhold medical records if the injured party's attorney merely refuses to enter into a representation agreement. In appropriate cases, the claims office should intervene in pending litigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) If the injured party's attorney improperly withholds or disburses money collected on behalf of the Government, the RJA should immediately initiate action to recover the money owed through litigation or through State disciplinary proceedings after appropriate coordination in accordance with AR 27&hyph;40 and AR 27&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Claims personnel may obtain an assignment from the injured party or his attorney for the reasonable value of the care that the United States provided if this will facilitate collection. The absence of an assignment does not affect the Government's independence right under the FMCRA, however, and an assignment is normally not necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recovering and Deposition on Claims <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.227 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> The MTF Third Party Recovery Program (TPCP). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOD Claims offices and MTFs manage complementary programs to recover for medical care furnished at DOD expense. Pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Judge Advocate General and The Surgeon General and understandings with Navy and Air Force authorities, claims offices and MTF's support each other's recovery programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) As provided in the MOA, claims offices will recover from automobile insurers, while MTFs will recover from health benefits and medicare supplemental insurance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) As provided in the MOA, MTFs will obtain insurance and other relevant information from persons receiving inpatient and outpatient treatment for injuries resulting from an accident. MTF personnel will also screen emergency room logs, clinic records, and patient admission information to identify accident cases. MTFs will refer these cases to claims offices in a timely manner, assist claims offices in obtaining medical records and cost computations, and route requests for medical records from injured parties and attorneys through the RJA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In return, claims offices will notify the MTFs of the final disposition of cases referred, deposit money recovered under 10 U.S.C. 1095 to the operations and maintenance account of the MTF that provided the care (see &sect;536.231(d)), and report the amounts deposited to an MTF's account on a monthly basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) As provided in the MOA, the head of each claims office may enter into a local Memorandum of Agreement with his or her supporting Army MTF commander. Such agreements should cover procedures, the degree of staffing each office will provide, and time frames for providing records or information. Such agreements may also provide for the MTF to assist the claims office's medical care recovery effort, either by giving back money deposited by the claims office into the MTF's Operations &amp; Maintenance fund to the claims office, or by providing personnel or other support. Any personnel provided or money returned to the claims office under such an agreement will only be used to support affirmative claims collection efforts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) If care was wholly or partly provided in an MTF on or after 5 November 1990 and recovery is possible from both a health benefits insurer and an automobile insurer, the MTF will first attempt to collect from the health insurer. If the MTF cannot recover the full value of the Government's claim from the health insurer, the MTF will foward the claim file to the installation claims office for collection from the automobile insurer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.228 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Post demand procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Uninsured Motorists. If the tortfeasor is an uninsured motorist, affirmative claims personnel will assert a demand against the tortfeasor, and will request suspension of the tortfeasor's driving and registration privileges under a State financial responsibility law if the tortfeasor does not pay promptly. If collection from the tortfeasor is not feasible, claims personnel will pursue recovery from any State uninsured motorist's fund or, on a medical care claim, from the injured party's uninsured motorist's coverage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Periodic review of pending claims. Whether or not the injured party's attorney has agreed to assert the Government's claim, claims personnel will review the status of pending claims every 60 days and take follow-up action as appropriate. Claims personnel should periodically contact the injured party's attorney to determine the status of pending cases, and should call or send follow-up letters to an insurer or tortfeasor who fails to respond to a demand or provides an unacceptable response. Follow-up action should be documented on the claims chronology sheet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Adjusting the amount asserted. The RJA should adjust the amount asserted on a claim as further treatment is provided. The RJA should delay settlement if it appears that extensive treatment is necessary or should consider this in negotiating a settlement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Forwarding claims to higher authorities. The RJA or head of a claims office will terminate action or will act on requests for waiver or offers to compromise that are within his or her settlement authority (see &sect;536.216). If a higher settlement authority must act on the claim, the RJA will forward a completed worksheet to the area claims office (if that office has authority to take action) or to USARCS as appropriate. When time is of the essence in securing a settlement, an RJA may contact USARCS telephonically for authorization to waive or compromise a claim. Prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations, the RJA should contact USARCS for guidance on disposing of any claim which cannot be recovered in full, compromised, terminated or litigated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.229 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Settling affirmative claims. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Claims personnel will reflect the basis for any settlements other than payment in full in the claims file. Note that under some circumstances, settlement authority may not waive or compromise a claim that he or she would normally have authority to act on (see &sect;536.216(g)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Payment in full. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A settlement authority may settle a medical care or property damage claim by recovering the full amount the Government's claim as a lump sum, through installment payments, or as a repair in kind on a property damage claim. An offer for the full amount of available insurance would not ``pay in full'' a claim asserted for a greater amount, and the RJA would have to follow compromise procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Compromise. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) If there are difficulties in recovering on a medical care or property damage claim (as defined by part 4 CFR part 103 of the Federal Claims Collection Standards), a settlement authority may accept less than the amount asserted from a tortfeasor or insurer for the convenience of the government. Acceptable bases for compromise for the convenience of the government include inability of the tortfeasor to pay, insufficient insurance, probability that the government will be unable to prove its case, or collection costs which are not commensurate with the amount being compromised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the injured party or the injured party's attorney requests waiver or compromise of a medical care claim, a settlement authority may accept an amount less than the amount asserted to equitably apportion the available funds and avoid undue hard-ship to the injured party. To do so, the settlement authority must consider the fair value of the injured party's claim, the future value of care provided by the United States, and the potential recovery available. In evaluating a request, the settlement authority may consider an offer by the injured party's attorney to reduce his or her fee, but should not make this a condition for granting a request. Prior to approval of any compromise based on undue hardship, the injured party must provide the following information: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Detailed information on what funds are available for recovery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Reasonable value of the injured party's claim for permanent injury, pain and suffering, decreased earning power, and any other items of special damages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANDY LEWIS: HATE-MONGERS ARE A SAD CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF COMEDY  </P> <P> The most important comedians have always been those who helped knock down the  social, racial, economic and/or cultural barriers that keep people apart.  </P> <P> In the '30s, Charlie Chaplin and the Marx Brothers made sure that society's  little tramps didn't get steamrolled in America's desperate quest for the  better life. Though they worked from greatly different vantage points, Lenny  Bruce and Bill Cosby contributed during the 1960s to the condemnation of  culturally ingrained racism. And Woody Allen has built a career on giving hope  to nerds throughout the world.  </P> <P> Along the way, comedians often have assumed the role that the sage assigned to  journalists -- "to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, some new-generation descendants of the greats have begun to  worship the tools some of their forefathers used -- stinging insults, graphic  language, sexually explicit situations -- without understanding the job for  which those tools were employed. I refer to two of the today's hottest stand-up  comics, performers who have reached rock 'n' roll-star status capable of  filling huge concert halls and arenas: Sam Kinison and Andrew (Dice) Clay.  </P> <P> Each is scheduled to play Orange County this week: Kinison in a club date at  the Laff Stop in Newport Beach and Clay at the 18,765-capacity Pacific  Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa. (Sam usually does larger facilities, but he booked  this one himself, reportedly to help pay his considerable alimony bills.)  </P> <P> Both have captured the attention (I would have said "imagination," but that's  far too complimentary) of the MTV-generation audience. Both appeal primarily to  teen-aged males -- no surprise, considering the heavily misogynist content of  both their acts. If I were a woman and a date took me to see either of these  wild boors, I'd ask for his money back -- then hail a cab.  </P> <P> Though I'm at a loss to explain the popularity of either, Clay is the bigger  mystery. (By the way, if you're looking for lots of examples of their "jokes"  here, forget it. The amount of each man's material that can be quoted in a  family newspaper probably weighs less than a stegosaurus's brain.)  </P> <P> With Kinison, it's easier to identify (if not identify with) the primal  catharsis in some of his routines. On his first album, there was an underlying  sense of true frustration at the hypocrisy he experienced in the life he led as  a preacher before turning his back on the church and becoming the antichrist of  stand-up.  </P> <P> Also, Kinison, unlike Clay, knows how to structure a joke that is created out  of a unique (albeit generally base) perspective. And Kinison knows how to  deliver a punch line.  </P> <P> One old routine about how difficult Jesus might have found it to explain his  Crucifixion and Resurrection to a wife displayed originality, intellect and  absurd juxtaposition of the real and the far-fetched. Sound comic principals,  all.  </P> <P> But since then, Kinison has been caught up in his own fame: He spends nearly as  much time on his latest album responding to Rolling Stone comments about his  reputed wild lifestyle as he does creating "new" material. And that consists of  inflaming racist attitudes toward Iranians, gays, women, the physically  disabled and just about anyone in the world who's not Sam Kinison.  </P> <P> Dice Clay, however, doesn't even have that much going for him. How he has so  quickly become a national phenomenon is a mystery that ranks up there with how  TV execs ever thought Pat Sajak would one day unseat Johnny Carson.  </P> <P> If there's more than meets the eye to Clay's act -- a leather-jacketed New Yawk  street thug who brags about every bizarre twist on intercourse he knows -- I  can't find it. Clay substitutes unbridled repugnance for viewpoint, odious  epithets for insight. He's as funny as a gang rape, as clever as a midnight  mugging.  </P> <P> Lenny Bruce showed that comedy can be tough, brutal and sometimes even ugly in  skewering the objects of his scorn. But those targets were small-mindedness,  bigotry and hate -- traits that Clay and Kinison would rather lionize. Their  loathsome attacks on women, homosexuals, ethnic minorities and others aren't  pointed or thought-provoking. They are simply imbecilic. Perhaps Clay doesn't  make jokes about the chronically stupid because they would hit too close to  home.  </P> <P> If there's any rationalization for Clay's moronic-punk persona, it could only  be that he really is a brilliant performance artist whose very presence exposes  how easily America can fall in line behind a crude, unthinking, spectacularly  unfunny delinquent.  </P> <P> Could it be that both are so hugely popular for the simple reason that they  accurately reflect, and give voice to, the values of their audience? That a  young generation bred on the senseless brutality of slasher movies like "Friday  the 13th" and "Nightmare on Elm Street" have become (to borrow Hunter S.  Thompson's pet phrase) a nation of swine?  </P> <P> Is it possible that, because celebrity worship has been elevated to the rank of  religious experience, we have surrendered the ability to think critically when  in the presence of a "star"? Otherwise, why would audiences grant not just  their approval but their delight at attitudes and behavior that, if expressed  by a child or a stranger at the supermarket, they would greet with the back of  a hand?  </P> <P> More disturbing yet is the realization is that Kinison and Clay, because they  are at the top of the stand-up comedy heap right now if only in terms of their  ticket-selling potential, undoubtedly are spawning dozens, maybe hundreds of  imitators who are dying to step into their dung-encrusted jackboots.  </P> <P> Remember the scene in Woody Allen's "Manhattan," when a question -- how does  one respond to neo-Nazis -- pops up at a posh party of left-wing intellectuals?  "We should go down there," Woody suggests, "get some bricks and some baseball  bats and really explain things to them." When one haughty woman opines: "Really  biting satire is always better than physical force," Woody retorts: "No,  physical force is always better with Nazis."  </P> <P> But the best course of action simply may be the one you'd take with bratty  children who misbehave just for the attention they can draw: ignore them and  hope -- no, pray -- they'll go away.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 19, RIA -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin, at a meeting with the country's top economic  executives, today described the situation in Russia's economy  and reforms as "near to a collapse".    He was talking with heads of plants, companies and financial  groups -- both state-operated and market-based ones. Taking  part in the meeting was Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin.    Although the "pre-collapse" state, according to Yeltsin, is  typical of not all enterprises, still "such a danger exists".  The president said that he had "discussed in detail" the  situation in production and the economy with the prime minister,  outlining measures for its improvement. Political issues were  not touched upon, for they are "more or less defined".    The president believes that the political situation is  "sufficiently favourable for foreign investments in the Russian  economy".    Following this discussion, said the president, the  government  has drafted eight decrees linked with the improvement of the  economy.    "In order not to make a mistake," Yeltsin addressed the  audience, "we have invited you to look together into the  decisions which we have not yet adopted but would like to adopt".    Then the meeting went on behind closed doors.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Owens-Corning seeks to expand in Europe OWENS-Corning Fiberglas, the US construction products and industrial materials group, is seeking to expand in Europe. Mr Glen Hiner, the company's new chairman and chief executive, said in London that the expansion programme could involve acquisitions, because that would be enable the company to increase capacity more quickly than by building new manufacturing plants. Owens-Corning, the world's largest manufacturer of fibre glass materials, has eight European plants. However, it has a much stronger presence in industrial materials - such as reinforcements, yarns and resins - than in construction products  - such as insulation materials and roofing. Mr Hinder said that, with the company's worldwide position and technology, it ought to be bigger in the European market for insulation materials. Its one plant in Belgium was currently operating at 110 per cent of its design capacity. With the depressed conditions in the European market, this may be a good time to buy, he said. 'We want to be one of the consolidators, not consolidated.' In the long term, he said eastern Europe and south-east Asia offered the company its greatest potential for expansion. He did not foresee acquisitions in the US. Mr Hiner was speaking on his first tour of Owens-Corning's European plants since joining the company in January, after 35 years at General Electric of the US. Overall, Mr Hiner wants to improve global integration of Owens-Corning's production facilities to ensure product uniformity. 'This is a necessity because of the growth of global customers who expect the product to be the same in the US and Europe.' Mr Hiner has already received plaudits from Wall Street for acting quickly to end the uncertainty at Owens-Corning caused by asbestos-related liabilities. Two weeks after joining the company, he announced a special Dollars 800m non-cash charge which is expected to cover the company for claims up to the end of the decade related to asbestos pipe insulation sold until 1972. Owens-Corning had previously taken a more gradual approach to making provisions for the claims, which are now declining but still exceeded 20,000 last year. Mr Hiner said he was 'highly confident' that the charge, based on 16 different variables, would cover claims until the year 2,000.</p>

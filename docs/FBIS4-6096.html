			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 15 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ], and Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the  Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], held a meeting at the First  House of Representatives Members' Office Building on the evening  of 14 April. They agreed that if Michio Watanabe, former deputy  prime minister and foreign minister, leaves the Liberal  Democratic Party and joins the new administration either as  deputy prime minister or in some other capacity, then the SDPJ  and DSP may have to leave the coalition.    According to senior DSP officials, Akira Yamagishi, chairman  of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation [Rengo], also supports  Murayama and Ouchi's position.    It is believed Murayama and Ouchi's coming out with such a  position is timed to warn Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and  Komeito against cooperating with Watanabe, and to change the  composition of the coalition by dropping Sakigake [Harbinger].</p>

[Begin Lacayo recording] I leave with affection and respect  for the president to dedicate myself to other tasks. Wherever I  may be, I will always cooperate with the national project, as I  have stated in my letter of resignation. [end recording]    Dr. Lacayo appraised the government's performance during the  past years.    [Begin Lacayo recording] The president of the Nicaraguan  people has performed an enormous task by ending a war, entering  a period of peace, and building such a difficult democracy. The  president has done a great job. Obviously, this is not the  most perfect government in the world, but we can say that this  administration has given us hope for the first time. It has  helped us to achieve reconciliation. Above all, the president  of the Republic of Nicaragua is determined to build democratic  values and institutions and -- as she has always said -- she is  carrying out a mission. It is a difficult mission but, it is  the mission that she was given. [end recording]</p>

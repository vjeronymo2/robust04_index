			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] TALLINN, May 16, BNS - Initialing a troop  withdrawal agreement like the one between Russia and Latvia  would have ended with a no-confidence vote to the government in  the Estonian parliament, parliament Speaker Ulo Nugis said in  his comments to reporters after last weekend's session of the  Baltic Assembly.    Latvia and Russia signed a framework agreement in April on  Russian troop withdrawal together with a package of additional  treaties, including one on the social protection of retired  Russian military living in Latvia. Estonia so far has refused to  make any concessions to Russia over the issue of the retired  military, which has become a major reason for the current  deadlock in the talks between the two countries.    Nugis in his remarks said the agreements signed between  Latvia and Russia in no way influenced the relations between  Estonia and Latvia. He said Estonia honors the right of Latvia  as an independent country to sign whatever agreement it wishes.  But he added that the signing of the treaties in Moscow had had  a certain negative impact, leaving Estonia to some degree  isolated.    The parliament speaker stated that Estonia is not going to  make any concessions to Russia over the military pensioners'  issue, because such is the government's "firm position and the  people's will." He also said any such concessions would  contradict the country's legislation and have an effect opposite  to what is wished as to the country's demographic situation.  [passage omitted]</p>

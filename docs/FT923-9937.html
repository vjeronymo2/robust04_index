			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Doctors faulted over drug allocation BRITISH doctors prescribe fewer, older and cheaper drugs than their Continental counterparts, but their prescribing practice is not cost-effective, according to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. 'The UK is not using new medicines wisely,' Dr John Griffin, association director, said. 'British doctors are using old, slightly more dangerous and certainly less effective products which are more expensive in the long term.' In 1990, the UK pharmaceutical market, including over-the-counter non-prescription drugs, was Ecu 4.74bn (Pounds 3.4bn). That compared with Ecu 10.1bn in Germany, and Ecu 8.9bn in France. UK patients received more than 460m prescriptions last year, up 24m on 1990. They cost the National Health Service Pounds 3.1bn, representing 9.7 per cent of its total expenditure. Per capita expenditure on prescription drugs in the UK is nearly half that in France and Italy, Dr Griffin said. UK per capita expenditure on prescription drugs in 1990 was only Pounds 55. That compared with Pounds 105 in Italy, Pounds 102 in France, Pounds 95 in Germany and Pounds 82 in Sweden. British GPs prescribe fewer drugs than many of their Continental counterparts. Prescriptions per capita in the UK averaged only 7.6 in 1989 compared with 38 in France, 20 in Italy and 12 in Germany. Danish, Swedish and Dutch doctors signed fewer prescriptions. Drugs prescribed by UK doctors also tend to be old, he said. In Italy, Japan, the US and Canada, more than 20 per cent of drugs prescribed have been introduced in the past five years. In the UK, the figure is 9.3 per cent. Dr Griffin blamed government measures for making doctors more cost-conscious. He argued that by prescribing less effective drugs, doctors were raising overall costs because of increased hospital admissions.</p>

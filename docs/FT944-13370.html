			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / US deaf over Cuba sanctions Cuban demands for Washington to start unravelling US transport, financial and trade sanctions against the island fell on deaf American ears during direct talks in Havana this week on immigration issues. In a tactic that clearly exasperated the Cubans, the US stonewalled all Cuban efforts to make the embargo an issue at the talks, which reviewed a September 9 bilateral immigration accord. 'I don't see how you can really proceed to an expanded programme of normal immigration if you have reduced flights and other restrictions,' said Cuba's chief negotiator, Mr Ricardo Alarcon. He was referring to curbs on flights and dollar cash remittances to Cuba introduced on August 20 by President Bill Clinton to tighten Washington's embargo. The US wants Cuba to introduce political reforms, such as legalising opposition parties, and to improve human rights. The talks in Havana ended inconclusively on Wednesday night after three days. Both delegations said they were satisfied with progress made in some areas, such as a US commitment to quickly introduce accelerated visa procedures. Mr Alarcon said the talks had identified some problem areas that still needed to be resolved. He gave no details but differences had emerged during the talks over exactly how to deal with 32,000 Cuban refugees sheltering at US safe havens at Guantanamo Bay in eastern Cuba and in Panama. Meanwhile, Wednesday's overwhelming but widely expected United Nations General Assembly vote against the US economic embargo on Cuba was being hailed by the Havana government yesterday.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Old boy network loses its hold on top boardroom jobs FORMER grammar school boys have taken over Britain's boardrooms from the public school old boy network, according to research by the London School of Economics. Half the chairmen of the top 50 UK companies by turnover were educated at state schools, while a further six went to 'top' grammar schools which were once state-funded via direct grants and are now independent. In 1979, only 14 chairmen had been state-educated. Only 15 of this year's chairmen went to fee-paying public schools, compared with 29 in 1979. Professor Leslie Hannah, of the LSE, who announced the figures in an inaugural lecture to the Foundation for Manufacturing and Industry, claimed the shift signalled the end of Britain's 'anti-industrial culture', following many decades of domination of industry by the public school elite. He said: 'The trend favourable to business is now firmly established, with continuing success in business recruitment of first-class honour graduates apparent in all recent decades. It seems that not only has there been a revolution at the top in the boardroom, but that revolution is firmly rooted in evolutionary cultural and educational change.' The shift has also been sudden. The apparent changes in the last decade are more substantial than those recorded in previous studies of the business elite over all previous decades of this century taken together. Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman of Williams Holdings (and educated at Bemrose Grammar School, Derby), who chaired Prof Hannah's lecture, said this sudden shift was attributable to the grammar schools created after the war. 'The reason is that people in the grammar schools of the 1940s and 1950s were extremely well educated. There's certainly an anti-industry culture in the British upper classes, or at least there has been.' A similar, but less drastic, shift is also visible at the level of higher education, according to the LSE figures. While Oxford and Cambridge maintained their old positions, providing between a quarter and a third of top businessmen in all the years surveyed, Prof Hannah pointed out that the two universities had become meritocratic, with a broadening admissions base.</p>

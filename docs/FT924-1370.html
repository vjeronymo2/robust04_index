			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Leading Article: French franc and D-Mark IS THE franc fort policy going to collapse? This hitherto unthinkable question is gaining greater force and in the process is becoming less and less unthinkable. Yet should the relationship between the French franc and the D-Mark fail, far more than just the exchange rate mechanism would be endangered. The weakness of the French franc this month - the first such weakness since after the ERM's 'Black Wednesday' - is not explained by the economic fundamentals. The problem is the slow growth imposed on France by the Bundesbank's disinflationary policies. French unemployment is expected to have risen in 1991, 1992 and 1993. Investors doubt whether the commitment to the ERM parity will stand the strain, especially with a parliamentary election due next March. How can France respond? Realignment would be folly. A small realignment would do nothing to lower French interest rates, while providing a trivial gain to competitiveness. A big realignment on its own might be still worse for interest rates, would destroy credibility and would improve economic performance too slowly. Waiting a few more months for lower German interest rates would be far more sensible. Floating the exchange rate would allow lower interest rates. Given the sound fundamentals of the French economy, floating might lead to no more than a trivial depreciation, even with lower interest rates. The franc might even strengthen. Granting early independence to the Banque de France would reinforce that possibility. Yet floating the exchange rate, while economically justifiable, would destroy the logic of the Maastricht treaty. Given long-standing French detestation of floating exchange rates, agreement to a float is unimaginable. Alternatively, the link with the D-Mark could be tightened. This would at least help lower French rates of interest to German levels. But that link could not be made more credible by France alone. The Germans would have to make an open-ended commitment to support of the franc. That, in turn, would demand a joint monetary policy, which would represent an immediate move to economic and monetary union (Emu). Unfortunately for France, Germany will not concede Emu tomorrow, which leaves soldiering on as the least bad choice. This is not a hopeless course. German inflation is falling, as is German output. Provided monetary growth slows, German interest rates should also fall, perhaps quite sharply, during 1993. Soldiering on has an important additional advantage. Up to now Mr Kohl has been able to have his pro-European cake and eat it. But if the French franc were in imminent danger of crashing out of its bands, he would have to make some choices. He could promise the Bundesbank the fiscal policy it demands before lowering interest rates; he could commit Germany to an immediate mini-Emu; or he could let the franc depart. France is doomed to play its present risky game. It could yet be saved by German recognition that its closest ally cannot be allowed to fail.</p>

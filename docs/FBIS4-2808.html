			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The Russian State Duma  (lower house of parliament) today condemned NATO's unilateral  use of force against Bosnian Serbs.    The State Duma in a statement called for an immediate  meeting  of the UN Security Council to discuss NATO's military  involvement in the Bosnian war.    The statement also suggested that measures be taken to  prevent the escalation of the Bosnian conflict.    The UN peacekeeping force should not be used by any bloc to  carry out military actions, the statement stressed, adding that  Russia was worried by the fact that NATO continued its policy of  using force as the means to solve the crisis in former  Yugoslavia.    Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also described  as "unreasonable" NATO's air strikes against Bosnian Serb  positions around the embattled Gorazde, saying they could only  result in the worsening of the situation there.</p>

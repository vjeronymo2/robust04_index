			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Business and the Environment: Industry on the warpath to fight greenhouse battle - John Hunt on efforts to sustain economic growth The international business community is beginning to get its act together in preparation for the world environment and development conference in Rio de Janeiro next year - an event dubbed the Earth Summit. Governments will meet there to draw up an international convention to combat global warming. In Rotterdam last week 700 heads of companies and business organisations, including many corporate giants, met at the second world industry conference on environmental management to set their own agenda for ensuring that their voice is heard at Rio. Many people in business and industry fear that the Rio meeting could move in the direction of tighter government pollution regulations that would inhibit economic growth and international trade. Business leaders argue that - contrary to the zero growth doctrines of some environmentalists - strong economic growth is the only way of providing the funds necessary to improve the environment in the industrialised world and provide aid for a cleaner performance in eastern Europe and the developing countries. At the conference, organised by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), business and industry mulled over these problems for three days. Out of it came a business charter for sustainable development - the buzzword for economic growth which refrains from inflicting lasting damage on the environment. The charter commits the 200 signatories to environmentally sound operations and to give the highest priority to environmental management. They promise to improve environmental performance and assess the environmental impacts of any new operation, to conduct regular 'green' audits and to modify products and activities so they prevent environmental damage. Environmental campaigners were not overly-impressed by these good intentions. The code is voluntary and relies on peer pressure among industrialists for its observance. Nevertheless the ICC is undertaking to discuss with the United Nations Environment Organisation the possibility of establishing a method of monitoring members' performance. The positive mood of the conference could not have existed a few years ago. This was summed up by Robert Kennedy, chairman and chief executive of Union Carbide, who had to deal with the aftermath of the disaster at his company's plant in Bhopal, India in 1984. At one time, he said, industry had automatically stonewalled when things went wrong. In the face of public outrage at such events, however, more information has been forthcoming. Now a dialogue had developed between business and public. 'We ignore public fear and outrage at our peril,' he warned. There was also a consensus that the costs of improving environmental performance should be fully incorporated into the pricing system and passed on to the customer. The previously-held view that air, land and water were free resources has led to much environmental degradation. It was suggested that the cost of the big clean-up could put a squeeze on profits. The use of 'market instruments' to encourage better performance through the workings of the free-market rather than by tougher regulations was given strong backing. Tradeable permits were advocated as one such method. Under this system a company with lower pollution can sell its surplus permits to one with higher pollution. Thus the highest polluter pays the most and the principles of the free market are satisfied. The development of the free market was seen as a prerequisite for environmental improvement. 'Industry considers environmental protection as a pre-condition for growth rather than a limit to growth,' declared Heinrich Weiss, president of the Federation of German Industries. There was a cool reception for the notion of a carbon tax on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas - which produce much of the carbon dioxide that contributes to global warming. Torvild Aakvaag, vice president of Norsk Hydro and chairman of the ICC Environment Commission, said: 'It would have to be harmonised internationally to be efficient and I don't think it is possible. It is inconceivable that China, which consumes 1bn tonnes of coal a year, would be willing or able to introduce such a tax.' Nevertheless, a main theme of the conference was the need for business to improve energy conservation and for governments to encourage it. Renewable sources of energy, such as wind and hydro power, should be encouraged but there was a strong feeling that fossil fuels will be the main form of energy for some decades. Nuclear energy also found strong advocates. 'I don't think we can allow ourselves to disregard that option,' said Aakvaag. 'I am convinced that nuclear energy will make a come-back.' Laurens Brinkhorst, director general for environment at the EC Commission, encapsulated the environmental problem facing world business. 'Will industry have the courage and determination to take environmental measures in its own hands thereby maintaining its flexibility and competitiveness? Or will the policy makers be forced to take the difficult decisions needed to protect the environment?' The answer will become clearer as the Rio conference draws near.</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAR BOMB IN BEIRUT KILLS MUSLIM LEADER, 21 OTHERS  </P> <P> A car bomb was exploded by remote control as the spiritual leader of Lebanon's  Sunni Muslims drove by Tuesday, killing him and 21 other people, police said.  Seventy-five others were wounded.  </P> <P> The explosion in Muslim West Beirut occurred as Arab League mediators were  trying to consolidate a cease-fire in the latest round of fighting.  </P> <P> Sheik Hassan Khaled was a leading voice for moderation in a country devastated  by 14 years of sectarian civil war.  </P> <P> Both Christians and Muslims denounced the assassination. There was no claim of  responsibility.  </P> <P> Police said Khaled was being driven home from his office for lunch when the  bomb went off in a crowded residential district. Reporters at the scene said  the explosion destroyed the fronts of buildings at a major road intersection,  setting nearby cars on fire.  </P> <P> The blast also shattered windows in the residence of Premier Salim Hoss, the  head of one of Lebanon's rival Cabinets, 100 yards from the scene. It was not  clear who or what was the target of the blast.  </P> <P> Rescuers had to break the doors of Khaled's smashed black limousine to remove  his body and those of his driver, his brother-in-law and an unidentified  companion.  </P> <P> "Our beloved Mufti is murdered!" a police officer screamed through tears as he  took the blood-stained white turban of the Grand Mufti from the crumpled car.  Among others killed nearby were four bodyguards.  </P> <P> "The assassin, or assassins, used a remote control device to detonate the car  bomb, which was rigged with more than 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of TNT," a  police spokesman said.  </P> <P> In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United  States was "revolted by the cold-blooded killing" and described Khaled as "a  selfless leader."  </P> <P> Khaled, 68, was spiritual leader of Lebanon's 900,000 Sunni Muslims and was the  nation's highest-ranking Muslim cleric.  </P> <P> He guided the economically powerful, minority Sunni sect into advocating  coexistence with Christians and shunning a fighting role in the sectarian war.  </P> <P> Lebanon's majority Shiite Muslims are believed to hold most of the foreigners  missing in Lebanon. Sunnis are not believed to be involved in hostage-taking.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, police in the southern port of Sidon said two West German relief  workers were apparently kidnaped for the third time. They last disappeared for  several hours 12 days ago.  </P> <P> Gunmen stopped Heinrich Struebig, 48, and Petra Schnitzler, 26, and a third  West German, who was not identified, between their office and the Miye ou Miye  refugee camp, police said. Schnitzler was later released, but she declined to  give details about the abduction.  </P> <P> No one claimed responsibility for the latest seizure, but it came as a West  German court prepared to pass judgment on Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese  Shiite Muslim accused of murdering an American passenger during the hijacking  of a TWA airliner in 1985.  </P></p>

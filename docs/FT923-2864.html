			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Indian shares rise on hopes of new money INDIAN stocks soared yesterday after the announcement of rules for the opening of the country's capital markets to foreign investors. The Bombay stock exchange index jumped 4.1 per cent as investors shrugged off their worries about the recent market scandal and bought stocks in the hope that the rule changes will prompt a wave of foreign investment. 'The mood was extremely up-beat,' said Mr S. Subramanian, vice president of DSP Financial Consultants, an investment company. The opening of India's markets to foreign institutions is a key element in the government's wide-reaching economic deregulation programme. The announcement coincides with the visit to the UK and the US of Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister. Under guidelines published on Thursday, foreign institutions will be permitted to hold up to 5 per cent of any stock. Foreign institutions as a whole will be allowed to buy up to 24 per cent. Dividends and interest income will be taxed at 20 per cent, long-term capital gains (profits on securities held for more than a year) at 10 per cent. The government has yet to disclose the tax rate on short-term investments - an important consideration or many institutions. A senior official of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, said the rules would be welcomed by foreign institutions. Mr Subramanian said more than 20 foreign fund managers had called yesterday seeking further information - mainly from Hong Kong, the UK and the US. Some brokers in Bombay have been drumming up business by forecasting massive flows of foreign money of Dollars 1bn and more into the Dollars 70bn stock market over the next year or so. But others warn that Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m may be more realistic. Mr Subramanian said 'old India hands' might start buying selectively, but foreign investors as a whole were wary because of the recent scandal, uncertainty about the future course of economic reform and the high price of Indian stocks. The average share in Bombay trades on a multiple of about 30 times earnings for the year to March 1992 and about 26 likely earnings in the year to March 1993. 'At these levels we won't see much money coming in.' Nevertheless, financial companies are busy preparing for the day foreign investors become a permanent part of the Indian market. Foreign broking houses - including Jardine Fleming, the British-owned company and Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley of the US - are opening representative offices or making alliances with local companies. Until now foreign investment in India has been limited to eight offshore funds which have accumulated net assets of about Dollars 1.1bn since the first was launched seven years ago.</p>

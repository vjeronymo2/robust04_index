			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Tax changes raise Swedish hopes - Government initiatives are likely to attract more foreign investment The Stockholm equity market is in an optimistic mood as the combination of proposed tax changes, the lifting of restrictions on foreign ownership, and an upturn in the US economy seem likely to attract further international investment in Swedish shares. Foreigners have been eager buyers of Swedish equities - they snapped up a net SKr11.2bn (Dollars 1.9bn) last year - and the liberalisation of share ownership in Swedish companies could well increase their appetite for this corner of Europe. In the first quarter, foreigners have been net buyers of the country's shares worth SKr3.2bn, compared with SKr1.1bn in the year-ago period. While the centre-right government's supplementary budget last Friday contained some grim economic forecasts - including expectation of a widening budget deficit in the 1992-93 tax year and a further 0.4 per cent fall in GNP in 1992 - it promised some welcome tax cuts for Swedish industry. The government's plans to abolish taxes on electricity and fuel for industrial use is expected to benefit energy-intensive sectors such as forestry, chemicals and mining. The market had been expecting the removal of the energy taxes for the last month, so the announcement did not have a noticeable effect on the stock market on Friday. However, it is expected to have significant long-term benefits. One securities house estimates that the removal of the energy taxes could add as much as SKr500m to the combined profits of Sweden's three main forestry companies (Stora, SCA and MoDo), giving them a forecast combined profit of SKr3.5bn in 1993. Other analysts point out, however, that while the removal of the energy taxes is good news for the forestry sector, it comes at a time when the industry is still suffering from the effects of global overcapacity. Only last month, Mr Bo Berggren, chief executive of Stora, Sweden's largest forestry company, warned that 1992 would be another difficult year, crushing hopes of a speedy recovery in the sector. 'Just removing the energy tax will not solve the forestry sector's problems,' comments one broker. Companies with mining interests are likely to enjoy a more obvious benefit from the lower energy costs. One such example is Electrolux, one of the world's leading white goods manufacturers which also owns Granges, an aluminium producer. Another company which will gain from the change is SSAB, the state-controlled steel concern which is selling some of its shares to the public this spring as part of the government's privatisation programme. SSAB's shares are already listed in Stockholm, and have climbed 31 per cent since the start of the year, against the market's overall gain of 8 per cent. Brokers say SSAB's share price increased by 3 per cent last week, helped by leaks that the government would abolish the energy tax. The government's decision to scrap a real estate tax, also formally announced in last Friday's supplementary budget but flagged well before, is expected to help the property sector and, indirectly, the banks, which have been burdened by heavy losses on loans to real estate companies. Bank shares, which have dropped by 16 per cent since the start of 1992, showed a slight recovery during April. 'With the removal of the real estate tax, maybe the fall in property prices will stop,' says one analyst, although he warns that any revival in the sector will probably take quite a long time. Apart from those companies likely to benefit from the lifting of the real estate and energy taxes, buying interest has focused mainly on cyclical stocks, following signs of a recovery in the US economy. Brokers note gains of 37 per cent in Volvo's share price, 20 per cent in the ball-bearing producer SKF, and 18 per cent in the specialty steel group Sandvik, since the start of the year. All of these companies have a high proportion of their sales outside Sweden, so the prospect of a recovery in the US is welcome news. During Sweden's recession, many of the large companies were forced to drastically cut costs, leaving them leaner and more efficient - and more likely to perform strongly once the Swedish economy recovers.</p>

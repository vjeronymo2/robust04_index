			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 27 May (EFE) -- The Ministry of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces has reported that a soldier was  wounded on 27 May when he thwarted an attempt to steal a vessel  in Guantanamo Bay, eastern Cuba, by five persons who planned to  leave the country through the U.S. military base located there.  These people tried to steal a fishing boat but the reaction of  the owner and the guards thwarted their effort, the source added.    In the action, a soldier was wounded "by shots fired by one  of the attackers," who were trying to illegally leave the  country via the U.S. military installation. A police report  stated that the attackers jumped into the sea and so far two of  them have been arrested and the other three are still at large.    On 17 April, Raul Castro, defense minister and second in  Cuba's political hierarchy, admitted that tranquillity prevailed  on both sides of the border last year and so far this year.  "Our determination is to continue doing our part to maintain  this climate," he added. Castro said that this is the reason  why all sorts of measures will continue to be applied "to  frustrate the crazy attempts of those who plan to leave the  country by this means." He recalled that this is a "highly  mined" area, and thus, escape attempts are not only "crazy but  an act of provocation against the country's security."</p>

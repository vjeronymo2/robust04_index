			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Strong demand helps SKF back to the black after nine months SKF, the world's leading maker of roller bearings, yesterday announced a SKr1.8bn (Dollars 297m) swing into the black at nine months, helped by strong demand from car and truck manufacturers in Europe and the US. The Swedish group also benefited from cost-cutting, lower financial costs and a return to profit at Ovako Steel. Profit after financial items amounted to SKr1.14bn, compared with a SKr709m loss last time. The result keeps the company on course for full-year profits of SKr1.5bn as the fourth quarter is traditionally the company's strongest period. Sales climbed 14 per cent to SKr24.6bn from SKr21.5bn, driven mainly by a 12 per cent rise in volumes. However the company said it also benefited from price rises, particularly in the after-markets segment, as well as from the weaker krona. Operating profits amounted to SKr1.43bn, after a SKr99m loss, while financial costs fell to SKr291m from SKr610m. The group's main unit, bearings and seals, achieved a SKr1.05bn profit, compared with a SKr422m loss, after sales climbed to SKr22.9bn from SKr20.03bn. Sales to the automotive sector, the company's biggest customer, were nearly 20 per cent higher as it benefited from rising demand and increased market share. Mr Mauritz Sahlin, managing director, said the North American trucks market had continued to develop strongly with no signs of weaker demand. The group's two other segments, machinery and after-markets, also showed positive sales growth. Ovako Steel reported a SKr102m profit on sales of SKr2.73bn. In the same 1993 period, it made a SKr301m loss on sales of SKr2.12bn.</p>

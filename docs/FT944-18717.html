			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Radical right leader deposed Mr Franz Schonhuber, co-founder and leader of Germany's extreme right-wing Republicans, was deposed at the weekend by a unanimous decision of his national executive. This follows a series of election defeats and secret negotiations between Mr Schonhuber and his erstwhile arch rival, Mr Gerhard Frey, leader of the equally extreme Deutsche Volksunion (DVU). The 71-year-old Republicans' leader is the only nationally known figure in the party, and he immediately announced his determination to fight the move, which he said was illegal and contrary to party rules.</p>

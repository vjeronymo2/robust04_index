			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Philip Johnston article: "Harliners Reject Ulster Peace </F> Push"]    [Text] A new drive for a political settlement in Northern  Ireland ran into immediate heavy flak from hardline Unionists  yesterday as Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, returned from  New York.    Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, has  indicated  he will publish proposals within the next fortnight to devolve  power to the province and set up cross-border policy bodies.    But Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic  Unionists, said any new arrangements based on the principles of  the Downing Street declaration on Northern Ireland were  unacceptable.    In the Commons, Mr Major said progress on a political  settlement would not wait upon Sinn Fein which has yet to  respond to the invitation to join talks.    He confirmed that ideas designed to give "focus and  direction" to the talks process would be brought forward soon,  despite signs of a rift with Dublin over the timing of the  initiative.    Mr Major took his first public opportunity to denounce the  propaganda campaign waged by Mr Adams on his trip to America.    "I don't believe people in Britain or in Ireland have been  deceived by Adams's performance," he said. The way to peace in  Northern Ireland was "in Gerry Adams's hands and I believe he  could and should do it," Mr Majo added .    On his return to Dublin, Mr Adams again declined the  opportunity to announce a permanent cessation of violence.  However, he said "we are now in the final phase of this  conflict" -- a message which observers took to be directed at  the IRA rather than the Government.    Following Mr Adams's visit to New York, the Government has  decided to try to wrest the initiative from Sinn Fein. But the  initial response from the Democratic Unionists was hostile, if  predictable.    Mr Robinson said on BBC radio: "The whole constitutional  position of Northern Ireland has been transformed.    "The self-determination of the people of Northern Ireland  has  been handed away from it being vested entirely with the people  of Northern Ireland to the whole of the people of the island of  Ireland."    The DUP [Democratic Unionist Party] response demonstrates  how  difficult it will be to make any progress in the foreseeable  future and there were indications that Dublin is not convinced  that the time is right for Sir Patrick to table his proposals.    Mr Dick Spring, Ireland's Foreign Minister, said he trusted  that the initiative would be directed towards the achievement of  the objectives the governments had jointly set themselves.    Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist SDLP  [Social Democratic Labour Party], maintained it was clear from  what Mr Adams had said in America that Sinn Fein "does not  accept the principle of self-determination based on consent."</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Turks to protest at austerity measures Turkey's austerity programme is coming under growing pressure from labour groups, with the main union federation calling a day of protest for next Wednesday and the government facing demands to raise civil servants' salaries. The cabinet is today due to announce salary increases for the 1.6m civil servants. Despite annual inflation running at more than 100 per cent, economists say Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, will want to keep the increase to below the 54 per cent projected in the 1994 budget. Separately, Turk-Is, Turkey's main union federation, representing around 1.2m workers in the public sector, is to stage a day of protest on Wednesday in the first sign of union opposition to the programme. Public-sector wage restraint is vital to the success of the government's fiscal adjustment plan, which envisages halving the public-sector borrowing requirement to 9 per cent by the end of 1994. The programme, backed by an International Monetary Fund standby credit of Dollars 742m, assumes a 15 per cent real wage cut across the economy. The government has still to pay rises to some 700,000 public-sector workers under collective bargaining deals signed last year, when it was agreed that wages would be indexed to inflation. The government wants the unions to accept rises in line with future inflation, projected to fall sharply to 20 per cent by mid-1995. 'It's daydreaming, of course we will never go for such a proposal,' warns Ms Seyhan Erdoydu, a Turk-Is official, 'World Bank or OECD projections are one thing, but the government's own projections are never met.' The government is hoping to appease union grievances, at least in the public sector, by introducing unemployment insurance for those made redundant by privatisation. This reform however, is currently frozen. In addition to wages, the unions complain about the rise in value added tax, and the government's failure to fulfil a pledge to provide a right to strike for civil servants. However, Mrs Ciller appears to be gambling that the unions, and the Social Democrats, their allies inside the coalition, will opt to protect jobs rather than push for higher wages. In June parliament ratified on second reading the International Labour Organisation convention on job protection, which the unions believe provides a legal basis to challenge dismissals. However, union militancy appears to be waning. Last year saw a sharp fall in the number of days lost to strikes, with just 38 strikes in the first six months of 1993 compared with 398 in 1991, according to union figures. With the government meeting its fiscal targets in the first three months of the programme, economists believe Mrs Ciller will want to hold the line on wages, which may give her more room for manoeuvre in the autumn, when parliamentary and union opposition to the austerity measures is expected to intensify.</p>

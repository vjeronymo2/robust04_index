			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CORSICAN STRIKE BLOCKADE LIFTING  </P> <P> Supplies of meat and frozen foods reached the strike-bound capital of Corsica  for the first time in a week today as trade unionists gradually lifted a  blockade of the island's ports and airports. The arrival of 1,500 metric tons  of food was greeted with relief by crowds of Corsicans hit by shortages of  meat, cigarettes and medicine during strikes over the high cost of living on  the Mediterranean island.  </P> <P> Trade unionists, who stopped work five weeks ago demanding a bonus to offset  high prices, appeared to have virtually lifted their seven-day blockade of sea  and air traffic. Some French airline companies announced resumption of  scheduled flights on the eve of the Easter break, and chartered flights from  Britain and West Germany were also due to land.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the head of the CGT trade union, Noel Zicchina, escaped an  assassin's bullet Thursday night as he and hundreds of fellow trade unionists  occupied the port at Ajaccio.  </P> <P> More than 20,000 civil servants and private sector workers -- a quarter of the  Corsican work force -- are on strike. The government is resisting their  demands, saying taxes have been scrapped on items such as cigarettes and  alcohol, and other goods are subsidized.  </P></p>

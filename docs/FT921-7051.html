			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Bank of America to sell 183 branches BANK of America plans to sell 183 branches and divest itself of Dollars 7.3bn of deposits in five states in order to meet anti-trust concerns over the forthcoming Dollars 4.5bn merger with Security Pacific. The planned divestitures, which are in line with previous indications, are designed to conform to guidelines that the bank has discussed with federal and state bank regulators as well as the Department of Justice. Some 10,000 employees are expected to be made redundant as part of the merger of the two banks, which have a combined pre-merger workforce of 91,400. Mr John Wilson, chief economist of Bank of America, told a Senate sub-committee yesterday that the planned divestitures would reduce the post-merger deposit concentration of the combined bank to less than 30 per cent of total deposits of commercial banks, mutual savings banks, savings institutions and credit unions in the five states - California, Washington, Arizona, Oregon and Nevada. The merger, which is expected to go ahead in the next few weeks, has run into problems in Washington and Arizona, where state legislative panels have proposed laws that would limit to 30 per cent the total deposits the Bank of America-Security Pacific group could hold. Bank of America argued yesterday that following the sale of 69 branches and Dollars 2.5bn of deposits in Washington, its share of total deposits in the state would be 26.1 per cent. The level in Arizona would be 24.8 per cent after the divestiture of 45 branches and Dollars 2.2bn of deposits in the state. The planned merger will create the largest banking group on the west coast and the second biggest US bank in asset terms, with about Dollars 185bn of assets. The combined branch network, prior to the divestiture of 183 branches, would be 2,332.</p>

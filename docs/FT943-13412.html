			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Nato and WEU remain apart Co-ordination between Nato and the Western European Union over how to organise joint military task forces has failed to get off the ground, a senior Nato officer disclosed yesterday. A new relationship between Nato and the WEU was proclaimed after January's Nato summit, at which the US appeared to give its blessing to the idea of western Europe taking more responsibility for its own defence. But a speech yesterday by Air Vice Marshal John Cheshire, until recently an assistant chief of staff at Nato's military headquarters, indicated virtually no progress on linking the two institutions had been made. He told the Royal United Services Institute the WEU's permanent staff had declined to enter discussions about how to organise task forces, on the grounds they had no mandate to do so from member governments.</p>

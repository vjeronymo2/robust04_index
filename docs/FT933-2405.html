			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wrong end of the stick I have been living and working outside the UK, principally in Spain, for the past seven years. I intend to invest in the UK stock markets and as a non-resident, I presume I would be exempt from UK income tax but would I also be exempt from capital gains tax? If I am not exempt from capital gains tax, how would it be collected? Would it be in the form of a with-holding tax or a demand at the end of the tax year? You have got hold of the wrong end of the stick. People who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the UK are exempt from capital gains tax, but are not exempt from income arising in the UK. As a non-resident Commonwealth citizen, however, you are entitled to a full personal allowance (currently Pounds 3,445 for a single person born after April 5 1929). As a resident of Spain, you cannot be charged more than 12 per cent UK income tax on interest. Also, as a Spanish resident you will be entitled to a minimum payment of a quarter of the one-quarter tax credit which each UK dividend carries: this leaves you with a maximum effective UK income tax rate of 15 per cent on the aggregate of each dividend and its tax credit. The Spanish tax authorities will allow credit for that residual 15 per cent UK tax against your Spanish tax liability on the aggregate figures; similarly they will allow credit for the 12 per cent UK tax when calculating your Spanish tax bill on any UK interest. Write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London UK WC2R 1LB, for a copy of the free booklet IR20 (Residents and nonresidents: liability to tax in the UK). Presumably copies of the Spain-UK double taxation convention are obtainable locally: the relevant articles are 11 for interest, 10(3) for dividends and 24(2)(a) for credit against your Spanish tax liabilities. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

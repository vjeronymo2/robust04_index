			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Winter and summer attendance, and selected aspects of breeding biology of banded and unbanded common murres will be monitored at breeding sites at the South Farallon Islands at Farallon NWR. Established and new study plots, individually-banded birds, blinds, and other facilities will allow for the study of summer and winter attendance in more detail than at nearshore locations. Monitoring would include determining arrival dates, winter attendance patterns (breeding versus nonbreeding common murres), winter behavior of nonbreeding and breeding common murres, site fidelity of breeding common murres, reproductive success, population size, and impacts of predation. Monitoring at the South Farallon Islands will continue for at least two years and may be extended beyond two years if needed to support refinement of recolonization methods or to facilitate interpretation of data at other colonies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Schedule: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Fall and winter 1994&hyph;1995: Begin preliminary work, including contracting, planning, logistics, permits, and purchasing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spring-summer 1995: Conduct aerial surveys of seabird colonies in central California to obtain baseline data, conduct aerial flights of Devil's Slide and San Pedro rocks to obtain aerial photos for mapping purposes, and record breeding common murre vocalizations at the Farallon NWR for use in the recolonization project. Select colonies and study plots to be monitored in the Point Reyes area. Conduct safety training for personnel as required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fall and winter 1995&hyph;1996: In fall 1995, conduct reconnaissance trips to recolonization sites in preparation for deployment of social attractants. Before December 1995, deploy social attractants and initiate daily observations of recolonization sites. Initiate daily observations of study plots in December 1995. Complete field season in August when common murres generally leave breeding colonies. Observations of study plots will continue from December through August for a minimum of 5 years to 10 years in order to provide necessary information to adequately evaluate the recolonization project. Work at the South Farallon Islands will begin the winter of 1995&hyph;1996 and will continue for a minimum of two years. Regular progress reports and an annual report will be submitted by the contractor performing the work at the South Farallon Islands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Castle and Hurricane Point Rocks Restoration: Restore Common Murres at Castle and Hurricane Point Rocks Using Social Attraction Methods (Decoys and Recorded Vocalizations) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Location: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Castle and Hurricane Point rocks, Monterey County, California. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Justification: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As described above, the recolonization of historic common murre colonies in central California will contribute to the reversal of the dramatic reduction of this seabird's historic geographic range. The 1986  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Apex Houston <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spill severely affected the breeding colonies that make up the southern half of the central California breeding range. Two breeding colonies near Monterey, Castle and Hurricane Point rocks, were hard hit by the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Apex Houston <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spill and are in serious danger of perishing entirely. The remaining subcolonies on these rocks are very small and disjunct. These colonies are particularly important because they are at the current southern end of the central California population as well as the southern extreme of the species' range in the Pacific Ocean. These colonies are in close proximity to each other and constitute the only active common murre colonies south of San Francisco, a large portion of the range of the central California common murre population. Given the current fragile condition of the overall common murre population and the lack of recovery over time, colonies once lost are not likely to be reestablished in the foreseeable future without human assistance. If the colonies at Castle and Hurricane Point rocks are lost, the resulting reductions in the geographical range, numbers, and productivity of common murres further increase the risk of extinction of the entire central California population. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Action: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The common murre colonies at the Castle and Hurricane Point rock complexes will be evaluated to determine the best means of employing social attractants at these locations. A minimum of two years would be required to determine appropriate methods. Both of these colonies are composed of several subcolonies on different rocks. Subcolonies will be examined to obtain a comprehensive understanding of colony dynamics in a severely depleted condition. Breeding population levels, reproductive success, attendance patterns, behavioral observations, and nesting locations will be determined at as many subcolonies as possible. Particular attention will be paid to prospecting birds within established subcolonies and at unoccupied rocks. In addition, all unoccupied rocks and potential mainland breeding habitats will be assessed for the use of social attractants to encourage common murre breeding. Habitat will be assessed for suitability to support a common murre subcolony, including such factors as slope, size, protection from human and other disturbance, surf conditions, and predation threats. The unoccupied rocks will be regularly monitored to detect prospecting common murres. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Pension fund managers predict industry upheaval CHANGES TO advance corporation tax are likely to lead to a dramatic upheaval in the pension industry, fund managers warned yesterday. Managers assessing the impact of Tuesday's Budget said it would effectively cut their income by up to 6.25 per cent. Mr Michael Pomery, partner at consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow, said: 'Pension funds are stuffed.' From April 5 pension funds will be able to claim back only 20 per cent of ACT. With ACT at 33 per cent of every Pounds 100 of profits, pension funds will be able to reclaim Pounds 16.70 from ACT instead of the Pounds 22.30 they could have reclaimed previously - in effect a 6.25 per cent cut in cashflow. Given the average UK pension fund's weighting of 58 per cent in UK equities, total cashflow is likely to shrink by up to 3.5 per cent. Mr Pomery warned that because actuaries valued pension fund assets on their anticipated cashflows, a fund's UK equity assets would be at least 6.25 per cent smaller on April 5 than they were on April 4. The drop in asset base and cashflow will be significant for mature pension schemes in declining industries whose plan sponsors have been making little or no contribution. Mr Andrew Wilson, research partner at consulting actuaries R Watson, said: 'This could mean either increases in contributions or cuts in benefits.' According to figures from the National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association, 38 per cent of all UK employers made no contribution to their pension scheme last year, relying on investment income and employee contributions to make up the bulk of payments to current pensioners. And schemes in 1992 were already hard hit by dividend cuts last year. For the first time in 25 years, dividend growth shrank by 0.5 per cent, instead of growing at the annualised five per cent rate assumed by scheme actuaries. The full effect is not expected to be be evident for some time, actuaries said. But glimpses of its potential impact are showing. Mr Pomery said that on Wednesday, he had a call from a client with a small surplus it had planned to distribute to members. 'Now that surplus is gone.'</p>

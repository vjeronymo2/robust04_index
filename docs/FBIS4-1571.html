			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sheel Kohli in Bermuda] </F>   [Text] Jardine Matheson is seeking to enshrine a takeover  code in Bermudan law because it fears a takeover by Chinese  companies, according to a senior Bermudan minister.    This contradicts statements made by Jardines directors last  week when they announced the hong's intentions to de-list  several Jardine companies from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange at  the end of this year.    Bermudan financial ministry officials said Simon and Henry  Keswick had said there was an extreme likelihood that there  would be a hostile bid for the group. David Saul, Bermuda's  Minister of Finance and a senior parliamentary member of the  ruling United Bermuda Party said he met the Keswick brothers on  several occasions to discuss details of passing their takeover  code into law.    "The Keswicks were concerned, they expressed those concerns  and they described those concerns," he said. "They were  concerned principally about a hostile takeover. They decided  that they needed protection, and that seemed to us a genuine  bona fide concern."    The code Jardines sponsored in Bermuda stipulates that  anyone  acquiring 30 percent of a company's stock must make a general  offer, whereas the Hong Kong trigger point is 35 percent.    The company, which has been doing business in Hong Kong and  China for the past 150 years, had sought, but been denied a  special arrangement in Hong Kong, that it said could have  allowed the group's shares to remain as a secondary listing in  Hong Kong.    Mr Saul said Jardines had been expressing fears about being  taken over since it first officially announced its new domicile  in 1984, coinciding with the agreement by Britain to hand Hong  Kong back to China in 1997. "When Jardines moved their  headquarters to Bermuda, it was apparent that takeover concerns  led them to do it."    He said it was these concerns too, that proved to be one of  the deciding factors persuading the Bermudan Government to allow  Jardines to proceed with a private bill to enshrine a specific  takeover code. Mr Saul said: "We suggested that they go the  private bill route. We said that we had no provisions in law to  prevent hostile takeovers."    Malcolm Williams, the general manager of the Bermuda  Monetary  Authority, whose department investigated the code and who will  be responsible for administering it, also said that these were  their motives. "They were uncertain about 1997, and it seemed  sensible in some ways in stationing and positioning themselves,  so that if something adverse happens, then they have something  to protect shareholders," Mr Williams said.    He said that from this assessment he could only surmise that  the Keswicks felt that the Hong Kong regulations were  insufficient to protect them adequately.    The announcements for the de-listing Jardine Matheson and  Jardine Strategic were backed by statements that the move was  not related to fears about China.    Jardines officials were not available for comment.</p>

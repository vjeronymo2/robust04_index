According to statistics, the Guangdong Commodity Inspection  Bureau last year checked over 400,000 batches of imported and  exported goods worth US$60.8 billion, more than 8,000 batches of  which were imported goods valued at US$32.3 billion.    According to the bureau, the commodity quality problems  discovered by the bureau mainly focused on equipment, steel  products, processed oil, grain and chemical products. Of these  imported goods with a quality problem, most of the equipment  coming under this description was out-dated and imported as  investment by foreign businessmen with their technical  performance failing to meet an acceptable level or even failing  to have the basic technical requirements. Some of such  equipment had been assembled with bad parts and components and  were in an incomplete state. Some five percent of steel  products imported via ports in Guangzhou last year were found to  have quality or quantity problems.</p>

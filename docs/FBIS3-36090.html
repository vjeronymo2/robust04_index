During the debate on this  draft law, people's deputies expressed two opposite stands:  Anatoliy Yahoferov and Ivan Makar believe the provisions of the  law are geared to restoring the administrative methods of  managing economy while Borys Mokin and others were convinced  that they stimulate energy by saving production methods. The  laws concerning legal proceedings will come into force on the  day of their promulgation, in particular the law "On the Bodies  of the Judges' Self-Government" (formerly called "On Conferences  and Congresses of Judges"); "On Qualification Commissions,  Qualification Certification, and Disciplinary Responsibility of  Ukraine's Judges"; and "On Introducing Amendments to the Law `On  the Status of Judges.'" Changes have been introduced to the  Supreme Council resolution "On Putting the Law of Ukraine `On  Road Traffic' in force." The people's deputies expressed most  of their interest during the debate on two draft laws: "On  Introducing Amendments and Additions to the Cabinet of  Ministers' Decree `On the Regime of Foreign Investments'" and to  the Land Code of Ukraine (concerning the privatization of plots  of land under incomplete construction projects). People's  Deputy Volodymyr Petrenko pointed out: "We must examine this  issue as a concept. Does the Supreme Council give the  opportunity to foreign natural persons and legal entities and  also to persons without citizenship to buy plots of land under  the current inflation and distorted exchange rate of the coupon  [karbovanets] in relation to the dollar?" The majority of the  speakers agreed with his opinion that it is impossible to grant  foreign citizens or persons without citizenship the right to buy  land and remarked that their right to lease plots of land could  be envisaged in the completed variant of the documents. The  deputies voted for introducing amendments to the Cabinet of  Ministers' decree "On the Regime of Foreign Investments."    Chairman of the Supreme Council Ivan Plyushch said that on 3  February two important issues would be considered: the draft  law on local self-government; and conformity with the trilateral  statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and  Russia to the Supreme Council resolution on START I ratification.</p>

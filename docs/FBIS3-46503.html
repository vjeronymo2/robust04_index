			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Papua New Guinea [PNG] government says it has  nothing to hide in an effort to solve the Bougainville crisis.  State Minister for Bougainville Michael Ogio says he denies  suggestions by supporters in Sydney of Bougainville  secessionists that security forces were undertaking a major  military buildup in preparation to retake the Panguna copper  mine. Mr. Ogio has described the claim as irrelevant,  misleading, and totally out of context. He said he also denied  claims by the Bougainville Freedom Movement that  Australia-supplied Iroquois helicopters were being used as  gunships. Mr. Ogio says the helicopters on Bougainville are  being used for humanitarian purposes and the transportation of  ground staff to inaccessible areas.</p>

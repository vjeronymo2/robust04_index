			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, President Kim Yong-sam invited senior retired  generals, including Messrs. Paek Son-yop, Kim Sin, Han Sin, Yi  Maeng-ki, Chae Myong-sin, and Yi Pyong-hyong, to Chongwadae  [presidential offices], and explained to them over a luncheon  the recent security situation.    President Kim stressed that the military cooperative system  between the ROK and the United States is closer than ever.    At the meeting, Lt. Gen. Chae Myong-sin, retired, said that  Vietnam fell not because it was short of arms but because it had  no will to fight and its spiritual strength was weak, and added  that the young people should equip themselves with more thorough  security-consciousness and resolve to defend the country.    Gen. Paek Son-yop, retired, said that the War Memorial Hall  should become a training ground to inspire the young people with  the resolve to defend the country. Lt. Gen. Kim Sin, retired,  stressed the importance of laying up for a rainy day, taking as  an example the underground roadway in Beijing which can be used  as a shelter in case of emergency.    Gen. Han Sin, retired, said that the result of President  Kim's visit to Russia was like disarming North Korea.</p>

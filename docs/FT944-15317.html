			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Print union calls off 18-month strike Industrial action against the Bristol printing company JW Arrowsmith will be called off today after 18 months of picketing. It has been the longest dispute in the city's history. Arrowsmith dismissed 120 employees in April last year after they voted to take industrial action in pursuit of a national pay claim. At the same time it derecognised their union, the GPMU. In spite of an official picket ever since, the family-owned company has stayed in business and the GPMU has failed to make it negotiate. But the company has reduced in size and is seeking to sell its site in south Bristol and move to smaller premises. Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said last night that the sacked workers' struggle had inspired trade unionists across the country. He said the dispute 'should serve to show other employers that such shortsighted, unjust and anti-union management is no way to build a successful business'. Arrowsmith, which was founded in the mid-19th century and specialises in technical typesetting, dismissed the staff for breach of contract. The company, which made a loss the previous year, said it had been damaged by an overtime ban and could not afford the claim for Pounds 6.50 a week and an extra day's holiday. It offered to re-employ staff on personal contracts and with a pay freeze, but only a handful returned.</p>

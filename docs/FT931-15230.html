			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Bahamas' former leader blamed for economic turmoil: 'Fiscal recklessness' is claimed as public indebtedness soars, tourism declines and offshore financial services face stiff competition THE once-vibrant economy of the Bahamas is looking shaky. Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham, elected in August, has been very firm about where the blame lies: his predecessor, Sir Lynden Pindling, who had held office for 25 years. Mr Ingraham has charged that the country's finances are in 'chaos' because of the 'fiscal recklessness' of the previous government, which had borrowed to cover its deficits over the past four years. But getting out of the economic quicksand will present the new prime minister with no small test of his administrative skills. The options are few for the narrowly-based Bahamaian econ-omy. Just after taking office, Mr Ingraham reported the government's embarrassment at being unable to release Dollars 33m in cheques it had written because all its accounts were overdrawn. 'It is unacceptable for the public treasury of a sovereign state to be in a scandalous position whereby cheques are written to pay government bills, but cannot be released because there is no money in the government's overdrawn bank accounts for the cheques to be honoured,' the prime minister said. Faced with a fiscal deficit last year of Dollars 240m (Pounds 158m), 8.5 per cent of GDP, Mr Ingraham's government has spent the past four months reviewing the practices of Sir Lynden's government. 'The information coming to hand confirms what has been common knowledge in the Bahamas; that there has been, for years, serious mismanagement and misuse of the public finances; and that there has been impropriety, and extraordinary extravagance, abysmal neglect and waste in the handling of the economy, and of the public finances,' Mr Ingraham said. The economy has suffered in recent years from a decline in tourism, its main pillar, caused mainly by recession in its main markets. The offshore financial services sector has not fared well in the face of increased competition from neighbouring tax havens, such as the Cayman Islands. The Bahamas' fiscal deficit jumped eight-fold between 1986 and 1989, was cut by a half in 1990 and then almost doubled again in 1991 and 1992. Foreign debt has doubled in the past three years. Representatives of the opposition party have suggested that Mr Ingraham has been overstating the problem and has not taken account of the economic problems which forced Sir Lynden's administration into extensive deficit financing. 'He is still campaigning for an election he has already won,' said one. There are no quick solutions available to the prime minister. Ironically, he has been forced into much the same action taken by Sir Lynden, saying: 'A further Dollars 100m must be borrowed as a matter of the most extreme urgency.' He also announced that the government is divesting some enterprises including one hotel and some port facilities, and will seek to manage the country's accounts with 'fiscal rectitude'. The prime minister has ruled out changes to the country's tax regime, in which incomes are not taxed, and has instead suggested increased efficiency in tax collection methods, especially for customs duties which account for about 70 per cent of the government's revenue. There appears little he can do immediately about Bahamasair, the troubled state-owned airline, for which the government is providing Dollars 51m in financial support by June. The government is also concerned about loans of Dollars 150m contracted by the state-owned Hotel Corporation, the largest hotel owner in the country, and the need for another Dollars 28m to complete the expansion of the international airport, as the Dollars 58m budgeted for it had been spent. Mr Ingraham's charges of 'impropriety' are unlikely to excite the 245,000 people of the Bahamas. In his last decade in office, Sir Lynden was frequently forced to defend the government, and himself, against local and American accusations of benefiting from narcotics trafficking and money laundering. Sir Lynden has always rejected the accusations, but Mr Ingraham's latest charge that Dollars 8m had been taken from the national coffers and secreted in a bank in the US will again force Sir Lynden on the defensive. The prime minister told parliament that the money had been put into 'someone's personal account'. He mentioned no names.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Arts: OUT goes Michelangelo, IN comes the glib idea - William Packer plumbs the Arts Council's strange philosophy IN ITS eager, condescending way, the pamphlet for children that accompanies the Arts Council's exhibition Recent British Sculpture, a selection of works lately acquired for its, that is to say our collection, says it all. The introductory paragraph is itself a collector's item. 'What is Sculpture?', it asks itself. 'Once upon a time this question was quite easy to answer. A sculpture was solid and three-dimensional, not flat like a picture. It could be big or small, but it generally stood on a plinth, not on the floor. It was usually carved from stone or wood, or modelled in clay and cast in metal. Sculpture was mostly about people and animals - people in particular. It didn't move. Not any more.' The statement is breath-taking in its complacency. Thus is written off in an easy, thoughtless antithesis the universal tradition that by now should embrace the cumulate experience of the millenia, from the earliest of civilisations to our own, from the Willendorf Venus to Henry Moore, from Easter Island to the bronzes of Benin, the great Buddha of Nara, the tombs of the Pharaohs, the totems of the Pacific, the figures of Michelangelo. Plinths indeed: people and animals forsooth: so that is what it was about all that time. That such simple-minded fatuities should be uttered in the name of education is merely the measure of how far we have come. That is not to say that all the works on show are therefore without merit. The point lies rather with the critical assumption behind the selection, and the clear signal given to young minds, that we need no longer bother ourselves with all that boring, old-fashioned, disciplined, difficult, dusty stuff. Chuck it all out along with the life-model, the cast from the Antique, the museum cabinet. Nowadays anything goes: do your own thing: art is whatever you like to say art is: what fun. It is the philosophy of play-pit self-expression, visual joke and glib idea as substitute for the creative and the profound. No monuments to mortality here, but plenty of bright ideas. Richard Wentworth is one of the most thoughtful sculptors we have, with an aesthete's fastidiousness in the formal control and disposition of his materials, and a surrealist's wit in the redeployment of given objects. His 'Toy' has a sardine-tin set as it were floating in a now solid galvanised tub, an object as simple as it is ambiguous and imaginatively satisfying. 'Richard Wentworth', we are told, 'says that he thinks of his studio . . . as 'the playroom where I'm not told to tidy up''. He should be ashamed of himself. Bill Woodrow's black crow tearing at carrion is as elegantly clever a thing as he, so clever a sculptor, has ever done. David Nash's small and rudely carved 'Coal Stove' is a nicely contradictory conceit, an image at once purposeful and impractical. Less convincing and more literary in her ambiguity, Cornelia Parker has made several hundred lead casts of a Big Ben souvenir which she has arranged in a cone-like heap that spreads out in neat, widening circles on the floor - 'Fleeting Monument', time passing, mutability, leaden symbolism. This is indeed a literary, concept-driven collection. Ron Haselden, with his clicking, flickering, electronic 'Red Nose', an engagingly casual assemblage of eviscerated cameras and naked circuitry, hints, we are told in the catalogue, 'at deeper concerns and questions the role of the camera - a machine . . . which is sometimes said to 'capture' its subjects.' On we go: 'Indirect Lighting, like much of Julian Opie's work, treads a very wary path between the languages of high art and of mass design.' 'Stephen Hughes ('Container One') has explored the concept of containment in various materials and forms over a number of years.' 'Territorial explores Veronica Ryan's concern with boundaries and the edges of things.' Such is the current jargon of justification. Sculpture is no longer simply what it is, ambiguous, intuitive, inarticulate, magical. It must be about this, concerned with that, take an interest, explore ideas, strike an attitude. Antony Gormley's 'Five Fishes' consists of five long objects, such as a truncheon or a blade, each encased in lead. Lead, he tells us, 'is a material of transmutation and insulation: death to the object - a removal from sight to be reborn in another place of the mind where differentiation has not occurred . . . This work abolishes time by removing objects from its flow and represents a moment of Adamic naming where evil coexists with good.' How silly of me: of course it does. From all this earnest company, Dhruva Mistry stands apart, the one sculptor allowed to acknowledge the wider tradition of the figure and the humane response, ancient Indian at one with modern and European. Here, even on the smallest scale, in his fractured carving of a reclining woman, he achieves the monumental. The sculptor is free, of course, to use whatever materials he feels appropriate to his purposes, and in whatever way. It is only the narrow critical exclusivity that is worrying, as though to say: only such an approach or interest is valid. 'During the last decade', says the catalogue, 'British sculpture has received international acclaim.' Did it then receive none in the 1940s, with Moore and Hepworth, none in the 1950s with Turnbull, Paolozzi, Armitage, Butler, none in the 1960s with Caro, King, Tucker, none in the 1970s with Long and Flanagan? So where in the collection are all the others, the carvers and modellers among them, even now still hard at work? 'Such a wealth of talent has emerged of late that it has been impossible for the Collection to acquire work by all artists of importance.' So that is all right then. Recent British Sculpture from the Arts Council Collection - Royal Festival Hall to Oct 3. Then: Coventry, Hull, Llandudno, Eastbourne, Bournemouth, Bath, Plymouth, Aberystwyth: sponsored by British Telecom.</p>

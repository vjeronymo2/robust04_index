The ministry will accomplish the preparation of budget  proposals for 1994 within the next few days to submit them for  consideration by the government and, later, by the new Russian  parliament. The draft budget will strictly conform to the  strategy of tackling inflation and restructuring the economy  pursued by the president and the government, the Finance  Ministry pointed out.    The this year's budget expenditures will be severely  restricted due to limited revenues. At the same time, the  Finance Ministry believes the draft budget is quite realistic  and feasible. If approved by the State Duma, it will be a good  basis for a further financial stabilization and the necessary  adjustment of the social and economic policies.    The Finance Ministry points out that the central financial  problem of the first quarter of 1994 is the last year's debts.  The ministry said it was taking all possible measures to find  additional sources of incomes for their reimbursement.</p>

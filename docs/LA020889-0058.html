			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Plessey Co. rejected as "outrageous" a revised proposal by Britain's General  Electric Co. and West Germany's Siemens AG aimed at obtaining British  government approval for a joint bid for Plessey. GEC and Siemens announced new  proposals for dividing up various Plessey businesses should their takeover bid  for the electronics and defense contractor succeed. The revised plan, submitted  to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which is investigating the  $2.96-billion bid for Plessey, was an attempt to calm British government  concerns about maintaining competition in the electronics industry.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE POLITICS OF LEMONS;  </P> <P> A GROUP OF GROWERS' REPRESENTATIVES SET WEEKLY SHIPPING QUOTAS. IN EFFECT, THEY  CONTROL PRICE.  </P> <P> The summer's lemon harvest is drawing to a close throughout Ventura County, the  nation's leading production area, as skeleton crews comb the orchards for the  season's few remaining ripe fruits.  </P> <P> Growers in towns such as Saticoy and Santa Paula are left to congratulate  themselves on one of the most successful years of the past decade. The demand  for fresh lemons is high and prices have approached record levels.  </P> <P> With little disruption, the harvest will now move into the desert groves of  California's Coachella Valley and Arizona's Yuma County. There, farm workers  will continue to pick fruit for much of the fall.  </P> <P> Lemons are readily available throughout the year because of just such varied  plantings, each located in different climatic regions. Other prime growing  areas still waiting to produce in the 1989-1990 growing season include the San  Joaquin Valley and San Diego County.  </P> <P> Yet, an important factor in the well-being of the lemon crop results from  committee meetings that regularly take place far from the widely dispersed  orchards.  </P> <P> Each Tuesday morning, a number of growers and processors gather to discuss the  lemon industry's fate in a most unlikely place:the ninth floor of a dingy  office building in downtown Los Angeles' fashion district.  </P> <P> There, in a smoke-filled conference room, the Lemon Administrative Committee  meets to determine how much of the crop will enter U.S. markets the following  week.  </P> <P> The group, which is sanctioned under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act  of 1937, has jurisdiction over all lemons grown in California and Arizona, or  about 97% of the U.S. total. (The remaining fraction is raised in Florida,  which operates free of the Los Angeles-based committee.)  </P> <P> Granted, lemons are far from a dietary staple and are not consumed in the same  manner as most other fruits. They are used, instead, as a garnish, flavoring  agent or baking ingredient. As a result, how a labyrinth of regulations governs  the crop probably has mattered little to the public in the past.  </P> <P> But lemons have shared in the growing interest in all fresh produce. And not  only have consumers' lemon purchases risen as a result, but so have those by  the restaurant and institutional food-service industries.  </P> <P> In an annual report filed last month with Agriculture Secretary Clayton  Yeutter, the Lemon Administration Committee defined its mission.  </P> <P> "An area where the lemon grower can exert influence in the distribution and  sales system is that portion of the crop reaching the domestic market. He can .  . . make sure that domestic shipments do not reach a level that will cause  fire-sale pricing and that places so much fruit on the domestic market that the  normal flow of harvesting and packing is interrupted," the report states. "It  is in the growers' interest that such interruptions do not happen and it is the  goal of the Lemon Administrative Committee to see that they do not happen."  </P> <P> At first glance, the prospect of stable supplies and prices would appear  welcome in a grower community too often beset by boom or bust cycles. But the  committee has some harsh critics.  </P> <P> "This system is a disservice to the consumer," said Skip Pescosolido, co-owner  of Sequoia Orange Co. in Exeter, Calif., who favors deregulation of the lemon  industry. "At least 100,000 cartons of lemons that could be sold are prevented  from reaching the market each year. That is a disservice."  </P> <P> Even so, little is heard about the committee that determines the fate of an  estimated $210-million lemon crop.  </P> <P> Although its meetings are open to the public, the committee works in anonymity,  making decisions that affect 60,000 acres of lemon orchards. It's one of the  few agricultural groups that uses its authority under the federal marketing  order to, in essence, centrally plan a food commodity. (Navel and Valencia  oranges are the only other crops with similar provisions in their grower-voted  charters.)  </P> <P> Few people in or out of the lemon business fully understand the committee's  complex inner workings and jargon. A number of produce industry representatives  declined to even comment on the committee's work because of its intricacies.  Thus the "politics of lemons" are left to some of the industry's major players.  </P> <P> Foremost among these is Sunkist Growers Inc., a Sherman Oaks-based cooperative  whose membership represents about 65% of all lemons grown in California and  Arizona. In 1988, the co-op reported about $140 million from the sale of fresh  lemons, both in the domestic and export markets, as well as those diverted to  other industrial uses.  </P> <P> Individual growers are each empowered to elect representatives to the  administrative committee under the marketing order that established the group.  However, the seats are apportioned so that Sunkist controls six, while an equal  number are allotted to independent growers and packers.  </P> <P> The final member, the chairman, says he does not vote when the two sides are  evenly split. Thus, six votes are enough to control the committee's agenda.  </P> <P> A Sunkist representative downplays the co-op's power on the committee.  </P> <P> "We have more of the lemon production than we have representatives on the  committee," said Kurt Anderson, a Sunkist vice president. "We've never asked  for more than what the original marketing order provided for and that was no  more than half."  </P> <P> The focus of the committee's work is a weekly recommendation on shipping limits  for fresh lemons, called the prorate allowance:a key decision for a number of  reasons.  </P> <P> By determining the amount of lemons that go into wholesale and retail channels,  the group is also conversely deciding how much will go into the byproducts  markets for industrial uses such as juice concentrate or lemon oil for cleaning  products. While fruit entering the fresh market can be profitable, the crop  diverted to the byproducts industry, about 36% of the total, is usually sold at  a financial loss to growers.  </P> <P> The prorate number eventually agreed upon by the group is forwarded to the U.S.  Department of Agriculture in Washington for approval.  </P> <P> The agency, more often than not, routinely OKs the group's recommendation.  Pescosolido says that USDA is just a "rubber stamp" for the committee.  </P> <P> Even if the USDA infrequently adjusts the prorate recommendation, the agency  still plays an active role in monitoring the group, a USDA spokesman said.  Further, the agency has a representative attend every committee meeting.  </P> <P> "They (the committee) know it's being regulated and watched," said Clarence  Steinberg, a USDA public information officer in Washington. "They play the game  properly. They know they are being scrutinized."  </P> <P> David A. Beavers, the committee manager, says that during the past 10 years the  USDA has changed the group's shipping recommendation less than 10% of the time.  </P> <P> "Logically speaking, the committee is representative of the lemon industry,"  Beavers said. "The USDA looks at the committee as knowledgeable of weekly  conditions. They rely on that, but it doesn't mean that they don't ever  question our figures."  </P> <P> The prorate allowance, since it determines the supply availability, indirectly  sets the wholesale price for lemons in this country. Retail prices are set  accordingly and have hovered as high as 99 cents a pound in the past year.  Controlling supply is said to be necessary because of the frequent surplus of  lemons.  </P> <P> "Prorate stabilizes the market," said Glenn A. Miller, president of the Saticoy  Lemon Assn. in Santa Paula. "When the market is flooded, then the bottom falls  out. The last time that happened was in 1986, and growers didn't do well.  Neither did consumers."  </P> <P> But Pescosolido, who owns 400 acres of lemon orchards in the San Joaquin  Valley, said that 1986 proved that deregulation works.  </P> <P> "Three years ago, because of a short crop, there was no prorate used for over a  year. The returns to the grower were the highest in 25 years and in 1986 they  sold more of their crop than usual," he said. "I refuse to believe that prices  will crash (if shipping limits are lifted)."  </P> <P> Miller, whose group is affiliated with Sunkist, said that the industry is just  now synchronizing supply and demand from a glut of lemons more than 20 years  ago.  </P> <P> "There was tremendous overplanting in the early 1960s," he said. "At that time,  there were 90,000 acres of lemons. Now there are about 60,000 acres, which is a  much better balance."  </P> <P> The huge jump in acreage occurred when growers mistakenly anticipated a boom in  lemon exports to Japan. Although about 22% of the current crop is exported, it  is far less than original expectations.  </P> <P> The stability that Miller and others favor in the lemon industry, however, is a  magnet for criticism.  </P> <P> "When you control the volume of fruit that is shipped domestically, then that  will obviously affect the price," said Steve Moore, an organic lemon grower in  Ventura who has battled with the committee over limits placed on the shipment  of his crop. "This prorate system does not allow the free market to function,  and I don't think that is a benefit to the consumer or to me as a grower. It is  a benefit to the large corporate growers that prefer a stable system. . . .  They prefer no swings in the marketplace."  </P> <P> Other industry representatives say that if the prorate regulations were  removed, then produce channels would be flooded with fruit during certain times  of the year. Such a development might financially squeeze growers into ruin.  </P> <P> "The prorate has proven to be a very excellent mechanism for supplying the  market on a regular basis to the benefit of the consumer and the grower," said  Anderson.  </P> <P> Another lemon processor, David Giller, Sun World Inc. vice president of citrus  marketing operations, supports the prorate regulation, but expresses some  reservations about the system.  </P> <P> "Our feeling is that the (prorate) is overused," said Giller. "We deal with  other commodities that are not regulated and it is the marketer's job (not a  committee's) to sell the fruit. . . . Some people feel that the consumer is not  well served (by the committee) and there is some basis for that."  </P> <P> Giller also said he feels the prorate controls have limited innovation in the  lemon industry and created complacency. His firm has developed a number of  significant new produce items, such as the seedless watermelon and the Le Rouge  Royale red pepper, breakthroughs that would have been unlikely under a  regulated system such as that in place for lemons.  </P> <P> "We could never have developed the seedless watermelon under this system. It  stifles creativity," he said.  </P> <P> The prorate, and the lemon marketing order that created it, have nothing to do  with product innovation, said Miller of Saticoy Lemon.  </P> <P> "Are innovative things being restricted? That's not true," he said, citing his  firm's effort to sell more lemons by developing a mesh bag for use by retailers  that holds several lemons at once. "We're retailing more fruit. In fact, 25%  more fruit is being shipped now than there was five years ago."  </P> <P> There is little chance that the current lemon marketing order, and its prorate  provision, will be changed any time soon. The USDA held hearings on the matter  in 1985 and a set of revised regulations resulted. The proposal offered several  options in place of the current system, but never advanced beyond the  preliminary rule-making stages.  </P> <P> For any revision of the marketing order to occur, or for the prorate to be  eliminated, the lemon growers would have to vote on the matter. Even if such a  vote were taken, it is unlikely that the current system would be drastically  changed.  </P> <P> There are some external factors, however, that may prompt a review of lemon  prorate. Primary among these is that California and Arizona growers face  increasing competition from oversees operations, including Chile, Spain and the  Bahamas.  </P> <P> In a recent Lemon Administrative Committee meeting, representatives discussed  the fact that a major shipment of Bahamian lemons had been distributed in San  Francisco at $10 per carton less than locally grown fruit.  </P> <P> "The West Coast entry of Bahamian lemons was not a problem in the past," said  Beavers. "Their growing costs are less than those in California and Arizona but  their volume has never been substantial. They ship only 600 to 700 carloads of  fruit, whereas California and Arizona in a normal year ship 45,000 to 57,000  cars of lemons."  </P> <P> In fact, the annual report sent by the committee to the USDA addressed the  issue of foreign competition.  </P> <P> "The California/Arizona lemon . . . has major competitors in other countries.  Spain has largely taken over the European market and at times has made  incursions into the Eastern United States. Chile has made efforts to move into  the summer lemon market in the same manner it has moved into the soft fruit  market in the winter," the report stated. "Each of these countries has distinct  advantages over the United States industry in terms of lower costs and cheaper  labor. Only a stable and economically profitable industry can prevent such  incursions."  </P> <P> In the committee's view, an "economically profitable industry" can be achieved  only with ceilings placed on the number of lemons shipped in this country.  </P></p>

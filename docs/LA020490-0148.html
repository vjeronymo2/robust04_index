			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW MEXICO STATE GETS EVEN WITH LONG BEACH, 104-91  </P> <P> The big rematch was over early. With about nine minutes left in the first half  Saturday, the raucous, revenge-minded 12,599 New Mexico State fans at the Pan  American Center were already shouting toward the Cal State Long Beach bench,  "Go start the bus."  </P> <P> It seemed reasonable advice for the 49ers, who had just gone through a  four-minute nightmare in which they were outscored, 17-0.  </P> <P> That run increased a 23-18 New Mexico State lead to 40-18, and from there the  Aggies eased to a 104-91 victory over the only team that has defeated them in  the Big West Conference this season.  </P> <P> "We didn't like losing to them down there," New Mexico State Coach Neil  McCarthy said, referring to the 49ers' 72-56 victory Jan. 15 in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Aggie guard Randy Brown, who converted a steal into a breakaway dunk during  that stunning stretch midway through the opening half, pinpointed the reason  for the Aggies' success: "We just ate their press up, slicing through for easy  baskets. I'm surprised they kept it on. I guess that's their bread and butter."  </P> <P> Before the run was over, Brown added four consecutive free throws after Long  Beach Coach Joe Harrington was assessed two successive technical fouls for his  complaints about the officiating.  </P> <P> "When a game gets out of control, it's hard to regain control," Harrington  said. "I thought a quick technical might help. It didn't, so I got another  one."  </P> <P> The Aggies, who never trailed, were just getting started. They sped to leads of  58-29 and 60-31 before settling for a 63-31 halftime lead. It was the most  points New Mexico State had scored in a first half in 13 years.  </P> <P> The many easy shots the Aggies got were reflected in their 64% field-goal  shooting in the first half.  </P> <P> "New Mexico State played like a nationally ranked team tonight," Harrington  said.  </P> <P> The Aggies, who have not broken into the top 25 this season, are 18-2 overall  and 9-1 in the Big West. They are 12-0 at home and have a four-game winning  streak.  </P> <P> And they won without center James Anderson, their leading scorer and rebounder,  who had returned to East Chicago, Ind., for his grandmother's funeral.  </P> <P> But Jason Trask and Chris Hickman filled in for Anderson and combined for 19  points and 12 rebounds.  </P> <P> William Benjamin, who made 13 of 16 free throws, led the Aggies with 18 points.  Brown and Keith Hill each scored 16, Michael New had 15 and Reggie Jordan 14.  </P> <P> Long Beach used a flurry of three-point shots to get within 10 twice in the  last minute.  </P> <P> "We were too far behind," said Harrington, whose team fell to 13-6 and 6-5.  "It's hard to get something going when they go to the line so much."  </P> <P> New Mexico State made 32 of 52 foul shots, but the game got somewhat closer  because the Aggies made only 17 of 33 from the line in the second half.  </P> <P> "When we get up on a team we keep the score down by missing free throws,"  McCarthy said. "If we have a weakness, it's that we don't have a killer  instinct."  </P> <P> Lucious Harris, despite eight-of-23 shooting from the field, led the 49ers with  18 points. Kenny Jarvis and Mike Masucci each scored 16.  </P> <P> The Aggies, who had claimed they were tired from playing four games in eight  days when they lost at Long Beach, were still fresh at the end this time,  becoming the first team this season to score more than 100 points against the  49ers.  </P></p>

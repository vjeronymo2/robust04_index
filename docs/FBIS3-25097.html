Speaking to the Portuguese news agency,  LUSA, Goncalves said: The two sides are cooperating and trying  to ensure the continuity of the process. On 13 February, Gen.  Goncalves, a Brazilian, ends his 12-month contract with the  United Nations. He noted that he would only request an  extension of his mandate if there were a crisis in the  Mozambican peace process. He said the Mozambican process  differs a great deal from the Angolan. Goncalves said  Mozambicans are anxious about peace, the former warring factions  no longer receive foreign assistance, UN troops are in place,  and the Mozambique National Resistance is not the National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola.</p>

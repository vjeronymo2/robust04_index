			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> LIBRARY REOPENING SCHEDULED JUNE 25  </P> <P> After being closed since December because of remodeling and a series of mishaps  with replacement carpeting, the Garden Grove Regional Library is now scheduled  to reopen June 25.  </P> <P> The library was supposed to reopen Feb. 13, but a defective carpet caused that  deadline to be missed.  </P> <P> A second reopening target date of March 26 also passed when another replacement  carpet proved to be a mismatch.  </P> <P> Gary C. Gray, chief of facilities and construction for the county General  Services Agency, said, "We received the carpet on May 1, and the installation  and all other physical improvements should be completed by June 1."  </P> <P> That done, the staff must still complete its work, including the reorganization  of books and other materials at the library at 11200 Stanford Ave.  </P> <P> For the last five months, people have been directed to the two smaller  libraries in the city, at 9182 Chapman Ave. and 11962 Bailey St. in west Garden  Grove.

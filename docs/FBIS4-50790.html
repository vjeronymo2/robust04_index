			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kang Xinwen (1660 2450 2429)] </F>   [Text] Brussels, 19 May (XINHUA) -- Visiting Li Ruihuan,  chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC] National Committee, met with Belgian National  Bank Governor Verplaetse here today. They held cordial and  friendly talks.    Verplaetse extended a warm welcome to Li Ruihuan's visit to  Belgium, and enthusiastically commended China on its major  achievements in reform and opening up. He said: China's rapid  and sustained economic development has made China "a model of  economic miracles in the Far East."    CPPCC Chairman Li Ruihuan indicated: Since carrying out  reform and opening up, China has truly made satisfactory  progress in developing its economy. However, it has also  encountered some problems in the process. To resolve these  problems, China needs to not only establish and improve laws and  regulations and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control,  it also needs to improve qualities of all the Chinese people and  to enhance all its nationalities' adaptability.    Li Ruihuan said: China is a country with a lot of people and  it has a very arduous task to develop its economy. Therefore,  while facing the need to import advanced Western technology and  equipment, it also needs to learn from Western countries'  experiences in regulating and controlling the market. He  expressed the hope that Sino-Belgian bankers will increase  bilateral exchanges and promote economic and trade cooperation  between the two countries.</p>

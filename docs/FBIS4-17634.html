			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr -- The Federation Council welcomes  the political will of the Russian Federation president,  expressed in his message on strengthening the Russian state, to  continue the policy of reforms and to unite constructive forces  in society for creative work for the good of the country and its  citizens. The upper chamber of parliament expressed this stance  in the Federation Council's address to the Russian Federation  president in response to his message. The chamber adopted the  address at its sitting today.    Deputies have informed Boris Yeltsin that they have defined  "measures which when implemented will promote steady interaction  between branches of authority in the interests of democracy."    Deputies stressed that "they regard the treaty on achieving  civic accord in Russia as an important step toward implementing  the president's message," since it allows "obligations  undertaken by all branches of authority, parties and public  organizations to be placed under democratic surveillance."    The document addressed by the parliamentarians to the head  of  state stresses that they are counting on a responsible attitude  on the part of the the president and government towards topical  problems raised by the Federation Council.    Deputies note with regret that so far the chamber's appeals  have not always met with a proper response from the executive  authority.</p>

The station will probably be  known as Radio Vryheid [Radio Freedom]. The foundations for the  radio mast were laid this morning by workers supervised by Mr.  Manie Malan of the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National  Front]. This will be the second right-wing station in the  [Orange] Free State. Radio Pretoria has already been operating  for a while from Donkerhoek, and Radio Koppies [small hills)  began transmitting about a month ago.    Radio Freedom will be received as far afield as Warrington  in  the northern Cape, Welkom in the northern Free State, and  Edenburg in the southern Free State.    Meanwhile, the chairman of the management committee of Radio  Pretoria, the Reverend Mossie van den Berg, has said that there  is no direct link between Radio Pretoria, Radio Vryheid and  Radio Koppies. He denied reports that Radio Pretoria was  broadcasting from another transmitter on the West Rand.</p>

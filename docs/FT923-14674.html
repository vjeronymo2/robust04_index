			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Sterling in a bind The trouble with disappointed expectations in financial markets is that the mood can simply end up worse. Thus, the FT-SE not only ended up 7 points lower yesterday than it was before Friday's misplaced excitement on base rates. Equally worrying was the exceptionally low volume. The authorities' limited room for manoeuvre must now be crystal clear. There is little scope for rate cuts while Maastricht doubts persist and Germany refuses to relax its policy. Even after the Bundesbank does eventually act, the UK may be more constrained than many now suppose. The differential between UK base rates and the German Lombard rate has already narrowed by a full percentage point since December. It may need to widen again once Germany does start to cut. The UK could use that opportunity to move to narrow bands within the ERM, though it could still scarcely cut rates faster than the Bundesbank. There is little evidence to suggest a lower Lombard rate soon, or that German relaxation will be aggressive when it comes. Expectations for the UK economy, which have already been lowered for 1992, need to be reduced for 1993 too. The temptation is to assume that the UK government cannot wait much longer for recovery. It would need an excuse, though, like the collapse of Maastricht or an Italian realignment, to justify devaluation. Italy's rate increase over the weekend suggests the latter is unlikely in the short run, but forward markets are discounting a lira devaluation in little more than three months. While such uncertainties are in the air, pressure on sterling could unsettle the gilts market as well.</p>

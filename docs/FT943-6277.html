			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Rabobank up 11% at halfway Rabobank, the Dutch co-operative bank, lifted net profit by 11.4 per cent to Fl 654m (Dollars 370m) in the first half from Fl 587m a year earlier, due to strong growth in lending to the corporate sector. Interest income rose by 7.4 per cent to Fl 3.07bn. Rabobank said continuing economic recovery had led to a higher rate of investment by corporate clients in trade, industry and services. Commission income rose by 12.2 per cent to Fl 553m, with much of the growth due to securities business and to demand for investment funds managed by the Robeco Group. Rabobank's trading on its own account was hit by the sudden increase in interest rates early in 1994. Its results on financial transactions fell into a loss of Fl 19m from a profit of Fl 129m a year earlier.</p>

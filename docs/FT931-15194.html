			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories reduce Labour poll lead LABOUR'S opinion-poll lead has been cut to 4 per cent in a survey for today's Guardian. The ICM survey shows the Conservatives as being considered to have the best economic policies - recapturing the advantage they lost as a result of Black Wednesday. Voting intention figures put the Tories at 38 per cent, up 5 per cent since December; Labour 42 per cent, down 3 per cent; Liberal Democrats 15 per cent, down 1 per cent and others 5 per cent, down 1 per cent. Just 24 per cent of interviewees said the Conservatives had the best policies for the economy, but this was up 5 per cent from December and enough to put them 1 per cent in front of Labour on the issue.</p>

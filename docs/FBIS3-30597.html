The presidium asked not  only for the names of reporters who deal with security issues  but also for their pen names or the indentation symbols they  use. According to police spokesman Ales Svoboda, the requests  have only been made by telephone so far; there is no written  evidence of them. The spokesman said yesterday that the Police  Presidium only wanted to update the current list of journalists.  He denied any claims that the collection of names and symbols of  the reporters was to serve for their persecution.    "It is only so that we know whom to invite to news  conferences, for instance," he said. According to Svoboda, it  is becoming ever more frequent that people call the police  claiming to be journalists.</p>

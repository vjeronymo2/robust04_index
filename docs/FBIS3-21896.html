The good news is that the increase "is  accounted for by activity in drugs interdiction which resulted  in a total of 894 offences being detected (in that category)  compared with 606 in 1992," said RCIP Commissioner Alan  Ratcliffe.    In reviewing the 1993 crime statistics at a press conference  Thursday morning, the Commissioner conceded that the 3,298  offences reported in 1993 "is a lot of crime."    At the same time, he was optimistic because the rise in  crime  was directly attributable to drug arrests and offences. He noted  it was "gratifying" that more than 75 percent of crimes (2,532)  were solved. "But there's still no room for complacency," he  added. The 77 percent clearup rate is a 10-percent increase from  1992, he pointed out. Police clear a crime when a suspect is  arrested and charged, not when a conviction occurs. [passage  omitted]    In discussing the drugs problem, the Commissioner made it  clear that the police statistics "only show how successful we  have been in tackling the drugs problem." The statistics do not  show the overall usage or sale.    "There is evidence there are far more drugs on the island  than have ever been here before," he said.    He and Drugs Squad Superintendent Trevor Cutts are convinced  Cayman has become a major transshipment point for drugs. "Drugs  are shipped here to go north. Some do find the local market, but  it's impossible that all seized drugs are for the domestic  market," said Commissioner Ratcliffe.    He based that upon a discovery rate estimated at 10 percent  of the total and the fact that police seized 4,330 pounds of  ganja (marijuana) and 52 pounds of cocaine in 1993. "If (those  figures) are 10 percent then that becomes "worrying." And, he  pointed out, that's just what police seized. It does not include  Customs seizures in 1993.    Superintendent Cutts concurred, saying Cayman "is like a  giant warehouse" for drugs coming from Jamaica headed for the  United States. When asked what the police are doing to stop the  flow of illegal drugs into Cayman, he deferred to Customs.  "Customs is the primary agency ... to stop drugs entering."    He praised his Drugs Squad staff, noting that the 14 people  on the Squad "work long hours," and often become stressed out in  the battle against drugs.    Sometimes it might appear the Drugs Squad is fighting a  "losing battle" said Mr. Cutts. "But you try and keep your  finger in the dike."    "Make no mistake, I don't think we are fighting a losing  battle. This is a beautiful island and it can be kept that way,"  if people work together to eliminate the drugs problem, he said.  "Solve our problem here. Look at the people arrested and their  nationality."</p>

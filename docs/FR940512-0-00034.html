			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge is probably the best of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the thermal refuges and undoubtedly the only one capable of supplying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all the needs for over 200 manatees through the winter. The springs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are fed by underwater artesian springs deep under the insulating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface of the earth, holding the temperature constant. Unlike  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industrial discharges, this natural water source is not subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanical breakdowns or power failures. Unlike most artificial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refuges, a readily available food source is available close by and in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abundant supply. Bengtson (1981) observed manatees remaining in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thermal refuges for up to a week without feeding during cold spells. It appears it was more energy efficient for them to fast rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk feeding in colder waters. In Crystal River, fasting is probably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rarely necessary for long periods, and the enormous outflow from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> springs can moderate the temperature of much of the bay, depending on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tidal and wind factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If left alone, manatees would use the resources of Kings Bay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> according to their individual needs. However, research has shown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the presence of boaters and divers causes manatees to leave the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spring heads in favor of the sanctuaries regardless of weather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions. On days when there is low diver turnout, a greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proportion of manatees remain in the springs (Buckingham 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Observations of other wintering areas, such as Blue Spring State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Park, show that, left to their own devices, most manatees will remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in warm water throughout the day during cold weather periods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Activities that cause manatees to leave a natural thermal refuge can,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, be considered ``harassment'' because those activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interfere with normal ``sheltering'' habits of the animal. Harassment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of manatees is a violation of both the Endangered Species Act and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marine Mammal Protection Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, manatees are able to move away from divers by going  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into three sanctuaries, Banana Island, Sunset Shores, and Magnolia  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Springs, established in 1980. The Banana Island sanctuary is located  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> near the main spring, Kings Spring, and is relatively warm in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relation to surrounding waters. Sunset Shores sanctuary is still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the southern part of the bay and provides a feeding and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resting area in fairly warm water. The Magnolia Springs sanctuary is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located in a canal development adjacent to Kings Bay and contains a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smaller spring. Since 1980, the number of manatees using Kings Bay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has increased from 100 to 246 in 1990. Although it might appear from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the increasing numbers of manatees that additional protection is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed, this is not the case. As manatee habitat is lost elsewhere  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the Florida peninsula, Kings Bay is becoming more important.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kings Bay is one of the last  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> natural <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  warm-water areas with abundant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food resources. Additional sanctuaries are essential to insure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate undisturbed natural areas in Kings Bay where manatees may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet their needs, including warm water, food, and areas for resting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and socializing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The economic importance of Kings Bay and especially the refuge's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> main spring to Crystal River and Citrus County centers around  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recreational SCUBA diving, snorkeling and boating. The area is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> internationally known as a desirable location for winter diving. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presence of manatees creates a special attraction which dive shop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owners exploit by advertising their facilities as a place where one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can ``swim with the manatees''. The tourism industry created by divers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coming to Crystal River is significant and total sales at five dive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shops and three motels more than doubled between 1980 and 1986, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ``manatee season'' accounting for 28 to 53 percent of their sales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the entire year (Milon in prep). Due in part to national and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> international publicity manatees have received in recent years, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of divers visiting Kings Bay has increased to about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 60,000&hyph;80,000 in the winter of 1990&hyph;91, double the number in 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FWS unpublished data). This rapid increase in popularity is likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to continue, significantly affecting manatees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service intends to provide manatees needed winter protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without adversely affecting diving and other waterborne activities so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important to Crystal River's economy. Aerial survey data available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on manatee distribution within Kings Bay suggest that strategically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> placed manatee sanctuaries could provide manatees warm-water refugia  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and feeding and resting areas free from harassment without causing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major disruption of current recreational patterns (Kochman  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1985, Buckingham 1990). It is important to note that, although a few  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local business people feared losses of revenue following the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of the sanctuary additions, no evidence of any losses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been observed during the 2 years the sanctuaries were in effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under emergency rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Service, by this rule, is expanding the sanctuary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area in Kings Bay to provide manatees additional undisturbed habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the cold weather months. These sanctuaries will exclude all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waterborne activities by humans from November 15 through March 31  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each year. The total sanctuary area, consisting of less than 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the area of Kings Bay, allows the remaining 90 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the bay to remain open to recreational and commercial waterborne  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities. The sanctuary areas were carefully selected to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum protection for manatees and minimum impact on divers. Public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> input into the selection of sanctuary areas was obtained during a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workshop held in Crystal River on March 21, 1991. The Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that, given these added refugia, manatees will not be forced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to leave the warm water necessary for their survival and will be able  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to feed, rest, and socialize without being harassed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sanctuary addition at Magnolia Springs adds 1.5 acres to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous Magnolia Springs Sanctuary. This short, horseshoe-shaped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section of canal joins a canal that feeds directly into Kings Bay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The addition extends the protected area around a significant artesian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spring within the original sanctuary, providing additional protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the small but consistent number of manatees, most notably cows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and calves, that use the area for giving birth, resting, and as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warm-water refuge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

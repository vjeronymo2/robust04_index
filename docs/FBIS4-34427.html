			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace </F> and reconciliation in Chiapas, to President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari issued in Mexico City on 16 June]    [Text] Respected President:    In the past few years, I have served the Mexican Government  honestly. You know that during these years, I have dedicated my  best efforts to solving conflicts and finding honorable and  respectful results capable of strengthening society and its  institutions. In all cases, I was able to avoid violence. I  respected the rights of the parties involved. I was able to  restore calm and create new institutional answers and solutions,  always preferring political options to the use of force, which  is unleashed when there is no foresight, no power to resist, or  no courage.    In all cases, I sought results through a responsible  handling  of the administration and the economy. Public resources were  managed honestly. I have never mixed matters of public interest  with private business. I have never used my political position  to infringe on the rights of others or on their public image.  With your continuous support, I was able to face very complex  local and national problems. I committed myself to respecting  public liberties, and I fulfilled my commitment.    I am leaving the public administration after having held  important positions during times of tension. I do so with the  certainty that I have shown respect for the rights of citizens,  social organizations, labor unions, and the opposition, always  defending the institutions and public interest.    Now, just when we had secured, with your complete support, a  consolidated truce in Chiapas, my work has been publicly  criticized, and all sort of resources have been used to express  this position and turn it into a guideline.    In light of the fact that this guideline differs from the  political strategy for peace used in Chiapas, the possibility of  coordinating the efforts needed in the new phase in the terms I  have made public has been eliminated by reason of the nature of  the current Mexican political system.    To maintain the current situation, I suggested that you ask  the governor of Chiapas State to participate in some of the  tasks in which I have been involved. The professional  capabilities of your secretaries of finance, government, and  foreign relations will ensure that the Chiapas problems in their  areas of authority are given the appropriate attention.    Now, to secure more progress in the peace process, it is  necessary to consolidate the military aspect, to avoid  aggravating social conflicts in Chiapas, to carefully supervise  the political campaign in the Chiapas elections, and to design a  strategy for the new negotiation phase.    If the Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN] plans to  increase its political activities, as can be concluded from its  recent decisions, the only true way to protect the institutions  is to produce a new political strategy of decisions, agreements,  and broad new starts in favor of changes that are capable of  securing peace.    In addition, in order to eliminate the possibility that my  activities are used as a pretext by saying they generate unrest  when the fact is that I have dedicated my entire life to the  search for public peace, I hereby inform you of my decision to  withdraw from political life and dedicate myself to family life.  I inform you that I will not participate in any political  activity during the current administration.    I know I will be told that I am forsaking peace because no  result was secured. No. We have secured all the results  possible at this time. I am quitting the commission with a  firmer decision in favor of peace and democracy. My commitment  to dialogue with the EZLN and the search for a peaceful solution  is permanent.    I am taking your public and private word that I will  continue  to enjoy the guarantees I have as a Mexican citizen. I thank  you for your permanent support and friendship and have faith  that during the important period our country will experience,  electoral impartiality will be strengthened and doors will be  opened so civil society can help reduce tension and so there are  democratic changes capable of making society feel secure and of  producing economic growth.    I ask you to extend my gratitude to the Mexican Army for the  support it gave to the political solution in Chiapas. I also  ask you to thank the members of your cabinet for the support  given to my mission.    I close by wishing you and your appreciated family health  and  well-being.    Respectfully yours.

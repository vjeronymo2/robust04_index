H. Nistad  told ELTA.    He confirmed information of ELTA released earlier that the  assistance to Ignalina plant was suspended unless there is an  agreement with Belarus preventing claims of the country to  Swedish companies if a nuclear incident takes place in Ignalina.    "The position of Belarus is very undetermined", Nistad said.  Last November, Swedish Prime Minister appealed in written form  to his Belarusian counterpart asking to explain the reasons why  Belarus is not signing Vienna Convention on the civil  responsibility for nuclear damages and not approving a law on  nuclear energy. There is no answer so far, Nistad said.    Director of Belarusian Institute of Energy problems  Aleksandr  Mikhalevich said there were no principal obstacles to sign the  Vienna Convention or a bilateral agreement with Sweden. But  "there are no people specialized in nuclear energy neither in  Belarusian Government nor in Foreign Ministry", he said.</p>

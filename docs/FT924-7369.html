			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Letter: Moving a challenge from cities into the regions Sir, A number of our member companies regard City Challenge as one of the recent successes of the government. This has involved allocating some of the urban programme budget on a competitive basis. To succeed, local authorities had to present comprehensive, five-year regeneration strategies for (say) a housing estate. Only those bids which are jointly developed and owned by local business and community organisations succeeded. While it is too early to judge the long-term impact, City Challenge has already encouraged better dialogue and co-operation between government, local authorities, business and the community. In the current, difficult economic situation, many businesses and local authorities want to work together to improve local economic conditions. Why not adapt the City Challenge precedent and pilot a 'Regional Challenge'? This would involve concentrating planned expenditure, for example, of the new Urban Regeneration Agency and Michael Heseltine's One Stop Shops for business support, on those areas which have 'got their act together'. 'Regional Challenge' would reward those areas where business-led organisations such as the Training and Enterprise Councils, Chambers of Commerce and local enterprise agencies, together with local authorities, have developed a common strategy and plan for economic regeneration.

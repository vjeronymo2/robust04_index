			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIRM ACCUSED IN CHEMICAL DUMPING CASE;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: PAINT COMPANY HID HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THE GARBAGE FOR 2 1/2 YEARS,  D.A. SAYS. IT'S CALLED ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL CRIMES EVER  UNCOVERED BY THE COUNTY.  </P> <P> An Anaheim paint manufacturing plant and its top executive were charged Tuesday  with five felony counts for allegedly hiding several hundred thousand gallons  of hazardous chemicals in sawdust and secretly dumping it in the garbage for at  least 2 1/2 years.  </P> <P> W.C. Richards Co. saved several thousand dollars per week by disguising the  solvents and hauling them illegally to the county-run Brea-Olinda landfill,  said Deputy Dist. Atty. Gerald Johnston, an environmental-protection prosecutor  in the Orange County district attorney's office.  </P> <P> Environmental officials termed it one of the most premeditated and large-scale  cases they have seen in Orange County, and said the dumping endangers public  health because county dumps cannot safely handle chemicals. The carcinogenic  liquids can slowly leak into the ground water and release toxic fumes into the  air.  </P> <P> "This is one of the most serious environmental crimes we've had in Orange  County," Johnston said. "It's serious because they dumped a tremendous volume  of the stuff, and we have found these chemicals in the ground water  (underneath) the landfill. We can't say for sure it came from the dumping by  W.C. Richards, but it was the same chemicals."  </P> <P> The district attorney charged W.C. Richards Co., 1116 N. Olive St., and Marion  Bruce Hale, 44, of Brea, with five counts of unlawful disposal of hazardous  waste. Hale, a vice president of the Illinois-based paint company, is in charge  of the Anaheim manufacturing facility,  </P> <P> W.C. Richards employees told authorities that disguising and dumping the  chemicals was a common practice for five years, Johnston said, but the statute  of limitations restricts the case to crimes allegedly committed in the past  three years.  </P> <P> An arrest warrant on the criminal charges was issued Tuesday for Hale, who,  along with the corporation, could face fines up to $100,000 per day of  violation for 2 1/2 years, or about $90 million. Hale also could be sentenced  to serve up to six years in state prison if convicted.  </P> <P> "His attorney says he will turn himself in tomorrow," Johnston said.  </P> <P> Hale's attorney, John Burns of Los Angeles, said Tuesday that he could not  comment on the allegations.  </P> <P> "We haven't seen the complaint yet. All I can say is we're taking this matter  very seriously. We're working it out with the D.A. now," he said.  </P> <P> Attorneys for W.C. Richards Co., a paint manufacturer with headquarters in  Chicago, did not return telephone calls Tuesday.  </P> <P> Johnston said Hale directed his employees on a daily basis to mix unusable  sludge and solvents with sawdust, then cover it with ordinary garbage in trash  bins that were hauled by garbage trucks to the Brea-Olinda landfill.  </P> <P> Employees told officials that they illegally disposed of 150 to 300 gallons of  solvents per day, Johnston said. For years, the plant had told the Anaheim Fire  Department it was recycling all its chemicals, fire officials said in April.  </P> <P> In April, the county's environmental strike team, acting on an anonymous phone  tip, diverted the company's garbage for four days. They said they found  hazardous concentrations of metals, methyl ethyl ketone, trichloroethane,  ethylbenzene, xylene and toluene, all highly toxic solvents that are suspected  carcinogens.  </P> <P> Four of the five felony charges stem from the waste sampled and other evidence  collected in that undercover investigation. The fifth charges unlawful disposal  daily for 2 1/2 years.  </P> <P> "What they were dumping were sludges and highly contaminated solvents, with  lots of metals, such as zinc and lead," Johnston said. "There were all kinds of  exotic solvents."  </P> <P> The company was raided April 17 by the strike team, which is coordinated by the  district attorney's office and is composed of members of about 10 city, county  and regional agencies.  </P> <P> State law requires the chemicals to be disposed of in special toxic-waste  plants or landfills, most of which are several hundred miles from Orange  County. The cost of legal disposal of solvent waste is about $500 per 55-gallon  drum. In contrast, it costs mere pennies to dump a drum in a county landfill.  </P> <P> Frank Bowerman, director of Orange County's Integrated Waste Management  Department, said there are probably other companies that disguise their toxic  waste and dump it in the landfills, "but I don't think there's a huge number of  them."  </P> <P> He said household chemicals, such as bleach and paint, are also dumped  illegally in the trash. The county this year opened a collection center in  Anaheim that is the first of several free household toxics roundup sites in the  county.  </P> <P> Small businesses are struggling because they are prohibited from using the  centers and they have trouble paying disposal costs that larger companies can  more easily afford.  </P> <P> "There are probably a few hundred companies in Orange County that are rocking  along earning some kind of living, and they can't really afford the costs of  legal disposal. The county should help them," Bowerman said. "But that doesn't  excuse what this paint company did. They were doing things knowingly in  violation of the law."  </P></p>

The  Zagreb-based Croatian radio said Moslem troops were attacking  Croat positions around Kiseljak in central Bosnia from small  arms and anti-aircraft guns. The same source said the situation  in the Mostar area was calm on Saturday. The Moslem-controlled  Radio Sarajevo, on the other hand, reported continuous small  arms attacks on the Moslem section of Mostar. Moslem attacks on  Serb positions in central and northern Bosnia also continued on  Saturday. Bosnian Serb military sources in the area of Srbobran  (formerly Donji Vakuf) reported Moslem provocations from the  direction of Bugojno, central Bosnia. The Moslem troops on that  section of the front have been regrouping over the past 24  hours, the sources said and added that the local authorities in  Srbobran had ordered all public institutions and schools to  suspend work in the expectation of a Moslem attack.    The Bosnian Serb army said the strongest Moslem attacks were  reported in the Trebava river valley to the northeast of Doboj.  The Moslem infantry attacks were successfully repulsed and the  enemy was forced to retreat, the same source said and added that  the Moslems were regrouping and bringing in reinforcements from  Gracanica east of Doboj. A Moslem commando team attempting an  infiltration into the area south of Doboj was successfully  neutralized on Friday night, the Bosnian Serb army said and  added that two commandoes were killed after stepping on a mine  while retreating and that several others were seriously wounded.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Mikhalych: "In the Summer the Children </F> Will Turn Our Country Into a Camp, but Certainly Not a Pioneer  Camp: A Forecast"]    [Text] Judging from all appearances, this summer will be  the equivalent of a natural disaster. It is not merely a matter  of the weather or the migration of refugees who are creating  bottlenecks and traffic-jams in all modes of transportation. It  is a matter of crime, which--according to the data provided by  the authoritative organs in this field--should increase  significantly during the summer. And whereas the summertime  growth of "adult" crime will--as anticipated--be the usual one,  as in previous years, the situation with regard to crime among  juveniles--according to the forecasts--must be considered  disturbing and inauspicious.    In the first place, the children will be on vacation....    Whereas previously the virtually en masse "Pioneerization"  of  children provided the police with a calm and tranquil life, this  cannot be counted on nowadays. Camps are being closed down  everywhere; in Moscow alone such an unenviable lot has befallen  hundreds of children's institutions. They lack sufficient funds.  Admissions tickets to those camps that are still afloat will  cost R400,000-R600,000.    It is a rare parent that will be able to scrape up such a  sum. Of course, the governments of Moscow and other Russian  cities have allocated subsidies. And--judging by all  appearances--50 percent of the cost of an admissions ticket will  be paid by means of social insurance. Moreover, as we were  informed in the Russian Ministry of Education, approximately  R500 million have already been allotted from the federal budget  for summer vacations. Allocation of an equal such sum was  discussed yesterday at a session of the government.    But the forecasts of the criminologists are, nevertheless,  quite disturbing inasmuch as even the funds that have been  allocated are patently insufficient. In the opinion of the  specialists, the principal trends in juvenile crime manifest  themselves more clearly during the summer. Whereas the increase  in crime as a whole during the last five years has amounted to  50 percent, and--moreover--one out of every six crimes committed  by juveniles is serious (robbery, theft, larceny), during the  summer the increase in crime will amount to approximately 60  percent over last year's figure. In the main, these will be  extremely diverse types of larceny--ranging from the activities  of pickpockets to those of shoplifters. There will be more  street-type hooliganism and squabbles between gangs.    Statistics show that last year the number of crimes  committed  by juveniles while in a state of intoxication increased by  approximately 70 percent. Moreover, it has been officially  acknowledged that throughout the country as a whole there are  about 100,000 underage drunkards, and that--generally  speaking--one youth in three who has reached the age of 14  drinks on a regular basis.    St. Petersburg and Moscow will be affected worst of all by  the above-mentioned problem. Crowds of migrating homeless  children will rush to these cities in order to live from hand to  mouth. Some 20,000 "drifters" will be added to the 60,000 St.  Petersburg gamins and the 40,000 already in Moscow. Rough  computations show that in the winter the number of Russia's  homeless varies from 150,000 to 180,000; but in the summer,  because of seasonal homelessness, there will be approximately  250,000-300,000 of them.    And the Law on Education merely adds to the trouble. Through  its inadvertence--according to data provided by Deputy Prime  Minister Yu. Yarov--there will be about half a million juveniles  on the streets; these are kids who have been expelled from the  system of secondary education. Because nowadays each school is  free to accept or reject anyone at its own discretion. And this  is not in conflict with the Constitution inasmuch as the latter  has guaranteed only a mandatory incomplete secondary education.  Taking into consideration the complex difficulties of job  placement and the reduction in the number of  vocational-technical schools, most of these 600,000 juveniles  will simply waste their time in idleness, or else terrorize the  neighborhoods and surrounding areas.</p>

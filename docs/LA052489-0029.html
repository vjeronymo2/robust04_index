			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALICE KAHN: SEA OF TROUBLE WASHES UP AT BEACH RENTAL  </P> <P> Welcome to our home. We hope you enjoy your stay here at SeaWhine as much as we  enjoy it when we aren't renting it out to make money. We have done our best to  see that everything is in order, but as you sign this guest book, please let us  know if there is anything we can do to improve it. We ask that you treat the  house as your own and leave it as you found it. If you need anything, we can be  reached at the Motel 6 in town. Have a nice stay.  </P> <P>  -- Fred and Ethel Schwartz  </P> <P> Dec. 18, 1988  </P> <P> The ocean was beautiful even though the weather was terrible and we were stuck  in the house for the entire weekend. We did enjoy the hot tub. Whoops! Sorry  about your cat. One thing bothered us. You said that there was a place for a  romantic fire. Not much romance with a wood stove.  </P> <P>  -- Dale and Luke Underwood  </P> <P> Jan. 21, 1989  </P> <P> What a perfect weekend. The surf could have performed a little better, but you  can't have everything. We found the wood stove extremely romantic. Amory finds  energy efficiency an incredible turn-on.  </P> <P>  -- L. Hunter Lovins  </P> <P> Feb. 4, 1989  </P> <P> Bob and I and our kids, Zachary, 11, Sandra Dee, 8, and Jedidiah, 3, had a  wonderful time. Bob liked the sandpipers and the tide pools. I especially loved  the perfect sunsets from the deck. Zach liked everything and said the VCR and  the Nintendo were especially "rad," whatever that means. Sandi loved the Power  Vac and the Microwave. Jedi liked the doorbell. We did our best to get the  stains out of the rug and the carpet. We do expect the cleaning deposit back  because what kind of people would do a family home in white and mauve?  </P> <P>  -- Caryn Carmichael  </P> <P> Feb. 14, 1989  </P> <P> Dear "Mom and Dad,"  </P> <P> Thank you for this wonderful honeymoon. Between the fire and the tub and the  beach, we hardly had a moment for romance. (Just joshing!) Those people who  ruined the rug and the couch ought to be sued. They also left burnt caramel  corn in the microwave. Weirdest thing, though, was the sock in the freezer.  Scottie's trying out that wonderful chain saw you gave him for our wedding  present. He's completely cleared that overgrown row of old redwood trees in the  back, and we now get a much better view of the neighbors.  </P> <P>  -- Love, Mrs. Scott Ryan Schwartz  </P> <P> April 2, 1989  </P> <P> Your lovely property has restored my health. A few thoughts: The hot tub should  be moved outside, the wood stove is corny, patio furniture would help, plant a  few trees out back, your art is incredibly boring, and a red couch belongs in a  brothel.  </P> <P>  -- Maurice Canard  </P> <P> May 21, 1989  </P> <P> I've been reading over the things the other guests wrote in this book. Bunch of  rotten dudes, man. We liked everything exactly like it is. The hot tub was  totally icy, the beach was awesome, and the fire was really hot. Only problem  was your neighbors didn't like us watching them through the telescope. They  came over to complain, and we got in a little fracas. I think the deposit will  cover the windows and the dishware, but the blood wouldn't come off the walls.  Lucky you got that couch. For sure. One of the guys in the band drew a pentacle  on the ceiling, and we thought it looked cool so we left it.  </P> <P>  -- The Satanic Nerds  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alyaksandr Byarsudski: "CIS Steps Up </F> Antinarcotics Movement"]    [Text] The International Committee for Narcotics set up in  Minsk about a month ago by a number of public organizations from  Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, and Russia, has received a  certificate of registration issued by the Belarusian Ministry of  Justice. This marks the beginning of the activities of the  committee headed by People's Deputy Viktar Piskarov, former  interior minister.    The committee's working bodies comprise people who formerly  worked in law enforcement agencies, as well as physicians and  scientists from the four founder-states. These are different  people but they have things in common: High professionalism and  an understanding of the relevance of the problems to be resolved  by the committee.    This is why the multifarious directions of the International  Committee's activities include a comprehensive education  project, and the drafting of concepts and programs on preserving  the genetic health of the nation. The committee will be  rendering assistance to medical and scientific institutions and  industrial enterprises for implementing antinarcotic projects.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Peers criticise leasehold bill GOVERNMENT plans for leasehold reform came under attack from all sides yesterday, as the House of Lords began debating the bill to give certain long-leaseholders in flats the right to join together to buy the freehold of their block. Criticism from peers that the proposals were too generous towards tenants had been widely expected, but concern was also expressed by others that the bill would not improve tenants' rights. Tory backbench peers suggesting changes dominated the debate. As in the Commons, the prospect of forcing government concessions will be greater where there is an alliance of Tory backbenchers and opposition parties than where it depends on Tory rebels alone. Some Tory peers were clearly sensitive to the charge that they were speaking in support of the large landlords, and underlined the impact the bill could have on a small freeholder living in a block he or she owns. The Duke of Westminster, London's leading landowner, listened to the debate but did not take part. The Lords do not pass amendments that would wreck legislation pledged in the election. However, Lord Boardman, a Tory backbencher, emphasised that the bill went beyond the Tory manifesto promise to improve the rights of resident long-leaseholders. Other Tory backbenchers pressed the case for widening the categories of leaseholders entitled to have their leases extended. Under the plans, a leaseholder in a block of flats which qualifies for enfranchisement is not entitled to a lease extension, even if the tenants in the block do not buy the freehold.

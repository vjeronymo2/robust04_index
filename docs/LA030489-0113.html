			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RENEWED TAKEOVER RUMORS GIVE LOCKHEED STOCK BOOST  </P> <P> The price of Lockheed shares rose $1.75 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange  on renewed rumors that aerospace giant Boeing Co. may try to buy its  Calabasas-based defense contracting rival.  </P> <P> Lockheed closed at $49.50 on volume of about 757,100 shares -- compared to  Thursday's 234,900 -- after Business Week magazine's "Inside Wall Street"  stock-tip column quoted unidentified sources as saying that Boeing, based in  Seattle, is keenly interested in Lockheed's defense contracting business.  </P> <P> Reports that Boeing is interested in Lockheed are not new. The company has been  the subject of periodic takeover rumors in recent years, and analysts said they  do not give much credence to the new report. They noted that Wall Street's  reaction also indicated skepticism in that the stock did not advance to its  52-week high of $50.125.  </P> <P> "I would sell Lockheed stock while it's up," said Paul H. Nisbet, an analyst  with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. Lockheed is not likely to agree  to a takeover, he said, "and I can't imagine Boeing going after Lockheed or  anyone else on a hostile basis."  </P> <P> Nisbet explained that hostile takeovers among defense contractors are extremely  rare -- in part because the Pentagon would vigorously protest any action that  might disrupt the business of one of its prime suppliers.

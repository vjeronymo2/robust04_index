			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Ex-Brent Walker man must pay fine Mr Wilfred Aquilina, the former finance director at Brent Walker, was yesterday told he must pay a Pounds 25,000 fine for false accounting, even though he pleaded poverty. The judge, Mr Geoffrey Rivlin, refused to accept that Mr Aquilina was insolvent. He told him at Southwark Crown Court: 'To suggest that you can't afford to pay is an affront to common sense and to the many people who are in a far worse position than you to pay a fine.' The fine was imposed three weeks ago in addition to a suspended sentence, but an adjournment was granted for a special investigation into Mr Aquilina's financial circumstances. Yesterday the judge extended from six months to a year the period in which Mr Aquilina had to pay.</p>

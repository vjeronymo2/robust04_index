			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chang Yong-sop] </F>   [Text] Washington, April 15 (YONHAP) -- Now that South  Korea has withdrawn the proposed inter-Korean exchange of  special envoys as a prerequisite to the third round of  U.S.-North Korean high-level talks, attention is focusing on  whether Seoul's initiative will provide a clue to solving the  nuclear question.    It may be premature to jump to conclusions but cautious  expectations are being voiced in Washington that because of the  move, working-level U.S.-North Korean talks may resume around  next weekend to discuss additional inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency.    In fact, a few signs backing up such expectations have  trickled out of the communist country in recent days.    One was Western press representatives' invitation to North  Korea for the April 15 birthday of President Kim Il-song, aged  82.    The invitees included correspondents from CNN-TV and the  WASHINGTON TIMES in the United States and Japan's NHK-TV.    The invitation was taken by North Korea watchers as a  conciliatory gesture by the normally intransigent North Koreans.    In an interview with CNN-TV, Kim Yong-sun, a Workers'  (communist) Party secretary involved in inter-Korean affairs,  said, "We do not want a war and are prepared to return to the  table of dialogue."    Kim then tried to tone down the inflammatory remark, "in a  war Seoul will be turned into a sea of fire," made by the chief  North Korean delegate to a recent inter-Korean working-level  meeting at Panmunjom.    It was this statement that prompted Seoul and Washington to  take hasty steps to ship sophisticated defensive weaponry to  South Korea.    Diplomatic sources here observe that once Kim Il-song's  birthday celebrations are over, North Korea may renew dialogue  with the United States as a face-saving tactic.    The sources say that North Korea is well aware of the  early-May deadline for its acceptance of additional inspections  and that it would face harsher pressure if it failed to heed the  deadline.    One source said, however, that even if working-level talks  resumed late next week, rough sailing would await the two sides  before they could manage to hammer out an agreement on  additional checks.    The North Koreans are likely to continue demanding that  working- level Washington-Pyongyang talks precede additional  checks, while the United States will maintain that a full  inspection of all declared facilities should occur before any  talks with North Korea.    State Department Spokesman Mike Mccurry made it clear at a  press briefing Friday that no further U.S.-North Korean talks  would take place before inspections have ensured the continuity  of nuclear safeguards in North Korea.    In other words, Washington's strategy is to address the  issue  of inspecting undeclared North Korean facilities at a third  meeting by winding up the question of looking into declared  sites before the talks open.    North Korea's plan, on the other hand, is to obtain the  maximum possible concessions from the United States by using the  card of additional inspections of its declared facilities.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Downturn in debt provisions expected to signal recovery - Guarded optimism in the market as the UK clearing banks begin their half year reporting season this Friday IF ANY unfortunate surprises are disclosed when the UK banks start reporting their half year results on Friday, their shareholders will have a nasty shock. For 20 years banks have lacked much capacity to startle because they have been held in so little regard anyway. But this year is different. The interim results season that starts with Lloyds on Friday and continues next week, culminating with Barclays, marks a watershed in two ways. One is that the results are likely to show a downturn in bad debt provisions. The second is that the recovery that signals is expected to last at least half a decade. For the first time in a generation the market has not discounted much for management incompetence or the likelihood of fresh problems being disclosed. The banks sector has risen 17 per cent relative to the FT-A All-Share index this year as the belief that they have mended their ways has taken hold. This is quite a change from the high inflation era of the late 1970s and 1980s when banks expanded balance sheets by taking on poor risks, and consumed capital. Shareholders now regard banks as being more tightly managed in a safer environment, and so capable of generating capital internally. Mr Norrie Morrison, analyst at Kleinwort Benson, argues that bank shares are coming to be valued on earnings rather than yields because banks are more trusted. The question - for which clues will be sought in the interims - is whether they have truly undergone a secular shift in behaviour. Two problems likely to emerge in the results have already been largely discounted. One is the start of the Standard of Recommended Practice (Sorp) on the accruing of interest on non-performing loans. This will stop banks taking interest into earnings and providing against it separately. The bank likely to be most affected is Lloyds, which has stuck closely to interest accrual. Although its profits before tax will not be affected, Kleinwort Benson predicts that the reduction of net interest income will raise its costs to income ratio by 4.2 percentage points to 66.6 per cent. The second problem is more substantial: the upsets that have been encountered by National Westminster, Barclays and Abbey National in continental Europe. As poor asset quality problems in US operations ease, similar problems have been exposed in retail bank subsidiaries in France. Lehman Brothers estimates that NatWest's disposal of its French retail bank will lead to a Pounds 100m charge, while Abbey National will make a Pounds 65m further provision in the first half against commercial property lending in France. Barclays is expected to suffer a Pounds 150m loss in France during 1993. Despite these local difficulties, total provisions are likely to start falling. Brokers expect provisions similar to the first half of last year, but a significant fall on the poor second half of last year. Estimates of the fall on the second half range from 15 to 27 per cent. Some of the brightest aspects of the results are expected to be the contributions made by investment banking subsidiaries, particularly in treasuries due to currency volatility, and capital markets operations as companies have raised debt and equity finance rather than borrowing from banks. This may make up for sluggish income from the traditional banking activity of lending. Each of the big four clearing banks has shown declines in loan volumes since the start of the year, with Lloyds having the sharpest fall. This limits the scope for interest income without wider margins. However, static or falling lending has also provided some encouragement to shareholders because it implies that banks will not have to raise capital to maintain the regulatory ratios of capital to risk-weighted assets. Fears of rights issues earlier in the year have eased significantly. Mr Julian Robins of BZW believes that banks are unlikely to repeat the rapid expansion of assets following the recession of 1979-81 which led to rights issues in the late 1980s. The question is whether banks will maintain the increased margins they have achieved in this recession. Mr Robert Law at Lehman Brothers says profits before bad debts have risen from 1.38 per cent in the early 1980s to 1.68 per cent in 1992 - or a 50 per cent rise in 'normalised' profitability. If the interim results mark entry to an era of internal generation of capital, they will have to display more self-restraint than in the past if margins are not simply to be squeezed as they compete for business. Mr Law says this question is 'impossible to answer with certainty' but much rests on it. If banks give in to such a temptation, then much of their newly found respect among shareholders will dissipate. Probably the initial signal will come from Lloyds, as the bank decides whether to continue accumulating its already strong capital, or start handing it back in dividends to shareholders.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Waiver of the In-Office Interview_7 CFR 273.2(e)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 330 of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the interim rule amended 7 CFR 273.2(e) to explicitly specify the circumstances under which the in-office interview for an applicant household must be waived. Consequently, current rules at 7 CFR 273.2(e) require that in-office interviews be waived if requested by households which are unable to send a household member to the food stamp office because they: (1) Are elderly or disabled as defined in 7 CFR 271.2; (2) live in a location which is not served by a certification office; (3) are experiencing transportation difficulties as determined by the State agency on a case-by-case basis; or (4) are experiencing other hardships that the State agency determines warrants a waiver of the in-office interview such as illness, care of a household member, hardships due to residing in a rural area, prolonged severe weather or work hours. If the in-office interview is waived, the State agency has the option to conduct a telephone interview or a home visit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department received one comment criticizing the interim rule provision, stating that the provision made ``the obvious and thoroughly unnecessary statement that granting waivers to in-office interviews applied in rural areas''. The commenter felt that adding emphasis to the regulations is not a decisive way to act when the Program has operational problems. Furthermore, the commenter felt that problems State agencies may have in applying the requirement to grant waivers of in-office interviews should be dealt with by FNS regional office staff. The Department understands the commenter's concerns, but the language in the interim rule was not added to address operational concerns, but rather was required by law. Public Law 100&hyph;435 clearly states that waiving in-office interviews for households in rural areas is sometimes necessary, and State agencies must do so when a household meets specific criteria. The interim rule amended 7 CFR 273.2(e) specifically to address Congressional concern that residency in a rural area not be a barrier to participation in the Food Stamp Program. Therefore this action adopts the interim provisions at 7 CFR 273.2(e) as final without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Food Stamp Application Form_7 CFR 273.2(b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 310 of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the June 7, 1989 interim rule amended several provisions of the regulations pertaining to the food stamp application form. Prior to publication of the interim rule, the regulations at 7 CFR 273.2(b) permitted State agencies to deviate from the FNS-designed food stamp application in order to process joint applications with other assistance programs, meet the requirements of a State agency computer system or accommodate State agency needs that are determined to be justifiable. The first provision of section 310 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 amended section 11(e)(2) of the Food Stamp Act to mandate that, in addition to its current criteria for approving State agency application forms, FNS must also ensure that the application is brief. Accordingly, the June 7, 1989 interim rule amended 7 CFR 273.2(b) to include brevity as a condition for approving deviations from the FNS food stamp application form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of comments received about the food stamp application form concerned this provision. Commenters, while supporting the interim rule's intent to shorten the food stamp application, wondered how the Department intends to judge whether an application form is ``brief'' enough to meet the requirements of Public Law 100&hyph;435.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Senate Report No. 100&hyph;397 (p. 24) expressed Congressional dismay over the length of multi-program application forms, i.e. application forms for food stamps and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits. The Department concurs with Congress on this issue. The purpose of an application form is to obtain basic eligibility information from the client (such as name, address, income, expenses, etc.). Such information requires only a few pages of questions for applicant households to complete. The Department also understands, however, that limiting the length of applications can be a problem for State agencies trying to administer a variety of programs. In December 1990, the Department completed a review of all State-designed application forms. The review had been initiated because of the passage of Public Law 100&hyph;435 and the ongoing concern that the food stamp application not be a barrier to participation in the Program. The reviewers found length to be the most disturbing problem with State-designed multi-program application forms. The length of the forms ranged from 3 to 44 pages, and the number of programs covered by the forms ranged from 3 to 9. Of the multi-program applications reviewed, 8 forms were 1&hyph;10 pages long, 21 were 11&hyph;20 pages, 7 were 21&hyph;30 pages, and 12 forms were over 30 pages long.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department realizes that the length of application forms is due to a great extent to such demands as automation and the need to administer a variety of programs. The Food Stamp Act, however, requires the Department to ensure that application forms are easy to use, readable, brief and written in simple terms. Therefore, the Department, in reviewing State agency applications, attempts to balance the need to reduce the burden on applicants and each State agency's need to administer the many programs under its jurisdiction. The Department is making no changes to the interim provision and is adopting that provision as final.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

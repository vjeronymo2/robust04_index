			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Farmers straying from the Tory fold - The Issues: Agriculture FARMERS have traditionally voted for the Tories, but there are signs that the recession has caused some to switch their allegiances. The battle for the farming vote is usually a two-horse race between the Tories and the Liberal Democrats. A poll conducted for Big Farm Weekly by Mass Observation UK earlier this month suggested that in the coming election one in four farmers will vote Liberal Democrat compared with only 13 per cent in 1987. The poll of 502 farmers showed the Tory share of the vote down from 83 per cent in 1987 to 63 per cent. Only 2 per cent of voters work on the land, but they could be vital to the outcome in several constituencies, according to Mr Richard Howarth, lecturer in agricultural economics at Bangor University College. 'There are some very marginal seats where quite a small number of voters could influence the outcome,' he says. For example Cambridgeshire North-East has a Tory majority of 1,428, while 15 per cent of the electorate is involved in agriculture. Hereford has a similarly slim Tory majority, with 8 1/2 per cent in farming. Mr Howarth points out that the Liberal Democrats have a lot of marginal seats, including Brecon and Radnor, which they hold by 56 votes, the smallest majority in the country. 'In a closely fought election the Liberal Democrats have to keep sweet with the farmers,' he said. Scottish and Welsh nationalists are complicating the picture. Galloway and Upper Nithsdale, one of the most agricultural seats in the UK, is held by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, with a majority of 3,673 over the Scottish National party, which is keen to regain the seat. Tory concern over the farm vote appears to have been growing for several months. At two important agricultural gatherings Mr John Major, the prime minister, urged farmers to get closer to the market, warning that the present level of price support was simply not sustainable. He was unable to offer solace on the two biggest areas of concern and uncertainty for farmers - the proposed reforms of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy and the talks on Gatt - the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister, may not have had a good press in his struggles with CAP complexities. But he has won grudging respect for his defence of the industry. Most farmers are under no illusion that an agriculture minister of another political colour could do any better. Mr Martin Howarth, National Farmers' Union head of international affairs, says it would be very difficult for a UK minister to trade agricultural reform against another issue. The Tory manifesto - which devotes more space to agriculture than those of the other main parties - promises to 'redouble our efforts to reform the CAP' and 'stoutly defend the interests of British farmers and consumers'. It points out, however, that pressure to reduce protectionist measures and the need to contain the cost of the CAP mean farmers will face reduced support and increased competition. The Liberal Democrats also say they will work for fundamental reform of the CAP. They want to increase direct aid to farmers and make incentive payments for environmental objectives, 'in particular for extensifying food production (using land less intensively), and reduced-input and organic farming'. Labour promises a Department of Food and Farming and pledges to replace production subsidies with 'green' premium payments 'to promote environmentally sound management of the countryside'. It believes changes in the wasteful CAP 'can help finance other Community projects'. All three parties support the Rural Development Commission, and include measures to improve the environment and conservation. Owners of large farms are concerned that proposed changes to the CAP will be unfavourable to them. Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner, is committed to reforms that will support 'rural communities which have no viable alternative to agriculture', which in effect means smaller farmers, mainly in continental Europe. Mr Howarth points out that this has divided the farm lobby. The Farmers Union of Wales is keen on the MacSharry proposals while the NFU would prefer to reform the CAP through a supply-management system and the Country Landowners' Association is against production controls. 'They are all taking a different line,' said Mr Howarth. 'For the first time the lobby is not united.'</p>

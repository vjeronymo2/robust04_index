			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: UK water sector No wonder Thames felt unable to follow North West Water's example by making an enhanced scrip dividend to fund its international activities. The tax saving would have been equally attractive, but Thames lost money outside the water business last year once the contribution of group treasury and insurance are stripped out. Having spent the proceeds of 1991's convertible bond issue on loss-making engineering companies, Thames can hardly ask shareholders for more. The company is wise to play down its international ambitions until the existing empire is in better shape. Nor, with gearing of only 31 per cent and relatively modest capital expenditure plans, could Thames argue that it needs fresh equity for the regulated water business. Yorkshire, which has lower gearing now but very large capital expenditure plans in the second half of the decade, has a better case in that regard. Yesterday's convertible bond issue could provide Yorkshire with an injection of equity just as capital expenditure and gearing are starting to climb. Anglian might make a similar case for an enhanced scrip dividend or a convertible bond when its results are announced next week. With the outcome of the regulatory review so uncertain, though, the companies might be better advised to wait before asking for equity for the basic water business. If the review results in lower than expected capital expenditure - and a fair-minded pricing regime - debt finance might yet suffice.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ACTOR WHO REJECTED THE SCRIPT;  </P> <P> PAUL ROBESON: A BIOGRAPHY BY MARTIN BAUML DUBERMAN (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $24.95;  784 PP.; 0-394-52780-I)  </P> <P> The life of a black celebrity is perilous enough, but the black celebrity who  becomes a spokesperson is asking for pure hell. Not only has the outspokenness  of those regarded as radicals gotten them into trouble, but as Gary Giddins'  recent book "Satchmo" (Doubleday), revealed, even a non-radical like Louis  Armstrong could come into conflict with the American secret police for his  criticisms of Eisenhower's handling of segregation in the South.  </P> <P> If Paul Robeson had fulfilled the role that American society had prepared for  him -- that of a patriotic token, lecturing the underclass of his time about  their "slovenly" habits and exhibiting by his efforts that with hard work and  determination one could achieve anything in this land of opportunity -- he'd  probably still be around, delighting audiences with his spirituals and playing  "Othello" in his old age.  </P> <P> But Robeson broke out of his role. He chose to use his celebrity status as a  platform for speaking out against the injustices of the oppressed all over the  world, and especially of blacks at home. For his efforts, he was hounded by his  enemies into physical and mental breakdown; and, in one of those Orwellian  ironies that black life in America accumulates, this man, who was persecuted  from the early '40s until his death in 1976, was diagnosed as having a  persecution complex.  </P> <P> In 1950, at the height of America's Cold War hysteria, the State Department  lifted his passport, lowering an iron curtain on his opportunity to earn a  living abroad. Not only did J. Edgar Hoover's FBI become part of the Robeson  family, it seems, devoting more resources to the investigation of one black  singer,actor and intellectual, during the '40s and '50s, than to investigating  organized crime, but even the Communist Party sent an informant, posing as a  bodyguard, to spy on Robeson. Though Robeson was sympathetic to some Communist  causes, he never joined the Party and was never brought under its discipline.  He once refused its order that he be silent.  </P> <P> Robeson's father, the Rev. William Drew Robeson, who had escaped from slavery  in 1850, at age 15, was forced out of his New Jersey ministry and into poverty,  punished by the white elders of the presbytery for his tendency to speak out  against social injustice. In later years, when Robeson himself was subjected to  vitriolic abuse from the press and the government, a family friend would  comment: "They did it to his father."  </P> <P> Robeson graduated from Rutgers where he excelled as an athlete and in 1921  married Eslanda Cardozo Goode, whose great-grandfather was Isaac Nunez Cardozo,  a member of a Spanish-Jewish family, and whose grandfather, Francis Lewis  Cardozo, was described by Henry Ward Beecher as "the most highly educated Negro  in America."  </P> <P> Despite Duberman's excessive and voyeuristic detail about Robeson's  "multiplicity of romantic and sexual encounters," details which degrade an  otherwise useful, fine and well-researched biography, Robeson and his wife  remained companions until her death from cancer in 1965. A serious rift between  the two occurred after the publication of her book, "Paul Robeson, Negro," in  which she alluded to his affairs and described him as lazy. (Throughout the  book, whenever there's a dispute between Robeson and his wife about a fact,  Duberman sides with Essie Robeson.)  </P> <P> A C-student at Columbia Law School, Robeson stumbled into an acting career in  1920, appearing in some dreadful thing called "Taboo," in which, typically,  Afro-American religion was subjected to the usual ignorant stereotyping.  "Taboo" was written by what Duberman describes as a "fashionable young white  socialite" named Mary Hoyt Wiborg, daughter of a wealthy financier, Frank  Wiborg. (Throughout his life, Robeson would roam around freely among different  classes, from the Australian aborigines, whose treatment he bitterly criticized  during his stay in Australia, to the denizens of the English court.) Though  Duberman provides testimony from some of the many he interviewed that Robeson  regretted his lack of acting and singing training, he received high praise for  his performance.  </P> <P> Robeson would be criticized for playing such trashy roles throughout his  career. He appeared in "Show Boat," "The Emperor Jones," "Tales of Manhattan"  and "Sanders of the River" (which Jomo Kenyatta, one of the performers (!),  praised). Robeson hated his film roles and was evidently duped sometimes by the  usual promise of control over the script, or perhaps saw himself as paving the  way for a succeeding generation of black film actors, who he felt would have it  better (to no avail, since some of today's black actors take roles that make  Robeson's role in "The Emperor Jones" seem majestic). Even the role of  "Othello" was demeaning, Shakespeare's Moor being a little more dignified than  "The Emperor Jones" but still a gullible half-cannibal who constantly berates  himself for his inferiority to the Venetians and who takes no offense when they  call him racist names. At any rate, by the 1930s, Robeson had bitterly  denounced both "Sanders in the River" and "The Emperor Jones." Robeson  evidently had more freedom when he performed in movies by black film maker  Oscar Micheaux and in an experimental film entitled "Borderline." One of  "Borderline's" producers was a founder of modern poetry, and a feminist, Hilda  Doolittle. In the film, he appeared with his wife, Essie.  </P> <P> Robeson's concert career was as controversial as his film and stage careers.  Zora Neale Hurston accused him of corrupting the original intent of the folk  song's creators, and of pandering to white audiences. Others, arguing that he  limited his range by singing the songs of the black proletariat, urged him to  attempt "serious" European music. The ever-culturally conservative black middle  class was offended by his songs and by his politics. Some of the most scorching  criticisms of his left-leaning views emanated from the black press, but the  black press didn't have the power to persecute him as relentlessly as the white  press did.  </P> <P> It was the white press that stirred up violent passions against him for  appearing in Eugene O'Neill's "All God's Chillun Got Wings" opposite a white  actress, and it was the white press that created the atmosphere for an ugly  civil disturbance which took place in Peekskill, N.Y., in 1947, where Robeson  had gone to perform for a benefit. And it was a white American wire service  that distorted a key political speech that Robeson made in Paris, a smear that  led Robeson's enemies to declare open season on him and NBC to ban him from its  air waves.  </P> <P> It could be said that Robeson was a victim of the experiential difference  between blacks and whites, a gap which, according to a recent NAACP poll, still  exists. The black experience, when not ignored, is arrogantly dismissed as the  "paranoid" imputing of conspiratorial views that aren't there. Based upon his  often-humiliating experience -- especially in the area of public accommodations  -- and of his observations about black life in the United States, Robeson's  version of American political reality was deeply different from that of  powerful white men in the government, who considered him ornery for pointing  out that the human rights violations, which they hypocritically condemned  abroad, also existed at home. He once got into a heated argument with Harry  Truman in the White House about such contradictions. Truman responded to  Robeson's un-paranoid plea for anti-lynching legislation by ending the  interview. Truman later included Robeson in a "gang" that he claimed he'd  defeated. Eleanor Roosevelt's view of Robeson was similar to Truman's.  </P> <P> Duberman's book indicates that Robeson could have made it easier for himself  had he recanted his support for the Soviet Union, something that he refused to  do. His support for the Soviet Union has always baffled many. Robeson was  warned by Emma Goldman in the 1930s that the Russian Revolution had its cruel  side. And even after the purges, the Soviet Nazi pact, the invasion of Hungary,  the revelations about genocide committed by Stalin, Robeson remained loyal,  shrugging off every criticism of a country he regarded as an ideal, color-blind  worker's paradise. He must have known, after partying with Khrushchev and his  friends in their private lodges, that some Communists live much better than  others. He was himself a cultural nationalist, but apparently took little note  of the fact that the Soviets had attempted to eradicate the cultures of Latvia,  Estonia and Lithuania. One wonders how Robeson would have reacted to glasnost,  perestroika, the appeal for Western capital, the experiments with private  enterprise, and the mass murders committed by Soviet forces in Afghanistan.  </P> <P> Robeson was again permitted to travel abroad thanks to a Supreme Court decision  in 1958 for which William O. Douglas wrote the majority decision, declaring  that "The passport division had no right to demand that an applicant sign an  affidavit concerning membership in the Communist Party." Ill health forced him  to return to the United States. During the last years of his life, he was  honored by a generation of civil rights workers whose coming his career had  anticipated.  </P> <P> The mixed attitudes with which his country viewed the career of Robeson -- a  man both praised and damned in his native land, and a man who had the courage  to articulate in public ideas most confine to their thoughts -- didn't end at  his death. Last year, in New York, "A Celebration of Paul Robeson" was held.  Among the sponsors were American Express, General Electric, ITT, Philip Morris,  Mrs. Vincent Astor, and The Rockefeller Group.  </P></p>

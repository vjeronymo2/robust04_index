			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Arts: Voice of an age - Richard McClure assesses the standing and reputation of the career of Sir John Gielgud as he approaches his 90th birthday Tributes to mark Sir John Gielgud's 90th birthday on April 14 were frustrated last month when a campaign to have London's Apollo Theatre renamed in his honour was rejected by its owner, Stoll Moss. It was a rare display of dissent about the actor regarded by his many admirers as keeper of the theatrical flame; last in that distinguished lineage which, through his great-aunt Ellen Terry, connects him to Irving, Kean and beyond even to Shakespeare. The Stoll Moss controversy is a contrast to the general adulation. Only the Queen Mother's birthday, according to one recent eulogy, prompts comparable 'gratitude and rejoicing'. Perhaps, but just as the role of the monarchy is being questioned, Gielgud's artistic legacy surely demands more critical appraisal. 'Times have changed,' argues Nica Burns, production director at Stoll Moss. 'I was recently negotiating for a light variety production to come to the Apollo and was somewhat perturbed when its two young producers, one of them under 30, told me they would take the show elsewhere if the theatre was renamed.' Such disrespect is uncommon among the profession's younger generation, even though most are only familiar with Gielgud through his sometimes unwise choice of screen appearances. While Olivier received an Oscar for Hamlet, Gielgud won his for playing Dudley Moore's foul-mouthed valet in the lamentable Arthur. Too often, he has squandered his talents on a succession of dons, dukes and other patrician bit parts, most notoriously as a senator in Penthouse Films' soft porn Caligula. On television he has fared better. The 'doorknob face' that Kenneth Tynan described has lately been seen assisting both Inspectors Morse and Alleyn in the course of their inquiries, though this year threatens the US mini-series, Scarlett, an unpromising sequel to Gone With the Wind. Bills must be paid, insists Gielgud, and, Lear aside, good roles for nonagenarians are few. Tomorrow night he plays the 'foolish, fond old man' one last time in a Radio 3 broadcast co-produced by Kenneth Branagh's now disbanded Renaissance Theatre Company. Radio provides the perfect medium for Gielgud's famous vocal agility. As Peter Greenaway, who directed him in Prospero's Books in 1991, observed: 'His qualities are not physical - he has a magnificent voice and a thinking mind.' Tim Supple, artistic director of the Young Vic, witnessed Gielgud's recording of the Ghost in Branagh's 1992 radio production of Hamlet. 'When he read, a sound came from him that one just doesn't hear,' he recalls. 'It was remarkable and immediately put you in touch with the sensation in the words, something that is not available when any modern actor speaks text. It was an awesome feeling. One sensed there was something impenetrably old about what was being done by him. 'It still had a magic spell but also not quite life.' Gielgud claims to dislike what Branagh calls his 'miraculous' tones, though he has confessed that as a youth he could make himself weep simply by listening to his own voice. His plummy declamation and unfettered tear ducts offer rich pickings for satirists, who also point to the taste for cravats, the oft-repeated anecdotes and the peacocks at his Buckinghamshire home as evidence of actorly affectation. Indeed, an earlier attempt to have the Queen's Theatre renamed after Gielgud was dropped when a producer pointed out it would invariably be dubbed the Old Queen's. But if Gielgud is guilty of the self-obsession customary in actors, it springs from commitment to his craft. Certainly, he is immersed in acting to the exclusion of all else. Beverley Nichols recalled a visit from Gielgud in the 1930s. 'We were sitting around wondering whether we were all going to be swept up in the approaching holocaust. 'Why don't you turn on the radio,' said John. 'There isn't one,' I replied. 'Excellent news,' said John, 'because I shall be able to listen to myself talking.' And talk, he did, brilliantly, till the small hours - not about Hitler or Mussolini or any of the ogres haunting us, but about the theatre, which was all he knew about or thought important in this distracted world.' But the mood of post war society and its theatre was out of tune with Gielgud's often mannered style of acting. While he was collecting a knighthood in the Coronation honours, Ionesco was dispensing with language - the tool of Gielgud's trade - as an adequate form of communication. At the same time, Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop was launching a working-class assault on the genteel complacency of post-war drama, based on a physicality which Gielgud, with his self-conscious gait, has never possessed. 'Gielgud is an Edwardian; he must still hear the echoes of Ellen Terry,' says Littlewood. 'In that horizon which he sees and which is in his background, I think he is superb - an opinion I don't extend to the rest of his generation. But because old Olivier, whom I couldn't stand, did that appalling Osborne play The Entertainer, Gielgud wanted to move into that dubious world too. 'He asked to work with me and, although I would have loved him to play Edward II, he didn't want to. He wanted to do something new to match Look Back in Anger. Later, I was given free tickets to go and see him in a modern play. I thought, 'Oh my God, he's not dressed. And where's the poetry?' I couldn't get over it.' However anxious to move with the times (his performances in Storey and Pinter were much praised), Gielgud has seldom been comfortable with the avant-garde, preferring the old school reassurance of Coward or Rattigan. He dissuaded Alec Guinness and Ralph Richardson from acting in Waiting for Godot and, in 1958, declined to appear in the British premiere of Endgame ('It nauseates me. I hate it and I won't play it'). He opted instead to take his tried and tested Shakespeare readings, The Ages of Man, on a tour of North America, a caution that has persisted into later life. He remained rooted in the decorous conventions of half a century ago. 'What has happened in the theatre from Beckett onwards has happened without Gielgud,' says Tim Supple. 'He has not left a legacy of breakthrough as have directors like Peter Brook and actors like Olivier, who was dangerous and kept on being so. One looks at Gielgud as a package of things that were about England and about English acting. And yet when you watch him as Clarence in Olivier's Richard III you realise he was a master. To be fair, he delights in the radical things happening around him.' This deference is shared by Supple's contemporary, Dominic Dromgoole, artistic director of the Bush Theatre, who believes Gielgud should be 'cherished and revered as a sublime monument to a certain sort of theatre'. If that sort of theatre is now ebbing away, the affection for Gielgud endures vicissitudes of fashion. As Edgar says of Lear: 'The oldest hath borne most; we that are young shall never see so much, nor live so long.'</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> POLY HIGH SCHOLAR WINS BUSINESS CAREER CONTEST  </P> <P> George Kim, a senior at Polytechnic High School in Long Beach, already is a man  of many accomplishments. He is an expert in Korean martial arts, a three-year  varsity tennis player, an award-winning speaker, a geometry tutor, a volunteer  landscaper of the Sarah Center for battered and abused women, a summer computer  operator for the Queen Mary and a talented violinist and concertmaster with  Poly's award-winning symphony orchestra.  </P> <P> And his resume just got longer. Kim recently walked away with $10,000, the  first prize in a business career development contest sponsored by Executive  Women International. He won with the aid of a videotaped interview, conducted  by a local contest judge, and a notebook he compiled detailing his various  accomplishments.  </P> <P> The straight-A student hopes his next stop will be one of four universities:  Harvard, Yale, Stanford or UC Berkeley, where he wants to become an economics  and pre-law student. His goals include earning a law degree from Oxford  University as a Rhodes Scholar and later a master's degree in business  administration from one of this country's top business schools. Kim  acknowledges his goals are high: "Ambitious? Yes. Impossible? No."  </P></p>

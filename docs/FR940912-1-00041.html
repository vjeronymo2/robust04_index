			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Modification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon modification of any emission source, an existing facility becomes an affected facility and therefore, subject to the standard. With certain exceptions, any physical or operational change to an existing process unit that would increase the emission rate from that process unit of any pollutant covered by the standard would be considered a modification within the meaning of section 111 of the Act. If a physical or operational change to an existing process unit would increase VOC emissions from the process unit, the owner or operator either can take appropriate measures to offset the emission increase within the process unit such that there is no overall net increase in emissions from the process unit as a result of the physical or operational change, or allow the process unit to be classified as an affected facility under the modification criteria and control the process unit to meet the requirements of the NSPS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the current regulations, an emission increase from one affected facility (i.e., process unit) may not be offset with a similar emission decrease at another affected facility to avoid becoming subject to NSPS. In addition, all emissions, not just the incremental increase in emissions, of the pollutants that have increased from the affected facility must be in compliance with the applicable standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the General Provisions to part 60, the following physical or operational changes are not considered to be modifications even though emissions may increase as a result of the change (see &sect;60.14(e)):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Routine maintenance, repair, and replacement (e.g., lubrication of mechanical equipment; replacement of pumps, motors, and piping; cleaning of equipment);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. An increase in production rate without a capital expenditure (as defined in &sect;60.2);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. An increase in the hours of operation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Use of an alternative fuel or raw material if, prior to proposal of the standard, the existing facility was designed to accommodate that alternative fuel or raw material;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The addition or use of any system or device whose primary function is to reduce air pollutants, except when an emission control system is replaced by a system determined by the EPA to be less environmentally beneficial; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Relocation or change in ownership of the existing facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following discussion identifies some possible changes to process unit operations used in SOCMI that might be considered modifications. The magnitude of the industry covered and the complexity of the manufacturing process permit only a general discussion of these possible changes. Therefore, the list of potential modifications for process units provided below is not inclusive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Feedstock, Catalyst, or Reactant Substitution.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Feedstock, catalyst, or reactant substitution is dictated by economics and the level of availability of the feedstock, catalyst, or reactant. Depending upon the specific process, changes in feedstock or catalyst may require substantial capital investment to modify the process to accommodate the change. The magnitude of the capital investment may prohibit feedstock or catalyst substitution for many chemicals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the chemicals produced in the SOCMI can be manufactured from two or more different feedstocks. For example, cyclohexane can be manufactured using either phenol or cyclohexanol as the feedstock. In most cases, however, feedstock substitution would likely require both equipment and process changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Substitution of reactants within the SOCMI process units is also a likely change that could constitute a modification. For example, for many chemicals, the potential exists to substitute air for pure oxygen or a chemical oxidant as a reactant or vice versa. Changing to an air oxidation process may be advantageous because: (1) Air is readily available; and (2) expensive corrosion-resistant materials are not required compared to the use of chemical oxidants. However, there may be major disadvantages in changing from an oxygen or chemical oxidation process to an air oxidation process, including a substantial reduction in plant capacity, a large increase in the reactor-related process vent stream flow rate (i.e., increased VOC emissions), and an altered product mix. The use of oxygen or air oxidation may be substituted for chemical oxidation processes as well. Reactant substitutions of this type may increase process unit VOC emissions to the atmosphere and, as a result, may constitute a modification (unless the fixed capital expenditure exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost required to construct a comparable new facility, in which case it would be considered reconstruction).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

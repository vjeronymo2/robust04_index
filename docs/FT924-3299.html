			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Margins maintained as Acal declines by 12% ACAL, the electronics and industrial controls distributor, reported lower interim profits although turnover increased as a result of recent acquisitions. Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 fell by 12 per cent from Pounds 1.52m to Pounds 1.34m on turnover which grew from Pounds 29.1m to Pounds 30.9m, including Pounds 3m attributed to recent acquisitions. Turnover in the underlying business slipped by 5 per cent, but was maintained at the same level as the second half of last year. Earnings per share dropped to 6.3p (7.1p), in part reflecting the 680,000 new shares issued at 214p each in July to fund the acquisition of Belgium-based Betea Components for BFr97m (Pounds 1.95m). The interim dividend is increased by 7.7 per to 2.1p (1.95p) per share. Mr John Curry, chairman, said gross margins had been maintained during 1991 and 1992, despite tough market conditions. Operating profit slipped to Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 1.82m). He added that the electronics divisions held up well in both the UK and continental Europe, although there were now signs of softness in northern Europe. Sales in the industrial and refrigeration divisions were down in most of Europe. Nevertheless Mr Curry said the group was achieving growth outside Europe in the refrigeration business set up last year. He added that the group was seeing a small growth in orders during the current financial year. 'We are no longer eating into the order backlog and gross margins are reasonably stable in spite of currency fluctuations and very competitive market conditions,' he said. With more than 70 per cent of the group's business overseas, the group should also be a net beneficiary of the recent effective devaluation of sterling on translation of overseas earnings.</p>

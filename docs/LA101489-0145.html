			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PANEL RAPPED ON OUT-OF-TOWN VOTE;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS: ORANGE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TRUSTEES, UNDER FIRE FOR VOTING IN PALM  SPRINGS TO CHANGE SCHOOL BOUNDARIES, WILL CONSIDER BARRING AWAY-FROM-HOME  VOTES.  </P> <P> Stung by criticism over a vote taken in Palm Springs to change school  attendance boundaries, Orange Unified School District trustees have decided to  consider a measure that would bar them from voting at future out-of-town  meetings.  </P> <P> Trustees also proposed Thursday night a wide-ranging study of the impact of  boundary changes on the ethnic makeup at district schools in response to  charges that shifting boundaries for the Linda Vista and Esplanade elementary  schools creates racially segregated schools. But they did not rescind the  boundary change, which took effect this fall.  </P> <P> The controversial 4-3 vote came during a district retreat in Palm Springs on  Aug. 15 and 16, a meeting that many of the board's critics said few members of  the public could have known about.  </P> <P> Supt. John Ikerd, however, said the board complied with requirements of the  state's open-meeting law by posting a notice on the front door of the district  offices on Glassell Street 72 hours before the retreat.  </P> <P> The change allowed about 40 Anglo students to transfer from Esplanade, which is  49% Latino, to Linda Vista, which is 90% Anglo when school began this fall. The  two schools are less than a mile from each other.  </P> <P> At Thursday night's board meeting, the board still was under attack for the way  it conducted the vote.  </P> <P> "You should never discuss business where you and your taxpayers are not eyeball  to eyeball," chided Bob Bennyhoff, a resident of Orange Park Acres and  crusading political writer for the community newspaper, Common Talk.  </P> <P> "It was a dumb thing to do," he said. "The thought crosses my mind that you  didn't want anyone to hear you. Communications is one of this board's biggest  weaknesses."  </P> <P> Bennyhoff said he learned of the vote days later, when he ran into one of the  parents who had lobbied for the change. He said he then went to the school  district offices to ask for the tape of the Palm Springs meeting, because all  other board meetings are tape recorded.  </P> <P> "Lo and behold, there's no tape," he said.  </P> <P> In a letter to Ikerd, Dorothy Gibson, another resident critical of the boundary  decision, said at Thursday night's regular meeting that she was "outraged that  the board would have the audacity to remove a public board meeting from the  confines of their school district."  </P> <P> Another resident, William G. Vasquez, asked trustees and the superintendent to  demonstrate that families affected by the proposed boundary change were  notified in advance that such a plan would be discussed and decided at the  August meetings.  </P> <P> Normally, the district sends agendas of regular board meetings to about 100  individuals or organizations, such as PTA chapters and the news media, Ikerd  said. In this case, a notice was posted only on the front door of the district  offices. But that apparently meets the legal requirements of the state's  open-meeting law, the Brown Act, according to Patricia McGinnis, assistant to  the chief legal counsel for the California Department of Education.  </P> <P> Several critics, however, say such an action smacks of the board trying to hide  its involvement in the controversial change.  </P> <P> Board President Sandy G. Englander, who proposed limiting future board votes to  meetings held within the district, said it is the perception of wrongdoing that  bothers her.  </P> <P> "Apparently there's been some concern raised (about) whether or not we were  within the Brown Act," Englander said. She said that while district officials  have no doubt that they acted within the law, "sometimes perception seems to be  a little different than reality."  </P> <P> Of that perception, she added, "If there is ever any question of doubt, we need  to clarify it."  </P> <P> The board will consider the proposal at its next meeting Monday.  </P> <P> Gibson also requested that public notices of meetings be posted on the side  doors as well as the front door of the administrative office. She said that  would make the notices more accessible to people who drive into the district  office parking lot looking for such notices.  </P> <P> Some board members balked at the suggestion.  </P> <P> "There is a limit," said trustee Jeff Holstein. "I know we want to be good  people and all that. But fair is fair and right is right. I don't see why we  have to jump at everything just when somebody brings it up."  </P> <P> Englander and trustee Russ Barrios also proposed forming a committee of  trustees and community members to examine the ethnic balance of each of the  district's schools.  </P> <P> Barrios, one of three trustees who voted against the boundary change, has said  he was concerned about the motives of the parents who wanted their children to  attend Linda Vista instead of Esplanade, which was named a Distinguished School  last year, a recognition by the state of its academic excellence.  </P> <P> In an interview earlier in the week, Barrios said he was not going to go as far  as calling the parents' motives racist, but he said he could find no good  reason for parents not to want their children to attend a school that was about  the same distance from their home, and had no record of violence.  </P> <P> "I can't look into another individual's heart," he said. "But I can look at  what's presented to me. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck . . . to  my recollection, every single board member told me, 'Hmmm, we know exactly  what's going on here.' But when the vote came, that was cast aside. I was  really disappointed and took it as a slight. I thought it was just plain  shameful."  </P> <P> Englander, who voted in favor of the boundary change, said the idea of forming  a committee to study the ethnic breakdowns is not meant to be a retreat on the  boundary issue.  </P> <P> "Without discussing how anyone voted or the position that anyone took. . . , I  think that if anybody feels there is a concern (about the ethnic balance), then  we should address this," she said. "I don't think this is an easy one to deal  with."  </P></p>

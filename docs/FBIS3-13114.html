			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Television  Network in Arabic, in a linkup with Damascus Syrian Arab  Republic Radio Network in Arabic, at 0902 GMT on 8 March begins  a live transmission from the Damascus University Auditorium of a  speech rally on the 31st anniversary of Syria's 8 March  revolution.    At 0905 GMT, ranking Syrian officials enter the hall, led by  'Abdallah al-Ahmar, assistant secretary general of the Arab  Socialist Ba'th Party [ASBP] and President Hafiz al-Asad's  representative, accompanied by other officials, including Vice  Presidents 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam and Muhammad Zuhayr Mashariqah;  Sulayman Qaddah, ASBP regional secretary; People's Assembly  Speaker 'Abd-al-Qadir Qaddurah, and Prime Minister Mahmud  al-Zu'bi. Other ministers and officials are also seated near  the podium.    The rally begins with the observance of one minute of  silence  in memory of President al-Asad's late son, Basil, and the Arab  martyrs. This is followed immediately by the Ba'th anthem.    The first to address the rally is Ahmad Abu-Musa, head of  the  Ba'th Vanguards Organization, on behalf of popular organizations  and professional unions. Abu-Musa begins his speech by euloging  Basil al-Asad and his traits, praising President Hafiz al-Asad's  patience and forbearance. He says the sympathy with Syria that  Arabs have shown illustrates the unity of the Arab nation. He  reviews Syria's political, economic, social, and democratic  accomplishments under the leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad.  He adds that the 8 March revolution was the major turning point  in the history of Syria, which turned from a small state to a  leading country able to influence Arab and world relations. He  adds that Syria's credibility has been enhanced by the Geneva  summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton, noting  that Syria's stand on the peace process is based on adherence to  Arab rights and international legitimacy and respect for UN  resolutions. He concludes by saying that Syria's stability,  national unity, and democratic practice have been enhanced by  popular organizations.    At 0927 GMT, Safwan Qudsi, member of the Progressive  National  Front [NPF] Central Command and secretary general of the Arab  Socialist Union Party, delivers a speech on behalf of the NPF.  He begins his speech by stressing the importance of historical  memory, which, he says, shows that Syria has taken large strides  since the 8 March revolution. He says that under President  Hafiz al-Asad, new realities have been created, noting that  Syria before Hafiz al-Asad was not the same as Syria with  al-Asad. He explains that President al-Asad is a historic  leader who managed to initiate conspicuous changes in the life  of Syria. He notes the launching of the al- Asad-led Corrective  Movement in 1971 has proved the ability of the 8 March  revolution to rectify its own course and to rid itself of  ideological rigidity. He notes that this would not have been  possible if the 8 March revolution had not had a special  mechanism that allows it to develop itself and to respond to  challenges and changes. He lavishly praises what he terms  President Hafiz al-Asad's genius, profound understanding of  reality, and farsightedness. Turning to Syria's participation  in the Middle East peace process, he says Syria has shown a  readiness for political flexibility, but not at the expense of  basic constants.    At 0957 GMT, 'Abdallah al-Ahmar delivers a speech on behalf  of the ASBP. After conveying the congratulations of President  Hafiz al-Asad and the ASBP command, al-Ahmar salutes the souls  of the martyrs of the ASBP and Arab nation and greets the Syrian  Armed Forces. He then eulogizes Basil al-Asad, noting that his  loss has shown the Syrian people's rallying around the  leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad, love for the deceased,  and strong national unity. He adds that this "ordeal" has also  proven the strong ties between Syria and Lebanon.    He then reviews al-Asad's role in the ASBP's struggle since  its establishment, noting that thanks to President al-Asad's  leadership, the 8 March revolution managed to tackle all  shortcomings in view of his understanding of reality. He says  the revolution after the Corrective Movement has realized  achievements everywhere in Syria. He also notes that the  revolution has stressed the importance of building the  individual through the spread of education, remarking that the  revolution has guaranteed education as one of the citizens'  basic rights. He says that under the Corrective Movement, party  pluralism was introduced, represented by the establishment in  1972 of the NPF, which groups a number of parties in Syria,  including the Ba'th Party.    Turning to the country's economic performance, he says that  "satisfactory" growth rates were achieved in 1993. He notes the  growth rates of various sectors of the economy.    He says Arab unity is a basic ASBP objective. The objective  of Arab unity, he says, guides the ASBP in all its efforts. He  says that since the Corrective Movement, President al-Asad has  been calling for Arab solidarity.    Turning to the Middle East peace process, al-Ahmar says this  process is aimed at achieving a just, comprehensive peace. He  notes that Syria joined this process on the basis of this  understanding. He notes that Syria adheres to the Madrid  formula. Since the Madrid conference, he says, Israel has been  been trying to hamper the peace process. He adds that Syria has  confronted Israel's attempts to isolate Syria, and worked to  enhance coordination among Arab parties to the peace process,  especially with Lebanon. He says Syria's efforts to confront  Israel's "maneuvers" were crowned by the Geneva summit, which  emphasized the principles of the solution and the Madrid  formula. He stresses that Syria will not relinquish one inch of  the Golan or other occupied Arab territories.    At 1045 GMT, al-Ahmar turns to the international scene,  noting that the world will not stabilize unless racism, double  standards, and aggressive tendencies are removed.    Al-Ahmar concludes his speech at 1050 GMT. Immediately  afterward, the speech rally concludes with the Syrian national  anthem. Live transmission ends at 1052 GMT.</p>

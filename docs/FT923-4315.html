			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Slow embrace of former rivals - Growing trade links between Russia and Turkey RUSSIA and Turkey next month celebrate the 500th anniversary of diplomatic relations between once great empires whose former rivalry has been replaced by political co-operation, grandiose investment projects - and debt squabbles. Catapulted to the status of a regional power by the break-up of the Soviet Union last December, Turkey is aiming to achieve what its ambassador in Moscow calls a 'strategic partnership' with Russia, embracing both politics and economics. While building up close links with the central Asian republics, Turkey is already co-operating with Russia on finding solutions to ethnic conflicts in the Trans-Caucasus. Both Turkey and Russia have a common interest in preventing strife between Azerbaijan and Armenia spilling over their borders. Turkey also wants to harness Russian energy supplies and high technology to Turkish trading skills and industrial potential. 'Our objective is to reach within five years Dollars 10bn in annual trade with the Russians,' says Ambassador Volkan Vural. That is an ambitious target, given that trade in the first six months of this year came to just Dollars 644m, and Turkey has frozen official credit lines until Russia catches up on its arrears. But a Russo-Turkish trade fair which opened in Moscow last week summed up the potential of what an ideal trading relationship would look like. One end of the historic Manezh exhibition hall exhibited food and consumer goods which Russia so badly needs and which Turkey has been supplying at much lower cost than western companies. The other end featured Russian defence enterprises seeking buyers for weapons and investment to help them convert to civilian output. Mr Vural said that Turkey was looking into buying weapons from Russia and developing its own defence manufacturing capacity after decades of being supplied by its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The two sides are said to be negotiating a Dollars 200m package to supply Turkey with helicopters, armoured personnel carriers, and other conventional weapons. Projects designed to make Turkey an international channel for transferring oil and gas from the former Soviet Union to the rest of the world are also on the drawing board. They include talk about Turkey helping to develop the Russian port of Novorossisk on the Black Sea following Moscow's loss of free access to Odessa, which is now part of an independent Ukrainian state. Although its credits were frozen after the Soviet Union's collapse, Eximbank, Turkey's official export credit institution, has earmarked 85 per cent of all its lending to the Commonwealth of Independent States, with most destined for Russia. Not a penny of a Dollars 1.15bn commitment has been allocated outside Russia and the largest central Asian republic of Uzbekistan. Despite a big Turkish political presence in this part of the former Soviet Union, credit for the other central Asians and Azerbaijan, a Turkic-speaking republic on the Caspian Sea, are still only being negotiated. Russia is supposed to spend 70 per cent of revenues from sales of natural gas to Turkey to cover the import of Turkish goods and construction work. In 1991, the former Soviet Union sold 4.2bn cu metres of natural gas to Turkey, and deliveries this year are expected to reach 4.7bn cu metres. In May Mr Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, agreed to increase gas imports to 6bn cu metres a year by 1995. But even this original formula of helping Russia generate revenue to pay for its Turkish imports has broken down because Moscow, pleading more urgent spending priorities, is not keeping its side of the bargain. It has already run up Dollars 48m in arrears to Eximbank this year. Mr Ahmet Ertugrul, Eximbank's chairman, said in Moscow last week he hoped what he called 'this default situation' would be cleared up soon so that credits could resume. Eximbank had expected that repayments would begin immediately after Mr Demirel visited Moscow in May. Turkey's politicians have made a brave choice of pressing ahead with political priorities and attempting to overcome what they hope will be short-term economic problems. Russia has yet to put itself in a position where it can fully benefit from such friendship.</p>

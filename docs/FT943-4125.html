			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pattern of EU progress leaves public feeling frozen out by Eurocrats Sir, I read with interest your editorial, 'The chance for a Euro-debate' (September 5), about a multi-speed Europe. Openness to the extension of the 'hard core' and minimum EU membership requirements will not be enough for this model to work. Further democratisation of the European Union will also be necessary. Even after Maastricht, democratic accountability undermines the moral legitimacy of the European Union and endangers both the process of integration and the process of enlargement. Until now, integration and closer co-operation among EU member states have been hammered out by national politicians in a relatively behind-the-scenes manner. This pattern cannot be sustained. It is alienating to the electorate and leaves the public with the impression that it has been frozen out by 'Eurocrats'. This process also links European integration firmly to the incumbent and often unpopular national governments who make the decisions. This discourages public debate of European issues on their own merits. In a similar fashion, the democratic deficit undermines a key element in the logic of widening the EU. Membership of the Union will do little to 'reinforce parliamentary democracy' in eastern Europe if policy-making at the European level does not incorporate greater democratic consultation. As European co-operation grows stronger, decisions made at the EU level will take on greater importance. Eastern and western Europeans alike will want a greater say as this process goes forward. But, however noble its end-goals, the current Byzantine horse-trading which characterises EU politics has little more legitimacy than a Soviet-era politburo.

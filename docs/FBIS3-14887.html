The meeting was attended by  Michel Peissik, French ambassador in Ukraine.    Leonid Kravchuk presented his ideas about the development of  Ukrainian-French relations. The Ukrainian president and the  French president's personal representative agreed on a mechanism  for devising and implementing specific projects and proposals  that will later become the groundwork for negotiations soon to  be conducted by a Ukrainian delegation that will visit Paris.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Vice President Jose Francisco Merino </F> with unidentified reporters on 20 March; place not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Merino] We have really had a demonstration of great  civic spirit. I think today could serve to prove Salvadorans  want to live in peace and democracy. We have surpassed our  expectations. Voter turnout was high. Although the Supreme  Electoral Tribunal [TSE] will give the figures, the turnout was  high, with a few exceptions.    The people's participation was truly unexpected, and the  results have been categorical. Without daring to give figures,  I would like to say the people voted intelligently. They know  and see the link that existed between the situation and violence  we had before and how peace was achieved and how we are  gradually achieving social and economic recovery.    There has to be justice for all, because we undoubtedly have  to realize our priority is to work for the neediest. With their  vote, they are now saying this is the right course. They have  entrusted the majority of the municipalities and the assembly  seats, the Presidency and the vice presidency to an  administration such as the one we have had during these five  years. There are no loses here; that is very important for you  to note. The only winner is the Salvadoran people. Just as we  gained with peace, we are gaining with democracy.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct]    [Merino] ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] is  receiving  a mandate from the people, freely expressed at the polls. The  people who will enforce it have great talent and experience.  Their honesty has already been proved, meaning that vote was  not wasted but will serve to improve our country.    [Reporter] Can you affirm you have won?    [Merino] (?I know), but the TSE will give the figures. It is  now clear the people voted for ARENA, for El Salvador. Let me  say [words indistinct] from the east, I was in the east, San  Miguel in particular. I visited several centers there. The  behavior is the same. The proportions are holding up. For  their own interest, there are some who would like to wait until  the decimal figures are out. The signals are clear, however,  [words indistinct] The TSE has to announce the figures. The  interest of many people who were kind to visit us.... [pauses]  And it is good foreign observers came, because that also helps  the country's economy. ARENA got twice the votes the FMLN  [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] did. These things  are important.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] the complaints have not been  long in coming. The FMLN has already complained regarding  certain irregularities that prevented a large turnout.    [Merino] I just told some reporters from another news medium  the FMLN leadership must review or rethink its remarks. If  there was one thing we had too much of today in all polls, it  was FMLN people with their vests and pins. They were there  watching at the voting tables. A Democratic Convergence member  belongs to the TSE. To say there was fraud amounts to not  trusting their own people who worked the whole day and their  voters who spent the whole day at the voting places.</p>

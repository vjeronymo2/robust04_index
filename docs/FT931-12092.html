			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Fashion: Paris is still the key - The nerve centre of haute couture PARIS IS the only city in the world where large numbers of people discuss seriously the economics of making dresses costing upwards of Pounds 6,000. It is still the nerve centre of haute couture and even designers from elsewhere - Versace from Milan and Valentino from Rome - come to show their collections twice a year. Not that they expect to see many customers there. The show goes on for the press. The publicity helps promote the lesser products, from perfume to purses, where the real money lies. Genuine customers have dwindled to about 1,500 worldwide, according to Vladimir de Kouzmine, managing director of Nina Ricci couture. 'There are many more women who could afford it but they do not have the patience for time consuming sittings,' he says. So it has become tempting for many designers to use couture to develop new ideas, which can be watered down for the commercial ready-to-wear. But making and showing a couture collection is enormously expensive. De Kouzmine estimates that it costs Pounds 1m a time - more than half in direct costs, the rest in tying up staff for over two months a year. The international financial concerns which control most of the houses are beginning to question the wisdom of it all. The result has been some awkward ducking and diving among designers and a division between houses who see couture as the fount of design innovation and those who feel the customer should call more of the tune. Last week's sale of the Yves St Laurent group to Elf Sanofi, state-controlled through Elf Aquitaine, followed the removal of Jean-Louis Scherrer by his Japanese financiers from the house he founded and the short-notice installation there of Erik Mortensen, himself ousted from Balmain. Balmain now has the first American in Paris, Oscar de la Renta. His first very pretty but not outstanding collection this week was seen as good customer relations. The brilliant Christian Lacroix, whose talents are best suited to haute couture, has had a setback with the failure of his perfume, C'est La Vie], launched before he was well known worldwide and the question is how long his backer, Mr Bernard Arnault, can continue to support him. At the heart of this is the dichotomy between old-style, labour-intensive craft and modern commercial expediency. Many couture houses are members of the Comite Colbert, a self-financing, 70-strong group of France's luxury goods companies, which exists to promote and perpetuate highly skilled artisan crafts. Apart from fighting such modern plagues as counterfeiting, it supports education in all the crafts on which its members depend, from workshop apprenticeships to student management and design projects on an international basis. Haute couture is fighting a rearguard action and its own governing body has reduced the minimum number of workers and outfits per collection for new couturiers in an attempt to encourage younger designers to join the profession. So far there are no takers, but financing a couture house in the recession cannot be done overnight. The most likely candidates are successful ready-to-wear designers, Thierry Mugler and Claude Montana. Mugler's collection of one-offs is already couture by any other name while Montana has designed couture for Lanvin. Both have a modernist design approach and would be welcomed by the more go-ahead houses. It is now almost two years since Yves St Laurent's partner, Pierre Berge, made his famous remark that 'couture will be dead in a decade', but the top names are determined not to sink without a lot of splashing. Chanel splashes loudest of all and, in Karl Lagerfeld, it has the world's most bankable designer. Its head of couture, Catherine Riviere is both impossibly elegant and warmly informal. She is also a consummate professional who says: 'The days of being in fashion for fun are over. Now we work hard to get new clients - subtly, not aggressively. But I believe in promoting haute couture because there are many women who can afford and want that unique workmanship once they understand it.' Chanel makes concessions to modern methods. Between 200 and 300 clients order each season (though how many outfits is not revealed) and with 90 workers their ateliers are smaller than some with fewer clients. With a global clientele who cannot all come frequently to Paris, they can work from fewer fittings and by building trust with the customer. They also take the collection to New York and Los Angeles. But the handwork is never skimped. An unembroidered dress or jacket still takes between 120 and 150 hours to make. Prices start at about Pounds 7,000 for a day dress, with suits costing up to Pounds 15,000, although exact prices are never quoted except to clients. Every house has its own subtleties and at Dior much pride is taken in the way a perfectly fitted couture outfit compensates for any imperfection in the client's figure. 'First we take her measurements and then fit a toile tightly around her,' says head of couture Annick de Cizancourt, another picture of elegance in classic Dior pale grey. 'This is built into a model of the client's body to make the outfit on.' The house has about 200 clients of whom 10 per cent are new each year, and 120 workers. The pace is more traditional than at Chanel - 'most clients accept that it takes about two months to complete an outfit. We are total perfectionists. The client is paying for the work of a seamstress who has had at least five years' training.' Chanel and Dior insist that, although there are close links between the perfume and fashion sides, the fashion side - including ready-to-wear, accessories and couture - is financially independent. At Ricci, the view is different. De Kouzmine claims 100 clients for whom about 300 outfits are made each season by 100 workers, who also do ready-to-wear alterations. The approach is more old-fashioned, with clients often being personal contacts of the staff who include a princess and a grand duchess. In spite of slightly lower prices, he says the lack of younger clients is a source of worry for the future. 'We should look at money-saving alternatives,' he said, 'like smaller collections, maybe more de luxe ready-to-wear and less couture, maybe showing only once a year as Cardin is going to do.' The designers, though, know where the crunch comes. In couture's heyday a client always expected at least one consultation per season with 'her' designer. Now it rarely happens except for special wedding dresses. 'Designers are paid to create: they're very busy,' says de Kouzmine. 'And they know that couture is not what makes the house's living.'</p>

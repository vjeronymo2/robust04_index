			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Economics: Hopeful eyes seek signs of 'robins on the lawn' amid US indicators A BUSY week for economic indicators in the US will give economists and financial markets a chance to judge whether US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's new found optimism about recovery is justified or not. He says he has spied 'robins on the lawn'. The consensus of analysts' forecasts compiled by MMS International, the business information group, suggests he may be right. Today's report from the National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) is expected to point to a slightly more upbeat assessment of the outlook among manufacturers. Friday's labour market data for February should show no further increase in unemployment from January's 7.1 per cent. A quiet week for UK economic news will be overshadowed by more frenetic political activity ahead of the Budget on March 10. Several important inflation indicators will be published on the European continent. With Germany's preliminary cost of living index for February expected to show annual inflation at more than 4 per cent, the Bundesbank will not want to relax its high interest rate policy for the time being. Events and statistics, with median market forecasts from MMS in brackets, include: Today: US: February NAPM index (48 per cent), January personal income (flat), personal consumption expenditure (up 0.4 per cent), construction spending (up 0.4 per cent), fourth quarter merchandise trade balance.

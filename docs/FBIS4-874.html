			<p>BFN     [Text] The Council of Ministers met today. The object of  the meeting was to strengthen peace and security in Bujumbura.  Here is Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko, speaking with by  Celcius Nsengiyunva.    [Begin Kanyenkiko recording] Everyone recalls that the  government asked the population to maintain peace and security  to honor the memory of our dead president of the Republic, the  late Ntaryamira and Ministers Cyriaque Simbizi and Bernard Ciza.  Unfortunately, the peace and tranquillity which had been  observed, particularly after the tragic night of 6 April, was  shattered over the last two days in some suburbs of Bujumbura.  It has been clear that the state of security in the entire  territory is dependent mainly on the security situation in the  capital.    For this reason, the Council of Ministers, in the short  term,  has set the following three objectives: First, to restore  security and trust in all the suburbs of the town. Second, to  resettle the displaced people and refugees in their respective  homes. Third, to make the people and armed groups surrender  their arms. In order to attain these objectives, the government  will carry out the following actions: First, it will do  everything possible to ensure that political and administrative  officials in zones and suburbs are men and women who are  acceptable to all sections of the population. The officials  must be open to dialogue with the cooperation of the security  forces, be impartial, and must not show leniency to wrongdoers.  Second, we shall invite members of the MIOB, the OAU  observation mission to Burundi, to go to the spot and work with  civilian and military officials, whether in the framework of  territorial administration or in the framework of the security  forces. This will bring about more trust and objectivity in  what is happening on the ground. Third, we shall broaden the  composition of the proposing committee for officials in matters  of security at the level of zones, so as to extend members of  the committee to sub-divisions and streets. [Words indistinct]  by appointing people there who are known for their integrity and  who strive for the return of peace and security.    Before ending the session, the Council of Ministers  recommended that government members immediately join other  members of the proposing committees in all the zones. This has  been in effect since 1100. [end recording]</p>

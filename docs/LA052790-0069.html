			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THANKS FOR TIP  </P> <P> I have been meaning to write and thank Jerry Hulse for a squib in his Travel  Tips column last year on CampAlaska Tours, P.O. Box 872247, Wasilla, Alaska  99687, phone (907) 376-9438.  </P> <P> I went with them for two weeks and had about the best time I have ever had on a  vacation. We must have covered 2,000 miles and saw just about everything. It  was a most reasonably priced trip, and the people in our group, from all over  the world, were bright, fun and good sports. I highly recommend this company  for a great way to really experience Alaska.  </P> <P> VAUGHN HART  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

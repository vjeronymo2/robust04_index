			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Diversified Iceland achieves 19% gain to Pounds 24.2m A SHIFT in strategy, from freezer centre to high street convenience food retailer, helped Iceland Frozen Foods Holdings report a 19 per cent advance in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 24.2m. However, signs that Iceland's strong like-for-like sales growth could be slowing down appeared to knock the shares back. Iceland shares closed 16p down at 485p. Mr Malcolm Walker, chairman, said Iceland had achieved 11 per cent sales growth in the six months to June 27, including inflation of some 2 per cent. This was expected to fall back to 7 per cent in the second half, compared with 16 per cent in the second half of 1991. Overall sales improved by 16 per cent to Pounds 480m. The main sales growth came from chilled foods and an increased number of weekly transactions. However, operating margins were trimmed back from 6.3 to 6.1 per cent as a result of the lower return on chilled products. Mr Bernard Leigh, finance director, said he expected that margins would not fall any further. The proportion of chilled foods increased from 11 per cent to 13 per cent of sales. Frozen foods accounted for 57 per cent of volume, against 60 per cent last year. Mr Walker insisted that Iceland was not abandoning its traditional frozen food market. However, he said, 'we are seriously in the chilled food business, as well as frozen foods'. Iceland was also testing the introduction of fresh produce in some of its stores. During the first half Iceland opened 14 new stores, for a total of 542. The group planned an aggressive opening programme in the second half, and a record 50 new stores next year. Capital expenditure would be Pounds 57m for the full year, slightly higher than initially anticipated. Profits were boosted by a Pounds 1m reduction in interest charges to Pounds 4.9m. Gearing was expected to be about 40 per cent by the year-end, against 54 per cent last year. The dividend was increased by 17 per cent to 3.1p. Earnings per share rose from 14.09p to 16.44p. COMMENT Iceland's reputation for double digit sales growth has helped the shares outperform the food retailing sector by more than 30 per cent over the last year. But doubts are creeping in to the share price, despite thoroughly commendable results. Again, investors are asking themselves whether Iceland's philosophy will work in the 1990s. The more the company diversifies, the less it is standing out from the army of other value-led retailers. The company's answer appears to be to keep its reputation for the growth through record store openings. The strong management is likely to achieve this, but eventually they will have to come to longer-term decisions on strategy. Forecasts are for Pounds 55m pre-tax. The prospective multiple of 13 may yet not fully reflect the niggling doubts about Iceland's philosophy.</p>

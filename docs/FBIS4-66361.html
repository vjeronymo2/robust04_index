The Chinese joint investment unit is the Zhejiang Electric  Power Development Company and the Singapore joint investment  party is the Shengbaowang Engineering and Development (Private)  Company, Ltd. This coal-fired power plant will have a total  installed generating capacity of 2,400MW and the first phase  investment will be 5.5 billion yuan renminbi, with each of the  two parties investing 50 percent of the capital and forming the  Chinese-Foreign Cooperation Ninglong Power Generation Company.    The Ninglong Power Generation Company's site has been  selected near Xianxiang Town in Yin County, Ningbo, beside  Xiangshan Bay on the East China Sea, and the project will occupy  about one square kilometer of land. Two 35,000-ton-grade coal  piers and a 3,000-ton-grade large equipment receiving and  unloading pier will also be built in conjunction with the  project.    Construction of this project may begin during the first  quarter of 1995. Construction of the project will be done  through contractual responsibility by the two joint investment  partners with each fostering its advantages. After the power  plant has been completed and in operation for 20 years, it will  be transferred to the Zhejiang Province Electric Power Bureau.    Shengbaowang Engineering and Development (Private) Company,  Ltd. is a subsidiary of Singapore's Shengbaowang Group Company.  Shengbaowang Group Company is a large well-know Singapore  company and is involved in the shipbuilding industry, maritime  petroleum projects, and other projects.</p>

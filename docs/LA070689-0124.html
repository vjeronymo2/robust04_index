			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Despite $71 million in U.S. aid since 1978 for a low-income housing project in  Egypt, it was not until this year that families were able to benefit, according  to a report by the Agency for International Development. In the report,  submitted to Congress, AID Inspector General Herbert L. Beckington complained  about U.S. aid operations as a whole in Egypt, which gets $2.3 billion a year.  He cited the project near Cairo -- still under construction -- as an example.  When the project began, the cost was to be shared equally, but by March, 1988,  the United States had spent $71 million and Egypt $63 million -- and not one  family had moved in. AID spokesman John Riddle said that since the report was  written, 205 families have moved in.  </P></p>

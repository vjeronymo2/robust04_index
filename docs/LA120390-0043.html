			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH: RETAILERS APPLAUD STING'S ALTERNATIVE CD PACKAGE  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Recording Merchandisers would like to go on record as  applauding A&amp;M and Sting for their willingness to try a packaging  alternative to the CD longbox. While many packaging prototypes are in  development, none have yet to reach the marketplace, and the feedback from the  testing of a new package will be invaluable in helping ultimately to steer the  industry toward a viable solution for CD packaging.  </P> <P> One of the questions that Patrick Goldstein raised relative to the AGI DigiTrak  (Pop Eye, Nov. 25) had to do with the ability to recycle the small plastic  struts that are currently part of the packaging design. NARM stands ready to  work with A&amp;M on testing the feasibility of recycling these plastic parts.  </P> <P> We should perhaps note that the DigiTrak, even including these small plastic  struts, constitutes a substantial reduction in the amount of waste when  compared to the existing 6 x 12-inch package in which 100% of the package is  discarded. In fact, the goal of every packaging prototype now in development is  to minimize the discarded portion of the package and to maximize the retained  portion of the package.  </P> <P> We certainly understand the eagerness of those artists who would like the  longbox to disappear immediately, but we appreciate Sting's willingness to work  with us in finding a better package not only for the retailer or the consumer,  but for the environment as well. This response constitutes an understanding  that problems of this magnitude are not solved overnight.  </P> <P> Criticizing the introduction of a new package because it may not be perfect is  a little like saying, "Don't send food to famine victims unless you can  guarantee that every mouth will get a bite."  </P></p>

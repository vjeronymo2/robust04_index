			<p>SUMMARY                                 The Japanese Government appears to be entering discussions with  the United States about resuming the stalled U.S.-Japan trade  talks under the impression that Washington is softening its  stance toward Japan on a number of key issues.  Tokyo also seems  to believe that the U.S. Government is divided over its policy  toward Japan, and that those favoring a more accommodating  approach may have, for the time being, gained the upper hand.                         END SUMMARY      In recent comments to the Japanese press, a number of senior  Japanese government officials have indicated that they see a  softening in Washington's trade policy toward Japan.      -- According to the 8 May Asahi Shimbun, Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa told reporters on 6 May that he believed that Washington  was backing off from its demand for numerical targets to measure  the openness of the Japanese market.  The paper quoted Kakizawa  as saying that he thought "the United States is beginning to  realize that such a demand will not win the support of  international opinion."      -- The 12 May Asahi Shimbun quoted unnamed Japanese officials  connected to the U.S.-Japan framework talks as citing a number of  recent examples of a softer U.S. line toward Japan.  Among these  examples were U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor's decision  to delay citing Japan under the Omnibus Trade Act for  discriminating against U.S. products and services;  President  Clinton's 3 May statement, during a 3 May television press  conference, that Washington will not seek numerical market shares  or managed trade; and the President's reported comment, during a  9 May telephone conversation with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata,  that both Japan and the United States need to work to restart the  framework talks.      Commentary in the Japanese press, which maintains close ties with  Japanese Government officials through the Japanese press club  system, has also recently portrayed Washington's stance toward  Japan as moderating.  A 3 May article in the influential,  business-oriented Nihon Keizai Shimbun argued that the U.S.  Government "has come to feel strongly the importance of Japan-  U.S. interdependence and realizes that excessive pressure on  Japan will . . .undermine U.S. interests as well."  Similarly, a  13 May Mainichi Shimbun article cited a number of examples of the  changed U.S. position, including statements by U.S. Trade  Representative Kantor that the United States is not seeking any  numerical market share in its talks with Japan;  President  Clinton's comments during his 9 May telephone conversation with  Prime Minster Hata, and comments by U.S. Ambassador to Japan  Walter Mondale, during meetings with Foreign Minister Kakizawa  and Minister of International Trade and Industry Eijiro Hata,  that the United States was prepared to be flexible on the issue  of objective criteria.  Japan's two other major national  newspapers, Asahi Shimbun and Yomiuri Shimbun, have also carried  similar articles (Asahi Shimbun, 12 May; Yomiuri Shimbun, 17  May).   Causes of Change      Japanese officials appear to believe that what they see as  Washington's softer stance stems from several factors.  One of  these is the recent sharp fall in the value of the dollar.  According to the 12 May Asahi Shimbun, one reason for the change  has been the recent sharp fall in the value of the dollar and the  negative impact this could have on the U.S. economy.  Suggesting  that the United States is reassessing its policy of pressing for  an appreciation of the yen, it quoted unnamed Japanese officials  in charge of the framework talks as saying that "the U.S.  Government has been concerned with the dollar's devaluation and  the fall in the stock market and bond prices."      Japanese officials also appear to believe that Washington does  not want to take any steps that might imperil the weak ruling  coalition government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.  The 12 May  Asahi Shimbun quoted unnamed Japanese officials in charge of the  framework talks as arguing that the U.S. Government was softening  its position toward the talks "out of consideration for the new  government in Japan."      In addition, Japanese officials apparently believe that these  concerns have strengthened the hands of those within the U.S.  Government that favor a more accommodating approach to Japan.  For example, according to the 12 May Asahi Shimbun, unnamed  Japanese officials in charge of the framework talks told the  paper that "the mood may be building within the U.S. Government  to alter the hardline trade policy upheld until now by the U.S.  Trade Representative. "  Similarly, the 3 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun  asserted that in recent "heated debate" over U.S. policy toward  Japan, officials in the National Economic Council and the  Departments of Treasury and Commerce favoring a more moderate  policy had won out over the U.S. Trade Representative's office,  which supported a continuation of the hardline approach.  The 17  May Yomiuri Shimbun argued that one of the reasons for  Washington's changing position was the impact of a letter sent by  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs Winston  Lord to Secretary of State Warren Christopher criticizing the  Clinton Administration's policy toward East Asia and calling for  less emphasis on economic issues in U.S. policy toward Japan.   Possibilities for Compromise      The perception that Washington is softening its stance toward  Japan appears to be encouraging some Japanese officials to  moderate Japan's stance in the talks and seek an accommodation  with Washington.  A number of senior officials have recently been  quoted in the press as proposing compromises on some of the major  outstanding issues in the framework talks.      -- The 18 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted Foreign Minister  Kakizawa as calling for "some kind of quantitative criteria which  would not lead to actual numerical targets" as a way to settle  the dispute over setting objective criteria to measure Japan's  trade performance.      --  According to the 21 April Nihon Keizai Shimbun, after a  meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, the Japanese  Government's special envoy for economic affairs, Nobuo Matsunaga,  called for both Tokyo and Washington to "make arduous efforts" to  devise objective criteria that do not involve numerical targets.  The paper also reported that Matsunaga stressed that both sides  needed to compromise.      -- The 18 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) Vice Minister Sozaburo  Okamatsu and Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi would  probably carry compromise proposals for "a step-by-step approach"  to setting objective criteria for measuring progress in opening  the Japanese insurance, automobile, and auto parts markets to  meetings in Washington beginning 19 May.      -- In an interview in the 11 April Nikkei Weekly, MITI Vice  Minister Okamatsu argued that both Japan and the United States  should seek a "third path" between Washington's "results-oriented  policy" and Tokyo's "process-oriented" one.   Continued Resistance      However, some senior officials, especially in the bureaucracy,  appear to continue to be wary of compromise with Washington--a  factor that could dampen the prospects for achieving a  breakthrough in the stalled negotiations.  The 3 May Nihon Keizai  Shimbun cited unnamed Japanese bureaucrats as being resentful  over reports that the United States had decided to soften its  approach for two months to see how Japan would respond.  According to the paper, the officials argued that Washington had  "no right to press Japan to respond by imposing a deadline."  The  13 May Mainichi Shimbun quoted an unnamed senior MITI official as  expressing skepticism that the Unites States was prepared to  compromise, stating that he did "not expect the United States to  drop its proposal for objective criteria so easily."  Other  senior officials have been quoted as making statements suggesting  that they anticipate that the United States will have to make  most, if not all, of the concessions if the framework talks  resume.  For example, according to the 12 May Asahi Shimbun, an  unnamed senior MITI official told the paper that the softening of  Washington's position indicated that "at long last the United  States Government has realized that no matter how hard it presses  Japan, it cannot wring concessions for . . . numerical targets."  The same article quoted another unnamed official as asserting  that in future negotiations, the two countries would have to  "reach a set of agreements that will allow the United States to  save face."   Outlook      Japan's ruling minority coalition would probably welcome the  opportunity to achieve a breakthrough in trade talks with  Washington that might reinforce its shaky political standing.  The coalition could also use such an achievement to bolster its  appeal in elections that will probably be held in the near  future.  The perception that Washington is softening its line  could play into the hands of those Japanese officials who are  seeking such a breakthrough. However, continued resistance within  parts of the bureaucracy to significant compromises in the  framework talks and the coalition's limited leverage within the  bureaucracy suggests that progress toward a compromise in the  talks will be slow.  Opponents of accommodation with Washington  may use reports of divisions within the U.S. Government over  Japan policy and of U.S. concern about the falling dollar to  argue that the United States may eventually be forced to soften  its position even further.

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Mediation urged to avoid 'overcrowded' courts THE GOVERNMENT was urged yesterday to back the private resolution of disputes as an alternative to the 'inefficient and overcrowded' public courts system. The Adam Smith Institute, a rightwing think tank, said private alternative dispute resolution (ADR), through mediation or mini-trials conducted by trained mediators or retired judges and lawyers, should be recommended by the government. The institute said the evidence against ADR from the US, where it had been used for many years, was largely anecdotal and sensationalised. Critics attempted to cast ADR in the worst possible light - referring to it as 'Cadillac justice' apparently favouring those who could afford to pay for it - or implied that it would create a two-tier system. The institute said the arguments against ADR were easily outweighed by the benefits of speedy, efficient and cost-effective solutions with the added benefit of preserving the business relationship between parties to commercial disputes. It urged the government to avoid allegations of creating a system available only to the rich by extending legal aid to cover individuals who wanted to opt for ADR. The institute said public courts should take steps to introduce ADR procedures. 'An increase in the number of options available to disputants who do seek to remain within the public courts could only add to the credibility of the traditional system of dispute resolution.'

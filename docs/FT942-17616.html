			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Social clause safeguard for Gatt trading system Sir, Christian Aid's experience in more than 70 developing countries is that labour standards could indeed be an excuse for a new protectionism ('Workers' rights and free trade', March 28). But allowing for a free-for-all would be just as bad. Global economic integration with a competitive devaluation of standards could leave workers in both north and south worse off. Unemployment in industrial countries is already increasing the pressure to adopt unilateral protectionism. Integrating a social clause into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade could be the best safeguard of a rules-based multilateral trading system. By addressing workers' rights at next month's Gatt meeting governments will also be addressing the concern of consumers who increasingly want to know that what they buy is 'fairly traded'.

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Rebuke from EU on water estimate The UK has overestimated the costs of complying with water quality directives, Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the union's environment commissioner, said in London yesterday. UK water companies have predicted that they will need to invest more than Pounds 10bn to bring water and sewage treatment standards in line with the EU urban waste water directive. But Mr Paleokrassas, whose officials met UK water regulators Ofwat and the National Rivers Authority this week, said the eventual costs were likely to be 'several billion pounds' lower. His comments came after months of rising tension between London and Brussels over water standards. The UK has attacked some standards as unnecessarily high, and asked for more time to comply. Yesterday Mr Paleokrassas said: 'There will be no lowering of standards or lengthening of dates.' Thames Water said: 'A lot of investment follows from this directive, but the costings are complex and the interpretation needs to be clarified further.' Speaking at the London School of Economics, Mr Paleokrassas also said the European Commission would say within two weeks whether the UK government's decision to licence the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield followed commission rules. 'There is some doubt as to whether the environmental impact assessment has been infringed,' he said.</p>

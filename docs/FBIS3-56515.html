			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Konstantin Petrosov: "Will Zhirinovskiy Visit </F> Armenia?"]    [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia, will visit the republic in  mid-January at the invitation of Armenia's Council of  Intellectuals, according to local mass media reports.    It is hard to say whether the fact is trustworthy and  whether  Vladimir Volfovich's coming to Armenia in the near future is  possible at all especially in the wake of his promise to turn  independent Armenia into a Yerevan gubernia as part of a Russian  empire.    Armenian social scientists, however, think Armenia does have  a social base for forces like Zhirinovskiy's, because populism  and socialist ideas take a far from back seat in semi-starving  countries.</p>

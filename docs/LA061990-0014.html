			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Bad News, Good News for 2 Live Crew: Police vice squads aren't the only ones  with a legal bone to pick with the controversial rap group 2 Live Crew. A  federal court lawsuit is claiming that the rappers made an unauthorized  derivative recording of Roy Orbison's "Oh, Pretty Woman."  </P> <P> Acuff-Rose, a Nashville, Tenn., music publishing firm, said Monday that it  refused permission to allow 2 Live Crew to record the song. However, a rap  adaptation appeared on the group's album, "As Clean as They Wanna Be," the  sanitized version of "As Nasty as They Wanna Be." "It's not about talking  dirty," said Acuff-Rose spokesman Tom Adkinson. "It's about copyright  infringement." The Nashville publishing firm asked for unspecified damages and  for the removal of all copies of the album from stores. Spokesmen for the group  and its label were not available for comment. . . . Meanwhile, the group also  got some good news Monday. The Sacramento district attorney's office said that  it did not find "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" to be obscene. The office had  launched an investigation after recent moves to make the selling of the album  illegal in three Southern Florida counties and in San Antonio, Tex. GREG  BRAXTON  </P></p>

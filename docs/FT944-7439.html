			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Hong Kong exchange chooses DTB system Hong Kong has chosen the trading and clearing system of the German futures and options market, Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), for its planned traded options market, the DTB said, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. Mr Edgar Cheng, chairman of the Hong Kong exchange, said DTB's system had been selected as the most suitable for the Hong Kong market after it had also looked into many other systems. 'The stock exchange will now be able to move ahead towards the introduction of our traded options market in the third quarter of next year,' Mr Cheng said. Mr Jorg Franke, DTB general manager, who signed the contract with Mr Cheng yesterday, said this was the first step in a long-term relationship between the two exchanges. He said the system developed by DTB, the world's largest fully computerised options and futures exchange, had handled more than 600,000 contracts a day at peak times.</p>

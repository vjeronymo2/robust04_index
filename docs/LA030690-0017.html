			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIRPORT TRYING TO BUY LAND NEAR RUNWAY  </P> <P> The Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority on Monday tentatively approved  applying for funds to buy 20.7 acres of land parallel to the airport's  north-south runway to provide a greater safety setback for planes.  </P> <P> The long strip of land east of the main runway includes the Lockheed Corp.  firefighters building, which would be removed if the airport takes possession,  authority staff members said.  </P> <P> The estimated $20-million purchase price of the land would be paid by the  Federal Aviation Administration, said airport spokesman Victor J. Gill.  </P> <P> The purchase would conform to an FAA policy that encourages airports to control  all land within 750 feet of runways, according to a staff report.  </P> <P> The strip of land is not connected to any of the properties under consideration  for a new terminal site, Gill said.  </P></p>

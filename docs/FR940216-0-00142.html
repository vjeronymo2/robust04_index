			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Requirements for Refiners, Blenders and Importers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requirements for producers of gasoline and/or gasoline blendstocks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No adverse comments were received on the proposal that a refinery which primarily produces gasoline blendstocks from crude oil (including crude oil derivatives) and mixes those blendstocks to form gasoline be subject to baseline determination using any, or a combination of, the three data types described below in paragraph 3. The requirements are being promulgated essentially as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Likewise, no adverse comments were received regarding the proposal to exempt (from the anti-dumping requirements) those entities which produce and/or supply gasoline blendstocks to refiners and blenders, but do not produce gasoline. Hence EPA is not promulgating anti-dumping requirements for such entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requirements for purchasers of gasoline and/or gasoline blendstocks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As proposed in April 1992, refiners who exclusively purchase blendstocks and/or gasoline and mix these purchased components to form another gasoline (i.e., blenders) must use Method 1-type data (as described in paragraph 3 below). Lacking sufficient Method 1-type data, the blender shall have the anti-dumping statutory baseline as its individual baseline. Most who commented on this issue suggested that blenders should be allowed the same opportunities as refiners to use 1990 and post-1990 gasoline and blendstock data. Otherwise, a blender may have to ``reformulate'' its conventional gasoline. Commenters also stated that this provision penalized blenders for not sampling their 1990 fuel when there were no such requirements. As discussed in the proposal, EPA does not believe that use of blendstock data or post-1990 gasoline or blendstock data would allow an accurate portrayal of a blender's 1990 production. Additional comments are discussed in the RIA; however, none led to a change in the proposed requirements for blenders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requirements for importers of gasoline. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  On April 16, 1992, EPA proposed that those who imported gasoline into the U.S. in 1990 must use Method 1-type data (as described in paragraph 3). Lacking sufficient Method 1-type data, the importer would have the anti-dumping statutory baseline as its individual baseline. An importer who did not import gasoline into the U.S. in 1990, but who does so after 1994, would also have the anti-dumping statutory baseline as its individual baseline. EPA proposed that if a U.S. importer is also a refiner and imported 75 percent or more of the 1990 gasoline production of a refinery into the U.S. in 1990, it could determine a baseline for that refinery using the three data types described in paragraph 3 below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most commenters agreed with EPA's overall proposal concerning importers. Some felt, however, that the ``75 percent'' criteria was self-selecting_only those importer/refiners with higher baseline emissions relative to the statutory baseline would choose to develop an individual baseline. Those importer/refiners with relatively low baseline emissions would use the statutory baseline, and thus dumping could result, since they would be complying with a baseline which was less stringent than one based on their own 1990 gasoline quality. EPA agrees that ``dumping'' could occur, but expects it to be minimal since few importing refineries are likely to meet the ``75 percent'' criteria. Nonetheless, EPA is requiring that all importers which are also refiners utilize Method&blank; 1-, 2- and 3-type data to determine the individual baselines of their refineries which meet the 75 percent criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter claimed that location, not percent of production imported, dictates enforceability. However, EPA believes that enforcement of a non-domestic refinery is governed less by location and more by the willingness of the company and/or country to open its refinery for compliance visitations. Another commenter specifically stated that Canadian refineries should be treated the same as domestic refineries for the purpose of establishing baselines. As stated, EPA believes that it will be relatively easy to accurately determine the quality of the gasoline produced in 1990 at a refinery outside of the U.S., for sale to the U.S., if a significant amount (i.e., 75 percent) of the production of the refinery came to the U.S. Independent of where the refinery is located, if less than this amount was imported, it will be more difficult to combine information on refinery operations and blendstock and gasoline data (i.e., Methods 2 and 3-type data) and allocate such information so as to establish the quality of the refinery's 1990 gasoline which was sent to the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters felt that an importer should be allowed to use all available 1990 and later data to establish a baseline and have its baseline verified by an auditor. However, as stated in the proposals, EPA believes that significant dumping could occur if post-1990 data is allowed since that data may not represent the importer's 1990 gasoline. EPA is thus promulgating this essentially provision as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requirements for exporters of gasoline. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA's proposals did not explicitly discuss whether gasoline exported from the U.S. in 1990 would be included in individual baseline determinations. However, because exported gasoline did not contribute to pollution in the U.S. in 1990, a producer of gasoline exported from the U.S. in 1990 shall not include the exported gasoline properties or volumes in its baseline determination. A refiner which exports all of its future gasoline outside of the U.S. is not subject to the anti-dumping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / City critical of government after bomb ORGANISATIONS IN the City of London strongly criticised the government following the IRA bomb at Bishopsgate last Saturday, according to an FT/MORI survey. Only one third said they were either 'fairly satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with the performance of the government in dealing with the problems caused by the IRA, while 34 per cent were 'fairly' or 'very dissatisfied'. When asked about reasons for their dissatisfaction most highlighted a perceived failure by the government to change the political situation in Northern Ireland. 'The same stance as 30 years ago has not achieved a result,' said one. One commented: 'There seem to be no new initiatives - they always react to everything after it's happened.' Another said: 'The problem has to be tackled before bombs get into trucks.' Several called on the government to increase its commitment to finding a solution, suggesting measures such as better intelligence, improved security and tighter co-ordination. Less than a third had positive comments on the performance of the government following the bombing, while 17 per cent said they rated it 'poor' or 'very poor'. Fifty-nine per cent were positive about the role of the press. But the Corporation of London received high praise, with nearly three quarters rating it 'very' or 'fairly good'. The police received positive comments from 60 per cent of organisations, and the fire service from nearly half. Most said the police or the City corporation should co-ordinate greater security between companies in future. Eighty-four cent of organisations supported a greater police presence on the streets of the City to prevent terrorism, 79 per cent wanted the police to have powers to set up road blocks when they felt it necessary and 74 per cent wanted formal co-ordination of security arrangements by organisations in the City. Just less than three-quarters said they already had a formal contingency plan with which to respond to crises such as a terrorist bomb, of which 26 per cent put the plans into operation after the explosion. The proportion of organisations with plans fell to two-thirds for organisations with less than 1,000 employees. The highest proportion without plans were investment houses, regulators and accountants. Most of those with contingency plans had only developed them very recently, with 45 per cent formalised since the bomb at the Baltic Exchange in April last year. More than a quarter of organisations said that some of their City workforce was unable to work on the Monday after the bombing, with the worst affected being investment houses. Even by Wednesday, 15 per cent of companies said none of their workforce was working. Operations were also affected in other ways. Several companies mentioned that they helped others with accommodation and other assistance. Some had work disrupted because of damage to clients' or customers' offices. At least two mentioned difficulties in getting access to their buildings after the bombing. Half of companies already had external security cameras and 48 per cent had toughened glass. Nearly four-fifths had introduced greater controls on entry to their buildings. Nearly a quarter of companies said that they would consider installing cameras following the bombing, 15 per cent a redesign of office accommodation and 19 per cent moving key functions permanently to less vulnerable locations.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / State plans to tighten up on free market in vodka THE Russian government said yesterday it would reimpose a state monopoly on the production, storage and sale of vodka, the country's national drink, and other spirits as part of efforts 'to restore order in the country and society at large'. A spokesman told Itar-Tass news agency that President Boris Yeltsin would soon sign a decree prompted by concern over an increase of poisoning cases from both Russian and imported spirits. He said this was 'far from the last' of several measures being undertaken by the government to restore poryadok - the favourite Russian word for law and order in everyday life. The production and sale of vodka has traditionally been a state monopoly in Russia, both under the tsars, and under 70 years of Communist rule. It has been a big source of revenue for the state treasury throughout the centuries. But since liberalising both domestic trade and imports a year and a half ago, the country has been flooded with foreign vodka and other spirits. Russia's own state producers are unable to meet demand, and bottles of locally produced vodka have been increasingly found to be diluted or otherwise tampered with. Tax collectors have seen very little of the profits from the increased sales, much of which are conducted by street kiosks which do not even have cash-registers. Rather than to chase away the bottles of Smirnoff and other foreign-produced spirits now on sale, the spokesman suggested that the main aim of the decree was to enforce state certification of drinks to ensure they were up to standard. But with hundreds of brands of alcoholic drinks sold at thousands of kiosks all around Moscow, the authorities are unlikely to be able to implement the decree, at least in the capital. More likely, it will provide a great cash-spinning opportunity for officials and police to levy bribes not to enforce it.</p>

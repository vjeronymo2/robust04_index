			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAMS BACK TO NFC WEST TITLE CHASE;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER EASY VICTORY OVER PHOENIX, ROBINSON IS TALKING ABOUT  CATCHING SAN FRANCISCO.  </P> <P> The Rams threw a welcome back party for themselves Monday after returning from  a four-game losing streak to the thick of the race in the NFC West.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, Coach John Robinson was outlining his team's chances in  complicated terms of wild-card playoff spots, all but conceding the division to  San Francisco. He wasn't exactly limb-stepping then, considering the 49ers were  cruising along at a Super Bowl clip while Robinson's Rams were praying they'd  never see another Hail Mary pass thrown their way again.  </P> <P> Trailing the 49ers by two games with five left and the Rams are in the thick of  the race? OK, maybe it's a thinner race than that, but it certainly beats their  view from the Minnesota locker room a few weeks back.  </P> <P> The Rams already have beaten the 49ers once. Of their remaining five games,  classify two as tossups: this week's battle in New Orleans and the Dec. 11  rematch with the 49ers at Anaheim Stadium. If you don't think you can win the  other three -- Dallas, New York Jets and New England -- kindly remove your team  from the playoffs and this discussion.  </P> <P> The 49ers have four tough games remaining: the New York Giants, Rams, Chicago  and Buffalo. Throw in one freebie, Atlanta.  </P> <P> The Rams are in reasonable shape if they can stay at least two games behind the  leaders until their December rematch. If the Rams beat San Francisco again and  sweep the season series, they'd win any first-place ties with the 49ers, who  close out the season against Chicago and Buffalo.  </P> <P> The Rams finish with the Jets and Patriots. Naturally, coaches never look  beyond next week's game, but Robinson's outlook has changed from the days of  defeat and dirges.  </P> <P> "We've got to be realistic," Robinson said. "To win the division, we've got to  win the rest of the games. Maybe you could get away with losing one. But I  think we have to beat San Fransico to win the division. I could see us  conceivably tying them. Then, if we beat them twice, we would be the  champions."  </P> <P> Aren't we getting a little ahead of ourselves here?  </P> <P> "I don't want to be led into these things about prophesying the future,"  Robinson said. "I just want to try and beat New Orleans."  </P> <P> And that is an imposing task in itself. Not only do are Saints just a game  behind the Rams at 6-5, they've already beaten the Rams once, meaning a slip-up  in New Orleans could wipe the Rams off the playoff map altogether.  </P> <P> The roads are diverse and unsettled, division champs or home for the holidays.  What's it going to be?  </P> <P> "The only thing realistic for us is just not worry about it," Robinson said.  "And I'm like everyone else. I go home at night and I make out all these  charts, and then I lose them and can't find them the next morning, so I have to  make out a new chart."  </P> <P> Jerry Gray's great day against Phoenix -- two interceptions, eight tackles,  four passes defended -- has convinced Robinson to switch the cornerback to his  natural position, free safety, next season.  </P> <P> Robinson has talked about it before, but this time he's serious. Gray has made  three consecutive Pro Bowls at left cornerback, but the Rams think they're only  scratching the surface with his open-field talent.  </P> <P> "I should take Jerry Gray and say, 'you're a safety, even if I've got to hire  you on the right corner and me on the left corner,' " Robinson said. "Last year  we kind of wanted to do it and chickened out."  </P> <P> With LeRoy Irvin's skills slipping with age, Robinson was afraid to make the  move this year and be left with two inexperienced corners, Cliff Hicks and  rookie Darryl Henley.  </P> <P> But Hicks has recovered from a rocky start to challenge Irvin for the starting  position, and it might already be Hick's. Irvin hasn't started the last two  games because of a foot injury, and getting his job now will take some work.  Gray was an All-American safety at the University of Texas, and has always  prefered the safety over cornerback.  </P> <P> Gray plays free safety in the Rams' pass-defense package, but next year the  switch will be complete.  </P> <P> "I think Jerry (age 26) could play well into his 30s at that position and be  very successful," Robinson said. "And I think he will be an All-Pro at that  position. . . . I think Jerry's a '9' as a safety. At corner, he's not a '9'."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> John Robinson said Doug Reed's left ankle sprain would probably put him out for  two weeks, although Reed was more optimistic on Monday. "I think I could  probably come back pretty quick," he said. . . . Cleveland Gary got six carries  in the Rams' victory over Phoenix on Sunday, but Robinson said it's not his  fault. "We didn't get the ball early, and I was getting (upset)," Robinson  said. "We got it and we scored. I know Cleveland Gary is a player. I thought he  was before, now I know." . . . Henry Ellard now has 5,537 career receiving  yards, good for third place on the team's all-time list. He's five catches shy  of moving ahead of Jack Snow into third place on the all-time reception list  behind Tom Fears and Elroy Hirsch. "Until I'm No. 1, I can't think too much of  it," Ellard said of his accomplishments.  </P> <P> THE RAMS BY THE NUMBERS  </P> <P> HIGHLIGHT  </P> <P> HENRY ELLARD  </P> <P> He might have had some better days in his seven-year pro career, but he has  never had more fun than Sunday. He caught five passes from Jim Everett, but it  was what he did with them that had Rams fans on their feet. He got two Cardinal  defenders turned around in the first quarter, took a short pass from Everett  and streaked 49 yards for a touchdown. His response to a 42-yard fourth-quarter  TD play was an end-zone forward somersault. The 163 yards he accounted for  enabled him to move into third place on the Rams' all-time reception yardage  list with 5,537.  </P> <P> SEASON TO DATE  </P> <P>  Eleven-game totals  </P> <P> </P> <P>

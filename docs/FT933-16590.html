			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Nokia to increase size of placement NOKIA, the Finnish electronics group which has recently moved back into profit on the back of rapid telecommunications sales, said yesterday it was increasing the size of an international share placement, originally announced in May, to 5.22m preference shares from 3.8m in response to strong demand. The offer price was set at FM159 (Dollars 28.07) per share, promising Nokia around FM830m in new capital which, the group said, made the offering the biggest international issue by a Finnish company. Lead-managers Credit Suisse First Boston and Enskilda Corporate have also been given an option to sell a further 780,000 shares to cover oversubscriptions. The price compared with a market level of just over FM160 earlier this week. Nokia yesterday expressed satisfaction that the issue, which will result in a near-10 per cent dilution of existing Nokia stock, had not dented demand on the Helsinki stock exchange. Volume was strong yesterday at around 600,000 shares traded and the price moved above FM170. Before the issue, some 20 per cent of Nokia stock was foreign-held following the relaxation of restrictions on foreign share ownership from the start of this year. Mr Jorma Ollila, chief executive, said the new capital would greatly strengthen Nokia's balance sheet, helping it fund a surge by its telecommunications and mobile telephone businesses recently in Europe and eastern Asia. Last month, Nokia reported a pre-tax profit for the first four months of FM154m, rebounding from a FM280m loss at the same stage last year and an overall loss in 1992 of FM158m. The chief factor behind the improvement was a 109 per cent rise in mobile phone sales and an 80 per cent rise in telecommunications sales.</p>

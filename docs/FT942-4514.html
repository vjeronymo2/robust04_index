			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Strong UK sales growth as Electrocomponents rises 40% Strong UK sales growth helped Electro-components, the electronic, electrical and mechanical components distribution group, report a 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to March 31. Profits were Pounds 72.7m, against Pounds 51.9m after net losses of Pounds 7m on disposals. Earnings per share were 22.9p (19.3p) and a proposed final dividend of 7p makes a total of 9.5p (7.9p). The shares closed 12p higher at 487p. Sir Keith Bright, who steps down after five years as chairman next month, said the results reflected 'the start of the climb out of recession in Australia, Ireland and particularly the UK.' Turnover increased by 2.3 per cent to Pounds 396.5m (Pounds 387.5m). Excluding the effect of the disposal of the lossmaking Misco businesses the previous year, turnover grew by 14 per cent and operating profits increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 69.9m (Pounds 60.1m). Sales in RS Components' UK division increased by 12.2 per cent to Pounds 279.6p as the group extended its catalogue range and boosted market share. RS International's sales grew by 35 per cent to Pounds 79.9m despite the difficult trading conditions and showed a profit underlining the progress made by the group's expanded continental European operations. Sales at Pact International fell by 3 per cent to Pounds 37m giving a Pounds 300,000 loss. The strong cash generation of the RS business in the UK resulted in a Pounds 20.6m increase in net cash to Pounds 57.4m over the year. COMMENT The results were slightly ahead of expectations and serve to highlight the strong performance of the core distribution business in the UK and the success of the group's focused strategy. The push into overseas markets is continuing with a new joint venture in India and the strengthening of distribution partnerships in Europe, the middle east and east Asia. This overseas expansion, particularly the start-up operations in Europe, should drive earnings forward well into the next decade. Meanwhile the cash balances will be used to support organic growth including a Pounds 35m investment over the next two years in a new warehouse in Nuneaton. This year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 83m look possible producing earnings of 26p and putting the shares on a deserved multiple of 18.7.</p>

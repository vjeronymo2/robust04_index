Dmitri Ryurikov, the presidential aide, in an interview with  BNS said similar "provocations" had taken place on several  occasions and that such action "would hardly contribute to  progress in the negotiations" between the two countries.    Referring to an incident last month in Latvia, when a  regional leader ordered two Russian generals detained and sent  out of the country, Ryurikov called the sequence of events a  "rather coordinated policy" of the Baltic countries.    He said the events were viewed by Russia as "regrettable."  In  his words Russia, having done "quite a lot" for the Baltics  becoming sovereign and independent countries, "has the right to  count on a definitely different attitude." "Russia hopes that no  such episodes will occur in the future," he said.    Ryurikov said there was going to be no reaction to the  incident from President Yeltsin.    The Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday delivered a protest  to  Estonian Ambassador Juri Kahn. "It is difficult to say how much  effect such protests will have on the hotheads, on extremists,  but one would like to trust that the authorities will implement  measures to protect the Russian military units," the  presidential aide said.</p>

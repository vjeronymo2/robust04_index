			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Russia toughens Chechnya stance Pressure mounted on rebel Chechnya yesterday as the Russian defence minister, General Pavel Grachev, admitted that aircraft which bombed the breakaway region's capital last week, killing nine people, were Russian. Moscow had previously denied that its aircraft were involved. Gen Grachev and two other top security officials yesterday left Moscow for the southern region neighbouring Chechnya. Gen Grachev, interior minister Viktor Yerin and Mr Sergei Stepashin, head of the counter-intelligence service, flew to Mozdok in North Ossetia for a tour of inspection of the Russian soldiers and military hardware being amassed around Chechnya's borders. Gen Grachev was reported last night to be ready for negotiations with General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president, as early as today. He was quoted as saying that a decision on the future of Chechnya would be made by Thursday. However, Gen Dudayev told the official Russian news agency, Tass, that he remained in favour of 'negotiations on an equal basis with the Russian leadership' - an apparent demand to involve President Boris Yeltsin in the talks. This has already been ruled out by Mr Yeltsin's aides. There are growing demands in Moscow for hostilities to be put on hold in favour of negotiations. The Russian military and the secret services are being blamed for precipitating an abortive attack by the Chechen opposition on the capital Grozny 10 days ago - more than 20 Russian servicemen were taken prisoner in the action.</p>

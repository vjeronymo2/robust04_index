			<p>BFN     [Text] According to updated information acquired by the  security authorities, it appears that the murder of the two  Turkish Cypriots in Stavrokonos village is the work of the  Turkish Secret Services.    Based on this information, it appears that the crime was  carried out by people who were acting on the orders of the  Turkish Secret Services. One of the victims, (Ozker Tufansu),  was a major witness for the Republic of Cyprus to overturn  claims by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' regime that 22  Turkish Cypriots who were living in the free areas had been  brutally mistreated by the police. Tufansu, who was in the free  areas, fled to the occupied areas but later returned. Ten days  before his assassination, he revealed Turkish activities to the  police. A few days ago, two deserters who were soldiers at the  Attila line [the buffer zone] came to the free areas because  they said they could not tolerate the occupation regime's  suppression.    Approximately 400 Turkish Cypriots live in the free areas  today and 180 of them are deserters.</p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL SEMI SELLS COMPUTER UNIT;  </P> <P> HITACHI, GM TO BUY MAINFRAME BUSINESS FOR $398 MILLION  </P> <P> National Semiconductor Corp., the Santa Clara computer chip maker, said Monday  that it has reached a tentative agreement to sell its mainframe computer  business to Hitachi Ltd. and a unit of General Motors Corp. for $398 million.  </P> <P> Several analysts said the deal was a great financial coup for National  Semiconductor, while others noted that it gives Hitachi, Japan's fourth-largest  computer maker, an even stronger foothold in the U.S. electronics industry.  </P> <P> Under the proposed deal, Hitachi would own 80% of the joint venture buying  National Advanced Systems, National Semiconductor's mainframe computer unit.  The remaining 20% would be owned by Dallas-based Electronic Data Systems Corp.,  the General Motors subsidiary created and later sold by H. Ross Perot. The deal  is expected to close within 60 days.  </P> <P> Last month, National Semiconductor said it had reached a tentative accord to  sell 50% of its mainframe unit to Memorex Telex NV of Amsterdam for $250  million in cash and 4 million shares of Memorex Telex stock.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ties to Hitachi  </P> <P> Complications in financing the deal arose, however, and the agreement expired,  freeing National Semiconductor to consider other offers, said George Bragg, a  spokesman for Memorex Telex's U.S. subsidiary in Tulsa, Okla. He said Memorex  Telex proposed other deals but could not match the all-cash offer from Hitachi  and EDS.  </P> <P> National Advanced Systems already has ties to Hitachi. It is the largest  distributor of Hitachi's Japanese-made, IBM-compatible mainframe computers and  data-storage systems, with operations throughout the United States and Europe.  In its most recent fiscal year, the 2,000-employee unit had sales of $900  million.  </P> <P> However, National Semiconductor has been trying to sell its computer operations  to concentrate its efforts on its core, chip-making operations, which have  suffered in recent months. In December, the company announced an agreement to  sell its DataChecker Systems unit for $90 million to a unit of STC PLC in  London.  </P> <P> "From National's standpoint, it's a very positive move," John McManus, of  Thomas McKinnon Securities in New York, said of the proposed sale. "They get  all the money up front. I think it's a great move."  </P> <P> Jim Hammons, a computer industry analyst with the Sierra Group in Tempe, Ariz.,  also said the deal was good for National Semiconductor but wondered what it  would do with all the money.  </P> <P> </P> <P> European Portion to Be Sold  </P> <P> "National couldn't do anything with NAS," Hammons said. "So now that they've  gotten rid of it, the question is what are they going to do with the cash that  they couldn't do with the company?"  </P> <P> National Semiconductor spokeswoman Mary Coady said the money would go toward  the retirement of debt and working capital.  </P> <P> Hitachi has said it intends to sell the European portion of the business, which  accounts for less than half its revenue, to Comparex Information Systems GmbH  for an undisclosed price. Comparex, based in Mannheim, West Germany, is  Hitachi's other sales outlet for mainframe computers in Europe.  </P> <P> As a result of the two sales and two rounds of layoffs in the chip-making  operations, National Semiconductor's worldwide employee count will stand at  about 35,000. Its stock closed at $8.25 on Monday, up 12.5 cents, on the New  York Stock Exchange.  </P></p>

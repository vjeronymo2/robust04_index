			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan G. Ivanov commentary: "Opposite Poles Attract One </F> Another"]    [Text] At one time there was a popular joke to the effect  that "every rumor is a reality!" It has turned out that this  witticism still has topical significance.    The persistent rumor of a meeting between the top leaders of  the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] and BSP [Bulgarian  Socialist Party] is on the way to being confirmed. Filip  Dimitrov, SDS National Coordinating Council leader, has declared  that he has met with [BSP leader] Zhan Videnov.    The leaders of the two main political forces indeed have  plenty to talk about. The subjects for discussion go far beyond  seeking a way out from the vexatious situation in which the SDS  and BSP have found themselves and possibly forming a coalition  to fight local elections.    Both the SDS and the BSP have their reservations regarding  Dr. Zhelev, and they did not permit him to extend his powers.    The same applies to any early National Assembly elections. A  well-calculated amendment to the Electoral Law would enable the  SDS's "disloyal ally," the DPS [Movement for Rights and  Freedoms], to be thrown overboard and ensure the tranquil  existence of a two-party parliament in the future.    Another question is that neither the SDS nor the BSP really  want elections before the end of parliament's allotted term.  This is also a subject for discussion.    Regarding the naive voters (if there are any left) for whom  the idea of such a meeting appears ridiculous, let them recall  one of the laws of physics, which states that opposite poles  attract one another.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Greenspan deflates Wall Street optimism  -Capital &amp; Credit Just when it seemed safe for investors to wade back into the US Treasury market, Mr Alan Greenspan returned to the beach, blowing his warning whistle again. The menace, of course, is higher inflation, not to mention the commitment of the Federal Reserve chairman, as America's economic lifeguard, to contain the danger by lifting interest rates whenever the central bank sees fit. It seems the demise of uncertainty was greatly exaggerated in the run-up to the Fed chief's appearance on Capitol Hill. 'What people want is certainty and we can only be certain they are not going to find it,' says Mr Jim Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. Mr Greenspan made sure of that in his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony before the Senate and House banking committees. He told them that it was 'an open question' whether inflationary pressures were still lurking below the surface of the economy, despite the steady increase in interest rates since February. He left bond traders with the distinct impression that a fifth move to tighter money supply this year could come at any time, though he stopped well short of saying a rate increase was a foregone conclusion. Most analysts now expect a tightening will coincide with the Fed's next policy-making session on August 16. After its July policy meeting, when the policy was left unchanged, bond traders began to grow bolder in the conviction that the Fed had indeed achieved Mr Greenspan's stated goal of moving to a 'neutral' policy stance, one which would neither encourage or discourage expansion. 'The market wants to believe what has been profitable for a long time, namely, that the economy will oblige by coming in weaker than expected,' says Mr Grant. The big jump this spring in leveraged positions held by primary government-bond dealers, from Dollars 147.4bn on March 20 to Dollars 169bn on June 22, shows the willingness of the market to throw caution to the wind, he says. Still, the perception that monetary policy was on hold was reinforced by recent data. Business inventories in May showed their largest monthly increase in seven years, the Commerce Department reported just a week ago, suggesting a slowdown in industrial production in the second half of the year. With such evidence of a cooling economy in hand, Mr Greenspan had been expected to confirm the market's rekindled hopes and pave the way for the bulls' return. Had traders revealed a touch of naivety? Nonsense, says Mr Robert Brusca, an economist at Nikko Securities in New York. Only a week earlier, Mr Greenspan himself had described the economy as enjoying the best of both worlds: moderate growth and low inflation. 'People thought that after that description, we would hear a rather friendly testimony last week, which did not turn out to be the case,' says the analyst, who has been critical of what he describes as the chairman's 'ad hoc' handling of monetary policy during the recession and afterwards. 'The question now is, who is testifying: Dr Jekyll or Mr Greenspan,' Mr Brusca quips. Other analysts, however, contend that the market was ripe for a setback last week, regardless of the tone and substance of the Fed chief's remarks. Much of the buying in the brief rally that preceded his testimony came from dealers covering 'short' positions, that is, replacing securities they had borrowed and resold on speculation that prices would fall. Most retail accounts stayed on the sidelines or confined their activity to the short end of the maturity range. Where does the market go from here? With Mr Greenspan's cautionary note, bonds appear vulnerable. With all the short positions driven out, the most likely direction is a downward drift until after the Fed's August 16 meeting. Traders say an upturn is possible, but unlikely, if economic data over the next month are perceived as causing the Fed policy-makers to delay the move for which Mr Greenspan has laid the groundwork. Mr Scott Knous, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data of Boston, expects the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury to spend the next month near 7.75 per cent, 25 basis points above the recent low of just under 7.50 per cent. He describes the overall tone as 'non-committal'. But the market will not confine its perspective to the US economic fundamentals. A further cut in German rates, a dollar rally and a fall in commodity prices would prove supportive, traders say. The market will need as much help as it can muster, with some Dollars 97bn in fresh supply coming up for auction before the Fed session. Not everyone is pessimistic about the outlook, even though the Treasury's quarterly refunding operation falls in the middle of the summer doldrums. 'I don't think the supply itself will be a problem if the market begins to get some signal that will resolve some of these uncertainties,' says Thomas Poor, manager of Scudder's Global Opportunities US Short-Term Income Fund.</p>

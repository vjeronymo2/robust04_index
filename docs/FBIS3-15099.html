Karimov Promises Not To </F> Tolerate Discrimination"]    [Text] "Uzbekistan has no future without Russia,"  Uzbekistan President I. Karimov stated while on an official  visit to Moscow. Confirmation of this is the package of  documents signed in the Kremlin by B. Yeltsin and I. Karimov.    The key document among them is the Russian-Uzbek  Declaration,  noting the principles of friendly relations between the two  countries and a mutual interest in developing bilateral links.  The spectrum of these is broad, and it is elaborated in detail  in the economic and military treaties. But this list lacks an  extremely important document which is vital for guaranteeing the  rights of the Russian-speaking population in Uzbekistan. It was  learned that I. Karimov is not as yet prepared to sign the  treaty on dual citizenship proposed by Russia. But he did give  the Russian president assurances that he will not tolerate human  rights infringements on ethnic grounds.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The services of the Communication Ministry today  issued an explanation on the article that was published by the  daily AL-WATAN entitled: The Presidency: A New Structure Under  Examination.    The Communication Ministry's statement asserted that the  issue here revolved around an article that epitomized and  commented in a derisory manner on a topic that was classified  top secret by the Defense Ministry.    Following the publication of such an article, the  Communication Ministry service explanation added, the office of  the communication minister summoned AL-WATAN editors, as well as  the journalist who wrote the article for a meeting. They were  asked to furnish the names of those who supplied them with the  information in a bid to establish the source of the leak that  was used to write the article that clearly violated the criminal  code articles, as well as the information bill.    A collective statement was signed by two AL-WATAN editors  and  the journalist with their free will. The latter did, however,  sign another statement individually.    The communication minister's statement points out that the  unfounded claims, published in today's AL-WATAN editorial, has  complicated the situation in the country because the highest  body of the state was depicted as a normal administration.    The Communication Ministry statement concluded by saying  that  there was no doubt that necessary legal measures will be taken  by the competent authorities against AL-WATAN.</p>

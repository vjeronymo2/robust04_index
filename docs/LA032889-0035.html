			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPER'S WILL TO INCLUDE $5 MILLION FOR BURBANK  </P> <P> Sherman Whitmore, who battled Burbank residents and officials for eight years  over development rights in the Verdugo Mountains, announced Monday that he  intends to establish a trust that will grant the city at least $5 million when  he dies.  </P> <P> Whitmore, 55, said he wants the money to go to the city's schools, libraries  and "helping the disenfranchised. I want this to help the city of Burbank."  </P> <P> Whitmore met opposition from the community and the Burbank City Council when he  tried to develop the more than 170 acres he owns in the Verdugo Mountains. The  council approved development plans in December, 1987, but only after reducing  the number of proposed homes on the property from 212 to 129.  </P> <P> Whitmore denied that he is trying to win favor with city officials, whom he  once called "unconscionable."  </P> <P> "I don't have any more property or projects pending in Burbank," he said.  "Nobody can say I'm doing this to feather my nest because it's already been  feathered."  </P> <P> The announcement caught many city officials by surprise.  </P> <P> "It's the first I've heard of it," Mayor Al F. Dossin said when told of the  announcement. "He's a very young, healthy man. Depending on the details, I  think it's a pretty nice gesture."  </P> <P> Dossin said the grant is the first of its kind that he knows of in Burbank. He  said other developers have donated money to charitable organizations in the  city, but never to the city itself.  </P> <P> Burbank City Manager Bud Ovrom said Whitmore had discussed the matter  informally with some city officials, but the developer had not presented formal  plans.  </P> <P> "That's a lot of money for the city," Ovrom said. "But frankly, we wish him a  long life and good health, and we don't see us getting any money from him in  the foreseeable future."  </P> <P> The money will be held in a "charitable remainder unitrust" worth from $10  million to $12 million, at least half of which will go to Burbank, said  Whitmore's accountant, Jeff Jones. Until his death, Whitmore will be entitled  to 10% annually of the fair market value of the trust's assets, Jones said.  </P> <P> Ovrom said he believes that Whitmore will draw substantial tax advantages from  the trust.  </P> <P> "I'm sure there are obvious consequences," he said. "And he has explained the  tax consequences to me, but I don't remember the conversations well enough to  explain how those work."  </P> <P> Jones said the trust was submitted to the Internal Revenue Service for approval  two months ago. He said he expects the fund to be approved in two months.  </P> <P> In addition to cutting the number of homes that Whitmore could build in his  Verdugo Mountains development, city officials in 1986 rejected his plans to put  33 single-family homes on a 61-acre parcel in Craig Canyon. Whitmore later sold  the land to the city for $1.1 million, half of which was paid for by the state.  </P> <P> Plans for the Verdugo Mountains development were recently delayed after the  federal Environmental Protection Agency announced that it wanted to review an  environmental study of the land by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Burbank  City Atty. Douglas C. Holland said.  </P> <P> Holland said the review is to ensure that Whitmore will replace water sources,  needed by wildlife, that will be removed during construction of the project.  </P></p>

Pisarzhevskiy, Kiev; UDC541.145]    [Abstract] The development of effective photocatalysts is  closely related to the search for ways to eliminate undesirable  deactivation processes resulting in the dissipation of  photoenergy into heat or luminescence whereby a significant  portion of the light quanta absorbed by the photocatalyst is  expended without inducing chemical reactions. In the case of  semiconductor catalysts, the main deactivating process is  recombination of generated photoexcited charges, i.e. electrons  in the conductance zone and holes in the valency zone.  Therefore, in considering the possibility of using any  particular semiconductor as a photocatalyst, preference is  usually given to materials in which electron-hole recombination  is not well pronounced. In this respect, heterojunctions are of  special interest. These are systems consisting of a  semiconductor matrix with some other semiconductor material  superimposed on its surface. One special property of such  semiconductor heterojunctions is their very efficient and in  some cases irreversible ability to separate photogenerated  electrons and holes by transferring one of these charge carriers  or both from the semiconductor-matrix zone to the  semiconductor-heterojunction zone, or vice versa. These  semiconductors should have very high photocatalytic activity and  indeed many have found practical applications as photodiodes,  transistors, solar energy converters, etc. Currently available  data on these heterojunctions refers mainly to dispersed  coprecipitation products (cadmium and silver sulfides, copper  (I) and cadmium, copper (I), cadmium, and zinc). The  photocatalytic activity of these systems in hydrogen evolution  reactions from aqueous sulfide-sulfite solutions is much higher  than for the individual metals, which is attributed to the  presence of microheterojunctions between similar semiconductors  and the coprecipation products. In the present work a study was  made of the preparation and photocatalytic properties of  heterojunctions made from cadmium sulfide and sulfur-containing  heterocomponents formed from copper (I), copper (II), and  bismuth (III) ions. Photocatalytic activity of the prepared  semiconductors materials was studied for the reaction of  molecular hydrogen evolution from alcohol-water suspensions. The  studies demonstrated that the photocatalytic properties of these  materials are largely comparable with the properties of cadmium  sulfide, although there are some differences. All three  materials containing Cu[.sup]+[/], Cu[.sup]2+[/], or  Bi[.sup]3+[/] manifest a photocatalytic activity under light  of the same spectral range as that of non-modified CdS, although  in the case of hydrogen formation, the reaction proceeds at a  considerably faster rate.

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> TRASH POETRY IN ACTION  </P> <P> Lypsinka is one of a kind, a characterization that must have crept into the  mind of her creator, John Epperson, during one too many glazed-out trips to  record store cut-out bins.  </P> <P> Epperson's performance as Lypsinka at the Cafe Largo in Hollywood -- a triumph  in the still mercifully obscure art of combining drag characterization with  lip-syncing -- was bizarre, weird and surprisingly entertaining.  </P> <P> He/she cruised onto the restaurant's tiny stage dressed in an outfit that would  surely have gotten him a role as a cheap nightclub performer in a '40s  detective movie. With his make-up slashed across eyes and lips in bright,  primary colors, his gestures grand and diva-like, his movements constantly  implying nasty sub-texts, Lypsinka was the very image of trash poetry in  action.  </P> <P> But then something very interesting happened. Lypsinka's lip-syncing was  perfect -- never so much as a flawed lip flap -- and within a few minutes the  performance was transformed from an eccentric gimmick into a fascinating  theatrical collage.  </P> <P> Like Andy Warhol, like contemporary rap mix artists, Lypsinka assembles the  detritus of pop art -- in his case, obscure songs from performers like Gisele  Mackenzie, Dolores Gray, Judy Canova and Kay Stevens -- into completely new  mosaics. His work both derives from, and comments upon, the vast, rusting pile  of entertainment trivia that is the heritage of the last five decades.  </P> <P> And it is effective, both as commentary and as sheer humor. Two "phone scenes,"  in which Lypsinka answered one illusionary phone call after another, only to  "hear," via his lip-sync, bits and pieces of dialogue ranging from Joan  Crawford and Bette Davis to Patty Duke and Caterina Valente, fascinated  precisely because so many of the lines were familiar, highly atmospheric trivia  icons.  </P> <P> "Lypsinka," Cafe Largo, 432 N. Fairfax Ave., Hollywood, Thursdays-Fridays, 9  p.m. Ends Dec. 28. Special performance Dec. 27, 10:30 p.m. for Act-Up LA. $6;  (213) 852-1851. Running time: 90 minutes.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Czech President Vaclav Havel by Vaclav </F> Pavrovsky at Lany presidential residence; date not given; from  the "Conversations at Lany" program--live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Pavrovsky] The most important  event at the present time is undoubtedly President Clinton's  visit to Prague. It seems that its focal point lies in the  preparation for the incorporation into NATO of the Czech  Republic, and also of other postcommunist states. After all,  this is confirmed by the visit of Madeleine Albright and General  John Shalikashvili. They are coming with the "Partnership for  Peace" plan. Or am I mistaken? Are there other important matters  related to this visit?    [Havel] I consider it a privilege for our republic that  President Clinton will stop here during his important European  tour and that it is here that he will be meeting representatives  of neighboring countries. I myself consider this to be an  expression of respect for the successes of the Czech Republic,  an expression of recognition of the traditionally good  U.S.-Czech relations.    The main, although certainly not the only, subject of our  talks will probably be our position in the newly shaping  European order, which will relate not only to security.    President Clinton will arrive from Brussels, where the NATO  summit is taking place, and he will probably interpret the  "Partnership for Peace" plan to us. We will expound our attitude  toward it.    At the same time, however, there are more things at stake  here. What this is really about is where we belong and what  values of civilization we acknowledge. I am sure that there will  be an opportunity to raise this because I know that President  Clinton is a man capable of listening to others. I myself was  surprised when I visited him in Washington to find how little he  talked himself and how much he asked. He is a man who is curious  about the other person's opinion, who is open to knowledge, who  wants to be informed, and I think these are also the  prerequisites for our being able to express our views.    [Pavrovsky] Mr. President, you have undoubtedly very good  memories of President Bush, President Clinton's predecessor. If  you were to recall all this and if you were to comment on the  differences between these two administrations or in U.S. policy,  what would you say? It is in effect a change of party in the  U.S. Government.    [Havel] [passage omitted] My personal relationship with  President Bush was excellent, and my cooperation with the  Republican administration was good. We certainly have not  forgotten what the previous administration did to boost our good  relations. It was at the time when we got rid of communism, and  the United States treated us in a very accommodating manner.    The situation has changed, however. There is a new  administration, and we shall naturally be seeking good relations  with this administration. In the spiritual ethos of a Democratic  administration, there is something that is close to my heart. I  mentioned this on more than one occasion in our previous  conversations. I hope that this will have a favorable impact on  the serious political negotiations we shall have.    [Pavrovsky] Slovakia and other postcommunist countries  think that they should enter NATO or make joint moves leading to  their entering NATO. Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said on  behalf of the Czech Republic that this should happen on an  individual basis.    [Havel] Czech policy lays correct emphasis on the fact that  we are independent countries that have to act on their own and  that have to follow their own interests. We cannot forever be  tarred with the same brush of being postcommunist countries, or  former Warsaw Pact members, and so on and so forth.    However, that does not at all mean that we should not  maintain the best possible relations with our immediate  neighbors. I believe we will have an opportunity to emphasize on  behalf of the Czech Republic that our position does not at all  mean that we do not want to cooperate on all levels where it is  advantageous for all the participants, or that we wish to  elevate ourselves above others. We shall be able to emphasize  that we are independent states. The world will have to get used  to this fact and will have to shed the tendency to tar certain  countries with the same brush and make life easier by  inadvertently pushing them into forming a bloc because it is  quicker to negotiate with a bloc than separately with each of  the countries.    [Pavrovsky] Attempts by postcommunist countries to join NATO  are very strongly opposed by the Russian leadership. Mr.  President, what do you think about Mr. Zhirinovskiy's actions  and behavior?    [Havel] To be honest, I am not very much interested in Mr.  Zhirinovskiy's rather wild pronouncements. What I am interested  in is to what extent he voices openly and harshly something that  has lain dormant in the consciousness of Russian society and  whether others do not express such cruel harshness just because  it is inappropriate to do so. That is a matter that would be  worth exploring, rather than exploring Mr. Zhirinovskiy as a  phenomenon. [passage omitted]    [Pavrovsky] Mrs. Rita Klimova, the first envoy of our state  to the United States, has died. I know you were friends.    [Havel] I ought to say that her death was quite painful for  me. I held her in high esteem as a very frank, courageous, and  wise woman. She was a splendid ambassador of our country to the  United States and did a great deal for our republic. [passage  omitted]</p>

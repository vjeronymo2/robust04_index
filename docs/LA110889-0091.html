			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> BREEDERS' CUP TELECASTS: SIX MISSES, ONE HIT  </P> <P> The NBC telecast of the Breeders' Cup jamboree of championship horse races last  Saturday recalls this classic line about the erection of faulty Candlestick  Park: "Don't blame the architect. It was his first ballpark."  </P> <P> NBC has been telecasting the Breeders' Cup since its inception six years ago,  but this year it was as if it were doing it for the first time because new  production head Terry O'Neill rearranged his production lineup so that John  Gonzalez shifted from producer to director and Terry Ewert took over as the new  producer.  </P> <P> The result was two telecasts. One was a jumble of unfocused rambling through  the first six races. It was almost as if these races, all worth at least a  million dollars and featuring championship horses, hardly mattered, so eager  were the TV people to keep reminding people about the finale between Easy Goer  and Sunday Silence.  </P> <P> The second telecast was outstanding. NBC captured the drama of the Classic race  -- before, during and after -- with good pictures and solid reportage.  </P> <P> There was little uniformity to the telecast during the early races. In some  races, we saw morning-line odds, in some we didn't. Too often they gave us the  Evelyn Woods School of Speed Reading, with the odds on and off screen in a  jiffy. Lacking Harvey Pack, there was a sense of betting smarts missing.  </P> <P> There were too many voices, no real focus. Frequent hesitations by host Dick  Enberg seemed to reflect confusion in the production truck, and we occasionally  heard instructions from the truck on the air. Synchronization between  commentary and taped action was spotty. Reporter Trevor Denman was all too  effusive most of the time.  </P> <P> Exultant winning jockey Angel Cordero lit up the screen dismounting after the  first race, but we never heard from him. Reporters Jenny Ornsteen and Sharon  Smith frequently interviewed people of no particular news value -- losing  jockeys and trainers -- only because they were available.  </P> <P> There were few sustained replays of any of the races before the Classic. Tom  Hammond did an excellent analysis of the Classic in a replay, but they showed  only snatches of reruns in the other races. With 4 1/2 hours of air time, the  reruns rated more air time.  </P> <P> Oddly, jockey Gregg McCarron, not the most articulate or commanding presence,  wound up with the most significant role in pre-race analysis. Hammond's  questioning astutely set up McCarron, who was astride a pony in the post  parades, yet Hammond might well have provided keener answers than McCarron  under a different scenario.  </P> <P> Easy Goer and Sunday Silence, of course, were the star attractions who merited  the most attention, but NBC went to ridiculous lengths in its star fawning. In  the midst of early races, they would break in for shots of the marquee aces.  They inserted taped shots of the respective jockeys, Pat Day and Chris  McCarron, leaving their hotels in the morning -- heart-stopping pictures,  those. They even shifted to a look at Sunday Silence while the horses were  preparing to go into the gate in the Turf race.  </P> <P> They were so obsessed with the Classic, I'm surprised they didn't run a ribbon  across the screen with proclamations such as "an hour and 27 minutes until Easy  Goer vs. Sunday Silence," etc.  </P> <P> On the plus side were some good features: close-up shots of Zilzal's sweating  flanks, good synchronization of Gonzalez' race pictures with Tom Durkin's  exciting calls and sharp NBC freeze-frame pictures of close finishes. Nix on an  inane feature on Shug McGaughey's exercising.  </P> <P> When they zeroed in on the Classic, they were all over the event, building up  tension with tight close-ups of the principals, equine and human; good  scene-setting with odds talk by Enberg and Hammond, and good on-the-spot  reportage. After trainer Jack Van Berg's worried remarks about the rained-on  track being a possible hindrance to Easy Goer, Denman chipped in with  significant assurance from McGaughey that it shouldn't bother his horse.  </P> <P> The Classic race was thrilling, Durkin's call memorable, the post-race  conversations with jocks McCarron and Day on the money. NBC faulted again at  the finish, though, by going off the air in puzzling fashion: running tapes and  pulsating calls by Durkin -- not of this stirring Classic, but of Breeders' Cup  races of previous years.  </P></p>

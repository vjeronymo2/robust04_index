			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FLORES MAKES FINAL BID TO GO AHEAD WITH  RUNOFF  </P> <P> As a federal judge Thursday considered a new political map for Los Angeles  County, Sarah Flores made a final appeal to preserve her campaign to become the  first Latino supervisor.  </P> <P> A day after he rejected a redistricting plan drawn by the board's conservative  majority, U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon heard testimony from architects  of the three maps submitted by plaintiffs in the voting rights case.  </P> <P> The judge said he will hold his final hearing in the 2-year-old case today,  taking arguments on whether he should call off a November runoff between Flores  and Gregory O'Brien and order a new election in a redrawn 1st District.  </P> <P> Flores, the top vote-getter in the June primary with 35% of the vote, made an  appeal to Kenyon to reject all three plaintiffs' maps.  </P></p>

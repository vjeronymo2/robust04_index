			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 25 (A.A.) -- Deputy Foreign Minister  Ozdem Sanberk said Monday [25 April] that Turkey always  supported the idea of overcoming confidence crisis between two  communities on Cyprus.    Sanberk speaking before meeting with UN special envoy for  Cyprus, Joe Clark, and his aides Gustave Feissel and John Paul  Cavanaugh said Turkey always wanted a secure atmosphere to find  a peaceful solution to Cyprus problem.    Recalling that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus  (TRNC)  has accepted the points included to the original confidence  building measures package of July 1993 and Turkey has supported  this, Sanberk said the UN proposed package has been twisted  after talks which began on February 17, 1994.    Clark told the press that the confidence building measures  have reached a point and it would be a pity to stop it during  this process.    Clark said he has met with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias in New York and is due to meet with Turkish officials  in Ankara on Monday and Tuesday.    Clark called for a contribution from everybody.    `We arrived at this point with Turkey's active support and  contributions,' Clark said.    He claimed that the TRNC would lose very important economic  advantages if the process failed to succeed.    He also said the package will benefit both sides and the  partial lifting of the embargo will strengthen the TRNC's  economy by 20 percent.    The confidence building measures package has two points, one  being the opening of the uninhabited Maras [Varosha] section for  Greek settlement under UN supervision, and the other being the  opening of the Lefkose [Nicosia] Airport also under UN direction  and the partial lifting of the embargo imposed on the Turkish  side.    The envoys will leave Turkey early Wednesday morning.</p>

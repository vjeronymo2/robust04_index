			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Arts: Committed to his own vision - William Packer admires the work of Norman Blamey IT IS comforting to think that talent will out, that sooner or later all artists of any true merit will get their due. Such faith is sorely tested in the event. Norman Blamey is now 78 and a Royal Academician of some 20 years' standing and he has shown in every Summer Exhibition of the Royal Academy since 1938. Yet he works slowly, and to meet his full Academician's quota of six major works to show each summer stretches him to the limit. Also there is the apparently narrow range of his subject-matter - the domestic interior and still-life, the portrait and the figure composition - all submitted to a calm, detached, unblinking scrutiny and realised with a scrupulous, even harsh technical precision. In the context of late 20th century modernism, with its contemptuous indifference to long, slow, consistency and technical probity, his commitment to his particular vision might seem, to some eyes, wilfully old-fashioned. It is at once astonishing and no surprise at all, that this small retrospective celebration, organised by the admirably independent-minded Linda Checketts of the the Norfolk Institute at Norwich, should be only the second one-man exhibition he has ever had - the first a similarly modest affair at the Roundhouse in Camden Town in the late 1970s. He is as accomplished and intriguing an artist as any currently at work in this country. He is even as important, for while he represents no movement or tendency of the avant-garde the position he has achieved remains entirely his own, which in itself is significant. For he is an artist, properly educated in the disciplines of the western realist tradition, who has said to himself that they will do for him. To look back consciously, as he has done, to the example of the Flemish masters of the 15th and 16th centuries, and to van Eyck in particular, has made him no less a painter of his own time, no less aware of the formal examples afforded by artists from Degas to Mondrian. It has only set him somewhat apart. The lesson is that the artist may look and learn, but is under no duty to follow. And so Blamey, our one present-day pre-Raphaelite, gives us the clearly articulated pictorial space within which the true appearance of things may be studied and registered, a space held and defined, four-square, by screen or mirror, door-frame, table-cloth or altar-front. In the past, the perspective, which is always meticulously worked out and resolved, has been forced to a degree, consciously flattening the space and elongating the figures within it, to mannered, even decorative effect. In more recent years, that system has eased, giving a more natural and conventional space, though the definition, both of space and form, remains as rigorous as ever. The paint surface is rich, but never indulgent in its application - again every mark, every bloc or element of colour put firmly in its proper place, incised with the sharp, swift edge of the palette knife. As he says of his methods in his teaching of life-drawing, the intention, the hope is to achieve 'intelligent precision rather than emotional swagger.' Blamey's most obviously ambitious paintings are the large ecclesiastical compositions of the celebrants and servers at the altar of St Pancras Old Church, the high anglican church which he has attended all his life. This is difficult material in every sense, in this sceptical age, and no other modern artist has taken it on, and on such a scale. Here there is no visionary or mystical special pleading, but only the simple depiction of the ritual by which belief is communicated, the principal figures impersonal and monumental, yet touching in their evident humanity. Though clearly more personal, the domestic and family compositions are formally no less ambitious, and turn out to be quite as monumental in the result. The artist's family around the harmonium, his wife, head on hand, at the kitchen table, the family again caught in the mirror, the space doubling and redoubling itself away to infinity - in all these works, the figures are held either in significant repose or at the definitive, chosen gesture. The fingers are spread at the keyboard, the hand reaches to turn the page, for once and for all. These are magnificent, truly monumental paintings, and the more poignant for touching upon our common experience. Norman Blamey is a secret we keep too well.

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RENT CONTROL LETTER DRAWS A REBUTTAL  </P> <P> Mr. Keith Lambert (Letters, April 22) seems to have his concepts of democracy  and communism a bit askew.  </P> <P> The majority (i.e. tenants) in Santa Monica voted for the rent control law.  They were free elections, which I consider to be one of the tenets of  democracy. What Mr. Lambert seems to want is oppression by the minority (i.e.  landlords) in Santa Monica, similar to what has taken place in the communist  world.  </P> <P> The majority of the people in Santa Monica voted not only for the Rent Control  Board but for the City Council that in turn carries out the wishes of the  people. Where have you been, Comrade Lambert?  </P> <P> NAN LEWIS  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

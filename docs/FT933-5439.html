			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Receiverships still on 'downward trend' despite August rise THE NUMBER of businesses going into receivership rose for the third successive month in August, but remains well down on the same month a year ago, figures released yesterday by Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, show. There were 252 administration orders and receivership appointments in August, compared with 321 in the same month last year. Mr Christopher Morris, insolvency partner at Touche Ross, said the underlying trend in receiverships was downward. The slight rise last month was 'entirely due to the increased number of multi-company group failures, such as the 14 companies in the Dunkfield Clothing Group, most of which were actually non-trading subsidiaries'. Regionally, the lowest rate of appointments in August was in the south-west, with eight appointments, and Wales with two. Failure rates in the Yorkshire and Humberside region and the north-west were worse than average. The building and construction sector continues to improve with the month's figures showing a 40 per cent fall compared with the same month a year ago. The longer leading index of economic indicators, which highlights turning points in economic activity about 10 months in advance, has flattened in recent months after rising strongly towards the end of last year. In July it was virtually unchanged on the previous month with a rise in share prices broadly offsetting a lower balance on the Confederation of British Industry's survey of business optimism. The coincident index, which moves in line with the business cycle, has maintained steady increases since the spring of 1992, the trough of the recession. The Central Statistical Office said the shorter leading indicator, which highlights turning points four months in advance, has risen since last autumn. In July, falls in new car registrations and lower expectations of stock changes reported in the CBI industrial trends survey broadly offset higher CBI reports of new orders. Gold and currency reserves rose an underlying Dollars 58m (Pounds 39.1m) last month, the Treasury reported yesterday. The dollar value of the existing amount outstanding under the Ecu-denominated revolving credit facility fell by Dollars 55m as a result of changes in exchange rates, the Treasury said. Proceeds from this month's tender of the Ecu Treasury bills amounted to Dollars 1.165bn while maturing bills totalled Dollars 1.276bn. Total reserves at the end of the month were Dollars 43.16bn.</p>

This is the main news following from  Decree No. 131-r of the St. Petersburg Mayor. On 16 February  Anatoliy Sobchak made new changes in and additions to the  Statute of Elections to the City Assembly he had authored.    In the event more than two candidates are on the ballot in  an  electoral district and none is elected (that is, does not get  more than 50 percent of the ballots cast by the voters  participating in the elections), the city electoral commission  must make a decision on holding a runoff election in the  district, placing on the ballot the two candidates who received  the greatest number of votes. The runoff election is held no  later than two weeks after the first round. The candidate who  receives the greater number of ballots cast by the voters  participating in the elections is considered elected.    Elections are considered invalid if the number of valid  ballots is less than 25 percent of the number of eligible  voters, as well as in the event no more than two candidates were  on the ballot in the district and neither was elected.    In addition, Sobchak made an amendment to Point 4 of Article  2 of the statute, bringing it into compliance with the Russian  Constitution. Let us recall that in keeping with this point,  members of the Federal Assembly could not be elected to the  assembly, while the Constitution applies this prohibition only  to State Duma deputies but not to members of the Federation  Council, who carry out their duties on a part-time basis. The  ban on Federation Council members' becoming assembly deputies  was the subject of a complaint by the former city soviet  chairman, Aleksandr Belyayev, which is currently being  considered by the city court.    By making changes in the statute on elections, the mayor  partially took into account the pertinent suggestions of the  electoral coalitions. The two-round election system will allow  to avoid the incidents that occurred in the course of elections  to the Federal Assembly.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Tortuous undoing of apartheid: South Africa's complex constitutional 'summit' 'Fine to warm, with storms brewing' THAT was how Mr Thabo Mbeki, one of the chief constitutional negotiators of the African National Congress, characterised the prospects for success at talks today on the political future of South Africa. When white, black, coloured and Indian South Africans meet today at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the multi-party forum shaping the country's constitutional future, they will be tackling the central questions of post-apartheid politics: how will power be distributed in the new South Africa? Will there be majority rule or power-sharing? By Saturday night, the 19 parties to Codesa may have agreed to form a multi-racial interim executive which would bring blacks to power for the first time in 350 years. Such a government would include the ANC (the largest black group), the ruling National party (which represents most whites and probably a majority of coloureds and Indians), and the powerful Zulu party Inkatha, as well as parties from the nominally independent black 'homelands', the liberal Democratic party and smaller ethnically-based parties. It would remain in office until elections were held for an interim national assembly, probably early next year. But before they can strike a deal on the interim executive, the 200-odd delegates to today's plenary session of Codesa must either resolve the issue of how a new constitution is to be drawn up - or agree to differ on it for the moment. The bottom-line positions of the two main parties - the National party, which continues to demand what would in effect be a white veto in the constitution-making body, and the ANC which wants decisions taken by a two-thirds majority - reveals a big gap which they were yesterday frantically attempting to close. Since last December, five Codesa working groups have met for at least two days weekly to seek agreement on removing obstacles to free political activity, on interim government, on the shape of a constitution-making body, on the future of the homelands, and on implementation. They have spawned sub-committees, technical committees, steering committees and management committees, which have struggled for thousands of hours to reach consensus. Their deliberations, reported in confusing detail in the local press, have alternately baffled and bored ordinary South Africans. And though they can claim to have made progress, only the upcoming plenary will determine whether there is breakdown or breakthrough. On some important issues, consensus has already been achieved. At the first plenary session of Codesa last December, the two sides agreed on a 'declaration of intent' which committed them to a multi- party political system with 'freedom, equality and security for all', an independent judiciary, a bill of rights, separation of powers among the executive, the legislature and the judiciary with appropriate checks and balances, proportional representation, and an end to racial discrimination. The Inkatha Freedom party, which refused to subscribe to the declaration last December, has now said it will sign, after an amendment which raises the possibility of federalism. Since then, the working groups have agreed to restore South African citizenship to the residents of the homelands of Transkei, Ciskei, Venda and Bophuthatswana, and agreed 'in principle' that they should be re-incorporated into the republic (though the wording is vague and the deal fragile). They have agreed on the structure of the interim executive, to be called the Transitional Executive Council (TEC), which would include a representative from each of the 19 Codesa parties and take decisions by an 80 per cent majority. The council would be a sort of 'super cabinet' with powers to compel the existing cabinet (which would remain in office) to comply with its decisions. But its scope would be limited: the council would not run the government, but deal only with levelling the political playing field in the run-up to multi-racial elections, ensuring joint control over the security forces, the state media, the electoral process and some aspects of foreign affairs. The council, which would be appointed by Codesa, could take office within two or three months. But the ANC has said it will block it until agreement is reached on the constitution-making body which would both draw up a new constitution and make ordinary laws during the transition to democracy. That may be within reach today and tomorrow, but only by postponing the most contentious issues - powers of regional government, the supreme authority of central government, joint control of security services - until later. Yesterday the two sides were still fighting over the size of the majority needed in the constitution-making body. The ANC wanted that body to take decisions by a two-thirds majority, while the National party is demanding a 75 per cent majority, which would in effect give it and its allies (whites and other conservatives), a veto over the constitution. Though the percentages appear close, the dispute is substantive: the final figure will determine whether blacks have the power to write what is essentially a majority-rule constitution, or whether whites and other minorities can entrench minority protections. If talks break down, the ANC will probably mount a campaign of mass protest, including a national general strike, which will lead to more civil disruption. The National party, for its part, may not easily buckle under the pressure. But in the end, both parties concede they will return to the negotiating table with the same political problems to solve, the same backlogs of economic development, the same burden of joblessness - and even less time in which to solve them.</p>

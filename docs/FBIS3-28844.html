			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Message by Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of the State </F> Law and Order Restoration Council, on the 47th anniversary of  union day, which was observed at the People's Square in Yangon  [Rangoon] on 12 February -- read by announcer]    [Excerpts] Esteemed national brethren of the union: The  12th of February 1994, the 47th anniversary of union day, is an  auspicious occasion. Forty-seven years ago on this day, leaders  of our national races were able to sign the Panglong agreement,  the national unity and solidarity accord. The Panglong  agreement, the result of national unity, became a source of  strength for the anti-imperialist and national liberation  struggle. [passage omitted]    Even now neocolonialists and their dependents are still  making attempts using various tactics to manipulate and  interfere in our internal affairs and to cause the  disintegration of national unity. In such a situation, our  national brethren must be vigilant in countering the  neocolonialist threat. It is evident to all that the State Law  and Order Restoration Council [SLORC], since the time it assumed  responsibility, has been giving priority to the affairs of the  national races while upholding the three main national causes:  non-disintegration of the union, non-disintegration of national  solidarity, and perpetuation of sovereignty.    In drawing up the new constitution, leading to a new  democratic state, the national convention has also been able to  formulate the basic principles which guarantee the unity and  consolidation of the national races. It is also to be noted  that the basic principles that guarantee the welfare of the  national races are included in the 104 basic principles laid  down by the national convention, which are to be framed in the  new constitution. [passage omitted]    As all the national races know, the SLORC, with a view to  forging a firm, solid national unity, has been extending an  invitation to the armed groups in the jungle. It is the right  time for the armed groups in the jungle to give up their armed  struggle -- which is impeding the development of their own  people --return to the legal fold with dignity, and work  vigorously for the welfare of the union and their own people.  [passage omitted]    I would hereby like to hope that all the national races will  be able to work for the welfare of the union more extensively  from the beginning of this significant and noble occasion of the  47th anniversary of union day, while upholding the four  objectives of the union day: to ensure the perpetuation of the  union, to keep all the national races ever united, to involve  all the national races in striving for the emergence of the  state constitution, and to bring about the national development  and the emergence of a peaceful, prosperous and modern nation.</p>

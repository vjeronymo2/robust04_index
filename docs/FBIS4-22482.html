			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Maryanin: "The Federal </F> Counterintelligence Service Will Defend the Homeland of the  Leader"]    [Text] The territorial organs of counterintelligence do not  mean to copy the structure of the Federal Service, but will have  their own tasks depending on the regional problems.    This was reported in the local press by General Major  Vladimir Shilimov, who was appointed, by edict of the president,  head of the FSK [Federal Counterintelligence Service] department  dealing with Ulyanovsk Oblast. Among the facilities evoking the  sustained interest of the Western special services, he named the  atom reactor scientific research institute in Dimitrovgrad; the  Ulyanovsk engineering plant, where antiaircraft and missile  complexes superior to the best foreign analogues are produced;  the joint-stock company Aviastar, with its Ruslans and Tu-204's;  and also the 104th airborne division, which was redeployed in  Ulyanovsk last year and which is subject to NATO inspection. The  Ulyanovsk security officers are also concerned about the  appearance at several classified military units of Western  religious preachers.    The head of local counterintelligence cited interesting  facts  from the life of the department. For example, last year several  Western firms undertook an attempt to compromise the Ruslan  airplane on the international market, but these efforts were  thwarted by the Ulyanovsk security officers. And the imeni  Volodarskiy machine-building plant intended to deliver to  Armenia a line for the production of live cartridges. This  illegal deal was also averted by local counterintelligence  officers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Double Standards"] </F>   [Text] While the United States brings pressure to bear on  the PLO to resume the peace negotiations in the wake of the  Hebron massacre, it threatens to use its veto to obstruct any  effective UN Security Council resolution that will protect the  Palestinian people from the occupation and the terrorism of the  Israeli Army and settlers.    This contradictory stand once again shows the U.S.  double-standard in its approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict.  The results of the official investigation clearly point to the  direct or indirect involvement of the Israeli Army, if not the  government and its prime minister, in this act of killing and  terrorism. Thus, the talk about peace and the resumption of the  peace process in accordance with the previous bases is just an  attempt to mark time and to cushion the great shock brought  about by the massacre of the worshipers in the blessed  al-Ibrahimi Mosque on the Palestinian, Arab, Islamic, and  international levels.    By procrastinating and obstructing the passage of a UN  resolution condemning the massacre and adopting a mechanism to  prevent its recurrence, the United States has exposed its  desperate attempt to waste time and cover up for the crime and  its perpetrators. It is an attempt by the United States to  shirk its responsibility toward what happened. Its shy stands  on settlements and settlers, and the question of supplying them  with money and weapons are well known. It is not strange that  the principal perpetrator of the crime is a U.S. citizen who was  brought up in Brooklyn and was nurtured on terrorism and racism  there like many other Jewish terrorists.    It goes without saying that the stand adopted by Russia,  which is the second cosponsor of the peace conference, and the  efforts it has exerted, irrespective of their motives and  objectives, deserve praise. The same applies to the European  stand, which deserves to be emulated by Washington in an effort  by the international community and international legitimacy to  restore Palestinian rights and land to their legitimate owners  and end the injustice, trials, and terrorism from which the  Palestinian people have been suffering for so long.</p>

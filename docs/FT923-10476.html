			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / US policy on Haitians 'illegal' A US federal judge last night ordered the Bush administration to end its policy of sending Haitian boat people back home, Jurek Martin writes from Washington. The order came after a federal appeals court, the second highest level in the judicial system, ruled illegal a presidential order telling the Coast Guard to return Haitians intercepted at sea and warning would-be refugees asylum requests would only be processed at the US embassy in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. 'The plain language of the Immigration and Nationality Act clearly states that the US may not return aliens to their persecutors no matter where in the world those actions are taken,' the court said. Mr Bush's directive was justified on the grounds that US facilities at its Guantanamo naval base in Cuba were being swamped by a tide of Haitian refugees.</p>

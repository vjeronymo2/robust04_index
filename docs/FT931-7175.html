			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo eases despite stable currency market A STABLE currency market and reports that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party was drawing up a new fiscal stimulus package brightened sentiment, but share prices lost ground on liquidation of margin positions ahead of settlements in March, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 64.21 to 16,798.94 on small-lot trading, having moved between 16,930.27 in early trading and 16,750.88 in the afternoon. Volume remained subdued at 220m shares against 211m. Margin traders and investment trusts were seen selling in small lots while some foreign investors bought companies which had announced restructuring measures.

Most large-lot investors remained on the sidelines ahead of this weekend's Group of Seven meeting in spite of a fall in speculative activity on the currency market. Aids-related stocks, bought actively on six-month-long margin contracts during September, lost ground as investors liquidated margin positions ahead of settlement in March. Green Cross fell Y40 to Y1,170 and Okamoto Industries, the condom maker, lost Y19 to Y981. Showa Shell Sekiyu fell by its daily limit for the third consecutive day, diving Y200 to Y800 on concerns over its foreign exchange loss. Some food companies, dependent on imports, gained on hopes of larger profits due to the higher yen. Nisshin Flour Milling advanced Y20 to Y1,130 while Nitto Flour gained Y5 to Y425. However, electric utilities, previously higher on hopes of improved earnings due to the yen's strength, lost ground on profit taking. Tokyo Electric Power declined by Y20 to Y2,570.

Fujikura gained Y15 to Y518 and Hitachi Cable added Y10 to Y620. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y1,000 to Y612,000 on profit taking, while Nissan Motor lost Y1 to Y621.

Goldman Sachs, in a recent research paper, comments that while the city-state stands to benefit from accelerating regional growth in the next few years, it has to meet a number of challenges. Among them, Goldman writes, is 'further adapting industrial policy to a high-tech and service orientation, coping with a rising exchange rate and increasing returns on capital to sustain high investment rates'.

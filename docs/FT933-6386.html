			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Philip Morris in talks on disposal of ice cream unit PHILIP MORRIS, the US food, cigarette and drinks group, is considering the sale of Breyers, America's top-selling ice cream brand. General Foods USA, part of Philip Morris's Kraft General Foods unit and the country's largest producer of ice cream, yesterday said it had entered talks with 'a limited number of qualified buyers' on the possible disposal of its frozen dessert business, which brought in nearly Dollars 500m in sales last year. General Foods, which also markets Sealtest, Light N' Lively and Knudsen frozen desserts, is the country's largest producer of ice cream. The company said it had not initiated the talks but had been approached by an interested buyer. 'The nature of the offer' warranted further exploration, a spokesperson added. It declined to disclose the names of the interested parties or the number of companies involved in the talks. General Foods said a sale would not involve its cultured or frozen topping products, including those marketed under the Sealtest and Light N' Lively labels.</p>

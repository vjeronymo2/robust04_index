			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / The Italian Election: The new political geography form left to right ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Chamber of Deputies (lower house): 630 seats. 48.3m voters (18 years or older). Voter has two votes, one for individual candidates and one for party lists. 475 seats in single-seat, plurality contests grouped into 26 constituencies. Voters vote for individual candidates. 155 seats allocated by a form of proportional representation (PR). Voters vote for party lists. Senate: 315 seats. 42.7m (25 years or older). Voter has one vote, castable for a candidate (either linked to a party list or an independent) in a single-member seat. 232 single-seat, simple-plurality contests, grouped into 20 constituencies. 18 regions have additional seats (83 nationwide) allocated by a form of PR.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PROGRESSIVE ALLIANCE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Leader: Achille Occhetto Dominant in the alliance, with highly effective infrastructure. Heir to Communist Party, now espousing social democracy and hoping to demonstrate Italy is mature enough to have its first post-war government of the left. Ably led by the first political leader to see the importance of alliances under new electoral laws.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Reconstructed Communists Leader: Fausto Bertinotti Rump of former Communist Party that refused to foreswear Marxism and join PDS; leader is former head of a hardline faction within the main trades union federation. Core of support is in industrial areas. Party at loggerheads with PDS on tax policy (raise taxes on government bonds) and foreign policy (withdraw Italy from Nato).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Democratic Alliance Leading figure: Giuseppe Ayala Conceived as umbrella of centre-left to attract politicians across traditional party lines when old political system faced collapse. Main figures are Republican Party, like former anti-mafia judge Ayala, plus a few Christian Democrats and from PDS. But it has not found way to avoid being swallowed by PDS.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- La Rete Leader: Leoluca Orlando Sicily-based clean government movement. Leader is former Christian Democrat mayor of Palermo who was triumphantly re-elected on Rete ticket last December. The movement, left-wing Catholic in inspiration with isolated pockets of strong support nationwide, will sweep western Sicily.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Greens Leading figure: Carlo Ripa di Meana Despite constant internal scraps, the Greens have broadened their appeal with a semi-collegiate leadership and the distant stewardship of Ripa di Meana, a former EU commissioner. Important in attracting young voters plus support in areas with major environmental concerns.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PACT FOR ITALY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Popular Party (PPI) Leader: Mino Martinazzoli Formed from the mainstream of the dissolved Christian Democrat Party. Under its leader, the former Christian Democrat head, it seeks to be the Catholic party of the centre, but appeal has been weakened by corruption scandals and the lack of known new figures to promote.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Segni Pact Leader: Mario Segni Movement gathered round referendum leader Segni but has sufferedfrom his oscillations. Having left the Christian Democrats and refused to deal with either the PDS or Forza Italia, he is now effectively back as the leader of the old/renewed Christian Democrats as the balancing force in the centre.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ALLIANCE FOR FREEDOM  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Forza Italia Leader: Silvio Berlusconi Movement created in less than four months by media magnate Berlusconi, using the resources of his Fininvest empire. He defines movement as 'liberal', endorsing free-market policies. But success has been based on leader's self-made-man image and the novelty of Forza Italia.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Northern League Leader: Umberto Bossi Populist movement in northern Italy that gathered round Bossi's charisma and pugnacious oratory. Movement has since graduated from a protest force to a genuine party with federalist demands. Remains rooted in the north and has been forced by the electoral system to seek uncomfortable allies like Forza Italia and National Alliance.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- National Alliance/MSI Leader: Gianfranco Fini The neo-fascist MSI rebaptised as the National Alliance. Fini, the most astute young politician in the country, has sought to shake-off the party's long-standing identification with the Mussolini era. The party, which has benefitted from the collapse of the traditional ruling parties, is strongest in the south.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

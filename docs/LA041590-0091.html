			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE  </P> <P> Death in the mornin', death in the evenin', death at supper time. . . .  </P> <P> Since viewing her recent TV ads I've sure got to agree with your columnists  that Dianne Feinstein is the "zippiest" candidate running for governor of the  great state of California.  </P> <P> Her commercials began by making hay from the tragic murders in San Francisco,  and then moved to those two issues no upwardly-clawing politician can resist --  abortion on demand and capital punishment. What the great state of California  needs to cope with a lot of complex problems is a no-nonsense solidly pro-death  candidate.  </P> <P> Who says a woman can't be more like a man?  </P> <P> WILLIAM J. KEACH  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

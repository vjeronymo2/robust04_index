Seoul-Ottawa trade cooperation anticipates South Korea's  participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA), said Korean officials who are accompanying Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu on a visit to Canada.    Han held talks with his Canadian counterpart Andre Ouellet  here Monday afternoon at which the Korean foreign minister  expressed his country's desire to form a special relationship  with NAFTA members.    Ouellet promised Han that Canada will actively study the  South Korean proposal, according to the Korean officials.    Han briefed Ouellet on the positions of South Korea and the  United States on the North Korean nuclear problem and asked for  Canada's continuing support for resolution of the issue, they  said.    Prior to visiting Ottawa, Han held talks with U.S.  Government  leaders on the North Korean problem in Washington.    Han and Ouellet shared the opinion that their countries,  both  surrounded by economically powerful neighbors, can work together  and complement each other. They agreed to foster conditions for  partnership in all fields, the officials said.    Han later met with Minister for International Trade Roy  Maclaren and discussed trade promotion and economic cooperation.  "They have agreed to form a partnership in political, economic,  trade and other fields," the officials said.    The special relationship calls for an increase in trade,  cooperation in regional and global issues, and efforts to  achieve peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region and the  world.    With regard to the North Korean nuclear issue, Ouellet said  it is obvious the world does not want to see any country  withdraw from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT).    He said Canada supports South Korean and U.S. efforts to  resolve the issue through dialogue.</p>

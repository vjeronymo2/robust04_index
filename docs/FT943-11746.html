			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: High-tech groups report gains GM Hughes Electronics and Allied-Signal, two US high-technology groups, posted higher second-quarter earnings yesterday as growing automotive and commercial aerospace revenues offset a decline in sales of defence-related products. GMHE, a subsidiary of General Motors, reported a 15 per cent gain in second-quarter profits to Dollars 267.3m, or Dollars 67 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 3.5bn, up from Dollars 3.3bn a year earlier. First-half profits totalled Dollars 579.8m, against Dollars 421.3m in 1993. It said productivity improvements and continued growth in its non-defence businesses were behind the gains. Revenues from GMHE's automotive electronics division rose 24.3 per cent to Dollars 1.43bn thanks to increased production of GM vehicles, which GMHE supplies with electronic products, and stronger international and non-GM sales. The company's telecommunications and space operations saw revenues climb 24.6 per cent to Dollars 548.9m, mainly due to work on government-related satellite manufacturing programmes and a contract to supply communications equipment to BellSouth Cellular. GMHE's defence electronics division reported a 10.5 per cent decline in revenues to Dollars 1.38bn, while its commercial technologies unit also saw revenues fall, from Dollars 168m a year ago to Dollars 163.1m. Allied-Signal reported second-quarter profits of Dollars 196m, or 69 cents a share, up from Dollars 167m, or 59 cents, a year ago and a record for the New Jersey-based company. The strong second quarter took first-half earnings to a record Dollars 365m, up from Dollars 313m in 1993. During the quarter, its sales rose 4 per cent to Dollars 3.2bn. The company's engineered materials division led the way, reporting sales of Dollars 88m, up from Dollars 73m a year ago. The performance of its automotive division was also impressive. It reported a 32 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 62m on record sales of Dollars 1.25bn. Allied-Signal's aerospace division posted higher net income, with profits from the unit rising 17 per cent to Dollars 61m as productivity gains helped offset lower military spending, which kept sales flat.</p>

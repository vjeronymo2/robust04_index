			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: The incredible cost of corkage Sir, While in London recently I read an article entitled 'Bring your own drink' (July 10/11) by Nicholas Lander. I was somewhat surprised to see that Mr Lander's suggested corkage - if bringing your drink were introduced in British restaurants - would be a maximum of Pounds 5 for wine and Pounds 10 for champagne. In the City of Perth, I checked around and over half of our restaurants make no charge at all, or if they do charge it is either 50 cents or ADollars 1.00 a head. I wish British drinkers great success in dining out but they should never pay a corkage of more than 50p a head. R G Withers, Lord Mayor, City of Perth, 27-29 St George's Terrace, Perth, Western Australia 6000</p>

This model helicopter is a 10 passenger, 2 engine, 8,250 pound (Category B) or 7,850 pound (Category A) transport category helicopter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Type Certification Basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The certification basis established for the BHTI Model 22U helicopter includes: 14 CFR 21.29 and part 29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) effective February 1, 1965 (Transport Categories A and B), Amendments 29&hyph;1 through 29&hyph;9; Amendment 29&hyph;11; &sect;29.997 of Amendment 29&hyph;10; &sect;29.927(b)(2) of Amendment 29&hyph;17; &sect;&sect;29.801, 29.25(c) 29.865, 29.1557(c), and 29.1555(c) of Amendment 29.12; &sect;&sect;29.1, 29.79, 29.1517, and 29.1587 of Amendment 29&hyph;21; Criteria for Helicopter Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) certification dated December 15, 1978; Exemption No. 2789, &sect;29.811(h)(1) (following Amendment 24, effective December 6, 1984, &sect;29.811(h)(1) became &sect;29.811(f)(2)); and Exemption No. 4395, &sect;29.855(a) and portions of &sect;29.855(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the Administration finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for these helicopters because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.101(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The BHTI Model 222U helicopter, at the time of the application for modification by Heli-Dyne Systems, Inc., was identified as incorporating one and possibly more electrical, electronic, or combination of electrical and electronic (electrical/electronic) systems that will perform functions critical to the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopters. The electronic flight instrument system performs the attitude display function. The display of attitude, altitude, and airspeed is critical to the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopters for IFR operations in instrument meteorological conditions. After the design is finalized, Heli-Dyne Systems, Inc., will provide the FAA with a preliminary hazard that will identify any other critical functions performed by the electrical/electronic systems that are critical to the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recent advances in technology have prompted the design of aircraft that include advanced electrical and electronic systems that perform functions required for continued safe flight and landing. However, these advanced systems respond to the transient effects of induced electrical current and voltage caused by the high intensity radiated fields (HIRF) incident on the external surface of the helicopters. These induced transient currents and voltages can degrade the performance of the electrical/electronic systems by damaging the components or by upsetting the systems' functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the electromagnetic environment has undergone a transformation not envisioned by the current application of &sect;29.1309(a). Higher energy levels radiate from operational transmitters currently used for radar, radio, and television; the number of transmitters has increased significantly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing aircraft certification requirements are inappropriate in view of these technological advances. In addition, the FAA has received reports of some significant safety incidents and accidents involving military aircraft equipped with advanced electrical/electronic systems when they were exposed to electromagnetic radiation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The combined effects of technological advances in helicopter design and the changing environment have resulted in an increased level of vulnerability of the electrical and electronic systems required for the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopters. Effective measures to protect these helicopters against the adverse effects of exposure of HIRF will be provided by the design and installation of these systems. The following primary factors contributed to the current conditions: (1) Increased use of sensitive electronics that perform critical functions, (2) reduced electromagnetic shielding afforded helicopter systems by advanced technology airframe materials, (3) adverse service experience of military aircraft using these technologies, and (4) an increase in the number and power of radio frequency emitters and the expected increase in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Management: No such thing as a free opera ticket At the weekend they were hobnobbing among the sheep at Glyndebourne. Last Monday night they were hard at it among the begonias at Chelsea. The season is upon us when business executives and their contacts get together in style. Far from disapproving of all this junketing, I love it. On the - regrettably few - occasions that I have been on the receiving end of corporate hospitality, I have had a splendid time. Two weeks ago my husband and I were taken to Covent Garden by BP. We had good seats and nice champagne and smoked salmon. It was all most pleasant. What puzzles me about this hectic entertaining is why companies do it. Why did Enterprise Oil invite 200 people and their spouses to a private snoop round Chelsea on Monday, followed by a lavish meal? Why do 300-odd companies pay up to Pounds 20,000 a year to take a few guests to Glyndebourne? Surely in this age of sleek and professional management, no one takes decisions based on Wimbledon tickets or a box at Ascot. Could it be that the season has become an institutionalised perk for senior directors? When you ask most companies about their entertaining they will not talk numbers; in fact they will barely talk at all. Off the record they will mouth platitudes about building relationships, and point out that the money from some of these events goes to charity. Not all companies are so coy. Michael Prideaux, of BAT Industries, provides the most sensible solution to the puzzle. He says corporate entertaining works subtly at the margin. There is nothing you can do to persuade an institutional investor to go on holding your shares. But if you have just treated them to a nice day out, they may be more willing to hear your side of the story before flogging them. I expect he is right. The system works because we are all human. Perhaps I should think twice before saying anything untoward about BP. When a woman in a position of power starts making unpopular dec-isions the chances are that someone will unfairly accuse her of sleeping her way to the top. Such was the sad fate that last week befell the intelligent and likeable Clare Spottiswoode, director general of Ofgas. The less said about that incident - or non incident - the better. Yet I wonder if the sordid story might contain a warning to the business world. The tabloid press is endlessly fascinated by who is sleeping with whom, and being fed up with the affairs of MPs it may be shifting its attention towards commerce. Spottiswoode - who spans the two worlds - could be a first step. If businessmen in the past have escaped attention it is not because they are considered out of bounds - witness Ralph Halpern and his bimbo - but because they are not well enough known. Now that many of our captains of industry are becoming increasingly famous (as well as increasingly rich) all the ingredients for a nice tabloid sex scandal are there. I put it to the editor of the Sun, who said he couldn't possibly comment. Perhaps that means he'd love to break a few such stories, but is having a bit of trouble coming up with any. While the private lives of executives is a subject for the prurient only, the same can not be said about their pay. The bad publicity any director can expect over an immodest rise is doing more to moderate pay rises than any number of (dubiously independent) committees. Yet not all those who receive a public flogging deserve it. Take last week's revelation that Alan Jackson, chief executive of BTR, has a guaranteed floor under his basic salary. I can't see anything wrong with that - most of us assume our base pay will not fall. Of course, bosses' total pay should go up and down with performance: but the basic salary should be small and fixed and the bonus generous when the company is doing well; non existent when it is not. LIkewise, I can't get too excited about the revelation at Lasmo's AGM last week that its part-time ex-chairman and deputy chairman were entitled to a pro-rata payment of Pounds 700 a day if they worked more than a certain number of days a year. As a part-time worker, I think it is fair to be paid extra for extra work. I am less sure about whether those gentlemen deserved such high salaries to start with. There is something deeply revealing about the way in which people lose, especially those who are used to winning. Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless, and Richard Branson of Virgin evidently thought that they were on to a winner late last year when they smilingly posed with the racehorse Desert Orchid to launch their bid for the national lottery. Now that they have lost we are seeing another side of their personalities. Branson is taking it like a spoilt child, having his picture taken sulking on the steps of his Holland Park home, and ripping up the fax that bore the news. Lord Young, in line with his smooth image, has delicately withdrawn into the background as if nothing had happened. Full marks, then, to their lobbyist, Des Wilson. According to the inveterate campaigner, who treats every day as a personal victory, the Branson-Young bid should not be seen as a failure at all. Their intervention resulted in other contenders promising to pay more money to charity. And that was the whole point, right?</p>

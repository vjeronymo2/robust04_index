			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kiro Gligorov, president of The Former </F> Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, by Yeoryios Kharvalias at  the presidential villa in Skopje on 1 March 1994]    [Excerpts] [Kharvalias] Mr. President, what did you  discuss with the German alternate foreign minister [title as  published]?    [Gligorov] We discussed the more general problems of the  Balkans and above all our confrontation with Greece! The  problems caused us by the Greek trade blockade. I must note  with satisfaction that the German Government was absolutely  categorical about the illegal nature of these measures and the  dangers they pose for stability in the region. At this point, I  would like to thank German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel for the  relevant remarks that he recently made in Athens...    [Kharvalias] Have you gotten any specific commitments of  political or economic support from the German side?    [Gligorov] First of all, we noted our mutual desire to  strengthen bilateral relations, particularly economic and trade  relations, as well as technical aid. However, we did not  discuss any specific plan for economic support by Bonn. We  pointed out once again the stated desire by the German side to  help the "Republic of Macedonia." [passage omitted]    [Kharvalias] However, it appeared last spring that Greece  and  Skopje, with the exception of the name, had reached a  significant rapprochement--a compromise on the emblems, the  flag, and so forth. What has happened since then?    [Gligorov] After the adoption of the relevant Security  Council resolution, which was a particularly positive  development, there were exceptionally useful discussions at the  United Nations under the auspices of Cyrus Vance and David Owen.  I believe that substantive progress was made at those talks,  there was a substantive rapprochement between the two sides.    But after that, the elections were held in Greece, the  negotiations stopped and later, instead of resuming them as  would be natural, the new Greek Government announced their  suspension! Moreover, it set the three well-known conditions!    I believe this is not a creative approach for two  neighboring  countries such as Greece and "Macedonia," which are not facing  very serious problems. Instead of understanding, we have a  unilateral embargo without a Security Council decision having  been made in advance as was the case with Serbia.    I must stress that we have not resorted to any  countermeasure  and so far people and goods from Greece enter our territory  without any restrictions.    [Kharvalias] But Greece is the only country that guarantees  your territorial integrity. What are you doing as a goodwill  gesture?    [Gligorov] But we have made goodwill gestures! We have  amended our Constitution with a clause that says that we do not  have territorial claims against any of our neighbors and,  moreover, we added the provision that we will never interfere in  the internal affairs of neighboring countries.    In addition, even in my recent letter to Greek Prime  Minister  Andreas Papandreou I stated that we are prepared to sign a  treaty with Greece on the inviolability of borders which, if  necessary, could be guaranteed by the European Union and/or the  United Nations!    I remind you that during the former embargo by the  Konstandinos Mitsotakis administration we did not resort to  countermeasures. We do not have the slightest intention to take  reprisals against neighboring Greece. We merely view the whole  situation with regret because we seek friendly relations with  Greece and the Greek people. [passage omitted]    [Kharvalias] By any chance did Alternate German Foreign  Minister Helmut Schaefer urge you to make another goodwill  gesture toward the Greek side?    [Gligorov] We were not given such advice or recommendation.  I believe that most of the European Union ministers realize  that we have already made many concessions. The dialogue will  have to begin at some time.    [Kharvalias] When was your latest contact with a Greek  politician?    [Gligorov] I am very sorry because I have never had any  contacts with Greek politicians, although at the first moment of  the crisis I sent a letter to Athens for a meeting with then  Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis. I have never received  any answer. [passage omitted]</p>

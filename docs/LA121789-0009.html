			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: BASINGER'S MOVES  </P> <P> Watch for actress Kim Basinger to branch into singing . . . appear in European  commercials . . . and star in a film opposite pop star Prince. Those are some  new career wrinkles, industry sources tell us, after her recent decision to  leave agent Rick Nicita at CAA and attorney Barry Hirsch.  </P> <P> Basinger's defection set off a scramble among CAA's competitors for her  business. But for now, insiders report, the $2 million-a-picture actress is  relying heavily on guidance from Prince, with whom she's been romantically  linked. (Prince, recall, covered some songs from "Batman," in which Basinger  co-starred.)  </P> <P> Basinger also is getting career advice from her new attorney, Gary Stiffelman,  at Ziffren, Brittenham &amp; Branca -- Stiffelman also happens to represent  Prince. The firm, which handles a range of rock stars, is well-positioned to  steer Basinger into a recording debut.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Basinger is out of a project at Fox, "Sleeping With the Enemy," that  was set to begin filming in February. The actress, sources say, was unhappy  with the latest version of the script for the Joseph Ruben-directed thriller,  and was concerned about committing to a project without knowing who her male  co-star would be.

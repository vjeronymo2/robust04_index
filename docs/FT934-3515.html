			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Wheelock posts 61% interim profit rise Wheelock and Co, the Hong Kong holding company for the late Sir Yue-kong Pao's listed empire, reported a 61.1 per cent rise in profits after tax and minority interests to HKDollars 940.3m (USDollars 121.7m) from HKDollars 583.7m for the six months to September 30. Wheelock, formerly World International, has interests ranging from trams to property to cable TV. Wharf Holdings, a diversified conglomerate and the company's main subsidiary, contributed some 70 per cent of profits. Analysts said much of the growth in earnings was made from treasury operations. Income from this source rose by around 40 to 45 per cent; brokers reckoned underlying profits growth was closer to 30 per cent. Mr Woo said the group would pursue its strategy of buying stakes in companies manufacturing in both Hong Kong and China, which sell to western industrialised countries but which may have potential markets in China. Earnings per share over the six months rose to 46.1 cents, compared with 28.5 cents last year. The dividend rose to 9.5 cents a share, up from 7.5 cents last year.</p>

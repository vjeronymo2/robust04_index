			<p>BFN     [Text] Los Angeles, May 23 (YONHAP) -- Chairman Kim  Tae-chung of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation has called for a  national referendum on the government's commonwealth plan as the  first step toward national reunification.    Speaking at a luncheon sponsored by the University of  Southern California in a hotel here Monday, the former South  Korean opposition leader said the North Korean nuclear problem  should be solved while Kim Il-song is alive because he alone can  offer a real concession in foreign policy.    North Korea has made a number of diplomatic concessions,  such  as simultaneous admission of North and South Korea to the United  Nations, cross-recognition of Seoul and Pyongyang by the four  powers (the United States, Japan, China and Russia) and mutual  recognition by Seoul and Pyongyang of the legitimacy of their  respective governments, for its survival since 1991. Since Kim  Il-song alone could concede such issues, he said, solution of  the nuclear dispute and other matters is necessary before the  death of the 82-year-old strongman.    The commonwealth plan will likely be realized during  President Kim Yong-sam's term in office, he observed, adding  that he believes the plan, if referred to a national vote, will  be approved by the people. "In that case, the government can  launch inter-Korean negotiations with confidence and authority,"  he remarked.    Because Kim Il-song is using the nuclear issue as a  bargaining card to normalize relations with the United States  and secure American economic cooperation, the only way to break  the nuclear standoff is for Washington to guarantee Pyongyang's  security by establishing diplomatic relations and suspending the  "Team Spirit" military exercise with South Korea, he said,  reiterating that the nuclear issue should be solved in a package  deal.    North Korea must expose its nuclear development program to  the world and promise to maintain peace and security on the  Korean peninsula, he stressed. China should then cooperate in  ensuring North Korea's commitment to security on the peninsula,  he added.    As Kim Il-song recently showed an interest in visiting the  United States, "We should not sneer at this olive branch he  offered," Kim Tae-chung said. If "the great leader" ever visited  the United States, North Korea might adopt a milder and more  flexible foreign policy. Asked whether he would run for  president again at a critical stage leading to reunification, he  replied, "I'll not run even if the people want me to run."</p>

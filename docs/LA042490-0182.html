			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> QUAKER OATS TO SELL FISHER-PRICE  </P> <P> Quaker Oats Co. said today that it will spin off its troubled Fisher-Price toy  division to Quaker shareholders, leaving the parent company free to concentrate  on its food business.  </P> <P> Fisher-Price, whose durable toys once dominated the infant and preschool  categories, has struggled against fierce competition in recent years.  </P> <P> Quaker Chairman William D. Smithburg said Fisher-Price should fare better as an  independent, publicly owned company.  </P> <P> The decision to spin off the toy subsidiary did not come as a complete  surprise. Smithburg, at a meeting with securities analysts in February, had  indicated that a sale of Fisher-Price was possible, although he said nothing  was imminent at that time.  </P> <P> The Fisher-Price unit, based in East Aurora, N.Y., posted an 11% decline in  operating income in fiscal 1989 and last month closed a manufacturing plant.  The plant closing in East Aurora affected 450 of the division's about 7,400  employees.  </P></p>

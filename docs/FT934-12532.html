			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Western Digital to sell facility to Motorola WESTERN Digital, the US semiconductor and disk drives group, is to sell its silicon wafer fabrication facility to Motorola, the US electronics group, for between Dollars 112m and Dollars 115m in cash, agencies report. Motorola will also assume equipment leases associated with the facility. The deal will include other unspecified considerations. The transaction is should be completed by the end of December. Western Digital and Rockwell International earlier this month terminated their negotiations on the sale of the facility. The transaction with Motorola also involves a supply contract, under which Western Digital said it would obtain a significant portion of its silicon wafer requirements for its disk drive and microcomputer products businesses from Motorola for at least two years after the sale. The sale is subject to a definitive agreement and government and private party approvals. 'Once completed, the transaction will continue to fulfil one of our principal goals over the last year - meaningful reduction of bank debt  - as well as facilitate our transition to a variable-cost structure from a high-fixed-cost structure,' said Mr Charles Haggerty, Western Digital chairman.</p>

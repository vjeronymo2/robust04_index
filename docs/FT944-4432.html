			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Morgan Grenfell fined over Maxwell pensions Morgan Grenfell Investment Management has been fined Pounds 180,000 by Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, in connection with losses from pension schemes controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. The fine is the third largest ever imposed by Imro. Morgan Grenfell has also agreed to pay costs of Pounds 95,000. Imro has also levied Pounds 170,000 in fines on two other former fund managers of Maxwell pension schemes for different rule breaches, neither of which led to losses for pensioners. Morgan Grenfell said the error, which was administrative, had been committed in February 1989, and 'we accept that we are guilty'. Morgan Grenfell has offered to make restitution of Pounds 276,000 to one of the Maxwell company pension schemes which trustees say had been lost as a result of the transaction. The charges stem from Morgan Grenfell's role as fund manager for the AGB Group Retirement Benefit Scheme. After AGB had been acquired by Mr Maxwell, a separate AGB Directors Scheme was set up with its own trustees. However, Morgan Grenfell said it had never been made aware of the distinction between the two. Imro said that Morgan Grenfell authorised its custodian bank to transfer AGB directors pension plan assets to a third party custodian bank without authority of that scheme's trustees. In total, according to Morgan Grenfell, the AGB group and directors scheme assets were worth about Pounds 8m, of which roughly Pounds 800,000 belonged to the directors' scheme. Also, Imro agreed a fine of Pounds 110,000 with NatWest Investment Management, in connection with a discretionary investment management service it provided for the Maxwell Communication Pension Scheme. NWIM also agreed to pay costs of Pounds 70,000. According to Imro, NWIM failed to make adequate arrangements for the verification of individuals authorised to give instructions relating to cash payments or asset transfers. On one occasion, Imro said, NWIM received instructions to transfer shares using blank stock transfer forms. Imro also said that Nikko Capital Management (UK) Ltd agreed to pay a fine of Pounds 60,000 and costs of Pounds 42,500 in connection with a significant breach of financial resources rules. In September 1991, Nikko extended a Pounds 6m loan overnight to Bishopsgate Investment Management. However, Nikko's rules required it to have minimum capital resources of Pounds 193,000 and it had negative capital of nearly Pounds 6m until the following day.</p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> BOOKS OPEN LOTS OF WAYS TO TILL THE SOIL  </P> <P> A garden book will help you through the dreary days of winter.

The book's title tells it all. The recipes include  one for scented note paper.  </P> <P> Also from Clarkson Potter come the nicely illustrated "Victoria and Albert Day  Book," with spaces for your garden record or engagements, and "The Scented Room  Gardening Notebook," also by Ohrbach. She has organized the spacious book into  sections for flowers, roses, herbs, vegetables, fruits and berries. There is  space for garden tips and supply sources.  </P> <P> Other noteworthy garden books include:  </P> <P> * "Pests of the Garden and Small Farm" (AMR Publications, $25) by Mary Louise  Flint." The author is director of the University of California Statewide  Integrated Pest-Management Project. The book includes 250 color photographs to  help identify pest problems.  </P> <P> * "The Language of Flowers," edited by Sheila Pickles (Crown, $19.95). The  flowers you receive, the way they are presented, even how the ribbon is tied,  have special meaning. The author speaks the language, from amaryllis to water  lily.  </P> <P> * "A Gentle Plea for Chaos: Enchantment of Gardening" (Simon &amp; Schuster,  $22.95), of which author Mirabel Osler says: "This book is an appeal for a  return of a little 'amiable disorder' to the sense of enchantment and vitality  that comes with a more random and intuitive approach to gardening, to an  awareness of the dynamics of a garden where plants are allowed to scatter as  they please."  </P> <P> * "American Cottage Gardens," edited by Ruth Rohde Haskell, and "Garden  Photography," edited by Charles Mareen Fitch, are paperbacks from Brooklyn  Botanic Garden. They cost $6.95 and $5.95, respectively.  </P> <P> * "Bringing the Outdoors In: How to Do Wonders With Vines, Wildflowers, Ferns,  Mosses, Bulbs, Cacti and Dozens of Other Plants Most People Overlook," by H.  Peter Loewer. The author, who also illustrated the book extravagantly, roams  the world of plants and offers advice on containers, simple greenhouses and  planters.  </P> <P> * "Focus on Flowers" by Allen Roach and Anne Millman (Abbeville, $39.95) aims  at discovering and photographing beauty in gardens and wild places. The authors  are experts with pen and lens.  </P> <P> * "Jerry Baker's Flowering Garden" (Collier, $7.95). Baker tells how to plan a  garden with "a different face for each season, even when the grass withers and  the flowers fade."  </P> <P> * "American Gardens" provides a tour of the nation's finest private gardens by  Peter Loewer (Simon &amp; Schuster, $35). The author uses color photos to guide  readers to 30 lovely gardens.  </P> <P> * "Taylor's Pocket Guides" (Houghton Mifflin, $4.95 each) include "Bulbs for  Spring," "Bulbs for Summer" and "Roses and Perennials for Shade," all edited by  Ann Reilly; and "Perennials for Sun" and "Old-Fashioned Roses," edited by  Maggie Oster.  </P> <P> * "Harrowsmith Magazine Gardener's Guide to Spring Flowers," edited by  Katherine Ferguson (Camden, $9.95), deals with flower bedding, bulbs,  perennials and flowering shrubs.  </P> <P> * "The Potpourri Gardener" by Theodore James Jr. (Macmillan, $22.95) is a guide  to making and growing potpourri, with information about more than 100  perennials, roses, bulbs, herbs and shrubs specially suited for creation of  potpourri.  </P></p>

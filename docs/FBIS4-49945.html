			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Technical associations  have become very active among Chinese farmers as more and more  of them want to learn technical expertise and information so as  to get rich faster.    According to the Ministry of Agriculture, such associations  started to flourish in the 1980s, with their focus first solely  on grain production in the ten provinces of Hebei, Shanxi,  Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, Henan, Guangdong and  Sichuan.    Since then, such associations have expanded to different  areas, including capital investment, technology, production,  processing, and supply and marketing, as farmers come to depend  more and more on the market.    A recent survey by the ministry shows that seven percent of  these associations focus on technology extension, over 50  percent of them concentrate on various production services, and  another 36 percent provide complete sets of help for farmers  from production to marketing.    The best known of such organizations is the Changcheng  township vegetable association of Zhucheng city in east China's  Shandong Province. As most of 2,400 household members are well  versed in vegetable production, the association helps them with  technical training, introducing fine seeds and supplying  services for vegetable processing and sales. Farmers from other  villages make up the majority of the association members, as  they want to learn more from the Changcheng farmers.    Another outstanding example is the Edible Fungus Association  in Feixiang county, in north China's Hebei province. The  association embraces 14 percent of the households in 100  villages specializing in edible fungus production.</p>

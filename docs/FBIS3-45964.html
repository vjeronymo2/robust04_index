Today, the All-Army Committee for  Compilation and Administration of Military Thematic Terms held  an exhibition in Beijing on the results of the compilation along  with a report-back demonstration of their practical application.  Leaders from the three general departments of the PLA [People's  Liberation Army] and major units of the whole army attended the  exhibition and watched the demonstration.    The Glossary of Military Thematic Terms is a  modern linguistic tool for checking and searching information.  This project was listed in 1987 as a key state project  concerning standards for military use under the "Seventh  Five-Year Plan." The quality of the principal part of the  project has attained advanced international levels and has  successively won special awards for outstanding achievements in  military scientific research in the whole army and a First Class  Prize for scientific and technological advancement in military  standardization awarded by the Commission of Science,  Technology, and Industry for National Defense. Its  complementary project and building of a whole series of relevant  tools have also made significant progress with the completion of  a Manual for Using the Glossary of Military Thematic  Terms and a Dictionary of Military Thematic  Terms as well as the compilation of a 13-part glossary for  the principal terms in a specialized subject.

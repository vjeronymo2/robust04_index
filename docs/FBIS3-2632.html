A great victory was scored in the first trial. In 1993, two  gas fields were discovered. One was the Ledong 15-1 Gas Field  and the other was the Dongfang 1-1 Gas Field.    Before this, great discoveries had been made in prospecting  for natural gas in Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin. A decade ago,  when drilling a well in the contracted Yacheng 13-1 zone in  Yinggehai, the U.S. company Arco discovered the Yacheng 13-1 gas  field, which is now under construction and will deliver gas to  Hong Kong in 1996.    As there are three gas fields within the same basin, what  kind of prospects does it indicate?    Hence, this reporter interviewed Wang Yan, president of  China  National Offshore Oil Corporation not long ago.    President Wang, who took part in the prospecting and  construction of the first offshore well in our country and once  acted as the head of Nanhai Xibu Petroleum Corporation, was  extremely familiar with the Nanhai Sea waters. For him, he  carries in his mind a map depicting the situation of natural gas  prospecting in Nanhai.    As introduced by President Wang, Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan  Basin  is a rapidly subsiding basin, and such a geological environment  is the best place for producing and storing natural gas. This  point is also illustrated by the current situation of the  Yacheng 13-1 gas field in this basin which has already been  proved.    The gas-bearing sandy layer of the Yacheng 13-1 gas field is  over 100-meters thick. With the assessment and calculation made  by a third independent party--U.S. Geological Advisory Company,  which is a worldwide authority, the reserves of this gas field  are estimated at 100 billion cubic meters, which is equivalent  to an oil field with 100 million metric tons of crude reserves.  Compared with natural gas fields which have been discovered in  our country, the reserves of Yacheng 13-1 gas field amount to  approximately 50 percent of the remaining proved reserves in the  whole area of Sichuan; and its size, abundance (referring to the  gas-bearing area per square kilometer), and productive capacity  is markedly better than that of gas areas in Shaanxi, Gansu, and  Ningxia. It is the largest single gas field discovered in our  country so far.    The reserves of the two gas fields newly discovered last  year  are also quite large. Now, efforts are being vigorously made to  drill wells there for assessment.    Last year, China National Offshore Oil Corporation drilled  two exploratory wells, but the attempts failed because the  pressure was too high. However, the "failure was gratifying"  because it was only the project which failed but a layer of  quite abundant gas was found in the two wells. According to  seismic measures, the gas-bearing sandy layer was more than 200  meters thick, whereas in the Yacheng 13-1 gas field, which has  100 billion cubic meters of reserves, the gas-bearing sandy  layer was over 100 meter thick. Hence, if the drilling of the  third well in this structure, which has already been carried  out, is successful and can be further verified, we will have a  large gas field with reserves even greater than that of Yacheng  13-1 gas field by 100 to 200 percent. What is gratifying is  that China National Offshore Oil Corporation has also found the  structure of Yacheng 23-1 gas field around the area which is  similar to Yacheng 21-1 gas field.    An area of over 260,000 square kilometer in the  Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin can be prospected and geologists  have already discovered over 100 formations. There are four  types of formations for producing and storing natural gas in  this basin, and now gas fields have been found in three of them,  which will, no doubt, greatly widen the scope of finding gas and  indicate very gratifying prospects. The China National Offshore  Oil Corporation has set the "joint development of oil and gas"  as a long-term strategy of development. From last year onwards,  it was unequivocally stated that in the future priority would be  given to gas extraction. Consequently, in the first year of  "giving priority to" gas extraction in the  Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin, reports of new successes kept  pouring in.    The trend of gas extraction is gratifying but also pressing.  President Wang Yan said: In 1994, the China National Offshore  Oil Corporation will further give priority to the  Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin. Now the corporation has set up a  leading group headed by the chief geologist to handle the  project in the vast gas area in Nanhai. Investment in the  Yinggehai-Qiongdongnan Basin will be increased from 400 million  yuan to 600 million yuan, and we are going to drill six  exploratory wells and three assessment wells. At present, three  well-drilling vessels are intensively carrying out work in this  area.    When talking about the significance of discovering a vast  gas  area in Nanhai, President Wang pointed out: Natural gas is a  fine-quality and pure fuel and also important for industrial  chemicals. Natural gas accounts for approximately 30 percent of  the world's total of energy production and consumption, among  some developed countries account for 50 percent, whereas in our  country it accounts for a mere three percent. Hence, our  country has a very great potential in developing the natural gas  industry. In particular, as the vast gas area in Nanhai is  adjacent to coastal areas in the southeast, which are  economically developed but extremely short of energy, the market  prospects are very good.    Finally, President Wang pointed at the locations of several  key exploratory wells on the map, held up three fingers, and  smiled and said, "Even if the chance is one out of three, there  is a very high probability of finding a vast gas area." He said  with full confidence, "This year, we must definitely make a  major breakthrough in the vast gas area in Nanhai."</p>

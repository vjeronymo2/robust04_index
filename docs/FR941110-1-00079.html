			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In recognition of the critical role that previously used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials would play in ensuring a smooth transition to ozone-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> friendly substances, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol decided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to encourage their expanded use. Specifically, in Decision  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> IV/24  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Copenhagen, 1992), the Parties decided ``not to take into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account, for calculating consumption, the import and export of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recycled and used controlled substances.'' EPA implemented this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision domestically in the December 10, 1993 phaseout rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (December 10, 1993; 58 FR 65018). Accordingly, EPA rules now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow importation of previously used or recycled controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances without allowances (&sect;82.4(a) and (b)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the December rule allows importation of used or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recycled controlled substances, EPA is now investigating several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases of potential fraud in which the importer claimed that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance was used or recycled when in fact, the Agency believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the substance was virgin or ``off-spec'' virgin (a newly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured substance that does not meet industry specifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for quality). Several other countries are investigating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importation of controlled substances that were believed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fraudulently labelled as used or recycled. Due to the difficulty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of determining whether a substance is used or recycled, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parties to the Montreal Protocol are very likely to consider a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarification of Decision  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> IV/24 during the 1994 meeting. In an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effort to facilitate final adoption of a rule that is consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the Protocol Parties' action, EPA is today proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative methods for ensuring that materials brought into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> country under the used and recycled allowance exemption are in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fact used or recycled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Additionally, EPA is today proposing that the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of used and recycled controlled substances be changed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to include only the term ``used'' since EPA believes recycled and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclaimed substances fall under the current definition. In this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner, a controlled substance is defined as used if it was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovered from a use system, regardless of whether it was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequently recycled or reclaimed. The proposed change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simplifies the references to used substances without confusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding their subsequent treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 1. Information Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> One method for ensuring that a substance claimed to be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is in fact used is to require that the importer have proof of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> origin of the substance prior to import. Naming the previous use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the substance offers opportunities for verification, whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through chemical analysis or through knowledge of a country's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infrastructure. Therefore, EPA is considering incorporating some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or all of the following information requirements:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=4 --> _the name and address of the firm that recovered the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _the type of equipment from which the substance was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovered,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

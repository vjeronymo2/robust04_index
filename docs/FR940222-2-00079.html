			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Each Fund could offer one class (the ``Benefit Plan Class'') only to qualified or nonqualified employee benefit plans. In addition to the services provided under the Administration Agreement, a Fund's administrator would provide or procure additional administrative and recordkeeping services necessary for the employee benefit plans to invest in the Funds. The administrator would charge a Class Administration Fee for the services, which fee is expected to be no more than 35 basis points of the net assets attributable to the Benefit Plan Class. The services are limited to: furnishing participant sub-accounting; maintaining separate records for each plan; assistance in processing purchase and redemption transactions; disbursing or crediting to the plans and maintaining records of all proceeds of redemptions of shares and all other distributions not reinvested in shares; preparing and transmitting to the plans, plan participants, or the trustees of the plans periodic account statements, and the integration of such statements with those of other transactions and balances in other accounts of the plan or participant; transmitting to the plans prospectuses, proxy materials, reports, and other information required to be sent to shareholders under the federal securities laws; transmitting to the transfer agent purchase orders and redemption requests placed by the plans; transmitting to a Fund or its agents periodic reports necessary to enable the Fund to comply with state Blue Sky requirements; transmitting to the plans or the trustees of the plans confirmations of purchase orders and redemption requests placed by the plans; maintaining all account balance information for the plans and daily and monthly purchase summaries expressed in shares and dollar amounts; and preparing, filing, and transmitting all federal, state, and local government reports and returns as required by law with respect to each account maintained on behalf of a plan; providing information to plans and participants about a Fund and its portfolios; and maintaining account designations and addresses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. A Fund may offer Benefit Plan Classes whose shares only are offered to qualified retirement plans for which a trustee is vested with investment discretion as to plan assets (``Excluded Classes'') by means of a separate prospectus. The Excluded Classes do not include Benefit Plan Classes whose shares are offered to self-directed plans in which an individual plan beneficiary can make an investment decision. As a result, there will be no overlap between the investors eligible to invest on their own behalf in Excluded Classes and any other class of a Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Each Fund may offer one class of shares (the ``Administrative Services Class'') to the clients, members, or customers of banks, broker-dealers, consultants, administrators, and other financial institutions (``Organizations''), which would provide certain services to their customers who purchase shares of the Administrative Services Class. Arrangements between the administrator and the Fund relating to such additional services are ``Administrative Services Arrangements.'' The administrator would either provide these additional services directly or would procure these services by entering into agreements with the Organizations. The services would be limited to: receiving, aggregating, and processing shareholder orders; furnishing shareholder sub-accounting; providing and maintaining elective shareholder services such as check writing and wire transfer services; providing and maintaining pre-authorized investment plans; communicating periodically with shareholders; acting as the sole shareholder of record and nominee for shareholders; maintaining account records for shareholders; answering questions and handling correspondence from shareholders about their accounts; issuing confirmations for transactions by shareholders; and performing similar account administrative services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Each Fund also could offer classes with a 12b&hyph;1 plan (the ``12b&hyph;1 Classes''). Under a 12b&hyph;1 plan, a Fund would enter into agreements with certain financial institutions (``Service Agents'') providing for distribution or distribution assistance of the shares of the 12b&hyph;1 Class. A Fund typically would make payments (the ``12b&hyph;1 Plan Payments'') to the Distributor or the Service Agent for such services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The Funds may in the future offer classes in addition to those described above, provided the Funds met the conditions imposed in any order of the SEC granting the requested relief. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The net asset value of all shares of a Fund would be computed on the same days and at the same times. The gross income of a Fund would be allocated to each class on the basis of the relative net assets of each class. Expenses specifically attributable to the particular class (``Class Expenses'') and 12b&hyph;1 Plan Payments would be charged directly to the particular class to which they are attributable. Class Expenses would consist of fees under a Class Addendum that relates to the class; litigation and indemnification expenses, if any, relating solely to one class; and fees of independent directors/trustees (``trustees'') incurred as a result of issues relating to one class. Class Expenses will be limited to those above, and the fees under a Class Addendum will be limited to fees payable for services set forth in the description of the Class Addenda for the Benefit Plan Class and the Administrative Services Class. Expenses incurred by a Fund not attributable to a particular class would be subtracted from the gross income on the basis of the relative net assets of each class of the Fund. Such expenses include litigation and indemnification expenses, if any, relating to a Fund, independent trustees' fees, and fees under the applicable Administration Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Because any 12b&hyph;1 Plan Payments and any Class Expenses that would be borne by a class of shares may vary for each class, the net income of (and dividends payable to) each class may vary from that of the other class or classes of the same Fund. Accordingly, for Funds that do not declare dividends daily (such as non-money market funds), the net asset value per share attributable to each class would differ between dividend declaration dates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

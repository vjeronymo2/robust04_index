			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Monday Interview: Music to Grumpy's ears - Sumner Redstone, owner of Viacom and MTV, talks to Raymond Snoddy Sumner Redstone's five grandchildren always call him Grumpy. He picked the nickname himself because, although he is 70 and looks like a wise and kindly old grandfather, he did not want to sound like one. How Redstone gets on with his grandchildren is of more than passing interest outside his family because his business is built around communicating with young people. The grandchildren also act as critics for some of the products he offers in the US and, increasingly, the world. Redstone owns and runs Viacom, the fast-expanding media group which controls television channels including MTV, the international purveyor of pop and video culture, and Nickelodeon, the successful US children's channel which will be launched in the UK next month as part of British Sky Broadcasting's new subscription package of 14 channels. This business has given Redstone personal wealth estimated at more than Dollars 3bn, the majority accrued over the past few years when most men would already have retired. Until he was 64, and before he bought Viacom in 1987, Sumner Redstone was worth merely a few hundred million dollars. 'Viacom has been the most exciting, fun experience of my life. I work with everyone. I'm involved with everyone,' says Redstone, who could be a surrogate grandfather for many of his staff, whose average age is 27. Viacom's interests range from cable television systems in west and mid-west America to five television stations and 14 radio stations. The programme channels are at the heart of the business: MTV is available in more than 200m homes, including in Europe and Asia, and MTV Latin America in Spanish will be launched on October 1. There is also VH-1, a music channel for 25- to 49-year-olds, and Nick At Nite, general entertainment for young adults, which takes over from Nickelodeon in the evening - both are coming to the UK next year as part of the Sky package. In addition, Viacom owns two subscription film channels and syndication rights to comedies such as The Crosby Show and Roseanne. 'This is essentially a software-driven company,' says Redstone. 'Our mission is to drive (the programmes) to every place in the world and to every new application.' His goal is not solely to make as much money as possible. An old-fashioned Boston liberal, he says he is aware of the responsibilities of being involved in the creation of an international youth culture. Redstone encourages certain limits on what is permissible. For example, MTV rejected Madonna's latest, erotic pop videos on grounds of taste, in the face of considerable criticism about censorship as well as potential financial loss. The channel may still be 85 per cent music, but it is also starting to do other things. For instance, MTV covered the US presidential campaign and interviewed Bill Clinton on his way to the White House. At the MTV Inaugural Ball, President Clinton acknowledged that MTV had 'a lot to do with his victory' by persuading hundreds of thousands of new voters to register. The programme Fifteen on Nickelodeon, aimed at the high-school audience in the US, deals with difficult issues such as drugs and sex. As part of Nickelodeon's Aids coverage, a condom was shown in a programme for young children. 'I was crying. I literally was crying as I watched that programme. I felt so proud. That would never have appeared on public broadcasting,' says Redstone. Economics and idealism, Redstone insists, go together. He has a vision of an international children's channel, created with local partners - 'a chance of an international lobby for the kind of world we want to live in'. But he talks about money with equal fluency and enthusiasm. The Viacom chairman is excited that, in the wake of his leveraged Dollars 3.4bn purchase of the company, its average rate of bank borrowing has fallen substantially. He also points out Viacom's senior debt was upgraded last year by Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, to investment grade, and this year Dollars 100m will go to the bottom line from interest savings, owing to the reduction in debt levels. Last year Viacom had net earnings of Dollars 49m, compared with a net loss of Dollars 50m the previous year, boosted by strong performances by MTV networks and from the company's cable television division. Last month, it reported operating profits of Dollars 107m for the second quarter, an increase of 11 per cent over the same period last year. Redstone's present media success is a long way from the start of his life, as a justice department lawyer. Lawyers, he believes, are 'the worst dissipators of human and economic resources I know'. *something in here (HP) * He moved across to business and, with his father, Michael, helped to develop drive-in cinemas in the 1950s, and later became a pioneer of multi-screen cinemas. He still owns National Amusements, which has more than 800 screens in the US and the UK, owns the name Multiplex, and is president of the Theatre Owners trade organisation. In 1979, Redstone's life was settled and seemingly secure. All that changed one night in a Boston hotel fire. 'It's impossible to explain how bad it was. I was covered in flames,' he says. He managed to climb out of his third-floor window and hang on to the window ledge by his fingertips until help arrived. At first he was not expected to survive. Then he was told he would not be able to walk. But after 60 hours of skin grafts and a lot of determination, Redstone is now a regular tennis player again. 'I have no nightmares about it. What makes me feel very happy is that all of this at Viacom came after the fire so I was able to begin a whole new life,' he says. The new business career began almost by accident, when he started taking stock positions in Hollywood companies ranging from Columbia to MGM Home Entertainment. His knowledge of how their products - the movies - were faring at the box office gave him an edge. Redstone bought a few thousand shares in Viacom in 1985 in the hope of selling them at a profit. He started asking questions about Viacom, and the answers made him consider a more serious role in the company. 'It was the flip side of motion picture exhibition,' he says. Cinema exhibition was a mature business, but Viacom was in the vanguard of its most dangerous rival  -home entertainment. In his 60s, Redstone mounted his first big hostile takeover - in competition with a Viacom management buy-out team. 'We had to B-O-R-R-O-W (spelling it out for emphasis) Dollars 500m in connection with this company. At National Amusements if we borrowed Dollars 10m or Dollars 15m, that was a major event.' He lured away the highly regarded Frank Biondi - former head of the Home Box Office pay TV movie channel and chairman of the Coca-Cola Television production company - in a multi-million dollar deal to run Viacom. One of the strengths of the Redstone-Biondi team is in assessing the new opportunities technology is creating for programme distribution, and the growing links between telephone and cable companies. Viacom recently linked up with American Telephone and Telegraph to test everything from video-on-demand television services and multi-player games to home shopping at the Viacom cable system in Castro Valley, California. All the new technical opportunities could provide new outlets for Viacom programmes. Referring to his cinema experience, Redstone argues: 'If the motion picture worked, the theatres worked. It's the same with the (television) programmes.' He has no intention of easing up, and he says another big acquisition, perhaps of a Hollywood studio, has not been ruled out. He is still having difficulty coming to terms with one aspect of Viacom  - MTV music: 'It's not exactly my demographic. I enjoy the dancing, the excitement, the sensuality, but I still like Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Tommy Dorsey.'

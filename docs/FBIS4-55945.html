			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 21 (CTK) -- The Green Party in  Slovakia (SZS) will enter the autumn parliamentary elections  within the left- wing coalition, SZS Chairman Jozef Pokorny told  journalists during the session of his party's coordination  committee today.    "On Monday [23 May] we will sign a coalition agreement with  the Democratic Left Party (SDL), the Social Democratic Party in  Slovakia (SDSS), and the Farmers' Movement," Pokorny announced.    Under the coalition agreement, the order of candidates on  the  list of candidates is to ensure the SZS six deputies' seats (in  the 150-seat Slovak parliament), provided the coalition acquires  the expected 15 per cent of vote. The SZS will propose a total  of 34 candidates. The agreement will enable the SZS to create  its own deputies' group in parliament, to promote their program,  and veto stances of the coalition, Pokorny said.    He said that if his party entered the elections separately  and received five per cent of votes, it could gain seven  parliamentary seats. But it may fail to enter parliament if not  part of the coalition.    Pokorny said that three former SZS members, who would have  preferred a SZS coalition with the opposition Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), were founding the Slovak Green  Party, adding he believed that this step aimed to weaken the SZS  before the elections. However, the SZS coalition with the  left-wing forces has annoyed only a few individuals of the  1,500-2,000 members of the party.    Pokorny informed journalists that the SZS intended to  establish a foundation to finance the conversion of the  unfinished nuclear power station in Mochovce, west Slovakia, to  vapor- and gas power.</p>

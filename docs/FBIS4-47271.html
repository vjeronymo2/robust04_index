I. Bogillo and A. A. Chuyko, Surface </F> Chemistry Institute, Kiev; UDC541.124.16:541.128:546.287]    [Abstract] The chemosorption kinetics of  alkylchlorosilanes, cyclic and linear organosilanes, and  trimethylpseudohalides on the surface of pyrogenic silica were  studied in previous works and a formula was developed which  adequately describes the process kinetics. In the present work  additional parameters for this formula were derived for the  activation energy of the chemosorption of  (CH[.sub]3[/])[.sub]3[/]SiX silanes and siloxanes on  silica surface. The activation energy of electrophilic  substitution of a hydrogen atom from the silanol groups of the  surface by these compounds decreases with lowering strength of  the Si-X bond and increasing inductive constant of the  substituent X, as well as with decreasing enthalpy of reaction.

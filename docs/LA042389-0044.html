			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: W.A.S.P. "THE HEADLESS CHILDREN." CAPITOL ** 1/2  </P> <P> Singer Blackie Lawless and gang have ditched their lurid sex-and-violence motif  and entered the world of social consciousness with no loss of power. In fact,  without the crutch of its sensationalist trappings, W.A.S.P. has created its  gutsiest record to date. Guest drummer Frankie Banali of Quiet Riot shines on  this album's heavy territory and Uriah Heep's Ken Hensley adds '70s-style  keyboards on several tracks. After being on the fringes of the metal scene for  the better part of the '80s, W.A.S.P. is ready to be taken seriously. JANISS  GARZA  </P></p>

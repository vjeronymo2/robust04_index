			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / International Company News: BBV plans to cut 3,000 jobs BANCO Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's second largest bank, plans to cut 3,000 jobs and close 300 branches, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. The bank had 2,771 branches in Spain and 157 offices abroad at the end of 1991. It employed some 28,800 people in Spain at the end of last year. 'To boost productivity some 3,000 jobs will go between 1992 and 1994 and in order to rationalise our branch network we will close maybe 300 branches over the next three to four years,' said Mr Alfredo Saenz, first vice-president. He said expansion of credit demand this year would be in line with economic growth in Spain, which BBV predicts will be around 2.5 per cent. He said lower provisions for bad debt and future pension payouts would underpin BBV's profits. This year's incorporation of the group's 217 non-financial companies under new Bank of Spain accounting guidelines would give BBV's 1992 profits a 5 per cent boost. The expansion of market share in Spain and an increase in productivity as BBV quickened the pace of cost savings would result in higher operating results in 1992, said Mr Saenz.</p>

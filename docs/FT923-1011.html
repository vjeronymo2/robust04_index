			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Ethnicity stalks Romania poll: Virginia Marsh and Anthony Robinson on elections this weekend PRESIDENTIAL and parliamentary elections in Romania this weekend will decide the fate of domestic reforms and vitally affect prospects for stability throughout the volatile Balkan region. The prospects do not look good. The latest public opinion poll by Irsop, an independent research company, indicates that the most likely outcome is a parliament where intolerant nationalists will hold the balance between conservative former communists and a shaky coalition of reformist democrats. No clear winner is expected to emerge from the first round of the presidential elections, where Mr Ion Iliescu, the current president, leads a field of six candidates. (The run-off takes place in two weeks.) His strongest challenger is Mr Emil Constantinescu, the rector of Bucharest University. He represents the 'Democratic Convention' (DC), a loose, 18-party coalition of anti-communist reformers. But the DC, which won power in Bucharest and many other big cities in local elections last February, has fought a lacklustre campaign. It has been unable to attract many rural voters, who make up 47 per cent of the population, or gain sufficient support from industrial workers suffering from rising unemployment, and lower real incomes. Mr Iliescu, a former high-ranking communist official who mysteriously rose to power after the execution of Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian dictator, and his wife on Christmas Day 1989, is supported by the Democratic National Salvation Front (DNSF). This is the rump party which emerged from a split in the National Salvation Front (NSF), which won Romania's first post-communist elections by a landslide in May 1990. The NSF, led by Mr Petre Roman, the deposed former prime minister of the first post-Ceausescu government, is now the standard bearer of International Monetary Fund-supported market reforms. The rump DNSF retained the loyalty of older-generation communists, including leaders of the secret police and intelligence services appointed by Mr Iliescu after the formal dissolution of Ceausescu's infamous Securitate network. He has also appointed loyal followers to key positions in the judiciary, the state television and the army. He appeals to ordinary workers and peasants traditionally suspicious of Romania's westward-looking intelligentsia. In recent months however, ultra-nationalist parties have chipped away at Mr Iliescu's electoral base by stirring up deep-rooted xenophobic traditions. Ethnic intolerance is especially strong in Transylvania, ruled by Hungary until 1918 and home to most of Romania's 1.7m ethnic Hungarians. But gypsies and Romania's exiguous Jewish and other minorities have also re-emerged as traditional targets. The estimated 2m gypsies are in a specially invidious position. Many Romanians blame the gypsies for giving the country a bad name abroad and making it difficult for Romanians to get foreign visas. This intolerance is likely to worsen following Germany's decision to repatriate 43,000 Romanians, of whom 60 per cent are gypsies, only days before the election. Recent weeks have seen a surge in support for Mr Gheorghe Funar, the rabidly anti-Hungarian mayor of Cluj, the former capital of Hungarian-ruled Transylvania, who has risen to third place in the polls with 14 per cent, against 38 per cent for Mr Iliescu and 31 per cent for Mr Constantinescu. If the polls are right, Romania's fragile democracy and market reforms could be undermined by an opportunistic alliance between Mr Iliescu's DNSF and Mr Funar's nationalists. This could reinforce a mirror-image rise of nationalist fervour in Hungary, where the government is already under attack for not properly defending the rights of 5m ethnic Hungarians in Croatia, Serbia and soon-to-be-independent Slovakia, as well as Transylvania. Such an outcome would alienate potential foreign investors and derail the economic reform process just as it is starting to bring results. Under the caretaker government headed by Mr Theodor Stolojan, Romania has set up much of the legal and institutional framework needed for privatisation and a market economy. It has earned praise from the IMF for sticking to tough budgetary and other parameters. A new IMF interim lending arrangement has been agreed, pending finalisation after the elections. Recent months have seen a sharp growth in exports and a rapid expansion of the private sector. This has not been enough to counteract a 50 per cent drop in industrial production since 1989 or stem a fall in real incomes of more than 20 per cent and rising unemployment, which is uppermost in the minds of many voters as they go to the polls.</p>

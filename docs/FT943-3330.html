			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jamaica acts to contain spread of livestock pest Hundreds of thousands of infertile screw-worm - a type of fly which has been devastating cattle and other livestock in the Caribbean - are to be released from aircraft over Jamaica. The project is being supported by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in an effort to contain the spread of the pest through the region. The flies being released are the sterile version of the New World screw-worm, which is attacking cattle in Jamaica and has also been detected in other parts of the Caribbean - mainly Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Trinidad and Tobago. About 86 per cent of the Caribbean region has been found to be infested with the screw-worm, according to the FAO. The project involves the continuous release of infertile insects which will mate but produce no offspring, leading to the progressive reduction and eventual total collapse of the screw-worm population, the FAO said. The Caribbean project, to be funded by regional governments as well as the FAO, is expected to cost about Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m). The Caribbean islands are hoping for success similar to that achieved in Libya four years ago, when the introduction of sterile screw-worms eradicated the fly in two years before it could spread and devastate livestock throughout the continent. Sterile flies will be released over all but 10 per cent of Jamaica's 11,424 sq km. The flies are produced in a laboratory on the border between Mexico and the United States and have been tested in parts of the US, Puerto Rico, Curacao and the Virgin Islands. In 1960, the cost of the screw-worm infestation in the United States was estimated at Dollars 100m a year. Clearing Mexico and the southern United States of the pest took more than 20 years and cost nearly Dollars 700m. Regional scientists say that one problem in dealing with the New World screw-worm is the ease with which it can be spread by animals as well as by humans. A country can be infested by the presence of the fly in one animal or human. Although quarantine regulations reduce the chances of infestation by animals crossing borders, no such arrangements have been made for humans crossing from infested areas. There have been hundreds of documented cases of human infestation by screw-worm in South America, including some deaths. Caribbean governments have been advised that a strengthening of quarantine regulations will be necessary to prevent the spread of the fly, although scientists say it is also likely that the pest could be spread by wind.</p>

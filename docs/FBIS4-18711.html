			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "Our Economics Staff": "GATT Sees World Trade </F> Rising Up to 5 Percent"]    [Text] World trade should expand between 2.5 percent and 5  percent this year but whether it turns out to be at the lower or  upper end of this range depends crucially on the extent and  timing of economic recovery in Japan and West Europe, the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) says today.    GATT economists say in an annual report that global exports  grew by only 2.5 percent in 1993, a deceleration from the 4.5  percent increase seen in 1992.    The value of global merchandise trade dropped 2 percent to  $3,580 billion between 1992 and 1993. Trade in services --  including tourism, transport, telecommunications, insurance and  banking -- is estimated to have grown a modest 3 percent in 1993  to $1.03 billion according to preliminary findings. This  compares with a 12 percent increase in 1992.    GATT says that this poor performance in trade was largely  due  to recession in continental Europe, where both exports and  imports fell for the first time in 40 years, and that recovery  in this area was crucial to its forecast. The report says that  if there is a mild recovery in Europe, the volume of world trade  could expand 5 percent or more. But "if, instead, delays occur  in the recovery of West Europe or in Japan, trade growth is  likely to be closer to last years 2.5 percent," it adds.    Low demand in several European countries, including France,  Germany and Italy, coupled with the dollars appreciation against  European currencies, meant the dollar value of West Europe's  trade had fallen 10 percent, the largest decline since the  Second World War.    The report says that the latest figures for continental  Europe and Japan suggest that recessionary pressures had receded  by the end of last year but that it is still too early to tell  whether recovery has begun. Trade activity remains relatively  weak in Africa, the Middle East, Central and East Europe and the  republics of the former Soviet Union.    In contrast, Asia, Latin America and North America recorded  above-average growth in Import volumes. Latin America had the  biggest growth in export volumes, up 9.5 percent in the last  year, followed by Asia with a 6 per cent rise in exports. North  American export volumes rose 5.5 percent in 1993 compared with 8  percent in 1992. Canadian and U.S. import volumes Jumped 11  percent compared with 8 percent the previous year.</p>

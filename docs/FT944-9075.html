			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Italy, UK finance plan for Kazakh pipeline British Gas and Italy's Agip are considering co-financing a Dollars 1.2bn oil pipeline at the heart of a dispute with Russia, according to Kazakhstan officials. Kazakhstan's deputy foreign minister, Mr Viacheslav Gizzatov, said British Gas and Agip might join Chevron of the US in financing the pipeline, connecting the Tengiz field to Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossisk. The pipeline would also carry oil condensate from a rich northern Kazakhstan field, Karachaganak, which British Gas and Agip intend to develop. The two groups have exclusive rights to develop Karachaganak, which contains reserves of 1,300bn cu m of gas, 650m tonnes of condensate and 200m tonnes of oil. The financing plan is part of an attempt to break a logjam holding up Chevron's Dollars 20bn contract at Tengiz, the former Soviet Union's largest oilfield. Kazakhstan is believed to contain some of the world's richest oil and natural gas reserves. But all export pipelines to the west pass through Russia, which industry officials say has thrown up obstacles to expansion. Chevron has refused to proceed with development of Tengiz, estimated to contain between 6bn and 9bn barrels of recoverable oil reserves, until the pipeline issue is settled. The financing proposal involves plans to expand the existing oil pipeline to Novorossisk. A three partner consortium of Oman Oil, Kazakhstan and Russia possesses the right to operate the expanded pipeline that would carry Tengiz's production. Russia and Oman Oil are insisting that Chevron arrange virtually the entire cost to build the pipeline, in exchange for a 25 per cent stake in the consortium. In turn, Chevron has offered to finance half the pipeline, but effectively wants to exclude Oman, which has put in no finance. British Gas results, Second Section</p>

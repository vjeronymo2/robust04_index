			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Henry Barrett plummets by 96% to Pounds 272,000 INTERIM PROFITS at the Henry Barrett Group, the steel and industrial products company that grew rapidly in the 1980s through acquisitions, plummetted 96 per cent as it was hit by the sharp downturn in the UK construction industry. Pre-tax profits for the six months to February 28 fell from Pounds 6.46m to Pounds 272,000, on turnover down to Pounds 57.43m (Pounds 67.8m). The profits fall compares with a 96 per cent increase in the previous half year on turnover ahead 75 per cent. Mr James Barrett, chief executive, said the group had been hit by a sharp decline in turnover and profit margins, particularly in the steel buildings division, where a 29 per cent fall in turnover was the largest among all divisions. As the economic climate in the UK deteriorated, profit margins for the industry fell in line with a 30 per cent decline in the selling price of buildings. The group's design and build business was especially hard hit and while productivity was significantly improved this could not completely offset the fall in profit margins. Lindapter International, a manufacturer of proprietary industrial fastenings, the steel services division and BNL, which markets thermoplastic bearing technology, were the only businesses that were profitable. The group has adopted a strategy of disposing of non-core businesses in an attempt to reduce gearing to the 31 per cent level recorded in the previous financial year. Gearing at the half-year was 74 per cent. At the end of March, it sold its Lurmark spray nozzle manufacturing business for Pounds 3.25m - Pounds 1m over book value - and is currently in talks on another possible disposal. The sale of Lurmark reduced gearing to 62 per cent. There has been an improvement in order books in the second half with the Don Reynolds curtain walling business currently enjoying a record order book in excess of Pounds 12m. 'We fundamentally believe that the worst is over,' Mr Barrett said. While the group saw a downturn it has been able to increase market share reflecting weaker positions of competitors. He, nevertheless, conceded that the group would not vigorously contest analysts' revised forecasts of Pounds 3m to Pounds 5m for the full year.</p>

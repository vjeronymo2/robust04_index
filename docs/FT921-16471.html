			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / International Company News: Iberian banks join forces to launch venture in France BANCO Comercial Portugues (BCP), Portugal's fastest growing private bank, and Banco Popular Espanol of Spain have joined forces to launch a new bank in France to be named Banco Popular Comercial (BPC). In a separate move, BCP also plans to launch this year a new housing finance bank in Portugal in association with Cariplo, Italy's state-owned savings bank and its largest financial institution. Both moves are designed to deepen the Portuguese bank's internationalisation ahead of January 1993 when the European Community's financial markets will be fully open, said Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, BCP president. BCP already has reciprocal crossholdings of 1.5 per cent with Banco Popular and Cariplo. The two new banks will both be owned equally by BCP and each of its foreign partners, although in the case of the bank in France, one of the two partners' shareholding will be a fraction of a per cent higher to conform with French banking requirements for a majority shareholder. BPC's initial capital will be FFr400m (Dollars 77m), and it will be presided over in turn by the two shareholding institutions. The bank will function through Banco Popular's 18 branches in France. It will aim to attract French private and corporate customers interested in the Iberian market, and to provide financial services for Portuguese and Spanish companies active in France. The new housing finance bank will be owned equally by BCP and Cariplo which recently formed a joint real estate leasing company. In the past two years, BCP has pursued a policy of establishing links with foreign banks as a way to gradually strengthen its international presence and activities. 'I don't believe a Portuguese bank can succeed on its own abroad. Portugal has neither the tradition nor the financial power to do this,' Mr Goncalves said.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Observer: Carla's boys At a time when the new US administration is upsetting its partners with confusing signals on trade policy, it is only natural that Carla Hills, the former US trade representative, should try to exploit the policy vacuum. Hills, 59-year-old wife of former SEC chairman Roderick Hills, has followed the route of many out-of-work politicians and become a Washington consultant. Her former deputy Julius Katz, and a couple of her other officials, Erin Endean and Robert Fisher, have joined her in the aptly named Hills Company whose aim is to help businesses maximise their opportunities and minimise their risks in the global economy. Even though she is one of yesterday's executives, her reputation for effectiveness means that there should be no shortage of clients wanting their hands held as they watch the worrying conflicts emerging in the new administration's trade policy. Admittedly, Hills is first and foremost a lawyer, like her successor, Mickey Kantor. She made her initial mark as a ruthless negotiator rather than a policy-maker. But strength as a policy-maker emerged quickly thereafter. Kantor, take note.</p>

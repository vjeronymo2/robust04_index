			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / German post-telecom sale back on course The final hurdle blocking the sale of the German postal and telecommunications service, the country's largest privatisation, was cleared at the weekend when management and unions agreed a pay and benefits package. After four weeks of acrimonious negotiations, the agreement allows for the final passage of legislation approving the privatisation of the postal and telecommunications service at the beginning of next year. It also marks an end to a string of nationwide postal strikes which delayed an estimated 70m letters and packages. The opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) had said it would use its majority in the Bundesrat, or upper house, to overturn the recent vote to change the constitution and approve the privatisation unless management and unions came to an agreement. The package agreed early on Saturday guarantees the present wage brackets until mid-1996 and also makes provisions that will bring the status of employees in eastern Germany in line with standards in western Germany. A negotiating team representing the three companies said they had gone to the 'limits of what was managerially responsible'. The state-owned leviathan, which employs 670,000 people, will now be turned into three joint stock companies on January 1, 1995: Deutsche Telekom, Postdienst (the postal service) and Postbank, the banking arm. The postal sale is the centrepiece of a privatisation drive by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrat government which recently agreed to reduce its 51 per cent stake in Lufthansa, the national carrier, and is making further efforts to reform the railway company, Deutsche Bahn, which became a state-owned joint stock company at the beginning of the year. However, the German Postal Union (DPG), a determined opponent of privatisation since it was first proposed in 1989, had demanded that management guarantee all employee benefits following privatisation. These benefits include around 100,000 subsidised apartments, money towards new shoes for postmen who wear out their soles on postal rounds and the right to a cold drink in temperatures hotter than 26 degrees Celsius. Many of these benefits are up for renegotiation in mid-1996 but there are fears that a series of other agreements between the government and the SPD may make it difficult for Deutsche Telekom, the first of the three companies which will be fully privatised, to match the performance of international competitors.</p>

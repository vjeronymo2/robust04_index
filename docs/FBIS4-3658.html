			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 23 Apr (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier  Zhu Rongji sent a telegram on 23 April to condole the death of  former U.S. President Richard Nixon. The full text of the  telegram follows:    Mr. Nixon was a statesman with foresight and sagacity. He  always cared about Sino-U.S. relations. He visited China seven  times, made important contributions to the improvement and  development of the two countries' relations, and had the respect  of the Chinese people. I wish to express my profound condolences  on his death, and also my sincere sympathy for Mr. Nixon's  family.</p>

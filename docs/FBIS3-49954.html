			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman on arrival </F> at Zagreb from Geneva talks -- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] A few minutes ago the Croatian  delegation returned from Geneva. Our colleague Zeljko Rajic met  them on their arrival. We would like to warn you that the  footage that we are broadcasting now has not been edited:    [Tudjman] I think that this was the most important document  since UN Security Council Resolution 871, because according to  it Yugoslavia, i.e. Serbia and Montenegro, have recognized the  Republic of Croatia within its borders. Although it has not  been clearly said, the formal declaration refers to the UN  Charter and the basic CSCE documents which set out precisely  that; relations between states are based on mutual recognition  and the declaration itself expressly says that this is the first  step in the establishment of both diplomatic relations and  normalization [as heard] and establishment of interstate  relations, and in the normalization of Croatian-Serbian  relations in their entirety, which means that the Serbs in  Croatia, by this official declaration by Belgrade, are called on  to regulate their relations with the Croatian Government in the  Republic of Croatia.    This is a victory for our policy which is in line with  requirements set by the international community, with the  European Union [EU] requirements and those set by the UN  Security Council -- that political means should be used to  resolve the problem of Croatia's UN-protected areas, which are  actually under Serb occupation; this occupation, as we know,  came as a result of their being supplied in every sense, both  with weapons and troops from Serbia. Official Belgrade has now  given up this forceful policy and declared itself in favor of  political normalization of the overall relations, and  consequently has given up the Serbs in Croatia. This is of  paramount importance.    After we had signed it, I had a feeling of having achieved a  great victory. We will not have to suffer fresh casualties to  liberate Croatian territories. In the very near future we will  be able to direct our efforts into building our country in the  economic and cultural sense. This very act which is of great  significance must influence the restoration of peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is not as yet certain, as I said in  the beginning because the Muslim side has continued putting  forward fresh conditions and because there is no accord there  when it comes to important issues.    As far as the conference is concerned, I likewise have to  say  that within the conference we, on our part, offered a new  proposal to the Muslims for the regulation of mutual relations,  for the establishment of real friendship, for the cessation of  fighting between the Muslims and Croats, for halting the Muslim  offensive against the Croat areas in central Bosnia.    The Muslims openly demanded in the course of the  negotiations  that Croatian Defense Council [HVO] forces pull out from central  Bosnia, that is, from Novi Travnik, Vitez, Busovaca, Kiseljak,  Kresevo etc. Therefore, they made it clear in the talks that  they wish these territories to become part of the Muslim  republic, they tried to back this with all kinds of excuses and  reasons -- all unacceptable to us from the standpoint of the  Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the strategic interests  of the Croatian state.    We presented our proposal to the Muslims and they gave us  their paper, their proposal. We have not even started  coordinating our views -- the Muslims believe war is inevitable,  they even believe that war between the Croats and the Serbs in  Croatia is an inevitability and that the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina could hardly be resolved without war.  However, this evening, prior to take off and our departure for  Zagreb, we held individual talks -- Deputy Prime Minister Granic  met with Silajdzic, I had a tete-a-tete with Izetbegovic. We  tried to agree on the need to establish peace between the  Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, to stop the bloodshed  and seek a basis for lasting cooperation to the benefit of both  peoples. We agreed to continue these talks and we hope they  will finally produce some results.    We [Croatia and Yugoslavia] signed a declaration and the  representatives of Herceg-Bosna and the republic of Srpska also  signed a joint declaration on the cessation of hostilities and  the opening of missions. All three sides agreed on the  establishment of hot lines to prevent the conflict from  spreading.    I should also say that we agreed in this declaration on the  opening of offices -- an office of the Republic of Croatia in  Belgrade and an official office, a bureau or whatever, of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Zagreb. This is a way to  establish normal diplomatic relations, to achieve diplomatic  recognition. I remembered in this context that, following the  Second World War, when relations between two superpowers -- the  United States and China -- were frozen, such offices were opened  after Kissinger's trip to China. Therefore, this is an  extremely important development.    [Tudjman] Let me say this: Some of our people may ask  themselves: What does this mean now, establishing diplomatic  relations with Belgrade? Is this a way to return back to  Yugoslavia or back to Belgrade?    I want to make this clear to everyone: This is recognition  of sovereign Croatia. This is a possibility to incorporate  peacefully, without casualties and new destruction, all those  Croatian areas which are currently occupied or under UN  protection into the constitutional and the legal system of the  Republic of Croatia. This will not be easy but we have made an  important step by initiating this kind of resolution. From this  aspect it was a success of our policy, our reputation in the  world, our power and friendship that we enjoy from the  international factors that helped us [as heard]. Not only did  the Russian representative but also representatives of other  European states supported this declaration. Therefore, this is  how one should assess this truly important event in our recent  political reality.    [Reporter] Mr. president, could you describe the role of  peace negotiators and the pressure by the international  community via the WEU [Western European Union], NATO, and other  officials? Did they exert any influence on the two-day talks in  Geneva?    [Tudjman] They have influenced the overall talks. They did  not have a direct influence on the declaration on the  normalization of Serb-Croat relations but they supported this  initiative. Russia particularly supported the initiative, which  is very important because it means that the main ally of Serbia  or Yugoslavia is recommending this. This is also a guarantee  that the declaration will be implemented. Some people at the  conference had their doubts but it is clear that Serbia,  Yugoslavia, and Belgrade found their interest in signing such an  agreement; the situation in which they are, bearing in mind the  embargo, the sanctions. The international public has accepted  this declaration with general approval.</p>

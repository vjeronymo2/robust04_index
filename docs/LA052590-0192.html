			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MICKEY SPILLANE WAY DEDICATED  </P> <P> A street that runs beside Mickey Spillane's old elementary school now bears the  author's name.  </P> <P> One of Spillane's grade school teachers showed up for the dedication ceremony  attended by the writer Thursday, along with dozens of young students from the  Theodore Roosevelt Elementary and Middle schools.  </P> <P> "At least it's paved," the 72-year-old Spillane said of Mickey Spillane Way,  which runs by the schools. "If it wasn't paved, I wouldn't go."  </P> <P> Spillane, who has written more than 40 detective novels featuring the  hard-boiled private eye Mike Hammer, said he attended grades three through six  at Roosevelt Elementary.  </P> <P> The writer's family moved to Elizabeth in 1918, when he was a month old. He  lived here until his senior year of high school, he said.  </P> <P> Spillane has been living in Murrell's Inlet, S.C., where he's finishing a novel  and rebuilding his home. The novel was lost and the house destroyed last fall  in Hurricane Hugo.  </P></p>

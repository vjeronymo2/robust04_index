			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Oftel reopens the rule book: Alan Cane says the watchdog sees a different role for itself allied with fresh regulations The UK has the most liberalised telecommunications market in the world. It also has one of the most complex, with emerging competition encouraged by a raft of regulation designed to give newcomers room to grow in the shadow of British Telecommunications. Yesterday's consultative paper from Oftel, the telecoms regulator, solicits opinions on questions at the heart of the worldwide debate on how best to manage the evolution of telecoms from state-owned monopoly to fully competitive free market. Few would oppose the need for a measure of regulation after liberalisation. Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said yesterday that Britain's tangle of regulation was no accident. He said: 'This burst of regulatory effort is inevitable as the emergence of competition generates new problems and argument for regulators to adjudicate on. 'If we are to ensure that competition does not wither on the vine, abandonment of monopolies and reserved rights must be coupled with the adoption of rules.' The question addressed by the paper is what kind of rules apply in a market such as the UK, where competition is still only emerging. The message from Oftel is that it would like to see itself policing the market for anti-competitive behaviour rather than continuing in its role as a calculator of regulated prices. Mr Cruickshank pointed out, however, that a move towards comprehensive coverage of potential anti-competitive behaviour would work only if the right enforcement mechanisms were in place. Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman, said this week that he wanted freedom from retail price controls from 1997, when the existing regime will be reviewed, and an end to preferential support for market newcomers. The Oftel paper suggests that newcomers have to be protected against BT through a modification of the access deficit contribution regime. It does, however, raise the possibility that ADC might vanish. Oftel speculates that if the line rental cap were lifted, BT would not raise line rental charges significantly, assuming the existing overall cap on prices remained in force. It says: 'With the overall price cap set at RPI minus 7.5 per cent, the bills of most customers would fall even if BT rebalanced (its line rental and call charges) quite quickly.' The paper also questions the high cost to BT of the universal service obligation, designed to ensure that the isolated and the infirm have economical access to a basic phone service. Research published yesterday by Analysys, a European telecoms consultancy, supports the Oftel conclusions. It says the net cost to BT of its obligation is between Pounds 50m and Pounds 120m, somewhat less than estimates by experts which have been as high as Pounds 400m.</p>

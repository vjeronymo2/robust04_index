			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / 'Tri-service' plan triumphs over tough vested interests: Operational command unified The plan announced yesterday represents a hard-won victory by defence ministry officials, over some stubborn vested interests, for the commonsense idea of joint or 'tri-service' facilities. The ministry has had to contend with the staunchly independent traditions of the three services, as well as some more practical objections. Under the new principle - referred by the ugly new word 'jointery' - there is to be a tri-service hospital and a tri-service staff college. Joint arrangements will be promoted in areas such as flying instruction, music lessons and veterinary care. Operational commands are by definition 'tri-service' as most wars are fought on land, sea and air. A permanent tri-service operational headquarters will be set up at Northwood, north-west of London. Ministry officials believe a single establishment to oversee operations in conflict zones will be better than what one called 'the current ad hoc approach of setting up such a headquarters only in response to a developing crisis'. Senior officers are known to have doubts about concentrating operational command in one, potentially vulnerable spot, however. Plans to bring the services together in a 20,000-strong Rapid Deployment Force, including men from the Parachute Regiment, Royal Marine commandos and RAF aircraft, are expected to receive a warmer welcome. The ministry has decided to make the naval hospital at Haslar, Hampshire a joint institution and to close the hospitals at Aldershot, Hampshire, and Wroughton, Wiltshire. All secondary medical care will be concentrated in a tri-service agency. A joint staff college is to be established by 1997, where officers will be sent on 10-month courses in tactical and operational doctrine. The ministry may use the Army school at Camberley, Surrey or the historic naval college at Greenwich, south London.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ESTIMATED JOB REDUCTIONS BY THE YEAR 2000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  RN   Army     RAF Civilian    Total  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- HQ reductions                   150    200     500      900    1,750 More efficient recruiting       600    900   2,200        -    3,700 Medical support                 250    250     250      270    1,020 Rationalisation of bases/ stores/spares depots            800    300   2,150    3,100    6,350 Improvements in IT               20    300     100      430      850 Air traffic control               -      -     200        -      200 Rationalisation of science and technology            -      -       -    1,300    1,300 Other civilianisation             -      -   1,500        -    1,500 Other support posts (including fire services)        80    250     600    1,100    2,030  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                         1,900  2,200   7,500    7,100   18,700  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

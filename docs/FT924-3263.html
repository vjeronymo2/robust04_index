			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / US troops land in midst of anarchy COLONEL Omar Jess, the Somali warlord who controls the wild southern city of Kismayo, turned to face the Indian ocean yesterday at the deserted port and gazed towards the horizon - perhaps looking for a first sighting of the French and US ships which started disembarking troops before dawn today. Col Jess, leader of the battle-hardened Ogadeni clan-faction, is the only man who can offer safe passage into Somalia's second largest port, a key objective of the US-led military intervention. 'We want the US soldiers to come because there is anarchy and chaos in the country, there is looting and gangs and warmongers,' said the colonel, leaning against a Land Rover armed with a mounted multiple grenade launcher adapted from a MiG-23 fighter jet. The port and airport at Kismayo are vital to transport food up the Jubba Valley where the people are suffering the worst starvation. If foreign troops encounter violence it is most likely to be in Kismayo where at least four clans are battling for control of the town's scant resources. Mr Sean Devereux, a Unicef official in Kismayo, says: 'Somalis in Kismayo have been used to localised power and they have seen what the gun can do and what power it can bring.' The United Nations had to evacuate Kismayo in October because of looting, hijacking of aid planes, intimidation and death threats against UN aid workers. Several ships have been looted while docked. In the last food shipment, only 20 per cent reached the most severely affected starving people. The rest of the trucks controlled by the local 'authorities' were 'diverted'. 'Jess cannot control the men with guns who do what they want and take every opportunity to grab and take,' says Mr Devereux. Col Jess said he had done as much as possible to get food to his people. He did not get a cut from the looting, only a 'few taxes' collected by local authorities under his control. 'The UN have destabilised Somalia, refused to help us and committed crimes which must be investigated and punished,' he said. He also warned he would fiercely resist efforts to turn Somalia into a UN trusteeship. 'We will fight anybody who wants to colonise us again. We want to be independent and free.' Like other warlords Col Jess says he will welcome troops but expects them to entrench the position he has established by force. He expects US troops to disarm the bandits, feed the starving, develop the country and then get out and give him his slice of power back. As soon as this illusion fades he, like the others, will become less welcoming.</p>

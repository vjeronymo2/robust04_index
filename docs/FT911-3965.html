			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Arts: Tom Jones - Hammersmith Odeon There they were, well-preserved ladies egging each other on to slip the bouncers and make to the front of the stage where they could hand the star the roses, the china ornaments - and the panties. Whoever first threw her knickers at Tom Jones should be made an honorary member of the Guild of Garment Makers because the ritual of the panties has become the corner-stone of his act. The well-laundered exhibits, ranging from skimpy red to enormous white bloomers, are handed over for Tom to mop his brow. They are then returned, with a kiss. It is as decorous as a Japanese bow. And as boring. There are signs that Tom Jones, now enjoying at 50 a popular renaissance, would like to go legit, to wow with his voice rather than his lower vertebrae. But he is a kindly man and likes to please his fans. So he stays a tease. To shouts that he remove his jacket he coyly replies, 'it will all be off before the night is out - this is just the foreplay', and to the little girl offering him a flower: 'How old are you love. Nine? Well I can't do much for you then.' He shakes his body like a gorilla rattling his cage; thrusts forward on his crotch; and grinds like a corkscrew, surely to share old memories rather than to excite. With his cheerful wrinkly smile and his heavy winks, Tom Jones is totally the entertainer. Yet he could be much more. The voice is still mostly there, and just as exciting in the lower register. Sustained by a row of six glasses of water, and what look like mints, he belts out the ballads, rips off the rockers, and dusts down the old hits for two hours. The only thing missing is decent songs. The best are the new ones, written for him by Van Morrison. But there are too many vaguely Latin numbers which sound like the Romanian entry in the Song for Europe, while the rock and roll, which currently enlivens the show, is unconvincing pastiche. You enjoy Tom Jones' act. You like the man. You thrill to the crowd. But not for a moment do you relate to the music or the lyrics, or imagine that any genuine feeling inspires the songs. All the genuineness goes into the love-in between the star and the fans, their appreciation of a jolly rogue - and that is why the panties play is more important than the performance.</p>

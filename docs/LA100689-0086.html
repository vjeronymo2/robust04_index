			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL BOYARSKY: A LESSON IN THE POLITICS OF POWER  </P> <P> It was easy to see that Alan Robbins was plotting. He was biting his lower lip  and his eyes were narrowed, warning signs that the state senator was engaged in  serious business.  </P> <P> Robbins, a Democrat representing a conservative area of the San Fernando  Valley, was trying to revive a bill that meant much to him as the Legislature  moved toward adjournment. But he faced an obstacle, a fundamental rule of  politics: Power comes from the alliances you build, the friendships you make,  and the favors you do over a long period of time.  </P> <P> In this case, his obstacle was Assemblywoman Maxine Waters, who was trying to  defeat Robbins' bill. Her intensity was apparent from the way she confronted  Assemblyman Richard Katz on the Assembly floor and dragged him over to a  meeting with Speaker Willie Brown. As usual, she was combative, ready to work  out a deal with Brown after defying him on an issue a few minutes earlier.  </P> <P> Waters could do that because she was one of the handful of people who got Brown  elected Speaker several years ago. Since then, she has helped save his  speakership from frequent assaults and is one of the few whose advice he  trusts.  </P> <P> Robbins, on the other hand, operates without long-term allies. He is the  ultimate legislative loner -- smart, tough, crafty, keeping his plans to  himself. Because of those qualities, colleagues are wary.  </P> <P> The issue was a piece of legislation known as "The Bill That Won't Die," or  "The Freddie Krueger Bill," after the man they couldn't kill in "Nightmare on  Elm Street."  </P> <P> The measure had been defeated or vetoed in past sessions, but always was  revived. In fact, it had just been killed -- some thought -- two weeks before.  </P> <P> The bill would eliminate the Southern California Rapid Transit District and set  up a super agency to run transit. Robbins has long maintained that the RTD is  poorly run and has not served his suburban constituents well.  </P> <P> Waters' district is in South Los Angeles, in the predominantly black area south  of the Santa Monica Freeway. This is an urban, liberal, Democratic area.  </P> <P> The question of whether it's good or bad to reorganize the transit district  didn't really concern Waters. What worried her was the RTD bus drivers, many of  whom are black residents of South Los Angeles. To South LA, the RTD is a great  source of steady, well-paying jobs, and Waters did not want anyone messing with  that.  </P> <P> Suburbanites dominate the Los Angeles County legislative delegation. Republican  Gov. George Deukmejian is sympathetic to them. On this day, the word from the  Robbins camp was that the senator was gaining support.  </P> <P> With constituents' jobs at stake, Waters wanted to see the bill defeated. There  was no one else to do it. She constitutes just about all the political  influence South Los Angeles has in the Legislature. Political, personal and  legal troubles have weakened her colleagues.  </P> <P> Nor would there be much help from city officials. The RTD, with two board  members nervously waiting amid a crowd of lobbyists outside the legislative  chambers, were counting on Waters.  </P> <P> At midday, Robbins felt he had breathed enough life into the bill to bring it  before the Assembly Ways and Means Committee.  </P> <P> Waters began to fight. At 3:15 p.m. on the Assembly floor, she talked to Katz,  a sometimes Robbins ally and chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee,  and John Vasconcellos, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. She asked Katz  if he was part of the anti-RTD move. "He assured me he was not," Waters said.  </P> <P> The three of them got together on the Assembly floor with Speaker Brown. A  strategy was arranged. The bill would be killed in the Ways and Means  Committee. At 6 p.m., it was dead. "I don't see enough votes on my committee to  pass it," said Vasconcellos. "So I won't bring it up."  </P> <P> The swift and deadly blow was a graphic example of how political power in Los  Angeles depends on alliances in Sacramento. How much power does Maxine Waters  have? As much as she can obtain from her alliance with the Speaker. If Brown  goes, so goes her power.  </P> <P> Such power is tenuous, and that's what troubles urban political leaders  competing against the suburbs. Robbins, of course, will be back next year with  the same bill. He never gives up. That's the real lesson in political science.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- Japanese Foreign Minister  Koji Kakizawa denied press reports that Japan is passive about  sanctions against North Korea in his talks with President Kim  Yong-sam, presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said Saturday. Kim  met Kakizawa who flew into Seoul earlier and discussed North  Korea's nuclear situation, Chu said.    They agreed that the situation is at a critical point for  not  only South Korea and Japan but for the entire Northeast Asia and  the Pacific region in terms of peace and stability, the  spokesman said.    The Japanese foreign minister promised his country's utmost  efforts within the boundary of the Constitution to participate  in U.N. sanctions against North Korea, Chu said after the  Kim-Kakizawa talks.    "The foreign minister said Japan takes the problem as its  own  and explained he will deliver such stance when he visits China  and seek Beijing's cooperation in resolving the problem through  the United Nations," said Chu.    Kakizawa apologized for the controversial remarks by former  Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, who said Japan was not an  aggressor in World War II but just trying to free Asian colonies  from European grip. "It was wrong for former Minister Nagano to  say such nonsense and discomfort South Korea," he was quoted as  saying.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: NWA offers staff equity for wage cuts NORTHWEST Airlines, the indebted US carrier in which KLM Royal Dutch Airlines holds a minority share stake, yesterday offered its employees a 20 per cent equity interest in the company in return for substantial wage conces-sions. The company has been negotiating with representatives of the various labour unions and groups at Northwest. It said yesterday's proposal was 'the company's best offer for a revised compensation plan'. The lack of progress in the talks has prompted speculation that the airline might file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, although Northwest has denied any such intention. The carrier, the fourth largest in the US, said the labour cost reductions needed to be in force by the end of March. It asked labour leaders to agree to the plan by March 10. Northwest said it might 'fine-tune' its offer, but could not 'agree to material changes'. The company is asking contract employees - including its pilots, flight attendants and mechanics - for cost savings of about Dollars 883m over a three-year period. Management and non-contract employees would contribute Dollars 92m. The savings would come from wage reductions, employee contributions to medical and dental insurance plans, and holiday accrual rate reductions. In return, Northwest is offering employees a 20 per cent equity stake and three seats on a 15-strong board of directors. This would match the three representatives appointed by KLM, which would see its share stake diluted pro rata. Once the employee wage concessions are in place, Northwest will attempt a financial restructuring. If it has not obtained Dollars 500m of new permanent capital by the end of June 1995, the employees' stake could potentially increase to 51 per cent of the equity. PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines, has sent a revised restructuring plan to senior creditors and aircraft lessors which reduces the total prepayment of claims through the issue of rights to buy PWA common stock, Robert Gibbens reports from Montreal. The prepayment would be reduced from CDollars 506m (USDollars 400m) to CDollars 423m. Partly-secured creditors could also take prepayment in non-interest-bearing 10-year notes. Holders of PWA subordinated debt, preferred and common stock, would also receive warrants to buy additional PWA stock.</p>

The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. GSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) On December 13, 1991, the Commission approved, on a temporary basis through December 31, 1992, a rule change authorizing GSCC to implement a non-member, ``executing firm'' information feature as an enhancement to its comparison service. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  On December 23, 1992, the Commission extended its temporary approval of the executing firm feature until June 30, 1994. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30078 (December 12, 1991), 56 FR 66110. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31651 (December 23, 1992), 57 FR 62586. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 14, 1992, GSCC introduced the executing firm feature, which allows trade data to be submitted to GSCC by a member (the ``submitting member'') on behalf of a non-member firm (the ``executing firm'') that it clears for by adding two new fields to the comparison system: (1) The name of the executing party associated with the member; and (2) the name of the executing party associated with the contra-party member. If a submitting member that is a netting member so elects, a netting eligible trade that it has submitted on behalf of an executing firm may be included in the net, and the submitting member would be obligated to GSCC as regards such trade to the same degree as if it itself had executed such trade; therefore, such trade would be considered for purposes of calculating the submitting member's mark and margin requirements. However, an eligible trade submitted by a submitting member on behalf of an executing firm will not be included in the net if the submitting member has informed GSCC that it does not wish, because of the type of relationship that it has with the executing firm (i.e., it does not normally guarantee settlement of such firm's trades), to have the trades executed by such firm be netted and novated by GSCC . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Initially, participation in the executing firm feature was modest; however, participation has grown significantly over the past year. Currently, twelve GSCC members have agreements in place pursuant to which, collectively, they may submit data on trades executed by 271 non-members. GSCC expects that the number of submitting members and executing firms will continue to grow. GSCC has not experienced any operational or other problems with regard to the executing firm feature. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GSCC believes that the executing firm feature provides significant benefit to the government securities industry by improving reconciliation of unmatched trade data and, thus, providing the benefits of GSCC's comparison process to a broader range of trades. This feature allows access by a greater number of firms (who may otherwise be ineligible for direct membership in GSCC's netting system) to GSCC's netting and risk management services, including broker-dealers and institutional customers. The result is that, through the executing firm feature, a greater number of government securities trades are being margined, netted, and guaranteed by GSCC than would otherwise be the case. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

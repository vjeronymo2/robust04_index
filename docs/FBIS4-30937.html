			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 31 (BTA) -- The 19th Bulgarian-Korean  (DPRK) Commission for Economic and Technological Cooperation  ended here today with the signing of a protocol on the results  of the session and of an agreement for drafting treaties on  avoiding double taxation and reciprocal investment protection  and promotion. The two sides observed that the resumption of  the work of the commission (the 18th Bulgarian-Korean commission  was held in 1989), will improve bilateral trade and economic  relations and sci-technical cooperation, the chairmen of the two  sides of the commission -- Bulgarian Deputy Trade Minister Kiril  Velev and the deputy chairman of the Foreign Economic Relations  Committee of the DPRK Ku Bo Te [spelling of name as received] --  told a press conference.    An agreement was reached to cover Bulgaria's  4-million-transferable-ruble surplus in bilateral commercial  exchange by the end of 1995 with the import of raw materials and  consumer goods, Mr. Velev said. Mr. Te said that the Government  of the DPRK gives priority to foreign trade and to promoting and  developing trade and economic relations with Bulgaria.    Ms. Antoaneta Dincheva, expert at the "Countries in  Transition" Department at the Ministry of Trade, told BTA that  Bulgaria and the DPRK effected their payments in convertible  currency at the current international prices on the main  commodity exchanges. In June 1993 the two countries signed an  Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation in order to wind up  reciprocal payments in transferable rubles and granted each  other most-favoured-nation status. The DPRK is interested in  the export of raw materials for the Bulgarian silk industry, in  the import of machines and equipment for the light and food  processing industries, in cooperation in the production of  electric and I.C.E. [internal-combustion-engined] lift trucks,  as well as in the setting up in the DPRK of a joint enterprise  for the production of fireproof bricks. In the field of  agriculture the two sides showed interest in the exchange of  genetic material of animal and plant origin and the Bulgarian  side showed interest in importing silkworm grain [as received].    According to data of the Ministry of Trade, in 1993  bilateral  commercial exchange amounted to U.S.$6,343,100, which is  approximately 65 percent up from 1992 (U.S.$3,856,000). In 1991  this figure was U.S.$2,201,000. Bulgarian exports to the DPRK  totalled U.S.$4,282,100 and imports from the DPRK  U.S.$2,061,000. Last year the DPRK remained second among  Bulgaria's partners of the former socialist countries in Asia,  following China. Bulgarian exports to the DPRK comprise mainly  base metals, textile materials, machines and equipment,  transport devices, mineral and chemical products, and the  structure of Bulgarian imports from the DPRK is dominated by  textile raw materials, foodstuffs, cement products, plaster,  ceramics, glass, instruments, etc. In the first three months of  1994 commercial exchange between Bulgaria and the DPRK exceeded  U.S.$1,018,800.    The delegation of the DPRK had meetings at the Ministry of  Industry, the Agricultural Academy and with Deputy Prime  Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev. The next  joint Bulgarian-Korean commission is scheduled to be held in  1995 in Pyongyang.</p>

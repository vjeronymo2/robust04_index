			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nelson Mandela, president of the African </F> National Congress, ANC, by presenter Jon Snow on 24 January;  Mandela is in Johannesburg, Snow is in the London studio; from  the "Channel Four" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Snow] What message do you have for those voters who  are not your natural constituents?    [Mandela] It is perfectly reasonable that some people should  have reservations, but it is the task of our organization to put  our policy to them, explain it as fully as possible, and leave  it to them to decide. I am convinced that we have the best  policy in the country and that there is no other political  organization which has got a policy as progressive as we have, a  policy that takes into account the aspirations of all our  peoples and which is in a better position to address their basic  needs.    [Snow] Now, over the weekend President De Klerk has called  the ANC a party of violence that has lost control of its  supporters. This is pretty heavy stuff so early in the campaign.  Is there any truth in it?    [Mandela] Well, Mr. De Klerk is the last person to make that  accusation, because the task of maintaining law and order and  making sure that there is no violence is that of the government  of the country.    [Snow] The relationship between you has been very critical  in  order to get us to this point. Now that the campaign is  underway it sounds as if that relationship is already under very  great stress?    [Mandela] No, that is a misleading impression because we  have  never ceased to exchange views on matters of common interest.  This last week we have met twice and have had very fruitful  discussions. But in the course of the campaign it is likely that  we will say very cruel things about each other, but that does  not affect our ability to come together whenever it is necessary  to address the problems facing the country.    [Snow] Well, now can we look at what you are promising the  electorate. Let's first start on the question of violence.  What is the ANC going to do in government to try to contain  what is happening in the townships, particularly amongst young  people where it is practically out of control?    [Mandela] Well, again that is not a correct impression  because although the young people are angry and are justified in  being angry, they are at the same disciplined -- when you give  them a lead they listen and they follow. As for the question of  violence -- after a democratic government has been installed, a  government which has state power and which has got the will to  put an end to the violence will receive the support of the  population. Our problem is that we are dealing with a lame duck  president and government who is completely weak, and unruly  elements have taken advantage of that.    [Snow] On the economic front, Mr. Mandela, the ANC has a  close relationship with the Communist Party of South Africa; it  has talked of nationalization, of redistribution in the past.  What is the economic policy briefly to be?    [Mandela] Well, I think as far as the question of the  Communist Party is concerned, that is a nonissue as far as we  are concerned. We are not even prepared to discuss it. As far  as our economic policy is concerned we are not following any  particular model. Our concern is to have sufficient resources  to address the basic needs of our people, like the high level of  unemployment, lack of housing, education, and medical  facilities, electricity, lack of running water, roads -- all  those things. Any particular strategy which will enable us to  address these problems we will adopt.    [Snow] Well, now can I just touch upon what happens with  Winnie Mandela after the election. She is very well placed to  get a good cabinet position in the post-independent government,  in the multiracial government. What kind of reassurances can  you give people -- given that she has had to face such serious  charges under the old regime?    [Mandela] She is a very popular figure and I think that any  government when it decides on allocating portfolio's will  consider the influence which a particular individual commands.    [Snow] Well, can I just ask you finally about yourself. we  are talking at six o'clock in the morning. I gather you have  been up already for an hour and a half, obviously you are  extremely fit but an enormous amount depends on you. This is  going to be a most exhausting campaign.    [Mandela] Well, as soon as I have finished with this  interview I am going to take my coat and walk to the game  reserve. That is where I am going to relax for the next five  days. We are trying to find opportunities, in the midst of a  very heavy program, of relaxing and resting, and I think that  will enable me to go through some of the strenuous assignments  which I would be given during the next three months.    [Snow] I gather that before we talked this morning you have  already been through a regime which is pretty similar to that  which you used to undertake in prison?    [Mandela] Well, I was explaining just the other day that  this  is something that is part of our system, not because I have  wanted to but because of the experiences I have had, and to that  extent I am grateful that I am able to get up as early as  possible and do some solid work before others start.    [Snow] Do you not feel terribly exhausted at the end of the  day?    [Mandela] There are days, of course, when I do feel tired,  but generally speaking at the end of the day I have got a  feeling of accomplishment that I have done a good day's work  which has been productive and that is very inspiring indeed, and  you go back feeling that your day has been worthwhile, and you  have done some good for the country and for your people.    [Snow] They say you are 76 -- it is hard to believe. How old  do you feel?    [Mandela] Well, they say that old age is part of your  spirit,  and if you think you are young you will naturally feel young, if  you feel you are old and defeated you will feel old and aged.  And I try to think I am younger than I am.</p>

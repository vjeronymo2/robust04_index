At this event, he delivered a speech  which read in part :    `It has been only a year since our first meeting in  Canberra,  but we have every reason to be satisfied with the rapid  development of the multi-sided Vietnam-Australia cooperation,  especially in the economic, trading, educational and training  fields. We greatly appreciate Australia's active help to us in  building a North-South 500 KV grid, a nearly-completed important  project in our national construction. We also highly value the  effective implementation of the Australian aid to train  Vietnamese officials, as well as Australia's active contribution  to a break-through in the relations between Vietnam and the  international financial institutions.    `I am optimistic about the prospect for the development of  friendly and cooperative relationship between our two countries.  Despite thousands of miles separating us and the difference in  historical circumstances and cultural traditions between Vietnam  and Australia, both of us have been looking towards the Pacific  and identifying ourselves with the common desire for an expanded  regional cooperation.    `We are satisfied with the results of the open and frank  exchanges of talks between us today. We are convinced that the  agreement between us in many fields will contribute to further  consolidation and development of the on-going fine cooperation  between Vietnam and Australia'.    Prime Minister Paul Keating, for his part, said:    `The effect of the changes you have introduced, combined  with  the skill and enterprise of the Vietnamese people, have brought  this country high levels of economic growth and have opened up  new opportunities for our bilateral relationship. Australia,  too, has been through a process of 'economic renovation'. We  have opened our industry to competition and our economy to the  world.    `I know, Mr Prime Minister, how difficult the task can be.  But, like you, I also know how large are the rewards for our  countries at the end of the process.    `And, like Vietnam Australia is also seeking closer links  with our region not only economically but culturally,  politically and strategically as well.    These parallel interests are creating unprecedented new  opportunities for us.    Trade between Australia and Vietnam in 1982 was 2 million  dollars. In 1993 it was 366 million dollars.    Australia is now Vietnam's third largest foreign investor,  with nearly 800 million dollars invested here.    We are also developing new avenues for cooperation on  regional issues.    And Vietnam can count on warm support from Australia as you  move towards greater involvement in regional organisations.    Bilaterally, we are finding new opportunities to work  together.    `I was also pleased to be able to tell you today, Mr Prime  Minister, that Australia has committed more than 200 million  dollars in a new four-year aid program, which we hope will cover  areas such as education, health, infrastructure and legal  training.</p>

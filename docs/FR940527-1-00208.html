			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;A discretionary adjustment factor of ^0.4 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> composed of an allowance of 0.3 percent for scientific and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technological advancement and an allowance of ^0.7 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for productivity improvement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An adjustment for case-mix change of 0.0 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A differential update of 3.1 percent for hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located in rural areas to reflect the phasing out of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differential in the standardized amounts between rural and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other urban hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Overall, the net increase employing the above factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is the percentage increase in the hospital market basket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minus 1.5 percentage points for urban hospitals and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market basket percentage increase plus 1.6 percentage points  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for rural hospitals. Based on the market basket rate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase estimate of 3.7 percent used in its March 1, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report, ProPAC recommends that urban hospitals receive a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.2 percent update and rural hospitals receive a 5.3 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> update.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: We are recommending an update that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the Administration's budget proposal and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i) of the Act, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended by section 13501(a) of Public Law 103&hyph;66. Our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendation is that: 1) the average update for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment system hospitals located in urban areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for FY 1995 be equal to market basket rate of increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forecast minus 2.5 percentage points, 2) the update to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rural standardized amounts be sufficient to equate the rural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the other urban standardized amounts. Based on HCFA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current forecast of the market basket rate of increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3.6 percent), we recommend an update for FY 1995 for urban  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals equal to 1.1 percent (the market basket rate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase minus 2.5 percentage points), and for rural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals equal to 8.4 percent (the market basket percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase plus 4.8 percentage points). Under these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations, we now estimate that the average update for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all prospective payment system hospitals would be the market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basket minus 1.4 percentage points, or approximately 2.2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent. As we have explained in section II of the Addendum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to this proposed rule, our recommended updates would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied to the unadjusted FY 1994 standardized payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts. That is, the FY 1994 standardized payment amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in our September 1, 1993 final rule (at 58 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 46362) would be increased to remove the effects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments made for outliers and geographic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassification before the recommended updates would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our recommendation is supported by the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses that measure changes in hospital productivity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientific and technological advances, practice pattern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes, and changes in case mix:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Productivity:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Service level productivity is defined as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ratio of total service output to full time equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees (FTEs). While we recognize that productivity is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function of many variables (for example, labor, non-labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material and capital inputs), we use a labor productivity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure in our framework, since the current update framework  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applies to operating payment. To recognize that we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apportioning the short run output changes to the labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> input, we weight our productivity measure for operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs by the appropriate share of labor input to total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating input to determine the expected effect on cost per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our recommendation for the service productivity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component is based on historical trends in productivity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total output for both the hospital industry and the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economy, and projected levels of future hospital service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> output. ProPAC has also estimated cumulative service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> productivity growth to be 4.9 percent from 1985&hyph;1989 or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.2 percent annually. At the same time, they estimate total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service growth at 3.4 percent annually, implying a ratio of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service productivity growth to output growth of 0.35. Our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MedPAR analysis indicates total Medicare service output  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (charges per admission, adjusted for CPI change) increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20.9 percent from 1985&hyph;1993, or an approximate average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual increase of 2.4 percent. Since it is not possible at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this time to develop a productivity measure specific to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare patients, we examined productivity (output per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hour) and output (gross domestic product) for the economy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Depending on the exact time period, annual changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> productivity range from 0.3 to 0.35 of the change in output  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (that is, a 1.0 percent increase in output would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correlated with an 0.3 to 0.35 percent change in output per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hour).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under our framework, the recommended update is based in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part on expected productivity_that is, projected service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> output during the year multiplied by the historical ratio of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service productivity to total service output, multiplied by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the share of labor in total operating inputs, as calculated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the hospital market basket rate of increase. This method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates an expected labor productivity improvement in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same proportion to expected total service growth that has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurred in the past and assumes that, at a minimum, growth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in FTEs changes proportionally to the growth in total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service output. Thus, the recommendation allows for unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> productivity to be smaller than the historical averages in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years that output growth is relatively low, and higher in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years that output growth is larger than the historical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trend. Based on the above estimates from both the hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry and the economy, we have chosen to employ the range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ratios of productivity change to output change of 0.30 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.35.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Defending Sudanese troops ran out of ammunition and abandoned the southern  garrison town of Nasir, besieged by rebels for more than nine months, the  army's general command said. A statement said that more than 1,700 army and  rebel troops were killed or wounded in the siege of the Upper Nile town. The  official Sudan News Agency said that Col. Mahjoub Mohammed Yousif, commander of  the garrison, was among those killed. The statement said government troops were  forced to withdraw after bad weather interrupted air drops of much-needed  ammunition and supplies. The fall of Nasir is seen as a major blow to the  Khartoum government in the five-year-old civil war in the south.  </P></p>

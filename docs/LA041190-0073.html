			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GRAF RETURNS, SCORES THUMBS-UP VICTORY  </P> <P> Steffi Graf, sidelined since breaking her right thumb on Feb. 6, said she felt  fine Tuesday and needed only 45 minutes to beat Petra Langrova, 6-1, 6-0, in  the Bausch &amp; Lomb Championships at Amelia Island, Fla.  </P> <P> The world's top-ranked women's player said the thumb, broken in a skiing  accident in Switzerland, was not a problem and predicted the layoff will help  her in the long run.  </P> <P> "I missed maybe two or three tournaments, but I don't think it hurts me at  all," Graf said. "I felt good being away. It should keep me fresh for other  tournaments."  </P> <P> The match was the first for Graf since Feb. 4, when she beat Arantxa Sanchez  the final of the Pan Pacific Open in Japan. Two days later, Graf fell on her  right hand trying to evade photographers at St. Moritz, Switzerland. She  originally hadn't planned to return until April 30, but the thumb healed  quicker than expected.  </P> <P> Also, Graf has lost to Gabriela Sabatini in this tournament each of the last  two years. Sabatini defeated Claudia Kohde-Kilsch, 6-2, 6-1, in their  second-round match.  </P> <P> "It's a tournament where I haven't done as I have in others, but I lost twice  with Gabriela playing above her level," Graf said. "I want to (win) this time."  </P> <P> Graf said it took hours of practice to regain command of her game. At times  during the layoff, she said, she played left-handed because of stiffness in her  right wrist.  </P> <P> "It took days to hit my first backhand," she said. "It took me days to hit my  first overhand, the first volley. It was kind of funny, but it was good because  there was always something new to be happy about."  </P> <P> Other second-round winners included No. 4 Zina Garrison, 6-3, 6-7 (7-1), 6-0  over Barbara Romano; No. 5 Natalia Zvereva, 6-2, 6-2, over Ann Grossman, and  No. 8 Gretchen Magers, 6-1, 6-4, over Camille Benjamin.  </P> <P> Martin Jaite of Argentina, seeded No. 2, beat West German Markus Zoecke, 6-1,  7-6 (7-1), to advance to the third round of the Count of Godo tournament at  Barcelona, Spain. Carlos Costa of Barcelona upset ninth-ranked Petr Korda of  Czechoslovakia, 6-3, 2-6, 6-2, and eighth-seeded Thomas Muster of Austria lost  to Goran Prpic, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2.  </P></p>

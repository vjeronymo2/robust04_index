			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the non-signer provisions, no peanuts may be sold or otherwise disposed of for human consumption if the peanuts fail to meet the quality requirements of the Agreement. Regulations to implement Pub. L. 101&hyph;220 were issued and made effective on December 4, 1990 [55 FR 49980] and amended several times thereafter, and are published in 7 CFR part 997. All such amendments were made to ensure that the non-signer handling requirements remain consistent with modifications to the handling requirements applied to signatory handlers under the Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Law 103&hyph;66 (107 Stat. 312), enacted August 10, 1993, provides for mandatory assessment of farmer's stock peanuts acquired by non-signatory peanut handlers. Under this law, paragraph (b) of section 1001, of the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1993, specifies that: (1) Any assessment (except indemnification assessments) imposed under the Agreement on signatory handlers also shall apply to non-signatory handlers, and (2) such assessment shall be paid to the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule will add new permanent &sect;997.51 Assessments to Part 997_Provisions Regulating the Quality of Domestically Produced Peanuts Handled by Persons Not Subject to the Peanut Marketing Agreement. Notice of the actual assessment rate established for each crop year will be issued as a new section as an Implementing Regulation beginning with &sect;997.100 Assessment rate, and be sequentially numbered each succeeding year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee meets in February or March each year and recommends to the Secretary a per ton, administrative assessment of Segregation 1, farmers stock peanuts received or acquired by signatory handlers for the upcoming crop year. The crop year covers the 12-month period from July 1 to June 30. The Committee met on March 16, 1994, and unanimously recommended a $.60 administrative assessment per ton of 1994&hyph;95 crop year Segregation 1 peanuts handled by those handlers who are signatory to the Agreement. The Department has initiated rulemaking procedures to implement such an administrative assessment on signatory handlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, pursuant to Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, this interim final rule provides notice that the Department will assess non-signatory handlers a $.60 administrative assessment per net ton of Segregation 1 farmers stock peanuts for the 1994&hyph;95 crop year. The assessment will be based on:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Tonnage reported on incoming inspection certificates of each handler's Segregation 1 farmers stock peanuts received or acquired for the handler's account and (2) tonnage reported on FV&hyph;117 ``Weekly Report of Uninspected Farmers Stock Seed Peanuts Received for Custom Seed Shelling.'' For example, in 1994&hyph;95, a handler who receives or acquires 100,000 tons of Segregation 1 farmers stock peanuts will pay an assessment of $60.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment will be applied to peanuts intended for human consumption and peanuts intended for non-human consumption outlets such as seed, oilstock and animal feed. The assessment will be applied to peanuts received or acquired for a handler's account, including the handler's own production. Assessment will not be applied on Segregation 1 peanut lots received or acquired by a handler from other handlers or from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) program received for non-edible use, or lots received on behalf of an area association pursuant to warehousing services (&sect;997.20(a)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment will be applied, pro rata, on non-signatory handlers who perform handling functions defined in &sect;997.14. Handling is defined as engaging in the receiving or acquiring, cleaning and shelling, cleaning inshell, or crushing of peanuts and in the shipment (except as a common or contract carrier of peanuts owned by another) or sale of cleaned inshell or shelled peanuts or other activity causing peanuts to enter the current of commerce. Handling does not include the sale or delivery of peanuts by a producer to a handler or to an intermediary person engaged in delivering peanuts to handlers and the sale or delivery of peanuts by such intermediary to a handler.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 997.15 defines a non-signatory handler as any person who handles peanuts, in a capacity other than that of a custom cleaner or dryer, and assembler, a warehouse person or other intermediary between the producer and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-signatory handler.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Speculators, brokers, or other entities who take possession of Segregation 1 farmers stock peanuts, submit such peanuts for incoming inspection, and subsequently enter such peanuts into the channels of commerce will pay assessments on such peanuts. Entities who receive or acquire farmers stock peanuts for the purpose of custom seed shelling will be assessed on the basis of Form FV&hyph;117 ``Weekly Report of Uninspected Farmers Stock Seed Peanuts Received for Custom Seed Shelling.'' Form FV&hyph;117 is currently required from such entities. Producer/handlers who store peanuts of their own production (farm-stored peanuts) will, at some point prior to further handling, obtain incoming inspection on such peanuts and, at that time, pay the pro-rata administrative assessment on such peanuts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only one administrative assessment will be applied to any lot of farmers stock peanuts. Non-signatory and signatory handlers will not pay an administrative assessment on a lot which they purchase from speculators, brokers or other such entities who have already paid an administrative assessment on the lot.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A crop year's original assessment could be increased by the Secretary based on a similar increase applied by the Secretary on signatory handlers. Such an increase will be applied on all peanuts first handled by non-signatory handlers during the crop year in which the increased assessment occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Peanuts will be assessed based on the rate applicable to the crop year in which the lot is presented for incoming inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Senior Chinese official  Li Tieying today awarded the top prize to the film "Phoenix  Zither" in this year's government film awards.    The movie depicts a group of rural teachers who persist in  opening classes for dozens of poor children in a mountain area.  The movie has moved audiences to tears in many Chinese cities.    Li is a member of the Political Bureau of the Central  Committee of the Chinese Communist Party as well as a state  councillor.    The film represents a group of works depicting heroes among  the common people. This category of arts is likely to go over  big here and is largely advocated by the government.    These works mostly center on humble figures who have the  same  life problems as the audience or readers. But they always find  it a pleasure to assist others, give no thought to personal  gains or losses, and help others restore confidence in life.    Other prize-winning films fall into the categories of  historical events or ethnic issues, for example, "Chongqing  Negotiations", which rehashes the historical meeting of Mao  Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek.    Several children's films, documentary films, cartoon films  and translated films were also given awards.    In addition, the film bureau recognized a feature film set  in  the securities market and co-produced by the Chinese mainland  and Hong Kong.    The government-controlled contest was first staged in 1957  but was suspended during the "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976)  when film production came to an almost complete halt. The  contest was revived in the 1980s.    It reflects the government's guidelines on film production.  In addition to the government film event, there are now two  other major film contests in China. In the "Golden Rooster  Awards," top works are selected by movie experts and  professionals. Prizes in the "One Hundred Flowers Awards" are  voted on by film audiences.</p>

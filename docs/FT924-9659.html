			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (3): Non-investors lose ground - Textiles are the largest export, but a two-tier industry is developing A STROLL down one of Thessaloniki's main shopping streets reveals the strength of the local textile and clothing industry. Boutiques displaying imported labels are vastly outnumbered by windows filled with Greek-made fabrics and garments. From the automated weaving plants of large manufacturers in countryside towns to the basement workshops in Thessaloniki's poorer neighbourhoods, the industry employs more than 40 per cent of Macedonia's workforce. Over 4,000 companies, about one-third of the industry total, are based in the region. Production is strongly export-oriented, with over 70 per cent of local companies selling abroad. Germany is much the largest market for both fabrics and ready-wear. 'Northern Greek companies cannot compete on price with the Asian garment-makers. But they are well placed to carry out smaller 'repeat' orders for big German traders, having acquired a reputation for good quality-control and punctuality in meeting delivery dates,' says Mr Rigas Tzelepoglou, a Thessaloniki-based management consultant. Greece's textile industry developed rapidly from the 1970s, thanks to increased output of locally grown cotton and low labour costs. Import tariffs, together with substantial export subsidies, provided an additional stimulus for expansion. Northern Greece attracted textile companies keen to take advantage of government incentives for industrial investment outside Athens, as well as the lower cost of labour in the north of the country, while transport from Thessaloniki for companies exporting to northern Europe was also cheaper at that time. After joining the European Community, Greece was no longer subject to quotas for textile exports; but, on the other hand, was obliged to phase out both tariffs and the export subsidy system that had kept less efficient manufacturers comfortably afloat. Meanwhile, competitiveness started to erode as labour costs moved steadily higher. Textiles are still Greece's largest export, earning Dollars 1.8bn last year. But a two-tier industry has emerged, with a widening gulf between successful companies, maintaining competitiveness through continuous investment, and manufacturers who are rapidly losing ground through their inability to renew machinery and equipment. 'We've gone from a labour-intensive to a capital-intensive business. To compete, you have to renovate equipment, organise better and keep on improving quality and customer service,' says Mr Christos Accas, managing director of Hellenic Fabrics, the largest Greek textile group with annual turnover of Dr30bn (Pounds 97.3m). Unlike most Greek textile companies, the group is both vertically and horizontally integrated, running a cotton-ginning plant near Thessaloniki and manufacturing yarns, fabric and garments. Its largest unit is an integrated spinning and weaving mill, which produces denim for the jeans industry, mainly for export. 'There is still room for expansion: after all, we produce one of the best cottons. But it's hard to keep reducing production costs, and the industry as a whole is gradually losing competitiveness. There are going to be big problems in the future,' Mr Accas says. According to some analysts, up to 50 per cent of Greek textile producers and garment-makers are likely to go out of business over the next few years. Competition from the eastern European countries is expected to grow, with new spinning and weaving mills being set up to take advantage of cheap labour and proximity to the German market. Yet garment-makers are likely to be hardest-hit. Three-quarters of Greek ready-wear manufacturing is done by small family units with five or fewer employees. There are only 24 companies that employ more than 200 workers. The focus on small-scale production based on imported patterns gave little scope for developing Greek-produced designs. As a result, Greek garment-makers have been unable to create products with brand names or build sales networks abroad. Until recently, the flexibility of small producers enabled them to keep on winning orders from abroad. But rising costs and aggressive competition from Spain and Turkey are making things difficult at a time when domestic demand is shrinking. For the moment, companies in Thessaloniki, where some 40 per cent of Greek garment-makers are based, seem to be holding on to customers more successfully than in the south of the country, according to local exporters. However, the industry now faces an additional problem as a result of the government's efforts to tighten exchange-rate policy, pegging the drachma more firmly to the Deutsche Mark and slowing the depreciation rate against other European currencies. 'Devaluation of the peseta and the lira is going to have adverse effects on our competitiveness. The export market has been getting more difficult, and now the drachma is overvalued by at least 10 per cent,' says Mr George Athanassiades, of Hellenic Pella Mills, a yarn-producer. With spinning mills facing slackening demand for ordinary cotton yarns, Mr Athanassiades has switched to making yarns that combine cotton with acrylic and polyester fibres, and coloured yarns. He says his company has spent Dr650m on new investment in the past three years, mostly out of its own funds. Mr Athanassiades has also diversified into importing, becoming the agent for Adidas shoes and athletic wear in Greece. He says: 'Continuous investment is important in this business, If you slip behind, you can't meet demand for better quality. But it's also important to reduce risk - and sales of brand name products in Greece are healthy.'</p>

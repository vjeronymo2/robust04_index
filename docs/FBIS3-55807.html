			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Jan 11, BNS -- The NATO summit in  Brussels gave the countries of Eastern Europe the maximum of  security guarantees NATO could go for at the moment, said Clyde  Kull, the Estonian ambassador in Brussels.    The statements by NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner and  U.S. President Bill Clinton, both favorable of the security  interests of Eastern Europe "were the maximum we could have,"  Kull told a BNS correspondent.    Woerner said NATO's message to the new democracies of  Central  and Eastern Europe was one and the same: the countries won't be  left on their own luck. "If we admit new members to NATO, this  must help to stabilize Europe and not to divide it once again,"  he said.    NATO leaders in the summit offered the nations of Eastern  Europe cooperation under the "Partnership for Peace" program.  The program gives the region no binding security guarantees, but  NATO under the scheme would accept the obligation to engage in  security consultations with countries participating in the  program, if the country feels its security threatened.    Kull said he regarded NATO members as ready to "go rather  far" in case the security of countries involved in the program  was threatened. But he added that the alliance was likely to  abstain from military intervention, but use "strong political  means of influence" instead.    The Estonian ambassador said preparations for the NATO  summit  had taken place under heavy pressure from the Eastern Europe. He  said the pressure had contributed to entering some new clauses  into the final document of the meeting, such as the words that  the NATO "doors are open."    Kull was sure that NATO and the Western countries were  interested in the Baltics as a possible sphere of interest.    "It is absolutely clear that a policy of dividing the  spheres  of interest is under way in Europe," Kull said. "Also Russian  Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev has said that Russia has  geopolitical interests, which are determined by the borders of  the former Soviet Union. If it is not Russia that has its  influence there, someone else will fill the place," Kull quoted  Kozyrev as saying.    But Kull also said the interest of the West in the Baltic  region could be described as economic and social rather than  military and political.</p>

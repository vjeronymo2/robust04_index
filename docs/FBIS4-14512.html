			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Golotyuk under the "Property" rubric: </F> "Struggle Flares Up in Moldova for the 14th Russian Army's  Legacy." Tiraspol Wants Its Share on a Par With Chisinau"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Moldavia [Moldova] has  instantly reacted to Tiraspol's "legislative initiative." A  report quickly circulated through ITAR-TASS channels speaks of  the fact that "Lieutenant General Aleksandr Lebed, commander of  the 14th Russian Army in the Dniester Region, has ordered his  soldiers and officers to resolutely cut short, even with the use  of weapons, any attempts to attack the facilities and personnel  of the Army." This was allegedly done "in connection with the  latest increasingly frequent cases of attacks on servicemen and  threats of violence against them and members of their families  from armed mafia-like groupings operating with the tacit  approval of the Dniester Region authorities."    Our correspondent was told at the Russian Federation Defense  Ministry and the main staff of the ground troops that there have  been no reports coming from the Dniester Region about a  worsening situation around 14th Army subunits. On the contrary,  there have been of late no cases of attacks on servicemen or  Army facilities. As for "cutting short any attempts to attack  the facilities and personnel of the Army," the servicemen must  do that in accordance with service regulations, and with the use  of weapons if need be. Thus, there is nothing new in it. The  report from Chisinau must have been most probably "timed" to  coincide with the eighth round of talks between Moldavia and  Russia.    Chisinau continues to insist on a speedy pullout from the  Dniester Region of 14th Army units. The more radically minded  politicians in the Moldovan leadership demand that this be done  before the end of this summer. Moscow maintains that this is  virtually impossible. It is in order to "press" the Russian  military into making the decision sooner that Chisinau wants a  worsening of the situation around the 14th Army units or at  least a semblance of such a worsening.</p>

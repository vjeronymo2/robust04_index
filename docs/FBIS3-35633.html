The participants worked  out the trade union association's tactics in the election  campaign and considered VOST's participation in the election.  VOST Chairman Oleksandr Dzhulyk provided data on the membership  organizations and the situation around VOST, pointing out that  interference in the affairs of VOST on the part of alien forces  (parties and organizations) was inadmissible. The Coordinating  Council indicated that the main task VOST is concentrating its  efforts on is the protection of the social and economic  interests of the working people. VOST's platform is based on  the principles of the struggle for a mighty, united,  law-governed, independent, and prosperous Ukraine for mutually  advantageous and equal relations with all the countries of the  world. The Coordinating Council participants made a decision on  VOST members participation in ensuring proper control during the  election.    The Coordinating Council also considered the economic  situation at the enterprises of Ukraine and discussed the issue  on concluding collective agreements, salaries, and protection of  labor. The participants pointed out that VOST favors the market  economy, which includes privatization on a nation-wide scale,  emancipation of peasants, state support to the strategic  industries, private farming, development of spirituality,  education, and culture, a reform of the political system and a  reform of the insurance system (medical, social, and pension  insurance with the compulsory insurance of the employer and the  hired employee.)</p>

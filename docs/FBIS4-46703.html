			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with L. Pavlikova, deputy economics minister of </F> Ukraine, by T. Mayboroda; place and date not given: "The  Invisible Being Acquires a Face or the Deposit Privatization  Certificate Becomes a Paper Voucher"]    [Text] There is not long to wait: in another three to four  months the citizens of Ukraine, just as the Russians at one  time, will get vouchers--privatization papers which will be  simpler for them to handle than special-purpose savings bank  deposit accounts in becoming owners of an appropriate share of  state property. The Ukrainian variant of the voucher is a type  of coupon which can be exchanged directly for shares in the  desired subject of privatization or a privatization  intermediary-investor who guarantees you decent dividends.    Such intermediaries have already appeared in our country and  their numbers will grow together with the competition, on the  crest of which potential investors will, naturally, make all  manner of promises. In such a situation, dear fellow citizens,  you must try not to make a bad deal, listen carefully, delve  into every detail, first becoming acquainted with the economic  file of the enterprise whose shares you decide to acquire in  return for the vouchers or of the intermediary to whom you  decided to entrust their investment. We requested Lada  Pavlikovskskaya, deputy economics minister of Ukraine to explain  certain aspects of the forthcoming "voucherization".    [Mayboroda] Lada Anatolyevna, everyone knows that in Russia  it was possible to sell the vouchers, exchange them for  something, give them as a gift, and so on. Why will that be  impossible in Ukraine?    [Pavlikovskaya] Practice has indicated the low effectiveness  of such a "primary" securities market. In addition to that this  required quite a lot of time. That is why we decided not to  release the voucher on the market. This privatization paper in  itself will not be the subject of purchase or sale, but,  exchanging it into shares, the citizen will be able to dispose  of it as he sees fit--sell them, give them as gifts, or exchange  them.    [Mayboroda] The editor receives many letters complaining  about the supposedly very low nominal value of our property  certificate--the voucher. It is impossible to purchase very much  both for its initial price--30,000 karbovantsy or its current  price which is slightly over a million.    [Pavlikovskaya] Yes, I am aware of that widespread  misconception. One, however, should not equate the nominal value  of the voucher with its real price on the market. The figure  designated on it is merely a part (in valuational expression for  a certain period) of the 70 percent of state property subject to  privatization, amounting to the share of each citizen of  Ukraine. On the securities market, under favorable conditions,  it will be possible to obtain shares for the voucher the real  price of which will possibly be measured in more than one  million karbovantsy.    [Mayboroda] Will it be possible to invest one's voucher in  housing?    [Pavlikovskaya] We provided for the possibility of  converting  a privatization certificate and a housing check. Three  concurrent types of securities were envisioned for the country:  a certificate for privatization of state enterprises, a check  for privatization of housing and a bond for land privatization.  We now have two types of securities and they exist in the form  of the deposit account. The privatization certificate--1,000,050  karbovantsy and the housing check--12,000 karbovantsy. It is  true a problem did occur which we are yet to resolve--the  "weight" of the nonindexed housing check proved to be less than  that of the certificate by a factor of almost a hundred.  Therefore I would advise waiting until the problem with  indexation is resolved which will be accomplished in the very  near future. As far as the land bond is concerned, that issue,  in principle, remains open because the mechanism for mass-scale  privatization of land has not yet been worked out by Ukrainian  legislators.    [Mayboroda] In Russia vouchers were in circulation for quite  a long period. In June of this year their acceptance from  citizens is coming to an end, according to available  information. What sort of deadlines are we going to have?    [Pavlikovskaya] In accordance with the privatization program  the certificate expires in 1994. A few days ago, however, a  decree of the president of Ukraine was published concerning the  introduction of privatization property certificates into  circulation, in accordance with which prior to 31 January 1995  citizens will be able to use both the noncash deposit accounts  and the cash property certificates, and then, after 31 December  1996, only the cash vouchers.    By the way, many of our countrymen have already utilized  their privatization accounts in the Savings Bank. A new list of  150 enterprises being privatized was published recently.  Therefore for those who have already made their selection, there  is no need at all to wait for the appearance of the paper  voucher.    [Mayboroda] We make frequent use of the market experience  gained by Russia. It would be good to learn more often from the  mistakes of others and not our own. Have our economists  extracted certain lessons from voucher privatization conducted  by the neighbors?    [Pavlikovskaya] Recently a group of Ukrainian specialists of  the Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Economy, the State  Property Fund, and the Savings Bank visited Moscow and Syktyvkar  specifically for the purpose of familiarizing themselves with  the massive privatization at the center and in various regions  of Russia.    We noted a sufficiently successful coordination of these  processes and good organization in the conduct of auctions. I  think that the check auction centers, and centers for acceptance  of bids from citizens and sale of shares are in essence being  organized by us as well.    We intend to improve the computer network, however, by  comparison with the Russian one. All-Russia auctions are  currently under way in Moscow where shares of industrial giants  are offered for sale. Bids for these shares arrive from the  periphery whereas residents in the capital take practically no  interest in regional sales.    If possible we would like to allow a resident, for instance,  of Odessa to effectively participate in an auction conducted in  Lvov or Donetsk through the computer network.    [Mayboroda] That would be an expensive luxury.    [Pavlikovskaya] Yes. Such a network would not be cheap. We  are however, counting on the support and technical assistance of  the American Development Agency which, by the way, is already  helping us with the production of cash vouchers.</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRADE ASSISTANCE  </P> <P> In regard to "U.S. Agency Has Line on the East Block" (World Report, Sept. 18),  I commend the author on the article, but I find it to be a serious oversight  not to mention that the district office of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial  Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce, located at 11000 Wilshire, Room  9200 in the Federal Building in Westwood, would be the first point of contact  for U.S. exporters and investors in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> The professional staff of International Trade Specialists located here is  prepared to provide advice and counsel on doing business in Europe, Eastern  Europe or anywhere in the world.  </P> <P> We do refer entrepreneurs and exporters to country desk officers and other  experts in Washington headquarters of the U.S. Department of Commerce, but we  can do a lot here in Los Angeles. Our primary goal is to promote U.S. exports.  </P> <P> MARK A. WEAVER  </P> <P> International Trade Specialist  </P> <P> U.S. Department of Commerce  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

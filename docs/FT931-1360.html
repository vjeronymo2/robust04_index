			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Caracas budget deficit set to fall VENEZUELA'S public sector deficit was expected to fall from 3.4 per cent of GDP from more than 6 per cent last year, Mr Ricardo Hausmann, minister of planning, said yesterday. The deficit is being reduced through a series of measures, including cuts in state spending and increased charges for public services. Pressure on the beleaguered government of president Carlos Andres Perez has prompted further efforts this year to reduce official spending and boost revenues. This is in spite of government promises in its original budget of real cuts of about 20 per cent in public spending. Taxes and royalties on petroleum exports, which are the main source of the Venezuelan government's revenues, have fallen dramatically in recent years as exports have declined. At the same time, the Venezuelan Congress has failed to approve two long-standing administration proposals for new taxes (a value added tax and a tax on assets). Congress convened special sessions early this year to consider the tax bills and other issues. The special sessions ended and the ordinary term has begun, but the bills still have not been approved. Congressmen and senators - facing elections in December - appear to be worried that their already low levels of popularity would be worsened by the imposition of new taxes. The Perez administration is also hoping it can raise extra revenues this year from its privatisation programme, which was stalled last year by two attempted coups and months of political turmoil. The government raised over Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) with 19 privatisations from 1990 to 1992. This year alone it hopes to raise a further Dollars 2bn from the sale of some important assets, including electric power companies and an airline.</p>

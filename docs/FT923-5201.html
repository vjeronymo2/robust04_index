			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (26): Four-nation headache - Europe's fighter is stalled by loss of German support THE European Fighter Aircraft was to have been the centrepiece of this year's Farnborough show, with a flying display. The aircraft will still be a central talking point, although not in the way that was intended. If development plans had kept to schedule, the first EFA prototype would have made its maiden flight in Germany about six months ago. But the fighter was not destined to become airborne with its original Anglo-German-Italian-Spanish partnership arrangements still intact. The German government's decision not to proceed in the programme to build the aircraft in its current form beyond the development phase was long anticipated. Less expected was its proposal, sprung on the other partners late in the day, to replace the project with a new, more modest aircraft with French participation. Bonn's opt-out, based on grounds of cost and changed military requirements, was largely a political calculation - a sacrifice to the new mood of united Germany, reflecting the negative image the project has suffered in that country and the lack of sufficient parliamentary support for it outside Bavaria, the region most industrially involved in the programme. German industry, with a prime role in the aircraft's fly-by-wire system and responsible for its centre fuselage and fin and rudder assemblies, was as committed as Britain's to the project, with jobs no less at stake. However, German failure to secure leadership of major EFA contracts such as the radar and electronic warfare systems led to its being viewed as a 'British' aircraft. It was inevitable that Germany's decision should raise questions in the UK about the wisdom of the whole project. The UK Ministry of Defence, which had to face a grilling by Mrs Margaret Thatcher on the justifications for EFA back in 1988 when full-scale development was begun, has insisted that there is no alternative - no available aircraft that could provide comparable performance without, at this stage, costing more. This view has received backing from all three main political parties and the House of Commons defence committee, which came to the conclusion that the project could survive the loss of one or even two partners. However, German withdrawal creates a quandary for the UK. The amount written into budget plans for acquiring the originally planned 250 aircraft for the RAF and providing spares and support for the first two years of service is around Pounds 11.5bn at 1991 prices. Savings can be made in a more narrowly-based project by simplifying manufacturing arrangements, but these are unlikely to compensate fully for the extra share the remaining participants have to take in the cost of setting up production. Keeping within the budget therefore requires buying fewer aircraft; Italy and Spain, like Germany, had already cut their numbers and the British figure was under review. However, the fewer aircraft produced under the programme, the less cost-effective they become. UK officials have estimated that below a combined level of about 350-400 aircraft, EFA would lose its competitive advantage over its rivals. The UK, in contrast to Germany, is looking to a global role for the aircraft beyond the requirements of national air defence and is optimistic about export prospects. Although they are rivals in the export market, the French have an interest in seeing the EFA programme kept alive in order to sustain future European prospects in the combat aircraft sector. However, the more ambitious proponents of an integrated European industry in competition with US manufacturers have received a major setback with the split in the EFA project. Ideas formulated at Deutsche Aerospace (DASA), the Daimler-Benz subsidiary which includes the airframe company MBB, involved a joint European military aircraft company based around the merged Tornado and EFA management companies. BAe was already somewhat cool to this corporate approach. After successful collaboration with the US on developments of the Harrier and Hawk, it wanted to keep its US options open as well. It is now all the more likely to be confirmed in that philosophy.</p>

According to party  members, Turbay Ayala fulfilled his two goals: primary  elections and a single candidate.    With the Liberal tradition of having been the president and  the party leader, former President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala is  retiring with the recognition of his fellow countrymen because  he united them and promoted clean primary elections for choosing  the candidate for president of the Republic.    [Begin Turbay Ayala recording] With the change in leadership  of the party we complete the cycle of a generational renewal  within the PL. The change is beneficial. It has its own  dynamics, and any efforts to halt the process will be to no  avail. [end recording]    Next week PL presidential candidate Ernesto Samper Pizano  will form the new groups for his electoral campaign.</p>

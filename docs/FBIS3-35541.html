The shooting, in which at least 40 Palestinians died, will  provoke a "dramatic escalation in the intifadah and shake the  Palestinian people and the Arab nation out of their slumber."    The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas has been at the  forefront of attacks on Jews in the occupied territories since  the PLO signed its peace deal with Israel in Washington in  September.    The spokesman said his movement had always warned that  "coexistence is impossible with the Israeli enemy which wants  the land without its inhabitants."</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Poised for a pick-up: French recovery is on the cards The recession was unusually deep for France last year, with gross domestic product contracting by an estimated 0.7 percentage points. The recession stemmed from a chain of events arising from the unforeseen costs of German unification and the difficulties relating to European integration. A recovery is on the cards for the French economy in 1994. However, because the French and German economies are so closely linked the former is unlikely to improve without a corresponding pick- up in the latter. There was a clear public relations element in the French and German authorities' announcement last November of a 'joint convergence strategy' for European economic and monetary union. Nevertheless, the stances adopted by Paris and Bonn are fully justified by their extraordinary degree of economic interdependence. France's economy has bottomed out since the second quarter of 1993. There was some mild growth (0.2 percentage points) in the second and third quarters after a sharp slump in the two previous quarters. Demand for private housing picked up, the number of real estate transactions increased, property prices stopped falling and there was a drop in the number of unsold flats and houses. Household consumption also increased. Its sharp rise during the summer came as a surprise after the substantial tax increases introduced in July and August. This year, industrial production, which fell by 3.5 per cent in 1993, should increase moderately. The reversal should be spectacular for the car industry; a 3 per cent increase in car sales should be achieved in the year ahead, after a decline of 18.3 per cent in 1993. Although the newly introduced European statistical system has complicated the task of analysis, France's external trade account is improving, particularly with its non-European trading partners. The surpluses have been increasing steadily in nominal terms, and France has even run a surplus on bilateral trade with the UK of more than Pounds 100m a month. Business investment has declined for the third year running. But recent surveys suggest that the downward trend has almost come to an end. Meanwhile, inflation is under control and unit labour costs are stable. The competitiveness of French exporters, measured in terms of costs and prices, seems on average to be good. For example, it appears to be close to the levels of 1991, when French companies gained market share. For more than a decade, maintaining a stable franc/D-Mark exchange rate has been the cornerstone of French economic policy. This policy has proved successful. Interest rate spreads have narrowed, inflation is under control, companies are more profitable and France's economic growth has outstripped that of most other leading industrialised countries. But now the situation has changed. First, the widening of the European exchange rate mechanism fluctuation bands following last August's currency crisis when the franc came under intense selling pressure, has extended the range of policy options. Second, the Banque de France's newly independent status will modify decision-making procedures. The goal of French monetary policy since last summer's ERM crisis has been to maintain the 'internal and external stability' of the franc. This policy should soon be spelled out in greater detail by the Banque de France's new monetary policy-making body, the Monetary Policy Council, whose members will be announced today. While a number of options are possible, radical scenarios can be ruled out, particularly those based on a shift in policy priorities. Stability will remain the central objective of monetary policy. Fiscal policy has played an active role since the government of Mr Edouard Balladur took office in April, but from a macroeconomic view the impact of such a policy has been virtually neutral. The government has already benefited from the success of its privatisation policy, and the effect will be even stronger in 1994. On the downside, the fall in tax receipts from recession and the increase in welfare spending have limited the scope for cutting taxes and reducing employees' and employers' social contributions. Provided Germany does not slip back into recession, the Banque Nationale de Paris forecasts growth close to 1 per cent for the French economy in 1994. This would be driven by residential investment, exports outside Europe and, to a lesser extent, household consumption. Inflation will remain low, at about 2.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the trade and current accounts will continue to generate surpluses. Unfortunately, the projected rate of growth will probably not be sufficient to make a significant reduction in unemployment. While France's economic performance in the past 10 years has been healthy, its record on jobs is mediocre. Unemployment is currently 12 per cent of the labour force. But the real blemish on economic performance is the fact that, in 1989, after several years of strong growth, unemployment was still 9.4 per cent, revealing a deep structural problem. Assuming the trends in productivity and economic activity persist, growth would have to reach 2 per cent in order to produce a rise in net employment, and 3 per cent to bring unemployment down. Clearly these thresholds are much too high. In the recent past, France may have appeared caught up in its rural origins, reluctantly facing up to the challenge of international competition and indifferent to its unemployed. While this impression is not entirely false, it distorts and overshadows the whole picture. In the past few years, French companies have made considerable efforts to innovate and adapt to the changing economic environment, and they will emerge more com-petitive from the recession. Several recent developments augur well for France and other economies: negotiations on the long-delayed General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have been successfully concluded, and the spectre of a trade war has dissipated; and oil prices are at historically low levels. If Germany comes out of its recession, economic activity in France should begin to pick up this year, in line with the rest of Europe. The author is chief economist, Banque Nationale de Paris</p>

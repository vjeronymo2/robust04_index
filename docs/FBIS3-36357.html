He said  that Azerbaijan want peace but that the first and foremost  condition is that Armenia withdraw from the Azerbaijani  territory it has occupied. Pointing out that the Russian  proposal for an immediate cease-fire was rejected because this  condition had not been met, Aliyev stressed that Azerbaijan  definitely wants Turkey to participate in the peacekeeping force  Russia intends to station in Karabakh. Recalling that he will  be making an official visit to Turkey as the guest of President  Suleyman Demirel between 8 and 11 February, Aliyev added that  this visit will constitute a stepping stone to further develop  the existing bilateral relations. He noted that he will be  conducting talks on all issues with Turkey and that the  Ceyhan-Baku oil pipeline issue will also be taken up.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / What the water companies say you've told them SEVERN TRENT WATER 'Consumers have shown a willingness to spend more on services but some are less willing to spend on waste water (sewage) projects which the regulators are pushing. Customers are more concerned about the cleanliness of their water, leakages and the replacement of lead' WESSEX WATER 'When our researchers explained the cost involved in the EC directive on urban waste water customers were shocked. The only projects for which they have shown a willingness to pay more are those to prevent rivers running low, improvements in taste of tap water and the removal of lead pipes' ANGLIAN WATER 'Customers support improvements and accept they will bring higher bills. Over three-quarters are willing to pay more to help implement the EC drinking and bathing water directives' SOUTHERN WATER Interviews with customers on the implications for bills of cleaning up much of the southern coastline are not yet completed YORKSHIRE WATER Will begin their survey in May, asking customers how they feel about increases in bills from new sewage treatment plants in Leeds and along the coast WELSH WATER 'Initial research showed that our customers' paramount concern is better quality of river water. Generally they are happy with the quality of tap water' NORTHUMBRIAN WATER 'We are finding that customers are prepared to pay a bit extra, for example, to reduce the risk of discoloured tap water and to improve the quality of coastal waters. On pricing, we expected them to say 'enough is enough' but no-one is saying that' THAMES WATER 'Customers want better quality, better standards, but at the end of the day they don't want increases in price' NORTH WEST WATER 'Most customers interviewed did not at first understand the link between bills and the company' investment programme of more than Pounds 5bn in the 1990s. Over half the spending is on cleaning up the Mersey, beaches, and sewerage treatment, yet many customers were unaware we dealt with these' SOUTH WEST WATER 'Customers see the need for our massive investment programme - 31 schemes clearing up 81 beaches. We will be pushing for additional financial support from Europe and government. But our customers are only 2.6 per cent of population and don't see why they should have to pay for cleaning up 30 per cent of the country's coastline'</p>

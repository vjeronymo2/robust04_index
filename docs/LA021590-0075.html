			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS THROW PARTY TO SHOW THAT A SOBER EXPERIENCE CAN STILL BE FUN;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS: NEARLY 1,000 WESTSIDE STUDENTS FROM 12 SCHOOLS ATTEND A 'SOBER BASH'  THAT OFFERED A GOOD TIME FREE OF DRUGS OR ALCOHOL.  </P> <P> High school party-goers don't need to get wasted to have a good time.  </P> <P> That is the message that Kolo Inc., an organization of students from 12 public  and private high schools, tried to send when it threw its first "sober bash"  Saturday night in an empty airplane hangar at the Santa Monica Airport.  </P> <P> "The idea is to give students an alternative," said Shane McCoy, a 17-year-old  student at Marlborough School who helped organize the event. "Hopefully,  everyone will consider it a night to remember, a night that, by the way, was  also drug- and alcohol-free. We'd like them to wake up the next day (after a  Kolo event) without the headache and say: 'Hey, I had a good time.' "  </P> <P> By most accounts, Saturday's party was a success, drawing nearly 1,000  teen-agers and raising about $4,000 during an evening of wholesome fun and  entertainment that, except for a couple of incidents late in the evening, lived  up to its billing.  </P> <P> Kolo was started about a year ago by Jasha Salter, a mother of three. She began  organizing the group after the alcohol-related deaths of four students in an  auto accident on San Vicente Boulevard in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Salter met with students and administrators of Beverly Hills, Palisades, Santa  Monica and University high schools, as well as private institutions such as the  Brentwood School, Crossroads School, Harvard School, Loyola, Marlborough,  Marymount High School, Windward School and the Westlake School for Girls.  </P> <P> "But I knew if an organization was going to be a success, it would have to be  run by the students," said Salter, whose daughter attends Westlake. "The  students don't want to preach; they just want to have drug- and alcohol-free  parties."  </P> <P> For that reason, they rejected the idea of using an acronym for its name that  would spell out an anti-alcohol theme. Instead they opted for Kolo, the name of  a Serbo-Croatian dance.  </P> <P> Organizers of Saturday's party said that at first they had a hard time  persuading fellow students to attend because non-alcoholic events are  considered "nerdy."  </P> <P> Not everyone at Harvard High School was completely thrilled with the notion,  said Deron Quon, 17, student body president. "I told them they should try it;  it's something new, and they could really have a good time."  </P> <P> Most didn't mind that the only refreshments being served were sandwiches,  cupcakes and soft drinks. Pepsi was a sponsor of the event and the Laker Girls  provided entertainment.  </P> <P> "I'm having a great time, and it's a lot safer," said Katarina, a 17-year-old  Beverly Hills High School student. "You can have a good time and don't have to  worry about someone getting drunk and not being able to make it home."  </P> <P> But others said the party lacked the sense of frivolity that could only come  from booze.  </P> <P> "People are going to drink no matter what," said Vince, an 18-year-old Loyola  senior. "I think it's unrealistic to think that you can have a party, say it's  alcohol-free, and it's going to make a difference. The fact of the matter is  that you have a better time when you've had something to drink. I know I do."  </P> <P> Security at the party was provided by Santa Monica police officers and  employees of the city's Cultural and Recreation Services Department, which was  also a sponsor.  </P> <P> Anita Ybarra, a recreation supervisor, said the city anticipated that there  might be problems. Extra security was called in and local groups that provide  safe rides were contacted to take home those who would not follow the spirit of  the party.  </P> <P> Toward the end of the dance, the anticipated trouble arrived.  </P> <P> "There may be no drinking inside here, but there are plenty of people drinking  beer in the parking lot," said one high school student.  </P> <P> Santa Monica officials nabbed one carload of teen-agers and forced them to  empty into the street the 24 cans of beer they had in the car. But no one  managed to catch the culprit who brazenly smoked a marijuana joint, which other  students smelled on the crowded dance floor.  </P> <P> "This is a still a success," said Akua Campanella, a Beverly Hills High School  student. "When you compare it to other parties, this is great."  </P></p>

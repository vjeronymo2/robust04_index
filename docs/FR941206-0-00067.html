Significant Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several changes have been made since the proposal of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these standards. The majority of the changes have been made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to clarify portions of the rule that were unclear to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters. Other changes include adding additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility to sources by allowing alternative monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaches to meet the standards. A summary of the major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes is presented below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A controlled MACT floor for chamber exhaust vents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at operations using 9,070 kg/yr (10 tons/yr) or more of EO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was determined based on data submitted by commenters (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Docket Entry IV&hyph;B&hyph;02). Existing and new sources using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9,070 kg/yr (10 tons/yr) or more of EO are now required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control the emissions from the chamber exhaust vent. Owners  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or operators of new and existing chamber exhaust vents at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources using 9,070 kg/yr (10 tons/yr) or more of EO must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parametrically monitor the control device used in achieving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emissions reduction requirements of the standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, the Agency has required control of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from the chamber exhaust vent at major sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because data were received from commenters indicating that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emissions from this vent are routed to a control device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to control emissions from other vent types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., manifolded to either the aeration room vent or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sterilization chamber vent). The Agency also received data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> showing minimal nationwide annualized cost impacts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately $240,000 associated with manifolding these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions (see Docket Entry IV&hyph;B&hyph;03). The Agency therefore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that the requirements to control this vent at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MACT floor are not burdensome for major sources and do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represent a significant change in the Agency's regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The format of the standard for aeration room vents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at sources using 9,070 kg/yr (10 tons/yr) or more of EO was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised to provide owners or operators flexibility to either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet a maximum emission limit of 1 ppmv ethylene oxide or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve a 99 percent reduction in ethylene oxide emissions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whichever is less stringent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The compliance date for all sources has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changed from 2 to 3 years. This extension has been provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to allow sources additional time to achieve compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these standards. New sources with startup after the 3 year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance date will be required to comply upon startup of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the source.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Owners or operators of all chamber exhaust vents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at sources using 907 kg/yr (1 ton/yr) or more but less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9,070 kg/yr (10 tons/yr) of EO were provided additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility to show compliance by either measuring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ethylene oxide concentration in the chamber prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activation of the chamber exhaust vent (as proposed) or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parametrically monitoring the performance of a control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device used to reduce emissions from this vent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The monitoring requirements for aeration room  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vents at sources using 9,070 kg/yr (10 tons/yr) or more of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EO were revised to provide sources additional flexibility to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitor either the ethylene oxide outlet concentration or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters of control device performance. For sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choosing to measure the EO outlet concentration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurements of ethylene oxide concentration that are below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the detection limit of 0.5 ppmv for ethylene oxide are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepted as a demonstration of compliance with the aeration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> room vent standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The Agency reduced the frequency of monitoring of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ethylene glycol concentration in the scrubber liquor for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources complying with emission reduction standards using an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acid-water scrubber. Owners or operators are now only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to monitor the ethylene glycol concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weekly. The Agency also provided sources using this control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology flexibility to alternatively monitor the level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the scrubber liquor in the liquor tank on a weekly basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Several commenters suggested that maintenance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalytic oxidizers within a temperature range was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. In the final rule, a baseline temperature is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established as a minimum oxidation temperature. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Based on information from commenters, compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions and monitoring requirements have been included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final rule for thermal oxidizers. These requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include the establishment of a baseline temperature and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuous monitoring of this temperature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

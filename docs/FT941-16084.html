			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: 10m people to file own returns - Self-assessment The Inland Revenue yesterday published details of the new system of self-assessment of personal taxation which will affect about 10m people. The main changes - promised by Mr Kenneth Clarke in the last Budget - will allow people to calculate their own tax liability and to pay it with no further need for communication with the Revenue. The self-employed from 1996 will be taxed on current year profits rather than those made in the preceding year as is the case at the moment. The Revenue says these changes will significantly simplify the administration of tax returns. All unincorporated businesses and anyone who pays more than simple PAYE will be affected by the changes. Taxpayers will also have to keep records in order to make returns. Trading records will have to be kept until the fifth anniversary of the filing date of the return. Others will have to be kept until the first anniversary of the filing date. There will be transitional rules for businesses running on April 5 this year. Companies that set up after that date will immediately pay taxes on same-year profits. Individuals and trustees will likewise have to send tax returns to the Revenue by January 31 after the tax year or, if later, three months after the return is issued. If taxpayers choose not to work out their own tax bills they can send a completed tax return to the Revenue by the September 30 following the end of the tax year. Changes concerning income and capital gains tax will take effect from 1996-97 while those affecting corporation tax will apply to accounting periods ending not earlier than April 1, 1996. The provisions published yesterday as part of the finance bill will be followed by a second tranche of legislation in the 1995 finance bill.</p>

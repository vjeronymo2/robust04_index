			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Decision Due on Bloomingdale's: Federated Stores, the parent of the Campeau  Corp.'s U.S. retailing operations, said it will decide within 30 days whether  to call off all efforts to sell its Bloomingdale's department store chain. The  New York-based retailer was put up for sale last fall as part of a plan by  Campeau to overhaul its department store divisions, but the move was put on a  back burner in January when the department stores filed for bankruptcy court  protection. Federated Stores said the Bloomingdale's chain is the only unit it  currently is considering selling.  </P></p>

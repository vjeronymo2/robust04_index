			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Observer: Mail chauvinist Britain's Royal Mail is already starting to behave as if it has been privatised judging by the latest edition of its Royal Mail International Business Travel Guide. Not only is Ireland portrayed as a more enthusiastic member of the European Union than Britain, but the guide also criticises the British government's efforts to settle the 25-year-old troubles. It notes that in the autumn of 1993, a new initiative jointly presented by the moderate nationalist SDLP and the republican Sinn Fein seemed to offer 'at least the possibility of a settlement'. That said, the attitude of the British government is described as 'unpromising'.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOFTWARE TOUTED AS A KEY TO UNLOCKING CREATIVITY;  </P> <P> COMPUTERS: THE IDEAFISHER PACKAGE AIMS TO AID INNOVATION THROUGH WORD  ASSOCIATIONS AND QUESTIONS.  </P> <P> When Marshall Fisher gives a sales pitch for his computer software package, he  holds out the promise of capturing the elusive spark of creativity.  </P> <P> He asks how much a potential customer would pay for a key to the subconscious  mind, a tool that unlocks an avalanche of ideas and gently shapes conceptual  clay into brilliant new forms.  </P> <P> How about $495, personal computer not included? asks Fisher, a creativity guru  and president of Fisher Idea Systems Inc. in Irvine.  </P> <P> Fisher, who spent $4 million and 12 years developing a creativity software  program called IdeaFisher, proclaims that the program is a "must-have"  brainstorming tool for everyone in search of a creative spark, from tiny  advertising agencies to Fortune 500 companies.  </P> <P> "We're using the computer to expand the thinking process instead of just  crunching numbers," said Fisher, who amassed a personal fortune as co-founder  of Century 21 Real Estate, the world's largest residential real estate  operation.  </P> <P> Fisher's small office in Irvine is plastered with reviews published since  IdeaFisher was introduced a year ago. With 300 books on creativity and the  thinking process lining his shelves, Fisher is girded to fend off the criticism  that he is trying to bottle something magical.  </P> <P> Although Fisher concedes that IdeaFisher is no substitute for independent  thinking, he says it enables people to dip ideas into a pool of word  associations or refine those ideas through a series of questions. The program  recognizes that thinking is a process. And it is designed to help a person  generate ideas for solving problems in much the same way that strolling through  a supermarket reminds you of all the options you have for cooking dinner.  </P> <P> The software, which is designed for use on IBM, Apple and compatible personal  computers, consists of two main features: the QBank and the IdeaBank.  </P> <P> QBank contains more than 3,000 questions that help put a problem in focus. The  user types in an idea and the program asks a series of questions that define  the idea more precisely and explore various avenues of thought. The program  also asks questions comparing the quality of the idea to other proposals, using  the results to determine a starting point for a search through the IdeaBank.  </P> <P> IdeaBank is a database of 61,000 concepts structured into 28 major subjects and  387 subtopics -- all connected by 675,000 associations. Instead of using an  alphabetical index, the database stores information much like the brain does  through associations. For instance, a word like "car" would be linked with  "traffic."  </P> <P> The idea of developing a creativity tool first struck Fisher in 1964, when he  toyed with the idea of publishing a kind of "smart thesaurus," or a book of  words and associated terms and concepts designed to help writers. Although he  never completed the book, he revisited the idea in 1977 after selling his  Century 21 holdings. He began work on a computerized version of his smart  thesaurus.  </P> <P> Linking the hundreds of thousands of associations contained in the IdeaBank and  organizing them so that they might be retrieved by a computer proved to be such  a highly complex task that it took 12 years to complete, Fisher said.  </P> <P> The company, which has 10 full-time employees, at one time employed 250 people  to type information into the computer.  </P> <P> Gary Cunningham, a principal at the Roberts Mealer Cunningham advertising  agency in Costa Mesa, said he uses the program to help companies select new  names. For one client, IdeaFisher was able to generate more than 5,000 proposed  names.  </P> <P> "There's concern about software replacing people in ad agencies," he said. "But  I think it is like getting 100 bright people in the same room and putting their  minds together. It puts pressure on other creative people to use it too."  </P> <P> Jack Russo, a patent attorney in San Francisco, said he uses IdeaFisher to  search for analogies when writing legal briefs and as a checklist generator  when taking depositions from witnesses.  </P> <P> "I use it to help form an idea like a conversation with a colleague would," he  said. "It paid for itself the first time I used it. It's like having a yellow  pad of paper that talks back to you."  </P> <P> Russo said the software should be used to solve general problems instead of  specific ones, and the user must be willing to spend a few hours familiarizing  himself with the search techniques.  </P> <P> Jess Fisher, Marshall's son and the company's director of product development,  cautions that the product isn't a panacea, and he doesn't guarantee that  IdeaFisher will work for everyone. An independent study by the University of  Hawaii found that people who claimed to be drained of creativity reported a  substantial increase in the number of ideas they were able to generate by using  IdeaFisher.  </P> <P> The software has received laudatory reviews in a number of publications,  including PC magazine, which named it one of the best new products of 1989. The  company says its customers include Walt Disney Co., International Business  Machines Corp., Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, Chase Manhattan Bank, General Mills,  Lotus Development Corp., Northwestern University, the Marine Corps and more  than 30 advertising agencies.  </P> <P> Fisher says the people who might benefit from IdeaFisher include strategic  planners, researchers, personnel managers, marketers, advertising executives,  screen writers, novelists and product developers.  </P> <P> Fisher hopes that the education market will be a proving ground for IdeaFisher.  The product is being used by teachers in the 5,000-student school district in  Moses Lake, Wash., to teach students about the thinking process. The University  of Missouri's journalism school is using the program to teach students how to  write better.  </P> <P> "We can expect to see classes on Thinking 101, down to every grade level where  you learn the process of putting ideas together," he said.  </P> <P> Fisher declines to disclose sales figures, though he said he has not yet  recovered his initial $4-million investment in the year the product has been  out. There is little direct competition for the product, he said, adding that  other products on the market focus on a single task such as generating names  for products.  </P> <P> The company isn't content with the attention it generated with IdeaFisher. In  September it will ship an updated version of the package.  </P> <P> The company said it is negotiating with at least two larger companies to  distribute IdeaFisher overseas. It is also developing custom versions for  lawyers and other professionals and creating a laser-storage version of  IdeaFisher that will use images rather than words.  </P> <P> "We're saying that we have to start thinking to be competitive and use every  tool at our disposal to be inventive," Fisher said. "Otherwise we will be a  third-rate country. Creativity makes the world go round. The rest is  housekeeping."  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW IDEAFISHER SOFTWARE WORKS  </P> <P> Naming a new brand of dog biscuit:  </P> <P> Start in the IdeaBank, the program's database of associations.  </P> <P> Type in the words dog treat.  </P> <P> The program spits out a list of topic categories:  </P> <P> ability/skill/talent/training/practice/lessons  </P> <P> dogs/cats/family pets  </P> <P> foods/food groups  </P> <P> like/want/prefer  </P> <P> Select dogs/cats/family pets  </P> <P> The program produces a list of associations that help the user brainstorm and  serve as a catalyst in the creation of a name:  </P> <P> best friend -- myth + -- Dalmatian in a fire truck  </P> <P> fire hydrant -- mutt -- gingham dog and calico cat  </P> <P> puppy love -- show dog -- shaggy-dog story  </P> <P> dog bone -- bone -- can't teach an old dog new tricks  </P> <P> dog costume -- top dog -- Old Mother Hubbard  </P> <P> doggie bag -- figurine -- leader of the pack  </P> <P> show-ring -- trophy -- best of breed  </P> <P> circus dog -- pedigree -- pick of the litter  </P> <P> shake hands -- scent -- Run, Spot, Run  </P> <P> The user jots down possible name ideas in the program's Idea Notepad.  </P> <P> gingham dog and calico cat: Gingham Dog  </P> <P> dog bone: Bone Appetit  </P> <P> puppy love: Puppy Loves  </P> <P> can't teach an old dog new tricks: New Tricks  </P> <P> The list of ideas can then be tested and refined in the QBank, which generates  questions such as "How would you expand the concept?"  </P> <P> Source: Fisher Idea Systems  </P></p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Pretoria may return land to blacks THE South African govern-ment appears ready to restore land to some of the 3.5m blacks forcibly removed under apartheid, reversing an earlier decision to reject all claims for restoration. In an interview in today's Financial Times survey of South Africa, President F. W. de Klerk makes clear that his government is willing to moderate its tough line on the land issue, which has been criticised by anti-apartheid groups and foreign governments. This appears to be part of the government's attempt to create a climate conducive to constitutional negotiations at a time of rising political tensions. The African National Congress has said it will boycott talks unless the government takes steps by Thursday to end violence which has left more than 150 people dead in the past week. Relations between the ANC and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party further deteriorated during the weekend amid further killings - six people died in a bus ambush in Tembisa township, north of Johannesburg yesterday - and an Inkatha threat, later denied by Chief Buthelezi, to deploy 250,000 armed warriors in black townships around Johannesburg. Mr de Klerk's policy shift follows the publication in March of a white paper which said that it 'would not be feasible' to restore land to victims of forced removals. The victims referred to are families evicted from their homes during the past 30 years as part of Pretoria's policy of confining all blacks to separate homelands. In the interview, which was conducted three weeks ago but was under embargo until today, Mr de Klerk stresses that the government is 'not . . . unapproachable' on the issue of restitution. 'Government's general approach to this issue is to address the cases concerned with sympathy and reasonableness.' It is understood that the government has agreed to set up a land commission to advise on claims resulting from apartheid removals. It is also understood that some of the legislation tabled as part of a land reform package will be withdrawn for further discussion. The government will go ahead, however, with a bill abolishing the Group Areas Act, which imposes residential segregation, and the 1913 and 1936 Land Acts, which prevented blacks from owning more than 13 per cent of South Africa.

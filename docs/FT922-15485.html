			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Corning earnings advance in first quarter CORNING, the US specialty glass group, yesterday unveiled a 21 per cent increase in underlying first-quarter earnings. Stripping-out extraordinary items, Corning said it earned Dollars 56.4m, or 30 cents a share, in the latest quarter. Net income for the first three months of 1992 was Dollars 78.1m, or 41 cents a share, against Dollars 48.4m, or 26 cents, a year earlier. The figures include one-time gains in both years. Net sales rose 15 per cent to Dollars 793.2m from Dollars 691.2m the previous year, fuelled by strength in Corning's laboratory services business. Mr James Houghton, chairman, said the company's fibre and cable businesses were showing a seasonal upturn and a return to strong year-on-year growth. The weak US economy, however, hurt results of Corning's consumer products and specialty materials operations. On Wall Street, shares in Corning were Dollars 1 1/8 higher at Dollars 33 7/8 in an advancing market. The company's stock has been battered in recent months by controversy surrounding the silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning, a 50-50 joint venture between Corning and Dow Chemical. Dow Corning said recently it was withdrawing entirely from the silicone breast implant business. Although the devices account for less than 1 per cent of Dow Corning's Dollars 2bn annual sales, there is growing concern that Corning may be vulnerable if Dow Corning is flooded with successful law suits. Mr Houghton has said the suits would not have a material effect on Dow Corning's financial position. In 1991, Corning's equity earnings from Dow Corning were reduced by Dollars 8.2m after Dow Corning took a Dollars 16.4m fourth quarter after-tax charge related to the implants.</p>

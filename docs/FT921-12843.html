			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India to import more cotton after crop setback THE INDIAN government has decided to allow the Cotton Corporation of India to import 1m bales (170 kg each) of cotton during the 1991-92 season (September-August). The move is in response to concern about runaway inflation in cotton prices following a sharp setback in the crop. The government had originally planned to limit imports to 500,000 bales. The mills have made it clear, however, that imports will not make sense while the 50 per cent duty remains. The textiles ministry supports the industry's stand but the finance ministry has yet to take a decision on the subject. As the government is taking its time to sort out the contentious duty issue, some of the leading textile mills like Century, Bombay Dyeing, Arvind and Madura Coats have decided to import about 200,000 bales on their own against exports of yarn and fabrics. Meanwhile, the government, which earlier sanctioned the export of 500,000 bales of cotton in anticipation of a good crop has now restricted overseas sales to 100,000 bales. In the last cotton season, India exported 1.18m bales of cotton. The Cotton Advisory Board, which at the beginning of the season forecast a crop of 13m bales, now thinks that production will be only 11.65m bales. According to Mr RK Khattar, president of the Eastern India Textile Mills Association, the setback in production results mainly from insufficient rains in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh and a cyclonic storm in Andhra Pradesh. According to the advisory board Maharashtra will now be producing 900,000 bales, against the earlier forecast of 1.5m bales; Gujarat 1.3m bales, against 1.9m; and Madhya Pradesh 1m bales, against 1.6m. Apart from the production shortfall, the quality of the crop, particularly in Gujarat leaves much to be desired. As a result, there is a great rush for the good quality cotton grown in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. Cotton is now fetching 70 per cent more than in corresponding period of the previous year. The total supply of Indian cotton in 1991-92 is expected to be 13.59m bales, including the carryover of 1.94m bales. Imports of 1.2m bales are likely to be needed to meet total Indian consumption estimated at 12.4m bales.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Communique stresses unemployment and security issues THE following are extracts from the final summit declaration: The European Council gave special attention to, on the one hand, action aimed at tackling the economic and social problems faced by the Community and particularly the unacceptably high level of unemployment and, on the other hand, to the wide range of issues relating to peace and security in Europe. Growth, competitiveness and unemployment: The European Council is deeply concerned about the present unemployment situation and the grave dangers inherent in a development where an increasing number of people in the Community are becoming permanently detached from the labour market. The European Council pledged the determination of the Community and its member states to restore confidence through the implementation of a clear strategy  -covering both the short term and medium-to-long term - to restore sustainable growth, reinforce the competitiveness of European industry and reduce unemployment. Monetary and exchange rate policy: The European Council agreed on the overriding importance of creating the budgetary and economic conditions for rapidly bringing interest rates in Europe down, thereby narrowing the existing gap between interest rates in Europe and interest rates in other major industrial countries. The European Council recalled that the exchange rate policy of all member states is a matter of common interest. It underlined the essential role to be played by the European Monetary Institute in this area. It invited the Commission to present proposals on all the necessary implementing measures relating to the second stage of economic and monetary union, so that they can be adopted by the Council as soon as possible after entry into force of the treaty and before 1 January 1994. Gatt: The European Council underlined the need for the Community to continue to play an active part in achieving further progress while preserving the European identity throughout the negotiations. The European Council stressed that it was essential to relaunch the multilateral process in Geneva as soon as possible on all topics, including agriculture, in order to complete a comprehensive, durable and balanced agreement before the end of the year. Early identification of the main elements of a large market access component and real progress on services and intellectual property, including contributions from all Gatt partners, would help to maintain momentum and pave the way for the conclusion in time of the final package. Enlargement: The European Council took note of progress in the enlargement negotiations with Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway. It recalled that the negotiations will, to the extent possible, be conducted in parallel, while dealing with each candidate on its own merit. The European Council is determined that the objective of the first enlargement of the European Union laid down by the Lisbon and Edinburgh European Councils should become a reality by January 1 1995. Relations with the associated countries of central and eastern Europe: The European Council welcomed the courageous efforts undertaken by the associated countries to modernise their economies, which have been weakened by 40 years of central planning, and to ensure a rapid transition to a market economy. The Community and its member states pledge their support to this reform process. The European Council today agreed that the associated countries in central and eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the European Union. Accession will take place as soon as an associated country is able to assume the obligations of membership by satisfying the economic and political conditions required. Membership requires that the candidate country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union. Russia: The European Council is looking forward to continuing the close co-operation with Russia in the political field and to jointly contributing to the solution of international crises. This is seen as an essential contribution to peace and stability in Europe and the world.</p>

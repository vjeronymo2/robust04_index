			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> XVIII. Notice Regarding Registration of Reformulated Gasolines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is in the process of establishing new requirements for the registration of motor vehicle fuels and fuel additives (F/FAs) as authorized by sections 211(b) and 211(e) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 96 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A proposal was published on April 15, 1992 (57 FR 13168). Pursuant to court order, EPA is scheduled to issue the final rule on or before April 29, 1994. The new registration regulations would supplement existing requirements and would apply to all F/FAs designated for registration, including reformulated gasoline and oxygenated gasolines. This new rule would require manufacturers of designated F/FAs to conduct certain tests and submit information regarding the composition and the potential health and welfare effects of the emissions produced by such F/FAs. Consistent with statutory requirements, for products registered prior to the promulgation of the F/FA final rule the proposal would allow a period of three years for the submission of certain data required by the rule. Under this proposal, manufacturers of designated F/FAs not registered prior to the promulgation of the F/FA final rule would be required to submit the requisite information prior to registration. This would mean that products not registered at the time of promulgation of the final F/FA testing rule would not be allowed to be registered and sold until EPA receives the requisite health effects information. In view of this proposed provision, EPA is advising manufacturers of reformulated gasoline and oxygenated gasolines to promptly register their products (or update their current gasoline registrations) so they can enter the marketplace and make use of the three-year time window allowed by the statute to conduct the required tests. The purpose of this section is to provide some guidance to fuel producers on the registration process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 96 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 211(a) registration of designated fuels and fuel additives is required as a precondition to introduction into the marketplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To make the registration process more flexible and convenient, current registration procedures allow a fuel producer to include in the original registration a list of additives that might be used in the marketed fuel, along with the applicable range of concentration-in-use for each alternative. Manufacturers are also allowed to revise existing fuel registrations to accommodate expected changes in their formulations. These provisions allow fuel producers to respond quickly to fluctuations in price, availability, and other market or technical factors when they formulate their fuel products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with this current practice, EPA will permit fuel producers to register their oxygenated gasoline formulations (including reformulated gasoline) by simply revising their existing gasoline registrations to include the pertinent oxygenating compound(s). Fuel producers who are uncertain about their future fuel formulations could potentially list an unlimited number of oxygenates which they might, under some conceivable circumstances, blend into gasoline. However, EPA would generally advise against the strategy of including every possible alternative oxygenate. The fact that, for the sake of convenience, registrations are permitted to be modified to cover oxygenated gasolines does not mean that all potential formulations which fit under this broad compositional umbrella will necessarily be considered equivalent to a single fuel product. In fact, the F/FA final rule is expected to consider each gasoline/oxygenate blend as a different formulation. Thus, fuel producers would be responsible for the testing of each gasoline/oxygenate blend covered by the respective fuel registration. Furthermore, oxygenated compounds that are listed but not tested within the allotted time period (i.e., three years) could not be used by the manufacturer. Thus, in determining which oxygenate compounds to include in the registration, each producer should carefully consider the tradeoff between the additional flexibility which a comprehensive list of potential oxygenates might provide and the additional testing responsibility which might result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For more information about registration procedures, please contact the registration office at (202) 233&hyph;9755.

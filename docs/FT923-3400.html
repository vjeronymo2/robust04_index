			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Strong gains in dollar-earning stocks STRENGTH IN the US dollar boosted the big overseas earning stocks in London yesterday, counter-balancing a more cautious response to sterling's performance against the D-mark. The strongly-worded rejection from the UK prime minister of suggestions of realignment of the pound in the European exchange rate mechanism calmed recent uncertainties. Domestic issues, including many leading retailers, found encouragement from the latest UK inflation statistics, showing an annualised increase of only 3.6 per cent, the lowest for four years. By the close, the FT-SE Index was more than 30 points higher, although traders warned that confidence remained fragile. Traders appeared surprised at yesterday's further advance in the Footsie Index, which brought a closing level of 2,370.9, up 30.3 on the day. The gain reversed what had been a loss over the week to show a net gain of 8.7 points since last Friday's close. Dealers under strict orders not to leave share positions open in these treacherous markets hurried to buy stock when the market moved forward yesterday. Equities opened firmly against the D-Mark but soon lost impetus when the pound failed to maintain its initial response to the uncompromising defence of sterling's role in the ERM by Mr John Major, the British prime minster, who said any realignment of sterling's parity would be 'a betrayal of our future.' But other considerations were brushed aside in equities by powerful rises in the big dollar-orientated issues, including the oils, pharmaceuticals and international traders. With Glaxo, British Petroleum, Shell, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham all higher in good turnover, the Footsie Index quickly extended its early gain of 6 points to 32.8. While the UK Retail Price index was a little better than expected, the favourable response from consumer stocks was unexpected in view of this week's negative survey of the retail outlook from the Confederation of British Industry. Trading volum increased after Wall Street opened its new session with a gain of 7 Dow points. Seaq-recorded volume finally totalled 476.8m shares, just behind the 485.6m recorded on the previous day. However, there were renewed hints that low trading volume is hurting City firms; Thursday's retail business was worth only Pounds 900.9m, still on the low side for market profitability. Retail turnover has remained painfully low, even by comparison with the unprofitable levels of the comparable period of 1991.</p>

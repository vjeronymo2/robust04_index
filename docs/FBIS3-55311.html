			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report by IPRINDA correspondent Zurab Dvali from </F> Tbilisi]    [Text] Today is exactly two years since the first popularly  elected Georgian president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, together with  about 50 of his followers, escaped at dawn from his bunker in  the government house, surrounded by the opposition, and fled  from the republic. It is 6 January again -- this time 1994, and  again the destiny of this man is at the center of attention of  virtually all the local and foreign media.    An official delegation lead by Chechen Republic Vice  President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev arrived in Tbilisi late last  night. According to information we have, the guests intend to  investigate all the details connected with Zviad Gamsakhurdia's  death -- along with examining a whole range of economic, trade,  and other issues. They have also passed on to the head of the  Georgian state a request made by the Georgian ex-president's  wife Manana to allow the body of her husband to be buried in his  homeland. She means the family cemetery in the grounds of the  house in Tbilisi that belonged to the ex- president's father.  Eduard Shevardnadze has declined this request. However, some  sources claim that the funeral could take place in the  Gamsakhurdia family home village in western Georgia.    It also become known today that Chechen President Dzhokhar  Dudayev has issued an official statement in which he indicates  that Zviad Gamsakhurdia should be buried in his homeland with  all the honors that befit the first president of Georgia. In  connection with this, Dudayev appealed to democratic circles of  Russia, asking them to put pressure on official Tbilisi.    At the same time, the question of whether Gamsakhurdia has  really shot himself still remains open. At any rate, a doubt  about this version of events was expressed not only by  representatives of the special services who, in one way or  another, were closely following the ex-president's activities  all this time, but also people who were personally close to  Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Anyway, the fact remains -- a man whose  name was connected at first with the best hopes and aspirations  of the Georgian people, and who later was accused of every  mortal sin and proclaimed a chief ideologist of provincial  fascism and a traitor, is no more.    As the saying goes, speak no ill of the dead.</p>

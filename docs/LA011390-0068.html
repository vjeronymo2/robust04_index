			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE  </P> <P> Legal representation of the county's abused and neglected children was  officially transferred to the county counsel Friday from the district  attorney's office, a county spokesman said.  </P> <P> In June, the county Board of Supervisors authorized the creation of a new  county counsel unit, the Juvenile Dependency Division, to take over child-abuse  and neglect cases from the overburdened district attorney.  </P> <P> District attorney aides had complained that they did not have adequate time to  prepare for the increasing number of juvenile dependency cases.  </P> <P> The Juvenile Dependency Division will employ 15 lawyers -- nearly double the  district attorney's staff handling these cases -- to handle the court-ordered  removal of 7,850 abused or neglected children, according to Chief Deputy County  Counsel Philip Dunn, who heads the new division.  </P> <P> Seven additional staff attorneys will handle 400 custody cases and 70 appeal  cases.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office will continue to handle criminal prosecution of  child abusers.  </P></p>

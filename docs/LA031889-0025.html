			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRE NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> CORA GETS LOOK AT POSSIBLE NEW CAREER OPTION  </P> <P> Once, Joey Cora was being groomed to be the next Alan Wiggins. Now he might be  angling to become the next Mike Brumley or Gary Green -- the player most likely  to back up Garry Templeton at shortstop for the Padres.  </P> <P> Having played second base almost exclusively since joining the Padre  organization in 1985, Cora is now getting a look at shortstop.  </P> <P> Cora played all eight innings of a 7-5 loss to San Francisco in a "B" game  Friday afternoon at Sun Desert Stadium. It was Cora's fourth appearance at  shortstop this spring and in some ways his shakiest. After three errorless  games, including a 10-assist "B" game against the Angels Tuesday, Cora made two  throwing errors against the Giants.  </P> <P> "Arm strength is the biggest difference," Cora said of the change.  </P> <P> Cora is not unfamiliar with the position; he was a two-time All-Southeastern  Conference shortstop at Vanderbilt. But he has played shortstop only  occasionally since he was selected by the Padres in the first round of the June  1985 1985 free-agent draft and asked to play second.  </P> <P> Cora made a rapid rise through the Padre system, starting Opening Day at second  in 1987. But he struggled; his usually reliable hitting failed him. He was  batting .237 when he was demoted to triple-A Las Vegas on June 8 if 1987, then  .276 in 81 games at Las Vegas and hit .296 last season. In the meantime, his  role as the Padres' best young second base prospect was passed to Roberto  Alomar.  </P> <P> With 21-year-old Alomar at second, Cora, 23, might find a brighter future at  short. The Padres are looking for someone to spell Templeton, 33. Brumley and  Green began the spring as the most likely candidates, and while little has  changed, Manager Jack McKeon said he wanted to give Cora an opportunity to show  what he could do.  </P> <P> "We want to give everyone who is competing for the infield position a chance,"  McKeon said. "You never known what can happen, and we want to be fair to  everyone."  </P> <P> Of the others looking to earn the final infield spot, Brumley is considered the  stronger hitter and Green the better fielder.  </P> <P> Cora said he is not sure what to make of his recent playing time at shortstop.  He said he has not discussed the experiment with McKeon but said he doesn't  expect it result in a permanent change.  </P> <P> "I figure it's just a chance to show my versatility," Cora said.  </P> <P> Left-handed pitcher Eric Nolte, who made the jump from Class A to the major  leagues in 1987 only to be demoted early last season to triple-A Las Vegas,  underwent surgery Thursday for a perforated ulcer, a club spokesman said.  </P> <P> Nolte became ill during a meal Thursday and was taken to Yuma Regional Medical  Center, where surgery was performed by Dr. Dirk Frauenfelder. Nolte is expected  to be in the hospital for three or four days. He is expected to miss at least  two or three weeks, McKeon said.  </P> <P> Nolte had pitched six innings in three games, allowing one run, striking out  five and earning two saves.  </P> <P> Nolte, 24, was called up to the Padres late in the 1987 season and won a 6-0  decision against Houston in his major-league debut. He won only one of his next  seven decisions but pitched well in most games, allowing two or less runs in  eight of his 12 starts.  </P> <P> Nolte made two relief appearances early last season before he was sent down to  Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Nolte, 24, is 2-6 with a 3.33 ERA in 14 major-league games.  </P> <P> Also, McKeon said that outfielder Shane Mack would miss at least a week to 10  days with a sore right elbow. McKeon said it is not known if surgery will be  necessary.  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Tim Flannery walked with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth to give  the Padres (9-4-1) a 9-8 victory over San Francisco (5-11) in front of a  sellout crowd of 6,332 at Sun Desert Stadium Friday night. The Giants had tied  the game at eight with three runs off winning pitcher Pat Clements (1-0) in the  ninth. Flannery walked against losing pitcher Doug Robertson (0-1). Left  fielder Carmelo Martinez hit a three-run homer in the first, his fourth of the  spring and the the Padres' 10th in the past eight games after they failed to  hit one in their first six. They had just nine in 27 spring games last year. .  . . It was the first sellout of a night game in Yuma in the Padres' 21 seasons  here, and the first time they had sold out three consecutive games . . . Padre  first baseman Rob Nelson had a walk, a single, a double and three RBIs in a 7-5  loss in the "B" game. . . . The Padres continue their nine-game home stand  today with their fourth game of the spring against the Giants. Game time is  12:05 PST. Dennis Rasmussen (0-1, 1.29 ERA) will start for the Padres against  the Giants' Don Robinson (0-0, 0.00 ERA). Rasmussen was the losing pitcher in  an 8-6 Giant victory March 8. Mark Grant and Mark Davis also are expected to  pitch for the Padres. Joe Price and Mike LaCoss should see relief work for the  Giants. . . . About 1,000 general admission tickets remain for each of the  Padres' next two games -- today against the Giants and Sunday against Seattle  at 12:05 PST. They will go on sale 2 1/2 hours before each game. . . . The  Padres are expected to make their first cut of the spring sometime this  weekend. They have 43 players in camp, including 36 on the major-league roster.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Rear Admiral Iliya Popov, Bulgarian Navy </F> chief of staff, by Captain 1st Rank Vladimir Pasyakin:  "Bulgaria Will Build Its Own Corvettes and Maintain Friendly  Links With All Navies in the Black Sea"]    [Text] A Bulgarian naval detachment, comprising the  corvette "Reshitelni" and the auxiliary "Kapitan Dimitur  Dobrev," made a routine port call in Novorossiysk. Our  correspondent met with the detachment commander, Rear Admiral  Iliya Popov, Bulgarian navy chief of staff.    [Pasyakin] Mr. Admiral, what is the purpose of your call?    [Popov] In the first place, to continue the development of  friendly links between our navies. Second, we wanted to give  our commissioned and petty officers and seamen an opportunity to  see the sights in this splendid Russian city and to meet with  seamen of the Russian Federation Black Sea Fleet. We used the  sea passage for combat training and improvement of our naval  combat proficiency, including organizing the towing of ships and  keeping watch, and for damage control exercises...    [Pasyakin] In your view, what are the prospects for the  development of relations between our countries and, accordingly,  between navies?    [Popov] I can only talk about relations between our navies,  because relations between countries are the prerogative of  presidents and governments. As well as the contacts that have  already taken place between our navies, this year will see the  "Briz-94" exercise, which is planned for 25-29 July. We have  invited warships from many countries to the exercise. I am  talking about two missile boats from the Romanian Navy, one ship  each from the Ukrainian Navy and Russian Federation Black Sea  Fleet, a Turkish frigate, two missile boats from the Greek Navy,  and two ships from the U.S. 6th Fleet. Representatives from  Georgia have been invited (we know it has no navy, but it does  have access to the Black Sea). Recently I was told that Italy  and France had shown an interest in this exercise. If they ask  to be given the go-ahead to participate, obviously we will agree.    As for contacts with the Russian Navy, we have already  exchanged preliminary protocols, which we intend to sign. They  take account of what kind of ties there will be between our  navies. On the basis of the protocol we will then sign a  bilateral cooperation plan. In July there will be the exercise  I talked about. In August the training ship "Gangut," carrying  students from Russian naval schools, will call on us in Varna.    We have also planned some events for next year and they have  already been agreed with our general staff. At the end of  April, for example, we intend to hold a symposium, inviting all  the countries of the Black Sea and Mediterranean regions. This  symposium will be similar to the one in 1993. On that occasion  we entertained visitors from 14 countries. This time we expect  there to be more.    [Pasyakin] What are the aims and tasks of the exercise you  mentioned?    [Popov] The task is Bulgarian Navy participation in  peacemaking operations to provide humanitarian aid. The aims?  First and foremost, to have the opportunity to get acquainted  with representatives of the various fleets we have invited, to  exchange experience. Second, to test communications and  rehearse collaboration between ships from different states, and  joint actions on damage control and protection of transports  delivering humanitarian aid, and assisting a submarine "in  distress"... In short, rehearsing episodes of a nonoffensive  nature.    [Pasyakin] Mr. Admiral, how does Bulgaria intend to update  its navy? According to my information, you used to buy your  ships and equipment from the USSR.    [Popov] We are certainly faced with the task of updating our  pool of ships. But it is too expensive buying other countries'  ships. So this question, after consultation with the general  staff and the Defense Ministry, evolved into the elaboration of  our own national shipbuilding program. Civilian institutes with  shipbuilding associations, shipyards, scientific research  institutes, and plants producing what goes into ships --  communications facilities, radar and navigation equipment,  armaments -- are participating in its creation.    The approval of the program by the general staff military  council is planned for the summer. Then it will go to the  Council of Ministers for its approval. Why? Because the  intention is that the money should come not from the Defense  Ministry budget, but direct from the state budget.    We are unable to buy foreign military technology with hard  currency. It is very important too that the allocated funds  should circulate within the country, creating jobs. We also  want to involve other countries in the implementatioon of the  program. And I am not just talking about foreign investments in  our industry. You will agree that it is extravagant to make two  or three ships just for our navy. Series production, that is,  for other countries too, is cheaper.    [Pasyakin] Incidentally, what class of ships do you intend  to build?    [Popov] Primarily, "corvette" class, of 900-1,2000 tonnes.  But if we find a country that agrees to participate in this  project, then serial production will increase, and we will even  try to enter the world market. And not only with corvettes. I  am talking about minesweepers and missile boats as well.    [Pasyakin] Since we are talking about financial problems,  the next question is what is the naval funding situation? At  the reception on your ship I saw publicity from several  Bulgarian firms...    [Popov] The finance, and I am talking about the upkeep of  ships, seamen's pay, and all the rest, comes out of the state  budget. As for visits and foreign port calls by our ships, like  this one, we get a lot of help from sponsors -- individual firms  with which we conclude contracts. Sponsorship takes the form of  goods. Gifts, souvenirs, food, drink. We are forbidden to  accept money. We, in turn, advertise these firms' goods in  foreign ports.    [Pasyakin] Mr. Admiral, what is Bulgarian military doctrine  in relation to your navy based on today?    [Popov] A military doctrine has been adopted in Bulgaria  which obliges us to defend the country. It is not possible for  us to create a big navy in the Black Sea. The navies of the  Black Sea states are much stronger than ours. The idea behind  the development of the Bulgarian Navy, in accordance with the  military doctrine, is based on the navy's basic task of  weakening as much as possible forces that are trying to attack  us from the sea. That is, to cause the enemy losses that would  frustrate its aggressive plans. That is, the navy's tasks are  purely defensive.    [Pasyakin] I know that the Soviet Navy's ships used to be  repaired at Bulgaria's "Flotski Arsenal" and "Odessos" yards.  What is the state of affairs in this sphere today?    [Popov] It is difficult to give a full answer, because the  repair yard in Varna is not under naval control, but is directly  linked to the ministry. I cannot say what the enterprise's  plans are, but I would point out that a delegation from the  Russian Defense Ministry went to Varna in April. An  understanding was reached on the repair of Russian ships at our  yard. We are interrested in these contacts. Russian orders  will strengthen the yard's position, and ours too, since  "Flotski Arsenal" also repairs the Bulgarian Navy's ships.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / People: Succession becomes clearer at M and S Clinton Silver, deputy chairman and joint managing director of Marks and Spencer, is retiring at the end of July after 42 years with the company. He is to be replaced as deputy chairman by fellow joint MD, Keith Oates. The appointment is seen as marking out Oates (right) as the likely successor to chairman Sir Richard Greenbury - a prospect welcomed yesterday by City analysts. In three years as vice chairman, Silver, 64, has seen Marks and Spencer regain from J. Sainsbury the title of the UK's most profitable retailer. He is described by company insiders as having 'an encyclopaedic knowledge of the business' and as having provided invaluable support to Sir Richard. Analysts say the affable Silver formed an effective partnership with his more ebullient chairman. He is likely to retain some links with M&amp;S through his chairmanship of the British Fashion Council. Silver, 64, joined M&amp;S in 1952 and held several positions in head office before being appointed an alternate director in 1974 and a director in 1978. He became a joint MD in January 1990, responsible for buying all clothing, homeware and food. Oates, 51, by contrast, is not a career M&amp;S man, joining as finance director in 1984. A strong personality with a sharp financial brain, he has been the driving force behind M&amp;S's expansion in the financial services field. He spent seven years in finance at IBM and four at Black and Decker's European headquarters in Brussels, before spending six years with Thyssen-Bornemisza in Monaco, where he rose to become vice-president, finance. Oates was appointed joint managing director of M&amp;S in 1991, with responsibilities for finance, group expenditure and overseas operations. He was a governor of the BBC from 1988 to last year. M&amp;S also announced the creation of three new managing directors' posts - one of whom, analysts suggest, may be the next chairman but one. Andrew Stone, since 1990 director responsible for ladies' outerwear and lingerie, becomes MD responsible for clothing, homeware and general merchandise. Guy McCracken, director responsible for the food division since January 1993, becomes managing director with responsibility for food. Peter Salsbury, director of personnel since 1990 and of store operations since last year, becomes MD with the additional responsibilities of store development and estates. In addition, Derek Hayes, divisional director responsible for European retail operations, and Barry Morris, divisional director responsible for womenswear, are both promoted to the board.</p>

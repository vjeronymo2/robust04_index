			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 19, IRNA -- The English daily `KAYHAN  INTERNATIONAL' Thursday said that Saudi Arabia for the past two  decades has made efforts to alter the centuries-old concept of  hajj. The daily wrote in its editorial that it was not solely a  product of "Wahhabi house of Saud" but a declaration jointly  engineered by the western forces of arrogance. It stressed that  King Fahd, for understandable reasons, could not tolerate even  peaceful demos against the U.S., Israel and other enemies of  Islam on `his' territory.    Turning to the deployment of Saudi security forces around  the  Iranian pilgrims headquarters this week, the paper noted that  the heavy military concentration around the building was  regarded as another recipe for disaster had the `deliverance  from unbelievers' rally taken place. "The world is not unaware  of Saudi Arabia's military, political and economic ties with  Washington and how American strategists (with due help from  Britain) advise the royal family on everything from gardening to  foreign-policy making," wrote the article. "If Muslims unite,"  the daily suggested, "no earthly power can resist them. Evil  powers are well aware of this and thus cannot bear to see  hundreds and thousands of pilgrims condemning their interference  in Muslim affairs."    KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL concluded by saying that the Saudi  rulers will never command the respect of the ummah for indulging  in practices detrimental to the lofty cause of Islam and its  followers. "They should open their eyes to the stark realities  of today's world in which nations big and small want their  leaders to get out of America's satanic orbit. For how long can  the `guardians of the holy shrines' keep alien interest on the  top of their national agenda?"</p>

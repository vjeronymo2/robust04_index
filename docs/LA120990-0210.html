			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> DR. KOOKIE, YOU'RE RIGHT! By Mike Royko (Plume: $8.95). This latest collection  of Chicago Tribune columns confirms Mike Royko's position as one of the  guardians of respectable American yahooism, a position he shares with Andy  Rooney.  </P> <P> There's something patently false about a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer posing  as an everday Joe Sixpack who hangs out with his buddy, Slats Grobnik, but  Royko plays the role to the hilt. He rails against anti-smoking crusaders,  lawyers, yuppies (although he admits he lives like one), health food and  feminism: "But even the most hard-nosed of feminists must concede that during  the past two decades, great strides have been made. I know dozens of women who  swear better than me." Royko's blue-collar persona allows him to vent otherwise  unacceptable prejudices under the guise of just-one-of-the-boys goodfellowship.

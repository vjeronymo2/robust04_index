In a statement he published jointly with current Ingush Vice  President Boris Agapov in Nazran today, Aushev pointed out that  "the people's will was above all for him."    During his meeting with candidates to the new republican  parliament which will be re-elected on the same day, Aushev was  told that the people will boycott the elections and a referendum  on the new Ingush constitution if he refused nomination for  president.    The statement points out: "We, with respect to the revival  of  the statehood of the Ingush people, consolidation of the people  of Ingushetia in the name of peace and prosperity, having  respect for numerous requests, oral and written addresses by  workers, elders, clergymen, youth and representatives of all  other layers of society and considering it impossible not to  meet their wishes, express our consent to fulfil the duties of  president and vice president of Ingushetia, if our powers are  confirmed at the elections on February 27, 1994."    Observers believe that their statement is actually a form of  registration for president and vice president. Their opinion  was later confirmed by the central election commission chairman,  Batyr Taldiyev.</p>

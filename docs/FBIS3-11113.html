			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso announced  on 9 March that import tariffs on a long list of products that  are manufactured by sectors that are run by oligopolies will be  reduced to 2 percent. This is the government reaction to the  indifference shown by the oligopolies to the stabilization plan  and to excessive price increases. The list includes food  products (canned food in general), cleaning and hygiene products  (razor blades, toothpaste, tooth brushes, etc.), tires, ink,  dyes, varnish, and chemicals used for the production of  medicines. The minister said: "This measure will solve this  problem. The country cannot bear speculation. Speculators will  see that the government will take a firm line."    The measure is a victory for the group within the government  which advocates stronger intervention to check price increases,  over another more liberal group which managed to shelve a  provisional measure that sought to regulate action against  abuses.    Minister Cardoso said the government saw that prices of  products whose import tariffs will be reduced were increased far  beyond the inflation rate of the past 12 months. Cardoso said  the resolutions to reduc these tariffs -- there are  approximately 20 -- will be published in today's official  gazette. Consequently, as of today importers will be able to  bring those products to the domestic market at lower prices.    Cardoso said: "I believe this measure will send a strong  signal that the government is determined to prevent  speculation." Beside reducing customs tariffs, the government  will enforce measures to de-bureaucratize imports and facilitate  the purchase of foreign products.    The government published in yesterday's official gazette a  list of 33 chemicals used for manufacturing medicines whose  import tariffs were reduced to zero. The measure is valid until  31 December 1994, because Mercosur [Common Market of the South]  regulations will come into force on 1 January 1995.    Jose Milton Dallari, a special adviser to Minister Cardoso  and a member of the so-called more liberal group within the  government, does not support a control on the prices of  oligopolies' products. He said: "If I go to a supermarket and  protested against price increases, what would happen? Nothing,  because people are tired of it." He says this is the main  reason why he supports negotiating abusive price increases,  discarding the idea of imprisonment, which Minister Cardoso has  advocated.</p>

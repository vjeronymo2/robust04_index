			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]  <H5>  Synapse is Faster </H5>   Neural networks for specific applications on conventional  computers are already marketable. The trend is towards  universally applicable neurocomputers made of special hard and  software. Siemens researchers have developed such a high-power  computer.    The modern broker no longer depends only on his nose. Nor  must he rely on the supernatural. The computer forecasts stock  trends for him with greater probability.    Conventionally structured computers must suffice for such  tasks. Complex interrelations of this sort cannot be completely  described mathematically. The usual devices with von Neumann  architecture can only process given algorithms sequentially, and  then only if the input information is complete.    It is precisely this handicap which is overcome by specific  software which imitates the functions of the human brain, the  neural network.    The brain, working together with nerve fibers and sensory  organs, can comprehend and classify things, even if the input  information is incomplete. The information is stored  associatively, i.e. in specific interrelations. This makes the  brain capable of learning. Since it builds up its connecting  structures itself in accordance with actual conditions, it is  also self-organizing. Millions of neurons work as active  processors, linked by nerve fibers (axons) terminating in  contact points which are connected in parallel to each other. In  the brain of an adult human, there are approximately  10[.sup]13[/] such synapses.    A neural network imitates brain function in a greatly  simplified fashion using mathematical algorithms. Like its human  counterpart, it is capable of learning and can thus be trained  to recognize specific patterns. Numerous models were developed  for this, from the simple algorithm with hardwired neurons to  models in which the connections are formed by self-organization.    First generation applications like the stock market  forecaster mentioned in the introduction run on powerful  workstations or other conventional computers. However, real time  processing of language, processing of moving images and complex  controls can no longer be carried out in this way. Therefore the  trend in hardware is towards special components and chips  (ASICS), which are significantly faster.    Heretofore, solutions have been tailor-made for special uses  and have not been universally applicable.    Therefore, at the Central Research Department of Siemens AG  in Munich they have gone one step further with a two-year  project on the SYNAPSE-1 neurocomputer.    "Our goal," says the director of the development team, Dr.  Ulrich Ramacher, "was to build a neural special computer on  which the simulation of any desired neural networks and learning  algorithms is possible." The Munich researchers have used a  new system architecture for the neurocomputer, developed the  MA-16 signal processor, and created their own software. Prior to  this, various network models were analyzed. Dr. Ramacher: "The  analysis showed that there are 25 different compute-bound basic  operations for which it is worth developing a special chip. That  is what we have done."    The result is the largest pure logic chip developed at  Siemens. It has 610,000 transistors on an area two centimeters  square. Its more than 200 connections and clock frequency of 50  MHz allow an input-output rate of 10.9 gigabits per second. At  the same time, the architecture of SYNAPSE-1 was so designed  from the beginning that processor performance and memory size  can be adapted to specific applications.    Dr. Ramacher is proud that SYNAPSE-1 is at least 8,000 times  faster than conventional solutions. One hour of computing time  on the neurocomputer corresponds to 8,000 hours on the latest  SUN-Workstation. At this year's CeBIT in Hannover, Siemens  researchers showed a sample application in which eight  incomplete images were reconstructed in 62 milliseconds. For one  such image, a workstation would have taken longer than two  minutes.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Pension groups put a little aside for the future: Alison Smith explains the impact on life groups of mis-selling Legal &amp; General last week became the latest UK life insurer to admit to making provisions to cover potential compensation to people who suffered from poor advice to transfer out of an occupational pensions scheme. But, like several others, it refused to reveal the extent of its provisioning. There is no reason to expect Prudential - the UK's largest life insurer - and Sun Alliance, whose annual results are due today and Thursday respectively, to be more forthcoming. Some have given a little more away. Refuge Group, the life insurer, announced this month that it had made provisions totalling Pounds 11.6m  - leaving 1993 pre-tax profits of Pounds 24.3m - for possible compensation in respect of pension transfer cases. It would not say how many it had sold. Only National &amp; Provincial, the UK's eighth largest building society (with pre-tax profits of Pounds 121m), gave an approximate breakdown: Pounds 2m provisions in respect of its 850 pension transfer cases. Only when both sides of the equation are offered can any sort of extrapolation be made for the cost to the whole financial services sector. If the same level of provisioning was adopted by other insurers, banks and building societies, the total for the 500,000-plus pension transfers sold since 1988 would be well over Pounds 1bn. Mr David Prosser, L&amp;G chief executive, argued that to reveal the figures for provisioning, or even to give an 'order of magnitude', would be unhelpful since it would fuel speculation. There is a risk that refusing to give any indication may lead the market to think that the position for individual companies is worse than it will turn out to be. It is true, however, that firm judgments about provisioning and compensation arrangements must await the work of the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator. The SIB's guidance is due to be published in July. But next month it will tell organisations which are the priority categories - such as people coming up to retirement or who transferred out of index-linked schemes. Some important issues bearing on the cost of compensation remain unresolved  -including the basic question of who should be eligible. As the life insurance industry never tires of pointing out, even in files where the information recorded is seriously incomplete, customers could still have received satisfactory advice and be better off than if they had stayed in their previous employers' schemes. In many instances the question will be more complex - where a customer received advice that was suspect at the time of the decision, but which seems to have been vindicated because of the buoyancy of the stock market; or whether a customer should be able to revisit the original decision where the information was incomplete although the advice seems satisfactory. Even after the ground-rules for who should be compensated have been set, the question of how this should be done remains unanswered. The life industry and its regulators believe that compensation arrangements should be settled promptly, rather than leave organisations with liabilities stretching on until their pension transfer customers reach retirement. The SIB proposals seem likely to offer some variant on giving the victim of poor advice the choice of either staying in a personal pension - enhanced with some 'top-up' payment from the life company - or being reinstated in the scheme of their previous employer. The costs of reinstatement vary according to the scheme from which the lump sum was transferred and the performance of the personal pension. But some idea of possible sums can be drawn from examples given by Mr Mike Wadsworth, a partner at consulting actuaries, R Watson &amp; Co. The illustrations cite a 35-year-old man with 30 years to normal retirement and 10 years' service with his ex-employer, transferring a lump sum of Pounds 10,000 from a scheme providing 1/60th of pay for each year of service. If he had transferred out of the scheme on March 1, 1989, it would cost almost Pounds 19,600 to reinstate him on March 1, 1994, plus perhaps Pounds 200 in administrative charges levied by the scheme, while the value of his personal pension would be Pounds 17,400 - a shortfall of Pounds 2,200 plus charges. If he transferred out of the scheme on March 1 1991, the overall shortfall would be only Pounds 600. Although the relationship between individual examples and the cost to companies is tenuous, the figures suggest the total bill for the sector may be nearer Pounds 500m than Pounds 1bn. The co-operation of occupational pension schemes in taking former members back would be essential. Mr Ron Amy, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds, is on the committee set up to advise the SIB board. But though the NAPF has discussed the issue, its members' views differ so sharply that there is no collective stance. Some, such as the mineworkers' pension scheme, are allowing former members to return. But others, such as British Steel and Unilever, are not. In the interests of resolving the matter cleanly, the Treasury is likely to exert moral pressure on schemes which do not want to reinstate former members. But what this will mean in practice - like so much else - will not be clear until after the SIB makes its July report.</p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAM NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> 49ERS MISS LOTT MORE THAN FOES  </P> <P> How much did the San Francisco 49ers miss Pro Bowl free safety Ronnie Lott,  sidelined Sunday by a bad ankle?  </P> <P> Enough that the Rams were glad he was a no-show.  </P> <P> "When (Lott's) not in there, you can take your rib pads off," said Pete Holohan  of Lott, who has carved out a reputation as one of the league's fiercest  hitters. "He's a stud."  </P> <P> Said quarterback Jim Everett: "Lott being out made a difference. I'm not blind.  I've always called him the glue of (their) defense."  </P> <P> In Lott's place Sunday was Jeff Fuller. He had six tackles and an assist, but  hardly was the force Lott is during a game.  </P> <P> "Ronnie Lott's a great player. When a guy like (Lott) isn't in there, you  obviously get hurt, to some degree," Holohan said. "The guys that were in there  filling in did a really good job. It's not like we dominated them by any  means."  </P> <P> Running back Cleveland Gary made his long-awaited Ram debut and was less than  spectacular.  </P> <P> Then again, he only was given two chances to carry the ball.  </P> <P> Used sparingly -- partly because of the tight score and partly because the  49ers were shutting down the Ram running attack -- Gary gained five yards on  his first National Football League rushing attempt. It came on the last play of  the first period.  </P> <P> Gary's second and final run of the day took place in the second quarter and  resulted in no gain.  </P> <P> But look at this way: it's only one yard less than Gaston Green has rushed for  this season.  </P> <P> "I felt good," Gary said. "I'm just happy to be part of a winning team."  </P> <P> If Gary was nervous about the debut, he wasn't showing it.  </P> <P> "There's no pressure on me," he said. "I was very relaxed. But I'm very glad to  get my professional football career started. Coach (John) Robinson has worked  with me. I feel more confident with the offense."  </P> <P> Wide receiver Flipper Anderson continues to receive rave reviews. And why not?  He caught four passes for 112 yards, including a 65-yarder for a touchdown.  </P> <P> "Willie Anderson has made great strides and he continues to get better,"  Robinson said.  </P> <P> Said Anderson: "I thought I might see a lot of single coverage today. I gave  the cornerback a little stutter step and he bit on it all the way."  </P> <P> The touchdown catch was the longest of his entire playing career and the first  of his NFL career.  </P> <P> The 49ers lost the game, but not their confidence.  </P> <P> Bubba Paris, veteran offensive tackle, said, "It's extremely disappointing to  lose, but we have all the talent and character that's needed to go out and  capture another Super Bowl."  </P> <P> Coach George Seifert was discouraged by the loss and by the sluggish manner in  which the team began Sunday. "We've got to come back," he said. "This team has  certainly done it before."  </P> <P> Mike Cofer of San Francisco outkicked counterpart Mike Lansford, four field  goals to two, but was hoping for a chance at a game-winning field goal himself.  </P> <P> "I just hope I get the chance to kick the winning field goal next time," he  said. "I'm a little bit more relaxed this year, but before the games, I still  get the same old butterflies I had in high school. I guess they'll always be  there."  </P> <P> Tom Rathman on the fumble that set up the Rams' winning drive: "I felt like . .  . coming off the field. Everybody tries to cheer you up, but you feel like the  butt of the team."  </P> <P> Add Rathman: "The last time I remember making a crucial fumble was in my rookie  year against Denver in a preseason game. Back then I was just a frisky  freshman, fighting for everything I could get."  </P> <P> Said Joe Montana, quarterback, philosopher: "It's a funny thing about the game,  sometimes it happens that way."  </P></p>

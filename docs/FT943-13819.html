			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / People: Ear to the ground at CS First Boston - Names in the News It has been clear for some time that Allen Wheat was not going to let himself become another casualty of CS First Boston's notorious in-fighting, writes Richard Waters. Last year, this newspaper was rash enough to question whether Wheat had been sidelined in the latest upheaval at the Swiss-owned investment bank; interpreting the politics inside CS First Boston has always been like Kremlin-watching in the days of the Soviet empire. Wheat's blunt response was to point out who makes all the money in the bank. These days, it looks like Wheat's staying- (and earning-) power are carrying him closer to the top. In May, he was given a seat on the board of CS Holdings, the investment bank's ultimate parent. At the same time, John Hennessy, CS First Boston's chairman, relinquished his board seat. No one in the securities industry questions Wheat's professional skills. He was largely responsible for building Bankers Trust's derivatives business before jumping ship in 1990. Since then, he has created another leading derivatives firm in CS Financial Products, which is half-owned by CS First Boston and Credit Suisse, another part of the group. And last year he moved from London to New York (the new seat of power at the investment bank, which used to be run as separate US and European fiefdoms) as president and ceo. Modern-day Kremlin watchers should beware of writing off Hennessy too soon, though. Last year, he mounted an amazing internal coup to take full control of CS First Boston. Casualties along the way included Archibald Cox (his former number two in New York) and Hans-Jorg Rudloff (the bank's former London head.) CS First Boston warns against reading anything into the reshuffle of board seats at the holding company. The presidents of each of the group's operating companies - rather than the chairmen - are represented on the board, it points out. So when Hennessy handed over his president's title to Wheat, it was only natural that the new man get the board seat as well. Perhaps. But experience shows few things at the bank are ever as simple.</p>

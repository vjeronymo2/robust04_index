			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANT OF THE WEEK: GARDENING  </P> <P> Thymus vulgaris  </P> <P> Common thyme  </P> <P> Perennial herb with small, aromatic leaves  </P> <P> Despite all the attention lavished on basil in recent years, thyme is still one  of the most popular kitchen herbs, essential in French cuisine.  </P> <P> An herb publication once advised: "When in doubt, use thyme." It enhances  without overwhelming, the leaves are so small they don't need to be chopped,  and, most important, dried thyme leaves are as pungent as the fresh ones. Dried  basil is pathetic.  </P> <P> Thyme is also a terrific plant for Southern California; it prefers lots of sun;  poor, sandy soil and little irrigation, except for desert areas (thyme should  be watered at ground level; wet leaves lose their fragrance). In most parts of  Los Angeles, thyme is a constant, never dying. Like another Mediterranean herb,  rosemary, thyme is virtually carefree.  </P> <P> Unlike rosemary, thyme isn't much of a landscape plant. It stays low, about 12  inches, and spreads about 18 to 24 inches. Because of this compact size, thyme  is comfortable in containers.  </P> <P> In summer, tiny lilac-colored flowers almost cover the plants; for drying, cut  the stems just before or during flowering. Hang the stems upside down in the  shade, and when they are completely dried, strip off the leaves and flowers and  keep in an airtight container. The leaves are so tiny and so far apart on the  stems that they will probably yield a smaller batch than expected.  </P> <P> Although thyme is best known as a culinary herb, it has other uses. The  Egyptians used it for embalming -- and it's still an ingredient in that  process; the Scots drank thyme tea to prevent nightmares; to the ancient  Romans, thyme meant courage, and soldiers bathed in thyme water to strengthen  themselves before battle.  </P> <P> Common thyme can be propagated from stem cuttings, best done in spring, and it  grows easily from seed, but many of the unusual thymes (caraway, coconut,  lemon, among others) can't be grown from seed. Thymus vulgaris seeds are tiny,  so they should be covered with only the barest amount of planting medium and  kept moist (but not wet) until they're large enough to plant into the garden.  If thyme seeds are not carried by a local nursery, any seed catalogue with an  herb section will have them.  </P> <P> Likewise, almost any nursery with an herb section will carry thyme plants.  Finding (and growing) this plant is no challenge -- but it is deliciously  rewarding nonetheless. JUDITH SIMS  </P></p>

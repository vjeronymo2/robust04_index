			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: HE HAS HELP FOLLOWING TOUGH ACT  </P> <P> All right, what do George Selkirk, Hunk Anderson, Gene Tunney, Gene Bartow,  Phil Bengston, Babe Dahlgren, Garry Maddox, Mychal Thompson and the guy who  shot Wild Bill Hickok have in common?  </P> <P> Easy. They all replaced legends. In most cases, the public never forgave them.  </P> <P> Selkirk replaced Babe Ruth; Anderson replaced Knute Rockne. Bartow took over  for John Wooden. Tunney, of course, took Dempsey's title. Bengston was the  Green Bay Packers' coach after Lombardi. Maddox played center field for San  Francisco after Willie Mays left. Dahlgren took over first base from Lou  Gehrig, and Hickok was murdered by a one-eyed scoundrel named Jack McCall.  </P> <P> This leaves Mychal Thompson as the resident legend-replacer of our times and a  member in good standing of the L.E.P.E.R. Society (Legends Primary Emergency  Replacements).  </P> <P> Mychal had the bad luck to be standing next in line when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  retired. It's not exactly the world's greatest place to be. Abdul-Jabbar, it so  happened, had 38,387 points in his career. When he retired, they gave him  everything but Rhode Island. He dominated the game of basketball in the way --  well, say, a Ruth, Rockne, Dempsey, Gehrig, Mays, Lombardi or Wild Bill Hickok  dominated their games.  </P> <P> It's not likely Mychal Thompson will get any farewell tours when he leaves the  game. The chances are he will fall somewhat short of Kareem's 38,387 -- he's  26,147 behind as this is written. The probability is not good he will ever  catch up to Abdul-Jabbar's 17,440 rebounds. It takes a really special kind of  person to replace a legend. Not everyone can handle it. It crushes some people.  Others take the position it's hard, dirty work but somebody has to do it. Don't  expect to find Mychal Thompson perched on a ledge above city traffic or down  and out onSkid Row, clutching a wine bottle and moaning, "Why couldn't it have  been Ralph Sampson I took over for?!"  </P> <P> Mychal is very good at taking things in stride. There are those who think he  has made an art form of it.  </P> <P> Mychal is not one to sit and brood. Mychal rolls with the punches. Some men,  performing in the shadow of a departed legend, would develop all manner of  tics, begin to lose weight, spend sleepless nights, start to talk to  themselves, become recluses. Roger Maris, when he was breaking Ruth's homer  record, found his hair falling out overnight.  </P> <P> Mychal's hair is just fine. He sleeps like a baby. His appetite is as good as  ever, which is pretty good.  </P> <P> For one thing, Mychal has found a sure-fire way to escape the obloquy that  comes with the role. He shares the billing. Mychal does not take the rap alone.  </P> <P> You see, Mychal's team, the Lakers, went out over the off-season and signed the  best center in Serbia to share the pivot with Mychal.  </P> <P> Now, the nice thing about Vlade Divac is that, while he knows very well who  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is, he doesn't have a firm enough grasp on English to know  when someone is yelling at him, "Call yourself a center, Divac?! Jabbar would  have sky-hooked that thing and drawn a foul." Vlade is perfect as a legend  replacement. Vlade's hair is not going to fall out, either.  </P> <P> Which suits Mychal. When someone asks him, as a reporter did in the Laker  dressing room the other night, whether he thinks his progress as a legend  replacement is going smoothly, he answers sweetly, "I feel we're doing a good  job."  </P> <P> We?!  </P> <P> Now, there are lots of We's in the world. Lindbergh always cut his airplane in  on the glory, and "We" was the title of his autobiography. Queen Victoria  always referred to herself in the plural: "We are not amused." Fight managers  always say, "We knocked out the champ." But of course, when things go wrong,  Tonto says to the Lone Ranger, "Where do you get that we stuff, Kemo Sabe!?"  </P> <P> So, Mychal lets Vlade get cards in this deal. Basketball is a team game, right?  Mychal is a guy who can delegate.  </P> <P> Mychal is a guy who has his own outlook on life, anyway. Mychal goes through  life as if he's riding an elephant.  </P> <P> For instance, most people who live in the snow belt or rust belt work all their  lives so they can move to the Bahamas or anywhere the beaches are white and  coconuts grow in the backyard.  </P> <P> Mychal was born there -- in Nassau -- and he chose to move to Minnesota as soon  as he graduated from high school -- in Miami, would you believe?  </P> <P> Mychal passed up Florida State and other orange blossom schools and went north  to Minneapolis. The fact he was bucking a trend apparently eluded him, even  though his friends wondered, "What did you have against Hudson Bay?"  </P> <P> Usually, when a green rookie opts for a region of the country where he needs a  ski cap to go down for the mail, the next scene sees him pulling every string  he can think of to get back to the sun and sand. Not Mychal. He loved  Minnesota. Mychal was so happy, he made All-American twice, set school records  in scoring, rebounding and scoring average -- and this on a team that had Kevin  McHale on it. "I loved it up there, it had a great purity about it," he  insists.  </P> <P> When Mychal got drafted in the pros by Portland, he was delighted. Mychal likes  carrying an umbrella. He still keeps a house in the Northwest.  </P> <P> So, Mychal is not deterred by the role into which history has cast him.  Particularly since he comes as part of an entry, Mychal Thompson and Vlade  Divac, Nos. 1 and 1A.  </P> <P> "We match up pretty well," Mychal insists. To date, Thompson-Divac have almost  evenly split 894 points and 606 rebounds. Which compares to the 748 points  Abdul-Jabbar had his last season or even the 1,165 he had in his next-to-last  season, and to the rebound total Abdul-Jabbar had of 523 1in his next-to-last  season or 334 his last season.  </P> <P> As usual, Kareem is being double-teamed. So, Mychal makes no apology. It  strikes him as the proper way to tackle a legend on or off the court -- get  help.  </P> <P> He is even hoping to make Divac a better player. "He doesn't need any help on  his offense, but I can teach him a few things on defense," Mychal says.  </P> <P> So, what does Mychal Thompson have in common with George Selkirk, Hunk Anderson  and the other legend-replacers of our times? Absolutely nothing. Mychal knows  better than to go it alone. Mychal knows something those other replacers  didn't: You can't go man-to-man with a legend. You have to zone him.  </P></p>

			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Arts: Mendelssohn Foundation A Mendelssohn Foundation has been established in Leipzig, Germany, based at the Gewandhaus, home of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. Its first task will be to rescue the Mendelssohn House, the composer's residence in Leipzig, from years of neglect and threatened development as a hotel. The Foundation plans instead to establish it as an international cultural centre. The Royal Philharmonic Society, based in London, was invited to become one of the founder members.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec warned of sharp price falls The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in Geneva today to debate whether to cut production in the hope that it will lift prices. Market expectations are that the 12 oil ministers are most likely to simply roll over the 24.52m barrel a day production ceiling agreed last September. But the OPEC secretariat is reported to have warned delegates last night that further sharp price falls could occur unless they agree to a cut. A secretariat report predicted that prices could fall to single digits unless action was taken. It said only a 1.5m barrel a day cut would be enough to give prices a substantial boost. But a Gulf Arab delegate said the report was clearly 'biased' in favour of those advocating a production cut. The report will be one of the first items on the agenda when ministers formally meet today. A series of informal contacts, including a meeting between the Saudi and Iranian oil ministers, took place last night. The main issue is whether the current ceiling is appropriate for market conditions. Earlier this year it proved to be too high in light of a surge in oil production from non-Opec countries, in particular from British and Norwegian fields in the North Sea. Pressure on supplies sent prices tumbling to five year lows. In recent weeks severe winter weather in the US boosted demand and helped to underpin oil markets. But prices have struggled to rise above the Dollars 13-Dollars 14 a barrel range for the benchmark Brent Blend. Even the wealthiest Opec states, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, have had to rein in budgets. The impact on the poor and populous Opec members such as Iran and Nigeria has been such that some observers predict that their fragile political stability might be undermined unless oil revenues can be increased. The roll-over option is unlikely to bring about any short-term relief for producers. But it is supported by analysts who predict that demand for Opec oil is likely to grow later in the year. 'They don't need to make any grand gestures,' according to Dr Leonidas Drollas, economist at the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies. 'Stocks are not that high and the call on Opec oil is roughly at current levels.' An Iranian delegate yesterday indicated that a roll over was not the favoured option. But analysts say Iran may be struggling to maintain current output. A small cut of 500,000b/d or so would not impress the markets, however. 'What is the point of a symbolic cut?' asks Mr Mehdi Varzi, director of energy research at London brokers Kleinwort Benson. 'If they cut, they have to make it convincing.' Saudi Arabia, Opec's dominant producer, objects to any strategy which would result in non-Opec producers winning additional market share. It is also worried that a large cut would trigger renewed over-production by some members.</p>

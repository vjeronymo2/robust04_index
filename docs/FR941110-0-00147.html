			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The secondary factors are not less important;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they just come later in the process of selecting an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate remedy or remedies. However, we are replacing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the word ``secondary'' with the word ``other'' to avoid any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further confusion. The first step is to assess the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seriousness of the deficiency(ies), including the presence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or absence of immediate jeopardy, to determine the minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended categories of remedies to impose, as well as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested optional categories from which to choose. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other factors (that is, the relationship of one deficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to other deficiencies, and the facility's prior compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> history in general and specifically with reference to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cited deficiencies) assist in making choices from among all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies available in any of the categories applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Other commenters want the compliance history  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the facility to remain secondary because facilities with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a change of ownership and/or personnel may not be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise emerge positively due to poor compliance in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> past. It was suggested that we change &sect;408.404 (proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at &sect;488.208) accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We did not revise the regulations text to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect this suggestion. A facility's prior compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> history should be considered regardless of a change in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ownership. A facility is purchased ``as is.'' The new owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acquires the compliance history, good or bad, as well as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets. While we agree that after consideration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's compliance history, HCFA or the State may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclude that such history is no longer a valid predictive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor of the facility's ability to achieve and maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance (for example, following a change of ownership  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the new owner ``cleans house'') the burden of proof is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the new owner to demonstrate that poor past performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no longer is a predictive factor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Other commenters wanted additional factors to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be considered in addition to those outlined in &sect;488.404  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (proposed at &sect;488.208). The suggestions for additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether the deficiency or deficiencies are directly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to resident care;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The corrective, long-term compliance, resident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective, and non-punitive outcomes sought by the agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The facility's degree of culpability;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The accuracy, extent, and availability of facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The facility's financial condition;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Any adverse effect that the remedy would have on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health and safety of facility residents;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether there has been a change in ownership or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation of the facility;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The facility's action to correct the deficiency prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the conclusion of the survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  While we are not expanding &sect;488.404 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include these additional factors, there is nothing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preclude HCFA or the State from considering any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors they believe to be relevant in the decision-making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process. We are, however, revising &sect;488.404(b) to clarify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the other factors that HCFA and the State may consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include, but are not limited to, only those factors listed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because we do not want to limit valid assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations unnecessarily, we do not desire to provide an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all-inclusive list. We realize that it is impossible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predict every factor that would have a bearing on every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular case. The two factors that we have included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulatory model have a direct bearing on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of the most appropriate remedy or remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have explained above how the interrelationships among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies can impact the decision to impose one as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposed to several remedies. The second factor, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's prior compliance history, is pertinent because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 1819(h)(2)(B), 1919(h)(2)(A), and 1919(h)(3)(C) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act provide for increased penalty amounts for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncorrected or repeated noncompliance. Moreover, sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposition of the denial of payment remedy for repeated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substandard quality of care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter didn't believe that surveyors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should make binding decisions regarding remedies, but rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this authority should be retained by the surveyors'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervisor in order to promote centralization as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistency in decision making.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / 'Police recruited men to attack ANC supporters' TWO gang members said police in the Zulu homeland recruited, trained and armed them to carry out attacks on African National Congress supporters, it was reported yesterday, AP writes from Johannesburg. The report in the anti-government Weekly Mail said the men, identified only as Lucas and Themba, were trained at a base used by the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party, the main rival of the African National Congress. The ANC has long alleged that security forces, in an effort to destabilise the black opposition movement, helped Inkatha in clashes between supporters of the two groups. Fighting between the ANC and Inkatha, the two largest black movements, has claimed thousands of lives in recent years. In previous reports, the Weekly Mail disclosed secret government payments to Inkatha that led to the demotion of two cabinet members and a promise from President FW de Klerk to halt covert funding of political parties. Subsequent reports on the scandal have included allegations that government funding of Inkatha has continued and that Inkatha supporters received military training. A government-appointed judicial commission said last week it would investigate the allegations.</p>

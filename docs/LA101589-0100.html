			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE NORTHERN LIGHTS;  </P> <P> SCIENTISTS IN POLAR AREAS GO WITH GLOW  </P> <P> A geomagnetic storm battering the Earth's poles is growing increasingly  violent, and northern lights researchers call it the best thing that's ever  happened to them.  </P> <P> The storm, caused by the bombardment of energy from solar activity, is making  the shimmering aurora borealis brighter, more colorful and more spectacular  than usual this year.  </P> <P> Unni Pia Loevhaug, a space researcher, plans to fire bolts of electricity at  the ionosphere, the layer of the Earth's atmosphere that acts like a movie  screen for the solar lights, to get an even better picture.  </P> <P> The study should offer insights into the universe and theories of physics and  "increase man's storehouse of knowledge," she said.  </P> <P> Her work may have practical applications in helping to overcome the havoc that  the electrically charged lights can play with radio communications and  navigation.  </P> <P> In Tromsoe, 185 miles north of the Arctic Circle, the tourism board is thankful  for the aurora borealis, which has drawn the curious and adventurous for  hundreds of years.  </P> <P> These amazing sheets of light are the offspring of the solar wind -- bursts of  energized atomic particles that sweep 93 million miles through space and slam  into the Earth's magnetic field at a speed of 1.56 million m.p.h.  </P> <P> The collision releases the storm of energy seen in the constantly changing  lights. Over the South Pole they are called the aurora australis.  </P> <P> "It's absolutely the most fantastic thing we have up here in the north,"  tourist official Gunn Sissel Jaklin said.  </P> <P> "The aurora will just keep getting better and better from now until 1994  because the 11-year solar cycle is moving toward a peak."  </P> <P> Space researcher Loevhaug keeps tabs on the lights summer and winter, even when  they are dimmed or hidden by the midnight sun.  </P> <P> "We're already seeing things that I have never witnessed before," she said. She  has studied the lights since 1983.  </P> <P> From her laboratory 18 miles outside town, the 33-year-old physicist is taking  part in European Incoherent Scatter Radar (EISCAT), a project launched in 1981  to study the northern lights and the Earth's outer atmosphere.  </P> <P> EISCAT's studies are funded by Britain, France, West Germany, Norway, Sweden  and Finland.  </P> <P> A transmitter fed by five megawatts of power, enough to light a small village,  bounces a radar beam off the ionosphere 30 to 1,250 miles above the Earth.  Signals are picked up in Sweden and Finland and relayed to Tromsoe.  </P> <P> "A radar wave is an electromagnetic field," Loevhaug said. "It scatters through  the northern lights, and we receive a picture of what is going on. When solar  activity builds up, it amplifies the lights and makes our studies easier."  </P> <P> It took centuries for mankind to discover that solar flares, tongues of fire  that leap thousands of miles above the sun's surface, caused the lights.  </P> <P> The Vikings believed the lights were flashes from the shields of warriors bound  for heavenly Valhalla. Eskimos imagined dangerous spirits, while Swedes thought  it was the torchlight of Lapps stalking stray reindeer.  </P> <P> Centuries ago, Tromsoe's people feared that laughing at the northern lights  would anger the gods, who would strike them lame.  </P> <P> The aurora has sometimes been seen far south of the Arctic Circle. It was  mentioned in the Bible and pondered by Greek philosopher Aristotle 2,500 years  ago.  </P> <P> Even though lights are commonly seen in Tromsoe, "a colorful display makes  everyone drop what they are doing to watch," Jaklin, the tourism official,  said.  </P> <P> "They look fantastic even when you understand them," Loevhaug said.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Limitation on Deferred Tax Assets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with the FFIEC's recommendation and the Board's proposal, the Board is limiting in regulatory capital deferred tax assets that are dependent on future taxable income to the lesser of:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. The amount of such deferred tax assets that the institution expects to realize within one year of the quarter-end report date, based on its projection of taxable income (exclusive of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards and reversals of existing temporary differences), or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. 10 percent of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets other than purchased mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships (and before any disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences are generally not limited under the final rule. The reported amount of deferred tax assets, net of its valuation allowance, in excess of the limitation would be deducted from Tier 1 capital for purposes of calculating both the risk-based and leverage capital ratios. Banking organizations should not include the amount of disallowed deferred tax assets in weighted-risk assets in the risk-based capital ratio and should deduct the amount of disallowed deferred tax assets from average total assets in the leverage capital ratio. Deferred tax assets included in capital continue to be assigned a risk weight of 100 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To determine the limit, a banking organization should assume that all existing temporary differences fully reverse as of the report date. Also, estimates of taxable income for the next year should include the effect of tax planning strategies the organization is planning to implement to realize net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards that will otherwise expire during the year. Consistent with FAS 109, the Board believes tax planning strategies are carried out to prevent the expiration of such carryforwards. Both of these requirements are consistent with the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The capital limitation is intended to balance the Board's continued concerns about deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income against the fact that such assets will, in many cases, be realized. This approach generally permits full inclusion of deferred tax assets potentially recoverable from carrybacks, since these amounts will generally be realized. This approach also includes those deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income, if they can be recovered from projected taxable income during the next year. The Board is limiting projections of future taxable income to one year because, in general, the Board believes that organizations are generally capable of making projections of taxable income for the following twelve month period that have a reasonably good probability of being achieved. However, the reliability of projections tends to decrease significantly beyond that time period. Deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are further limited to 10 percent of Tier 1 capital, since the Board believes such assets should not comprise a large portion of an organization's capital base given the uncertainty of realization associated with these assets and the difficulty in selling these assets apart from the organization. Furthermore, a 10% capital limit also reduces the risk that an overly optimistic estimate of future taxable income will cause the bank to significantly overstate the value of deferred tax assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Banking organizations already follow FAS 109 for regulatory reports and accordingly, are making projections of taxable income. Banking organizations already report in regulatory reports the amount of deferred tax assets that would be disallowed under the proposal. In addition, the 10 percent calculation of Tier 1 capital is straightforward. Therefore, the Board believes that banking organizations will have little difficulty implementing this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Guidance on Specific Implementation Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the comments received and after discussions with the other agencies, the Board is providing the following guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Originating Temporary Differences_Consistent with the Board's proposal, the final rule does not specify how the provision for loan and lease losses and other originating temporary differences should be treated for purposes of projecting taxable income for the next year. Banking organizations routinely prepare income forecasts for future periods and, in theory, income forecasts for book income should be adjusted for originating temporary differences in arriving at a projection of taxable income. On the other hand, requiring such adjustments adds complexity to the final rule. Furthermore, deductible originating temporary differences, such as the provision for loan and lease losses, generally would lead to additional deferred tax assets. Thus, arguably, such temporary differences should not be added back to book income in determining the amount of deferred tax assets that will be realized. Accordingly, the Board is permitting each institution to decide whether or not to adjust projected book income for originating temporary differences. While the Board is not specifying a single treatment on originating temporary differences in the final rule, institutions should follow a reasonable and consistent approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

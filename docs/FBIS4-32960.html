			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 31 May (AFP) -- On Tuesday, the  government of provisional President Emile Jonassaint, which is  not recognized by the international community, banned members of  the resigning administration of Prime Minister Robert Malval  from leaving the national territory.    In a communique read over state television, the Ministry of  Interior and National Defense "informs border posts and those  concerned of the formal prohibition against leaving the country  effective immediately for those who have to give explanations on  their use of public funds." This measure, which also involves  all high-ranking officials appointed by exiled President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide or Malval, is aimed at officially  reviewing the country's accounts.    According to observers in Port-au-Prince, however, this  directive may cause tension between the authorities of the  administrations of Jonassaint and Malval, who, despite tendering  his resignation, continues to administer current affairs while  waiting for President Aristide to appoint a new head of  government.    This measure was adopted "with the legitimate concern to  guarantee the interests of the public administration and the  state," the communique said. Former officials must present  official proof of their handling of affairs at the moment of  leaving the territory. Some of Malval's ministers are already  abroad, according to well- placed sources. Following his  election, Father Aristide ordered the same measure, which was  denounced at the time as political vengeance.</p>

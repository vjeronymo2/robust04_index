			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Business in the Community (3): The focus is sharpening - The role of the Training and Enterprise Councils A YEAR ago Doncaster Enterprise Agency was rather suspicious about the new Barnsley and Doncaster Training and Enterprise Council. Mr Brian Crangle, chief executive of the agency, one of the 300-odd enterprise agencies in the UK which come under the umbrella of Business in the Community, says: 'It was not clear whether the Tec was going to be a catalyst or a provider of services itself. 'But as our relationship has progressed we have come to a much better understanding of what the Tec is all about and the positive role that it can play in co-ordinating our activities.' Resolution of the role of Tecs in stimulating and supporting enterprise activities, in what is an already crowded playing field, has been one of the critical issues for the movement. Tecs have been set up over the past two years by Mr Michael Howard, the former Employment secretary. Employer-led they drew their original inspiration from the Private Enterprise Councils in the US. With a majority of private sector employers on their boards, Tecs were intended to bring a sharp new local focus to both training and enterprise activities in England and Wales. Part of their enterprise brief has been to promote the growth of small companies and to bring greater coherence to the many strands of help available and to ensure that any gaps in services were filled with cost-effective provision. Tecs' brief included the development of business information and advice services; the enterprise allowance scheme; training provision for small businesses and support for exporters. The agenda has not been without problems, not least because the Department of Employment and the Department of Trade and Industry have not themselves closely co-ordinated their activities in the field of enterprise. At the sharp end, Tecs have come into conflict with existing providers of business assistance - including chambers of commerce and enterprise agencies. Chambers, like enterprise agencies, are largely supported by voluntary subscription and offer a wide range of services to their members including business advice. The most notable conflicts between chambers and Tecs, for example, have been when Tecs have set up rival services to those of chambers, such as export advice, and where they have set up membership subscriptions from the same client base. At best, however, a growing number of the 82 Tecs are either working in partnership with chambers of commerce and enterprise agencies, contracting with them to provide services including business information advice, or else they are providing leadership in co-ordinating activities. County Durham Tec, for example, has created a network of eight 'Business Services Centres' in partnership with existing bodies providing a single point of entry for the entire range of enterprise support services. The Tec has based the centres on existing Enterprise Agencies and Development Agencies. Birmingham Tec, in partnership with other agencies including enterprise agencies, is bringing together all enterprise initiatives to provide new and developing businesses with continuity and consistency of support. The New Business Programme provides an integrated package including improved access to business counselling and advice, preparatory training and support funding. Doncaster Enterprise Agency, for example, has a contract from Barnsley and Doncaster Tec to operate its enterprise allowance scheme, which is a scheme which offers unemployed people financial help to start their own businesses. Whether partnership will one day lead to marriage, with Tecs eventually absorbing some of the other players, remains to be seen. Brian Crangle is probably typical of most Enterprise Agency activists when he says he could not envisage his agency being absorbed by the Tec although he sees closer and closer partnership arrangements. 'I believe in a federal approach,' he says. So what has the Tec brought to the party? Mr Crangle says that the fact that the Tec had money to spend was an important attraction in bringing people together. 'The fact that it has money to spend probably persuaded different people to sit down at the same table in the first place,' he says. He also believes that the boards of Tecs themselves, drawn from a localised business community along with representatives of public sector organisations such as local councils, are an important forum for the exchange of ideas. According to a recent survey, contacts between small businesses and large local companies and public sector organisations are not particularly strong. The survey, by Kingston Polytechnic for Midland Bank, said most small businesses were not as well integrated into strong local networks of contacts as many people generally assumed. Tecs, it is hoped by the government, should bring a new spirit of co-operation and understanding into local business networks. But a lot more will have to be done to raise the general performance to the standards reached by the best.</p>

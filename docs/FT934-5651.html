			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Libyan deals hinge on Lonrho film Lonrho, the international conglomerate, is ready to complete deals worth hundreds of millions of pounds with Libya if a documentary film shows it to be innocent of the Lockerbie bombing, Mr Tiny Rowland, the joint chief executive, said yesterday. Mr Rowland said Lonrho had set up a Caribbean shell company to finance a film about the bombing to establish whether Libya was involved in the destruction of the Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, with the loss of 270 lives. 'The Libyans want to sign deals with Lonrho worth hundreds of millions of pounds but I have to be sure we are not involved with partners of mass murder,' he said. 'If the film proves them to be innocent, there will be enormous potential to sign many deals.' Mr Rowland said Libya wanted to take a 25 per cent stake in Lonrho's agricultural business and recently pressed the company to sign new joint ventures worth around Pounds 150m through the Libyan Arab Finance Company (Lafico), the main investment vehicle of Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader. But Mr Rowland said: 'I have told them that until we know for sure that they were not involved in the Lockerbie bombing we cannot do any further deals.' Mr Rowland rebutted suggestions that his joint chief executive, Mr Dieter Bock, was not backing the film. 'Mr Bock has fully supported the board in deciding to make this film,' he said. Mr Bock, however, is known to be embarrassed by the film and wants Lonrho to withdraw from further co-operation with Libya. The film is being funded by Metropole Hotels which is two-thirds owned by Lonrho and one-third by Lafico. Mr Rowland said he had been warned by Mr Douglas Hogg, minister for foreign affairs, that screening of the film, due to be completed by January, could be in contempt of court. Mr Rowland said he had no intention of showing the film to the public but added that a copy would be sent to the foreign office once the documentary was finished. The issue is expected to be brought up at Lonrho's board meeting on Friday.</p>

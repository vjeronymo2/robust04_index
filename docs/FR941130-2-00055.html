These agreements are Agreement No. 203&hyph;011394 (``OOCL Agreement''), <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Agreement No. 203&hyph;011395 (``Maersk Agreement'') <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  and Agreement No. 203&hyph;011396 (``Cooperative Agreement). <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  They require the participants, Sea-Land Service, Inc. (``Sea-Land''), P &amp; O Containers Ltd. (``P &amp; O''), Nedlloyd Lijnen B.V. (``Nedlloyd''), Orient Overseas Container Line Ltd. (``OOCL'') and A.P. Moller-Maersk Line (``Maersk''), to be members of the Trans-Atlantic Agreement (``TAA''), now known as the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement (``TACA''), (Agreement No. 202&hyph;011375). <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An agreement is defined in section 3(1) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1702(1), as ``an understanding, arrangement, or association'' and may include conference and non-conference agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The agreement allows Orient Overseas Container Line to charter vessel space from Sea-Land Service, Inc., P&amp;O Containers Ltd. and Nedlloyd Lijnen B.V.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The agreement allows Sea-Land Service, Inc., P&amp;O Containers Ltd. and Nedlloyd Lijnen B.V. to charter vessel space from A.P.

Like vessel sharing agreements, conference agreements must be filed at the Commission. However, to ensure that a conference or its members cannot restrict or otherwise control conference membership, section 5(b)(3) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1704(b)(3), requires that a conference agreement must permit any member to withdraw from conference membership upon reasonable notice without penalty. In addition, section 5(b)(2), 46 U.S.C. app. 1704(b)(2), states that each conference agreement must provide reasonable and equal terms and conditions for admission and readmission to conference membership. Any conference agreement that imposes withdrawal penalties or unreasonable terms and conditions for readmission to a conference violates the 1984 Act and may be canceled or modified by the Commission under section 11(c) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1710(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, the OOCL Agreement, the Maersk Agreement and the Cooperative Agreement require Sea-Land, Nedlloyd, P &amp; O, OOCL and Maersk to be members of TACA. If one of these carriers withdraws from TACA, it is compelled to withdraw from these vessel sharing agreements. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  The OOCL Agreement, the Maersk Agreement and Agreement No. 202&hyph;011171, another vessel sharing agreement, involving Sea-Land, P &amp; O and Nedlloyd, <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  impose penalties on the carrier that withdraws from the vessel sharing agreements, i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Maersk Agreement gives Maersk, Sea-Land, Nedlloyd and P &amp; O the option of terminating or withdrawing from the agreement, if one of them withdraws from TACA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This agreement involves chartering of Sea-Land vessels in the trans-Atlantic trade. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The withdrawing party must give six months irrevocable notice to the other parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The withdrawing party shall cease operation as a common carrier in the Trade. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The withdrawing party shall not re-enter the Trade as a common carrier for a period of five (5) years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The withdrawing party shall, during the six month notice period, make all reasonable efforts to assist the other parties in succeeding to the business of the withdrawing party including, but not limited to, providing customer lists, and affirmatively recommending the other parties to the withdrawing parties customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

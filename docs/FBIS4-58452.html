			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by General (Retd) Mirza Azlam Beg: "Who Will Press </F> the Button?"]    [Text] When I became the Vice Chief of the Army Staff, I  was made privy to the nuclear programme and also responsible for  the Pakistan Army. What I saw on the ground and based on it I  gave the statement that Pakistan had acquired nuclear capability  in 1987 and not in 1990. However, for three years, from 1987 to  1989, the US President continued to certify that Pakistan had  not acquired nuclear capability, which was contrary to what was  stated in a report by Richard Barlow, an American responsible  for monitoring our programme in Islamabad, even though, I am  sure they must have read it. Pakistan in those days had  importance due to the Afghan problem, the Russians were in  Afghanistan, and the Americans needed Pakistan and thus a  certification had to be given that Pakistan had not acquired the  capability, whereas the fact was that we had.    In 1989 when Russia withdrew from Afghanistan, Pakistan  ceased to be of importance to the US and thus Richard Barlow's  Report became valid. Robert Oakley, the US Ambassador in  Pakistan declared that Pakistan had crossed the red line, and  consequently all the trouble started. It was also in early 1990  that an uprising erupted in occupied Kashmir against India.  This resulted in creating tension and the relations between the  two countries became very strained. India was at a disadvantage  as it had not expected an uprising in Kashmir. To divert  attention, it tried to cash in on the tension between India and  Pakistan and projected to the world that Pakistan, having  acquired nuclear capability, was preparing to launch a nuclear  attack against India. This created a commotion and the US took  certain steps in a attempt to curb Pakistan.    The first step was to send Robert Gates to Pakistan. This  was during the first tenure of Benazir Bhutto. Upon his arrival  we had a meeting, and I clearly told him that they were talking  about something which just did not exist on the ground. I  pointed out that was definite tension between India and Pakistan  between what was happening and what had been happening in the  valley, and with the troops on the Line of Control in Kashmir.  The hotline between GHQs of India and Pakistan had been fully  functional, every second of the day. We were in conversation  with them knowing exactly what was happening without even going  to the second stage of tension, which leads to a state of  conflict between the two countries i.e., deployment of  conventional forces.    The US had reached the conclusion that Pakistan was  preparing  for a nuclear attack on India on the basis of pictures  circulated via satellite, showing troop loads of material from  Kahuta moving outwards, F-16s from various bases being placed at  suitable air bases for striking India, and activity in and  around Quetta where they thought there were some nuclear  facilities which Pakistan had created. Thus painting a picture  as if Pakistan was ready to strike India.    What needs to be understood here is the motive behind  creating this false image of Pakistan by the Indian lobby.  Firstly, it was to divert attention of the world from Kashmir,  because if there is a possibility of a nuclear holocaust in the  subcontinent naturally everyone will forget about what is  happening in Kashmir and all attention will be directed towards  this major issue.    The ground realities are that in 1989, immediately after  Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto took over, a meeting of the National  Nuclear Command Authority (NNCA) was held. The NNCA was  established by late Mr Bhutto when he first initiated the  programme, and he became the chairman, being the chief  executive. Later on Mr Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the Chief of the Army  Staff and three other people who are involved with the programme  formed the Nuclear Command Committee,    This committee formulates all the policies. In January  1989 under the then president this committee met, the prime  minister was there, I was there and having analysed the problems  in detail we thought that there was a need to adopt a policy of  restraint to limit our nuclear programme. Because we thought  that Pakistan had acquired the maximum deterrence level that is  needed to avert the threat that we perceived, and it could also  quantify, for example the correlation of forces between India  and Pakistan, i.e., conventional forces.    Therefore, having reached the minimum deterrence level, the  committee took a decision to limit one aspect of the programme  which was uranium enrichment. If uranium is enriched to the  maximum level of 95 per cent and above it becomes weapon-grade  uranium. As there was no requirement of going beyond three to  five per cent which is the level needed for our Kanup [Karachi  Nuclear Power] plant, from the time this decision was taken,  i.e. January 1989, Pakistan has been only carrying out  enrichment up to three to five per cent.    Whereas the other processes, i.e. the R&amp;D for the  development  of the device and its refinement and development of the delivery  system and refinement of the system, the test that has to be  carried out in the lab and finally the safety measures for the  security that have to be undertaken to ensure that there is no  mismanagement are continuing.    Thus, the management, control, and safeguard measures are  the  responsibility of the National Nuclear Command Authority. Its  job was and continues to be to institutionalise policy making  and to determine the capability and the criteria as to what  capability level we have to acquire. This authority also  determines the state of readiness which has to be maintained at  all times. By a state of readiness, I mean the device  integration that has to be achieved because the device contains  so many different items, consequently the preparation of all  those items, then the ability to put them together and have a  device ready when needed. This is an important decision.  Related to this is the delivery system development, which  somebody said can be catapulted. I am sorry, it cannot be  catapulted.    It is a highly technical system and it has to be tested from  time to time on computers and in the lab before you can really  go in the field and carry out a real hot test. The delivery  system, therefore, has to be developed. We already have the  F-16s, Mirages and the M-11s which we are now getting from China  that can carry, but there had been a problem in the past. Then  through the missile programme, which I am sure they have  continued with, we should have a delivery system with a very  effective, accurate, guiding system, provided on the missiles.    There have been doubts about the designation of  responsibility both with the country and outside. I would like  to make it very clear that the NNCA is very definite in its mind  and has very clearly designated the responsibility to joint  operations centre (JOC), which is maintained in the Joint Staff  Head Quarters in Rawalpindi which commands all the three  services during war. The JOC is the first one to be given  orders when it comes to deployment and utilisation of this  capability. And, of course, the orders are then passed on to the  other three services which are to take action, particularly the  Army and the Air Force, as these agencies are involved in the  development of the device.    With regard to safeguard and security measures, because of  its sensitivity, foolproof methods have to be adopted for  security of the whole system. The authority also lays down in  great detail the policy of how the various components will be  place, protected, and safeguarded. There are technical and  procedural measures which are adopted to ensure that no mistakes  are made. These procedures and technicalities are devised by  NNCA, as they are a highly guarded secret. Therefore, to the  best of our ability, we have developed technical and procedural  measures to safeguard and provide safety to the material. This  has been the case from the very first day the programme started.    There has to be a political chain of command. It was there,  it has been there and continues to be there till today. The  military chain of command starts from below where it is at the  receiving end and carries out instructions as received from the  political authority. The person who has the hand on the button  is the chief executive. But the term "chief executive" has  undergone several changes. When Mr Bhutto was alive, he had his  hand on the button. when Gen. Ziaul Haq came to power, his hand  was on the button and after him Ms Benazir Bhutto and so on.    The question is, now that we have acquired this capability  what do we gain from it. In this context, I would like to read  two statements. The first one I quote: "Pakistan's possession  of Nuclear Weapons makes a large Indian conventional edge  unexploitable. "The conventional edge implies the correction of  forces, in which the Indian Army is three times, the Air Force  five times and Navy ten times that of Pakistan's. They cannot  exploit this situation because Pakistan possesses nuclear  weapons. This is the first advantage that we have gained. And  this is something that a former Indian Army Chief Sunderjeet  admits in his statement, "On balance one may conclude that in a  general low level symmetry between India and Pakistan a  substantial degree of nuclear stability exists."    The fact is that if today there is stability, it is due to  the possession of nuclear capability by both sides. I can count  many advantages. It certainly has reduced the possibility of  war. Although the option of going to war is not with the weaker  but with the stronger one, but as the stronger's options are  limited due to the possession of the nuclear weapon, therefore,  India just cannot unleash its conventional weapons against  Pakistan. That makes the possibility of war between India and  Pakistan much less.    The question of cost effectiveness has been raised, which is  something very surprising. When our project was at its peak in  1985, 1986, 1987 the annual budget of Kahuta programme was less  than the cost of one F-16. We paid about 28 million dollars per  aircraft as against 18 million dollars, the actual cost, because  we got it out of turn and we had to pay 10 million dollars extra  for every aircraft. I am, therefore, talking of 18 million  dollars and I say on good authority that the cost of one year's  budget programme of Kahuta Laboratory is less than the cost of  one single F-16 aircraft.    And from the time we received these F-16s, I think we have  lost four or five of them and are left with only 34 or 35. So if  somebody is thinking exchanging our nuclear programme with the  F-16s -- 38 of them -- I am sure he is not aware of this reality.    Another advantage that Pakistan has in possessing a nuclear  weapon is that India cannot indulge in nuclear blackmail against  Pakistan since we have a meaningful capability. We took a  decision, a policy of restraint as we thought that since we had  reached the minimum deterrence level, we did not have to go  beyond it. But it must be remembered that limiting enrichment  of uranium does not cap your nuclear programme. If you are  carrying out the enrichment of uranium up to five per cent, to  take it to 20 per cent, perhaps you need about a week's time.  If from 20 per cent, you want to take it to 95 per cent another  10 days or so will be required only. Thus, within 15 days, if  you want you can just raise the level to 95 per cent and you  will be producing weapon-grade uranium.    This should make the difference apparent. First they were  talking of rolling back, now they want Pakistan to cap its  programme. This is a very major decision which Pakistan has to  take, but in my judgement if it comes to that, and if there are  great many advantages, then it has to be a move in symmetry with  what India is doing. It has to be a simultaneous action  guaranteed by the powers and thus bring Pakistan and India to  understand the logic to cap their programme. They do not want  us to roll back which is a big change, and I think if India  agrees, Pakistan may decide to cap its programme.</p>

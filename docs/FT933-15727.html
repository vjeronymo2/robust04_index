			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: World offshore output forecast to rise WORLD OFFSHORE oil production is forecast to rise by 18 per cent to 943m tonnes by 1995 with most of the increase coming from the UK and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, according to a report released today by Mackay Consultants, the management consulting group. Mackay expects North Sea offshore output to increase by 41 per cent with Norway remaining the world's largest offshore producer for the rest of the decade. But the report suggests world-wide exploration activity will be fairly static. Although the number of exploration wells is expected to rise from 1,017 last year to 1,134 in 1995, that would still be below the level of drilling in 1991. The report shows a 20 per cent drop in exploration and appraisal drilling in the UK with around 105 wells being sunk by 1995. Mackay says it has reduced its forecasts as a result of changes to Petroleum Revenue Taxes announced in the UK March Budget, which abolished tax relief for exploration work. Expenditure on the offshore sector worldwide is estimated to grow by 3 per cent in the next two years to Dollars 84bn. But spending in the UK sector is expected to fall from Dollars 8.3bn last year to Dollars 5.6bn in 1995 as the emphasis shifts towards developing smaller fields. World offshore gas production is forecast to grow by 18 per cent by 1995 to 442bn cubic metres.

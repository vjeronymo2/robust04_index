			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Construction Contracts: Hospital projects won by LG Mouchel LG MOUCHEL &amp; PARTNERS has been appointed to engineer two large hospitals in the south of England. Mouchel's Bath office has been appointed by the West Dorset General Hospital's NHS Trust to undertake the civil and structural engineering on the second phase of the Dorchester General Hospital. Phase 2 of the hospital development will provide 350 additional beds in 15 wards and includes five operating theatres and facilities for other specialist functions. The design of the Pounds 28.6m development started in July and invitations to tender will be sent out in April 1994. Construction is due to begin in November 1994 and should be completed by October 1997. South West Thames Regional Health Authority has appointed Baker Martin Mouchel, the firm's Southampton office, as the structural engineer to develop and refurbish St Richards Hospital in Chichester. The hospital has grown up over the last 40 years and the intention is that the present facilities should be rationalised and that a sound basis should be provided for future development of the site. The appointment will therefore involve major refurbishment of some of the buildings, the building of extensions to others and the construction of new facilities. Roads and car parking facilities on site will be upgraded and extended. The project will be divided into a number of phases, the second of which is the construction of a new nucleus hospital. The whole development is expected to be completed in July 1997 at a cost of Pounds 28m.</p>

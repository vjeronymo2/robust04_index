			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Nikita Yermakov and Konstantin </F> Pribytkov]    [Text] Davos, Switzerland, January 30 TASS--Russian  President Boris Yeltsin's policy of an in-depth democratic  reform of Russian society, the economy and political  institutions will be continued with due regard, primarily, for  the national and strategic interests of Russia and proceeding  from the principles inherent in the new Russian Constitution,  Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told a plenary  meeting of the World Economic Forum here on Sunday night.    Touching upon the problem of foreign investments in the  Russian economy, Chernomyrdin emphasised that last year had seen  no cardinal changes as regards Russia's readiness for  cooperation. Inside Russia, conditions for the operation of  foreign investors gradually change, albeit too slowly, he said.    Russia can accept and "digest" foreign investments amounting  to at least 10,000-12,000 million U.S. dollars a year, not as  "aid" but on mutually beneficial commercial terms, Chernomyrdin  said.    "We are prepared for joint work in this respect, to set up,  in particular, a multilateral council of foreign and Russian  bankers, investors, and entrepreneurs and jointly examine  investment cooperation possibilities with respect to particular  sectors and enterprises," the Russian prime minister said.    Chernomyrdin expressed readiness to participate in the work  of such a council, a session which could be held in Moscow in  May-June.    In conclusion, the Russian premier voiced hope that the  World  Economic Forum would promote the understanding of the processes  taking place in Russia.    Then he answered questions asked by plenary meeting  participants.    January saw a campaign during which Russia was accused of  curtailing reforms and the Russian Government was alleged to  have a desire to reverse the reform process.    "I would like to state once again: Russia will not turn  backwards and will not swerve off the road of reforms. This is  guaranteed, primarily, by the Constitution which reflects the  realities of a democratic society, democratic Russia. We have  the president who is the guarantor of what we do now. You may  rest assured that my government will go ahead with reforms and  will not turn off the road," Chernomyrdin said.</p>

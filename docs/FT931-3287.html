			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Split over strategy for merchant bank: The aftermath of a disagreement at Baring Securities Five years ago, Mr Christopher Heath was a stockbroker who had it all. He was reputedly the UK's highest paid man, earning several millions pounds a year - and the Asian securities firm he had founded, Baring Securities, had received establishment approval with a Queen's Award for Export Achievement (in 1991 it won a second Queen's Award). On Monday, he appeared as mortal as the hundreds of other City of London brokers who have lost their jobs in the past few years. He resigned as chairman of Baring Securities and all his other directorships in the firm's parent company, Barings Plc, having had a disagreement over strategy with the parent company's deputy chairman, Mr Andrew Tuckey. If the spoils for Mr Heath have been rich, they have not been insubstantial for the merchant banking group Barings - though the precise level of its earnings from Baring Securities have been obscured in its traditionally opaque accounts. In the early 1980s, Barings had been a staid and somewhat sleepy merchant bank - a pale shadow of the family business described by the Duc de Richelieu in 1818 as the sixth great power in Europe (though Barings is probably today better known for being at the heart of the City of London's greatest financial crisis of the last century, the 1890 Baring crisis). In 1984, Barings made one of its most astute investments when it bought the Asian stockbroking business set up by Mr Heath. The core of this securities business was the purchase and sale of Japanese equities to non-Japanese investment institutions. Foreign interest in Japanese shares reached a peak in the mid-1980s - and Baring Securities was one of the main beneficiaries. It became the most profitable UK-owned broker of Japanese shares - and one of the most profitable Asian securities firms in the world (though its profits were a fraction of domestic Japanese firms). The success of Baring Securities seemed to give a new impetus to Barings' traditional activities - though much of the credit for this revival was because of a reorganisation by Mr Tuckey. Barings' fund management business has grown rapidly and today has more than Pounds 22bn under management. But perhaps more important has been the revival in the traditional heart of Barings, its corporate finance department which provides advice to UK and international companies. Its return to the first division of UK corporate finance was confirmed last year when it was chosen by Lloyds Bank as its adviser in the battle with Hongkong Bank for control of Midland Bank. 'The success of Baring Securities was helpful to the group as a whole,' Mr Tuckey said yesterday. 'But the success of the bank (in corporate finance) and of asset management would have happened in any event.' The culmination of his expansionist strategy came at the end of 1991 when Barings bought a 40 per cent stake in one of Wall Street's investment banks, Dillon Read. In the table, the return to profit of Barings' US business is predominantly attributable to Dillon Read. But last year Mr Heath's magic goose stopped laying golden eggs. As Japanese share prices have fallen dramatically over the past three years, foreign investors' interest in Japan has wained. Almost 40 per cent of Baring Securities' revenues are still linked to Japanese securities trading, even though it has over the past five years built up highly profitable businesses in other Asian and South American markets. As a result, Baring Securities incurred a loss of nearly Pounds 20m last year, in part due to the costs of cutting more than 100 staff in September and making provisions for the costs of surplus office space. Because Baring Securities is headquartered in London, its loss contributed to the fall in its parent's UK profits from Pounds 32.1m to Pounds 2m in 1992 as shown in the table. The disagreement between Mr Heath and Mr Tuckey, which reached a climax at the weekend, was over measures to return Baring Securities to profit. Mr Heath wanted Barings to allocate more of its capital to Baring Securities, so that the securities firm could carry out more proprietary trading, which is the business of trading securities and derivative instruments for its own account - several US securities houses, such as Salomon Brothers, have adopted such a strategy in Japan. However, Mr Tuckey believed this would make the group too exposed to the performance of the securities business. His aim is to create a group of equally important divisions, so that a poor performance by one business can be offset by profits from another. He believes the way to boost Baring Securities' profits is to encourage it to work more closely with the corporate finance department, so that it can win an increasing number of mandates to issue new securities for companies in Asia and South America. The other part of his strategy, which will be carried out by Baring Securities' new chairman, Mr Miles Rivett-Carnac, is for Baring Securities to concentrate on emerging markets, such as those in South America, Singapore, Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan and Malaysia, where dealing commissions are far wider than in developed markets. But Mr Tuckey insisted there were no plans to prune the Japanese business any further. He also denied market speculation that there would be cuts in the 100 staff employed in trading derivatives. Indeed he said that the securities business had proved to be remarkably resilient, following the reorganisation last autumn. 'We have maintained our market share in all major markets,' he said. Baring Securities is back in profit. As for Mr Heath, he is staying at Barings as a consultant. However, his friends say he is still 'very hungry', for all his millions. Baring Securities could one day face competition from a new Heath-led broker.  ------------------------------------------------------------------              BARINGS: PRE-TAX PROFIT (POUNDS 000S)  ------------------------------------------------------------------                                        1992          1991  ------------------------------------------------------------------ UK                                    2,018        32,125 Other Europe                          3,596         1,044 North America                         5,123        (3,015) Asia/Pacific                         26,684        21,286 Rest of world                          (608)          (86) Interest and exceptional costs      (15,549)       (8,873)  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Total                                21,264        42,481  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

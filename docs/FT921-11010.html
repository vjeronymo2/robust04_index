			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Observer: Ox-pox Meanwhile, as if the Russians did not have enough problems already, a mysterious disease has been killing off their yaks. More than 1,000 of the beasts - delightfully defined in the Oxford dictionary as 'long-haired humped grunting wild or domesticated ox of Tibet'  -have died in eastern Siberia over the past two months. Some specialists are blaming large-horned cattle plague. The crisis has been deemed of sufficient importance to merit sending a delegation from the Russian parliament's emergency committee to the mountainous Tuva region of Siberia. Any salt mines nearby?</p>

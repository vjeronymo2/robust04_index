			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother President Yasir 'Arafat had today a  telephone conversation with the Mr. Godal, the Norwegian foreign  minister.    The conversation dealt with the latest development in the  Palestinian-Israeli peace process and the means for bolstering  it by starting the rebuilding process as soon as possible.    They also talked about the International Coordination  Committee of the donor-countries and the need to fulfill its  pledges by giving monies to the Palestinian authority in order  that the latter would meet its development and rebuilding  pledges in the self rule areas.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Troops in Somalia defy orders from local commanders: Critical decisions face UN as two peace operations encounter growing troubles THE CRISIS over the United Nations' peacekeeping role in Somalia deepened yesterday as it emerged that UN troops in the country have been refusing to obey orders from their local commanders, apparently on instructions from their governments. According to UN officials in New York, Italian, Kuwaiti and Saudi contingents have been refusing to carry out orders given by the Turkish commander, General Civek Bir. Underlining the sense of disarray in the UN force, officials said some troop commanders in riot-torn Mogadishu were reported to have been unwilling to commit contingents to UN sorties because of the risk of casualties. Last night, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, referring to UN operations, including those in Somalia and Bosnia, said the organisation could find itself out of its depth unless expert military advice to the secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, was vastly improved. 'There is a powerful case for enhancing the military expertise available,' he said in London. 'Otherwise the UN will be out of its depth very quickly, if it is not so already.' Such assistance could take the form of a UN staff college. The UN ambassadors of the half-dozen countries with more than 1,000 soldiers in Somalia were recently summoned to discuss the growing crisis by Mr Kofi Annan, under-secretary general in charge of UN peacekeeping operations worldwide. The envoys were told it was unacceptable for national capitals to issue orders to contingents serving under the UN flag and Gen Bir's authority must be respected. The latest blow to the UN's authority in Somalia emerged as Italy, which has voiced disquiet about the increasingly bloody operation, asked the UN for its troops in Mogadishu to be moved out to safer terrain unless agreement could be reached. Mr David Andrews, Irish defence minister, called for a conference of the countries contributing troops to Somalia. After addressing 80 Irish troops about to go to Somalia, he said: 'It is important not to lose sight of the fundamental reason for the UN presence in Somalia, which was to help create the political and economic conditions whereby ultimately the Somali people could help themselves.' His call came a day after US helicopters blasted the command centre of General Mohamed Farah Aideed, the fugitive warlord, leaving more than a dozen dead and provoking a mob to kill four journalists in revenge. The Organisation of African Unity called yesterday for a review of the UN operation, saying the world body should resume dialogue with people there. On Monday, UN officials rejected a proposal by Mr Fabio Fabbri, Italy's defence minister, that combat operations be suspended in an effort to reduce tension in the former Italian colony. This led yesterday to calls from the opposition in parliament to withdraw the Italian contingent. The US, which recently boosted its Somalia firepower to strike at Gen Aideed's militia, announced yesterday it had again moved a task force of 2,200 marines away from Somalia and would begin withdrawing four AC-130 attack aircraft. But the Pentagon said this did not signal any softening of US support for a military crackdown against Gen Aideed. Rising death toll stokes hatred against UN, Page 4 Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Hungary paves way for power sell-off Hungary's parliament yesterday voted through an act regulating the electricity industry and creating the conditions for eastern Europe's first wholesale power privatisation. The law breaks the national monopoly on electricity generation and distribution held by the electricity utility, MVM, allows for independent utilities and establishes the basis for a division along British lines between power generators and distributors. Crucially, the legislation, on which the UK merchant bank Schroders has advised the Hungarian government, establishes a legal framework for setting prices. This gives foreign investors the pricing stability they need to bid confidently in the privatisation tender due this summer. The electricity industry as a whole has a book value of Ft570bn (Pounds 3.76bn), the government claims. Its partial sale will be of roughly the same order of magnitude as Hungary's telecommunications privatisation. Last December, Deutsche Telekom of Germany and Ameritech of the US paid Dollars 875m for 30 per cent of national telecoms operator, Matav, in eastern Europe's largest single privatisation. But the crucial determinant of the size of the transaction is the detailed pricing regulation of the electricity sector, which will flesh out the act passed yesterday and is due in the coming weeks. Tariffs may have to nearly double if the industry is to cover its forecast capital costs, and advisers hope that price rises can close the gap in 3-5 years. In preparation for the electricity sale, the government has split MVM into eight generating companies and six regional distributors. West European utilities may be permitted to acquire majority stakes in six regional distribution companies. The authorities also intend to allow complete foreign ownership in four generating companies which rely largely on coal-fired power plants and require modernisation. The state plans, however, to retain a stake of 25 per cent in three larger conventional power complexes and to keep full control of the Paks nuclear power station. Hungary has taken a liberal approach to foreign investment in the utilities because of the pressing need to develop infrastructure neglected under communist rule. The industry ministry estimates that the electricity sector must invest Ft220bn-Ft250bn by the year 2000 to replace outmoded capacity with more efficient, cleaner stations.</p>

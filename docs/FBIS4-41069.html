			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN" daily), 06/21/94  -- RA [Republic of Armenia] Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a  declaration, which particularly says:    "The Azeri military units shelled the north-eastern  districts  of the republic at 5am on June 5, and penetrated into the  Noyemberyanskiy district. Having attacked the frontier post at  the village of Barekamavan, the Azeris killed and outraged 6  Armenian frontier guards, wounded one and captured one frontier  guard.    RA government believes that this provocation attack, in  conditions when no military operations are carried out,  evidences aggravation of the Azeri position and its negative  attitude towards serious negotiations. This attack coincided in  time with CSCE Minsk group Chairman's visit to Armenia.  Therefore, this was, in fact, an attempt to fail Jan Eliasson's  mission.    RA government demands official apologies and corresponding  explanations from the Azeri authorities, as well as immediate  return of the captured frontier guard and to cover the expenses  caused by the attack.    Until the Azeri government does not satisfy the mentioned  demands, RA government will seriously consider the question of  stopping all negotiations on resolution of the Karabakh  conflict. Responsibility for all consequences of failing the  negotiations will lie on the Azeri republic.    Paying a great importance to de-facto cessation of military  operations in Mountainous Karabakh during the month, and hoping  that this may become a basis for a legal cease fire and for  successful negotiations on resolution of the conflict, RA  ordered its units not to respond to this provocative operation.  Nevertheless, if such actions are repeated, RA keeps the right  to take adequate measures."</p>

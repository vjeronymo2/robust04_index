			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'BENCH IS HELEN'S ONLY HOME'  </P> <P> Leslie Herzog's article "Bench Is Helen's Only Home" (Nov. 3) is a sad  illustration of the increasing problem caused by the closure of the state  hospitals and the change in laws relating to the mentally ill and  developmentally disabled.  </P> <P> Civil and human rights advocates have insisted that all people have a right to  live as they chose, and the laws made it almost impossible to detain someone in  a hospital for his own protection. If they are not suicidal or homicidal, 14  days is the maximum stay. These advocates, however well intentioned, have  overlooked an important aspect: that along with rights comes responsibility. If  a person cannot be responsible for food, clothing and shelter for themselves,  then should they have the right to live on the street?  </P> <P> Community programs were to be the answer for this problem, and it was assumed  that the former patients would avail themselves of the services provided -- and  some have done so. But many others chose not to participate in any program.  When there is no way to enforce participation, a program is useless.  </P> <P> The pendulum has swung too far in the opposite direction. It is time for some  advocates to begin to lobby for a change in the laws, and a reopening of the  state hospitals. Of course we don't want people inappropriately hospitalized,  but when they prove that they can't be responsible for themselves, we will  again have to assume that responsibility.  </P> <P> LIZ NORTON  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

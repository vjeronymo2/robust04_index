			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / California resolves two-month budget crisis CALIFORNIA'S two-month-long fiscal crisis finally came to an end early yesterday morning when Mr Pete Wilson, the Republican governor, signed a Dollars 57bn (Pounds 28.6bn) budget approved by the lower house of the state assembly. The last and necessary capitulation by the Democratic-controlled legislature was its acceptance of an education bill which allows the state's constitutional obligation to school funding to be suspended if, as may happen, the courts find illegal a loan for current expenditure from future allocations. Mr Wilson claimed victory for his long fight to produce a new balanced budget without recourse to tax increases in the face of a prolonged and deep recession. It was achieved by substantial cuts in state grants to health, education and welfare. Mr Willie Brown, the veteran speaker of the assembly, described the budget agreement as 'a compromise, the best decision we can make tonight'. He conceded that state-wide discontent with the political process might mean that many legislators, already faced with new limitations on the number of terms they may serve, would be voted out of office in November. The most visible consequence of the long stalemate was that the state found it necessary to issue Dollars 3.2bn in IOUs to meet its payroll and other contractual obligations, the first time it has had to issue its own scrip since the depression of the 1930s. In recent days financial institutions had begun to refuse to honour these IOUs and a major closedown of state offices was being threatened. The California battle has been the most dramatic and painful of countless others fought across the country. They are seen as harbingers of wars to come at the federal level, regardless of who is the next president. Mr Wilson may not necessarily be the political beneficiary of the budget agreement. Mr Mervin Field, the veteran California pollster, reports that voters blame him and the legislature alike and may vent their anger at his office as the budget cuts are felt.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Single market jobs fight in France FRENCH labour leaders yesterday demanded the government find local work for 4,000 customs agents likely to be transferred or lose their jobs under the EC's single market, AP reports from Paris. Most tariff and other customs barriers fell on January 1 with the single market's advent. The CFDT labour union said the planned transfers would mean hardship for the agents living along France's borders, and in Paris and Lyons.</p>

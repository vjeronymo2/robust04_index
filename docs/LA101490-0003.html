			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: STEVEN SEAGAL WANTS HIS OSCAR  </P> <P> With Steven Seagal's "Marked for Death" riding high at the box office -- it  grossed nearly $12 million in its first four days of release -- the tough-guy  star is at work on his native turf, Brooklyn, where he's just started shooting  his next film.  </P> <P> It's called "The Price of Our Blood" and Seagal tells us: "I'm finally doing a  picture I'm excited about."  </P> <P> The actor and martial artist calls it "a wonderful character piece that's about  friendship -- two guys who grew up together who find themselves on different  sides of the law, and then have to react to a personal tragedy."  </P> <P> Directed by John Flynn, and co-produced by Arnold Kopelson and Seagal for  Warner Bros., "The Price of Our Blood" is from a script by Lance Hill.  </P> <P> Or at least it was.  </P> <P> "I've completely rewritten it," declares Seagal unabashedly. "I'm sure Lance  Hill is a nice guy, but I'm also sure he's never been to Brooklyn. I've made  the movie feel more real -- and I've emphasized the friendship, and the idea  that these two guys who grew up together are suddenly working against each  other."  </P> <P> Known for his less-than-subtle action roles, Seagal adds that "The Price of Our  Blood" "is my attempt at an Academy Award."  </P> <P> Seriously?  </P> <P>  "In this film, audiences are going to see a performance they aren't  expecting," he insists. "Yeah, I could deliver an Academy Award performance.  But I'm not kidding myself. Because I'm Steven Seagal, I will never get an  Academy Award.  </P> <P> "This industry has already made its mind up about me." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

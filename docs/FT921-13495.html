			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Finns and Russians sign trade pact FINLAND and Russia signed trade and friendship pacts yesterday, replacing those running from the late 1940s until last year, Robert Taylor reports from Stockholm. The old trade system gave Finnish companies the edge over western exporters to the Soviet market. But in the first half of 1991, Finnish exports to the Soviet Union fell 61 per cent to FM3.6bn (Pounds 467m), with imports falling 25 per cent. Now, two-way trade has almost vanished. The two also signed a new political pact replacing the 43-year treaty imposed after the second world war. In future, relations will be based on international law under the UN charter and the final act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, ensuring existing frontiers between Finland and Russia. Neste, Finland's state-owned petrochemical company, has reached agreement with the Russians to import 2m tonnes of crude oil for refining in Finland.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Nestle Hungaria in Ft2bn CP issue NESTLE Hungaria, part of the Swiss foods group, yesterday kick-started Budapest's commercial paper market with an issue of short-term notes. Nestle Hungaria is to issue up to Ft2bn (Dollars 24m) in notes with principal guaranteed by Nestle. Nestle Hungaria said it would use the proceeds to satisfy its regular working capital needs. The notes are not expected to a premium above Hungarian Treasury bills, which have an average yield of 16.2 per cent, according to the DWIX index. Nestle Hungaria will make considerable savings by borrowing through a CP issue rather than through banks. The most competitive prime rates are about 5 per cent higher than Treasury yields, largely because of banks' requirements to hold reserves. Credit Suisse First Boston, which is acting as dealer and arranger, said it was in talks with other companies on CP issues. CSFB expects joint ventures, units of multinationals and domestic companies to make CP issues this year. CSFB Budapest has already arranged Forint bond issues for itself and the Hungarian units of McDonald's and Levi Strauss.</p>

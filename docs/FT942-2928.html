			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Buenos Aires port sale hit by row A bitter dispute between a consortium led by a subsidiary of UK-owned P&amp;O and Argentina's Murchison-Roman port services company is blocking the privatisation of the port of Buenos Aires. The consortium, led by P&amp;O Australia, originally won bidding to operate two of the port's busiest terminals as a 25-year concession. But last week Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, rejected P&amp;O's offer after second-placed Murchison-Roman claimed one of its rival's local partners, OL Fasce, had not complied with bidding terms. Mr Cavallo said he regretted P&amp;O had lost the concession, but said he cancelled the transfer because Fasce had failed to prove it had a minimum net worth of Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.6m) - one of the conditions of the privatisation. However, P&amp;O had previously challenged Murchison-Roman's objections in court, insisting Fasce could prove its net worth. On Wednesday it applied for a injunction halting the transfer. Mr Luis Dotras, a Murchison-Roman director, said P&amp;O made 'a totally speculative offer that would be impossible to comply with.' He alleged the P&amp;O consortium would not be able to generate sufficient cashflow to pay the government the Dollars 13.5m (Pounds 8.88m) annual fee it had offered. Murchison-Roman offered a Dollars 9.7m annual fee. P&amp;O in turn alleges Murchison-Roman used lobbying strength to overturn its bid. Mr Horacio Duranona, a lawyer acting for the P&amp;O consortium, said: 'P&amp;O made the biggest offer. Murchison pressured Congress. The economy ministry did not review all the documents proving sufficient net worth.'</p>

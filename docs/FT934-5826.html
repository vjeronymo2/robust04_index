			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Skiing: Just watch this face Thank goodness I had a bath this morning. A grown man is lying on the floor poking at my feet, his face millimetres from my right big toe. His name is Dion Taylor, he comes from New Zealand and his mission is to find a pair of ski boots that fit me. Since my feet - as I was once told - are like bricks, this is no easy task. We settle for Koflachs: the RC837 'trouble shooters'. 'We bought this boot specifically for people who suffer from problem feet,' says the Snow + Rock ski company catalogue, ominously. 'To be honest I'd like to put you in Salomons, but Koflachs are better for your shape of foot,' says Taylor, a top man at Snow &amp; Rock, which is supplying equipment for the 1994 FT Round the World Ski Expedition, during which I will be skiing every day for a year. Next to me, my skiing companion Lucy Dicker is having her feet prodded by another Kiwi, 'Johnno' Carmichael. 'Lucy, you've got very high arches and you pronate a lot,' he says. 'That means your feet roll inwards when you walk. We'll compensate for that with our High-Definition Sidas inner soles moulded to your foot.' The next stage is to have our boots foamed, and then equipped with Winter Heat pads - a bit cissyish, but a few comforts will not go amiss since we will be spending all of 1994 in these boots. Foaming makes them fit snugly but means getting them on and off for the first few days is a desperate struggle. What else? A tough pair of Sorel boots for our evening walkabouts; an Ortovox Stratus rucksack and avalanche shovel; Pieps Dual Frequency avalanche transceivers; WRS Sports Med back-supports (corsets to you and me) and Gul knee sleeves for support. Then there are Gator fleece-lined face masks; Casio altimeter, barometer and thermometer watches; Avocet altimeters; Ski Dometers to clock speed and mileage; security ski locks; and powder traces to prevent us losing skis in deep powder. Oh, and some skis: Salomon and K2; and Lutah and Degre 7 ski suits. With everything on, we resembled walking ski shops. Next stop: the Bio-Mechanical Analysis Laboratory (BiMAL) at Hammersmith, West London, where physiotherapists to the stars, hold court. Will Carling, the England rugby captain, was working out a few feet away when we started training on a Cybex 340. It sounds like a death ray, but it is helping Carling sort out a problem hip and, hopefully, will help us. You sit in what looks like a jet pilot's seat and a metal caliper is strapped around your lower thigh. This device, when linked to a computer, checks the strengths of your hamstrings, quads, and abductors and adductors and target any of these for strengthening or recovery from injury with a programme of weight training. 'Very often energy is wasted by an inefficient style or limited by injury,' explains Watson. 'Cybex will pin-point any weakness in strength or symmetry and can even be used to diagnose certain medical conditions.' Lucy and I had mixed initial diagnoses - basically Lucy was supple and I was strong. 'Your overall flexibility was extremely high,' Watson told me. 'But the strength of your stomach muscles could be better.' Quite. Lucy, meanwhile, showed 'a very good range of flexibility around the pelvis and legs, with a full range of spinal movement. The combined strength levels of her legs was high and above twice her body weight, which was excellent. But her right leg is 40 per cent weaker than the left.' Outer fitness is being pursued: Lucy and I visited the Clarins Studio at Neville Daniel in London's Knightsbridge for what we thought would be a couple of tubes of suncream and ended up having a three-hour session with Sarah and Pamela, two Clarins beauticians, who administered head-to-toe massage, facials and a range of skin products for all weathers. We do not use soap any more - soap is for the hoi polloi. We have Gentle Foaming Cleanser, Rich Treatment Cream, Eye Contour Balm and Gel, Multi-Active Day Cream, Eau Dynamisante, and even Skin Beauty Repair. And that is just for London. We have not even started with the mountain moisturisers and potions yet. Watch this face. Snow + Rock: 188, Kensington High Street, London. Tel: 071-937 0872.

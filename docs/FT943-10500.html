			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: DSM posts surge in profits to Fl 98m DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, said net profit rose more than 20-fold in the second quarter of 1994 compared with the same quarter of 1993. Net profit jumped to Fl 98m (Dollars 55m) from just Fl 4m, on turnover up slightly more than 8 per cent at Fl 2.27bn. The latest figures take net profit for the first half to Fl 181m, a significant improvement from the Fl 10m posted in the first six months of 1993. The company said it had profited from its continuing cost-cutting drive and from a strong 12 per cent rise in sales by volume in the first half. This, in turn, reflected economic recovery in Europe and resurgent demand from important customers, such as the European vehicle industry. Demand for caprolactum, a raw material used in making nylon, was also on the increase in east Asia and western Europe. At the same time, the flow of cheap, competitive supplies of the feed stock from central and eastern Europe had slowed. 'The improvement in results is first and foremost due to higher sales volumes,' Mr Ad Timmermans, a DSM board member, said. 'Selling prices are still low, but show an upward trend.' DSM gave no definitive forecast for the rest of the year but the company said that the traditional 'summer dip' in the current third quarter would probably be less pronounced than in previous years. Sales by volume are expected to remain high in the second half, while a slight recovery in prices should set in for some products. Mr Timmermans said the surge in profit was 'gratifying', but added that profit levels were still too low. DSM will pay an interim dividend of Fl 0.50, representing one-third of its sharply reduced total dividend of Fl 1.50 in 1993. The company cautioned, however, that the interim dividend did not give any indication of the full-year dividend.</p>

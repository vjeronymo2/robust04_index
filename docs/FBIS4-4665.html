			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, April 1 KYODO -- North Korea's ambassador  to the United Nations on Friday [1 April] renewed Pyongyang's  call for high-level talks with the United States to settle a row  over international inspections on North Korean nuclear  facilities.    In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Pak Kil-yon said  North Korea is not opposed to holding high-level talks with the  U.S. if a ground for such talks is provided.    Pak said, "not at this moment, but if the U.S. could lay the  foundation for a third round of high-level talks, we have stated  we will not oppose" such a move.    On a UN Security Council statement Thursday calling for the  North to fulfill obligations to open its nuclear facilities to  international inspections, the ambassador said it is "a  unilateral demand and (North Korea) does not have an obligation  to meet it."    In a statement issued Thursday, the Security Council urged  North Korea to allow unrestricted inspections of its nuclear  facilities and hinted at economic sanctions if it failed to  comply.    But Pak did not deny a possibility of accepting further  inspections by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), if negotiations with the U.S. proceed.    "We have not yet heard of an official proposal from the UN,"  he said.    Asked what he has in mind as a condition for holding the  high- level talks with the U.S., Pak said "it is only the  fulfillment of the U.S.-DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of  Korea) agreement reached on February 25."    In the agreement with the north on February 25, the U.S.  announced it would call off the Team Spirit joint military  exercises with South Korea in exchange for North Korea's  acceptance of IAEA inspections on its seven declared nuclear  plants.    The IAEA started the inspections last month but after an  IAEA  inspection team was barred from collecting samples of nuclear  material from one of the seven nuclear plants, the U.S.  stiffened its attitude.    The U.S. and South Korea then reversed the decision to call  off the Team Spirit war games after the IAEA's announcement that  Pyongyang had thwarted its nuclear inspections.    The Security Council announced it would wait until the end  of  April, when the IAEA provides its report on the North Korean  issue, before it decides if it will actually impose sanctions on  the north.    Diplomatic sources said the focus now has shifted to whether  the U.S. and the north will resume unofficial contacts to pave  the way for high-level talks as well as China's efforts to  persuade Pyongyang to accept the U.N. request.    China, as a permanent Security Council member, has veto  powers on UN resolutions and has maintained close relations with  North Korea even after the collapse of the former Soviet Union,  once another supporter of Pyongyang.</p>

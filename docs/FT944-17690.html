			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / EU backing for telecoms competition A 'one-stop telecomm-unications shop' has been set up by European governments to promote greater competition in provision of telecoms services and help harmonise licensing arrangements. Twenty European governments, including all EU states except Ireland, have given their backing to the European Telecommunications Office, which has been established in Copenhagen. The European Commission sees the office as a key step in opening up Europe's telecoms market to competition. Eleven governments, including all the EU except Portugal, Greece and Ireland, have agreed the office will provide a standardised application procedure for companies wishing to provide new or competing telecoms services within their countries. Member governments will have an obligation to process applications within six weeks where possible, and provide translations of licences into English. Most EU states will not open basic voice telephony to competition until 1998, but a wide range of telecoms services, including private corporate networks and leased line facilities, are already open to competition. A Commission official said: 'This is to help make telecoms competition a reality, by making the licensing procedure less opaque and to curb the endless delays currently involved'. The European Telecommunications Office has been given responsibility for devising pan-European numbering systems for companies wishing to offer services such as freephone in more than one country. It will look at ways of harmonising licensing requirements, which vary widely between member states. The Commission's telecoms division was working 'flat out' to publish a Green Paper next month on the liberalisation of telecoms infrastructure across the EU, enabling new operators to provide services over their own networks, the official added. The Green Paper is set to recommend that infrastructure be liberalised in line with services, allowing competitors to existing telecoms operators to begin at once with investment in competing networks. They would be able to use them in all services by 1998. Last week's telecoms council in Brussels saw strong opposition from Spain, Portugal, Greece, Denmark and Ireland to any early liberalisation infrastructure, but agreed the Commission should present proposals to the next meeting in mid-November. The UK, Germany, and the Netherlands have given strong support for liberalising infrastructure in line with services.</p>

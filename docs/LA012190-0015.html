			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMMACULATE DECEPTION  </P> <P> Regarding "Immaculate Conception" (a poem by Louise Erdrich, Book Review, Dec.  24): Evidently Erdrich doesn't know the difference between the Immaculate  Conception and the Virgin Birth. Quite clearly her lines concern the latter,  not the former.  </P> <P> The Immmaculate Conception is the doctrine that the Virgin Mary, from the  moment of her conception in St. Anne's womb, was kept free from original sin.  </P> <P> SHELBY J. LIGHT, Assistant Minister, First Congregational Church, LONG BEACH  </P></p>

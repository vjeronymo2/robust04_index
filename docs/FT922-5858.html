			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / UN report warns on global heating THE political drive to combat global warming receives powerful scientific backing today with the publication of a report from the United Nations inter-governmental panel on climate change (IPCC) to next week's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. IPCC predicts that human activities will heat up the world during the next century, by pumping carbon dioxide and other 'greenhouse gases' into the atmosphere. There is, however, still uncertainty about the scientific processes involved in global warming. It is also impossible to know how much the world population and industrial activities will grow, and how much greenhouse emissions will be reduced by concerted international action to reduce consumption of carbon fuels. IPCC studied six scenarios and each shows an appreciable increase in global temperature. The average increase is likely to be somewhere between 1.5 degrees Celsius and 3.5 degrees Celsius over the next 100 years. Even warming at the bottom end of this range could raise sea levels by 50cm - enough to flood low-lying countries such as Bangladesh. Agriculture in some parts of the world would be devastated. The report draws directly on the research of 118 scientists from 22 countries; a further 380 scientists were brought in to review their work. 'It can therefore be considered as an authoritative statement of the contemporary scientific community,' said Sir John Houghton, scientific chairman of IPCC and former director of the UK Meteorological Office. Today's report stands by the main conclusions of the IPCC's first scientific assessment, released in 1990, which shocked politicians and gave real momentum to the movement to draw up an international convention on climatic change. There has been a vast amount of research since then - some suggesting the IPCC had exaggerated the danger by ignoring cooling processes which could counteract the greenhouse effect. But IPCC says these will only slightly reduce the overall trend. The most important new cooling influences are destruction of the heat-absorbing ozone layer by man-made chemicals (mainly CFCs), and tiny particles of industrial pollution known as 'sulphate aerosols' which shroud much of the northern hemisphere in a heat-reflecting haze.

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDBERG, JARRYD UPSET IN DOUBLES, BUT SWEDEN STILL IN COMMAND, 2-1  </P> <P> Stefan Edberg and Anders Jarryd were upset in Saturday's doubles, but Sweden  retained its lead over Yugoslavia in a Davis Cup semifinal.  </P> <P> Edberg and Jarryd, once one of the world's best doubles team but now playing  together only in team competition, lost, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 to Goran Ivanisevic  and Goran Prpic.  </P> <P> Sweden leads, 2-1, going into today's final two singles matches.  </P> <P> Jonas Svensson and Mats Wilander had won the opening singles matches Friday.  Sweden has never lost a Davis Cup match after leading, 2-0.  </P> <P> Svensson will play Prpic in the first singles match today, and Wilander will  complete the best-of-five series against Ivanisevic, a teen-ager who has jumped  to 51st in the rankings this year.  </P> <P> The Yugoslavs were playing only their fourth doubles match together.  Ivanisevic, who played two other doubles with Prpic in the Kings Cup, a  European team event, and one in the Nations' Cup, was outstanding.  </P> <P> "It was a tough match because we have played so little together," Ivanisevic  said. "We played really good. It was impossible to beat us.  </P> <P> Edberg, a finalist in both the French Open and Wimbledon, was replaced as  singles player by Svensson because of an ankle injury. He had not played  competitively since Wimbledon. He sprained his ankle last weekend in his  hometown of Vastervik during his first workout on clay since Wimbledon.  </P> <P> "I would have been surprised if I had played well today," Edberg said. "Anders  had only one handicap and that was me."  </P></p>

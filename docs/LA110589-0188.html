			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOARD OF INQUIRY NAMED TO STUDY COLLAPSE OF BRIDGE AND FREEWAY  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian named 10 members of an independent Board of Inquiry  Saturday, to investigate the collapse of Interstate 880 and the San  Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in the Oct. 17 earthquake.  </P> <P> The panel is headed by nationally known earthquake engineering expert George  Housner, who was appointed earlier.  </P> <P> Housner, who was appointed several days after the disaster, is the C.F. Braun  Professor of Engineering Emeritus for the Caltech in Pasadena.  </P> <P> The Oct. 17 earthquake killed 65 people, including 41 in the collapse of a  double-decker section of I-880 in Oakland known as the Nimitz Freeway.  </P> <P> The board will investigate the collapse of both I-880 and a section of the Bay  Bridge.  </P> <P> "We also need to know whether these failures were, or could have been,  predicted," Deukmejian said in his Saturday morning radio address, when  announcing the new appointees.  </P> <P> Deukmejian said the board will determine if the bridge and freeway were  properly retrofitted using seismic and structural information that has been  developed after other earthquakes.  </P> <P> The panel also is expected to make recommendations as to whether the state  should modify existing construction and freeway retrofit programs in light of  information learned from the quake.  </P></p>

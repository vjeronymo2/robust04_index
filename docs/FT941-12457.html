			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / How to Spend It: Minimalism in the bath-tub - Lucia van der Post taps into the latest in bathroom design and fashion 'Home in Three Days. Don't Wash.' These were Napoleon's orders to Josephine as he sent her a message that he was on his way back from the front. In his time, it seems, a taste for women au naturel was not at all unusual. Today the fashion for the daily bath, for cleanliness and the banishing of body odours permeates our culture. There is scarcely a western house without at least one bathroom and in prosperous circles two, three and four are not uncommon. Those of a reflective cast of mind are inclined to invest bathing with mystical significance, seeing it as a domestic version of ancient purifactory rites. Certainly, it is true that bathing the world over has always been connected with motives other than simple cleanliness. In these secular times pleasure is the over-riding aim and, for years, modern design reflected this. Just as minimalism and a sense of simple quality has taken over in other rooms of the house, so it has begun to reach the bathroom. Take the one photographed here (top). Designed for a successful city banker - a bachelor - the brief to Simply Bathrooms, which created the room for him, was for comfort, quality and simplicity. The owner wanted the maximum luxury and the best quality shower, bath and fittings. He also wanted the overall look to be as simple and stark as possible. He wanted the tranquility of a Japanese bathhouse without a frill or a hint of excess. The heart of the bathroom, and the reason for its owner's intense satisfaction, depends on the quality of the fittings. He wanted a shower and Simply Bathrooms selected Showerlux, a German make, because, although many showers would meet his technical requirements, that one also met his visual needs. The cubicle is made of curved glass which is elegant and much less visually intrusive than any others It arrives as a complete unit (a central upright pole which houses the controls is integrated into the glass) which means there is very little for even the most ham-fisted plumber to screw up. Its disadvantage is that being free-standing it does need quite a lot of space. There is an even more beautiful and luxurious model - which requires yet more space - which looks like a stunning transparent snail. The bath is high-quality acrylic, as plain as could be, with a built-in whirlpool to enable its owner to relax in the city. The total cost of equipment and installation came out at just under Pounds 10,000. Anyone who has had a go at transforming or installing a bathroom will know that one of the big difficulties is that at the top end of the market in specialist products for the bathroom, 10 different suppliers might be involved - with possible long waits for delivery men who turn up just when you have given up on them and gone out. Patrick Riley, managing director of Simply Bathrooms, decided that one of the keys to running a successful bathroom business had to be in providing better service. He, therefore, set about developing a system to co-ordinate deliveries so that every component would arrive on the same day. Some 70 per cent of the equipment he sells he keeps in stock, the rest has to be ordered. He delivers it all together. The bathroom photographed here, for instance, was installed in a week, resulting in minimal disruption to the owner's domestic life. Anyone interested in the service can ring 081-665-0066 for a brochure (which is filled with information, planning aids, design suggestions, points to look out for) or visit the showrooms at 28 Rushgrove Avenue, Colindale, London, NW9 6QS or 2 Bensham Lane, Croydon, Surrey. For those who are brave enough to think of renovating or building a bathroom from scratch themselves, Terence Conran's Do-It-Yourself book (Conran Octopus, Pounds 14.99, 254 pages) has two suitably pared-down bathroom projects which are described in detail. The one photographed (left) is a light, panelled room which uses painted tongue-and-groove pine boarding to hide the pipework. Besides being visually appealing the tongue-and-groove boarding may be mounted on a batten frame to create an access panel which can be easily removed if (as they surely will) plumbing problems arise. The whole effect is redolent of cool, New England chic. The second bathroom which might be useful to those looking for inspiration is a clean-lined tiled bath shower and basin unit. The result looks sleek, restfully uncluttered and easy to clean. Here at last are designs to inspire. For too long most do-it-yourself manuals have been high on expertise and technical information but low on elan. Terence Conran's book, as you might expect from such a designer, focuses on 30 different projects, each one of which is thoroughly in tune with 1990s-style simplicity. Besides the bathrooms there is a great deal else of interest to those who who feel comfortable with the mysterious world of Do-It-Yourself. There is a pared-down, elegant solution to the problem of providing shelves and cupboards in an alcove. There is a baby's crib, a rocking chair, a wall of display shelving and, possibly my favourite design of all, a Japanese wardrobe which is all sleek panels and sliding screens, light years removed from the embellished built-in systems which do-it-yourselfers are usually encouraged to embark on. Perhaps some of the most useful designs are those for the garden - a tree seat, a plain as plain garden bench, a walk-through pergola and, most ambitious of all, a summer house. I have no ambitions in the DIY area myself so am unable to judge how easy the instructions are to follow but there are intricate-looking drawings, comprehensive lists of the materials and tools required and the quality of the photography and drawings make even me think that maybe one day I too might just have a go with the Black &amp; Decker.</p>

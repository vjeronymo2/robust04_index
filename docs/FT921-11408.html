			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Profit-linked pay plans double to 3,000 in year THE NUMBER of companies with profit-related pay schemes more than doubled to almost 3,000 last year, according to figures released by the Inland Revenue yesterday. The number of individual employees enrolled in schemes rose to nearly 600,000. Profit-related pay schemes, which were introduced in 1987, offer tax relief to employees up to a certain proportion of their salary. The number of companies with schemes rose to 2,949 in the 12 months to last December, compared with 1,233 a year earlier. The number of employees covered rose from 263,400 to 581,000. The number of employees covered by schemes still represents only 2 per cent of the British working population. Much of the increase took place in the last quarter of 1991, which the Revenue said reflected attempts to register before the beginning of the new tax year in April. Mr John Maples, economic secretary to the Treasury, said the figures reflected the doubling of tax relief for schemes announced in the 1991 Budget and they represented a 'major boost' to the idea of profit-related pay. Ms Jenny Davenport, head of employee relations and communications at the Industrial Society, said: 'Performance-related pay is a bit of a performance. It's a good thing but not terribly relevant.' She said the limited level of tax relief offered under the scheme, the delay before relief was paid and the bureaucracy involved in administering the scheme explained why adoption rates were not higher. Profit schemes have to cover 80 per cent of the employees in a company and use a complex formula to fix payments.</p>

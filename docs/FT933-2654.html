			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Italy's shares boom built on shaky foundations: Financial instability threatens to turn companies' success into disaster Italian shares have climbed so sharply this summer that the stock exchange's overburdened computers recently suffered a three-hour breakdown under the weight of buy orders. Milan has been the fastest-rising bourse in Europe since January. Investors have piled into equities as rates on government bonds have fallen in line with the international trend towards lower borrowing. That has prompted a bout of share buying unequalled since the mid-1980s when enthusiasm about company profits made Italy Europe's best-performing stock market. However, this time the corporate sector is in much worse shape: companies have borrowed more heavily, interest rates remain relatively high, and Italy's 18-month political corruption scandal has tarnished the reputation of many companies. Unless there is reform in management, banking and regulation of many companies, the surge in share prices could be a bubble waiting to burst. Italy's banks have been taking the brunt of criticism. 'The banks lent too freely in the late 1980s, when deposits were growing fast and bankers were falling over themselves to lend to companies to win market share,' one foreign banker says. The legacy of that decision is immense debts that some groups are finding impossible to repay. At least six of Italy's best-known companies have had to turn to their bankers for help this year. Ciga, the luxury hotels group controlled by the Aga Khan, has stopped paying interest on over L1,000bn (Pounds 414.42m) of debts and is trying to sell some of its best-known hotels to cut its financial burdens. The Cameli family, which runs a shipping and commodities trading concern, and Arvedi, one of Italy's biggest steelmakers, are both trying to shed assets to meet debts of more than L1,000bn. The need for corporate rescues has pinpointed serious flaws in the way banks lend money and the way in which groups use it. Banks have stumbled in extending credit too freely, without assessing the risks. Many credits have been tied to fixed assets rather than to cash-generating operations. Weaknesses have also emerged in the way banks monitor their lending. This year's financial crisis at Ferruzzi, Italy's second biggest private company, has exposed some glaring lapses. Many banks were unaware of the extent of their loans to the sprawling Ferruzzi empire. 'Credit controls are still not up to the best international standards and management information systems are often antiquated,' says the international credit chief of one US bank. Poor management information and an emphasis on growth at all costs have been evident at many of the companies now in difficulty. Opportunistic diversifications were also common. The Camelis expanded into an array of unrelated activities, including cash registers. And Ferruzzi, which is now staggering under debts of more than L28,000bn, expanded aggressively during the later 1980s, through a stream of takeovers and investments that moved it away from its core agricultural business. Part of the reason for the costly diversifications was to enhance the image of the controlling Ferruzzi family. Determination to match industrial dynasties such as the Agnellis, who control the Fiat cars group, was a big influence on Mr Raul Gardini, Ferruzzi's former chairman, who killed himself in July. Such lese-majeste with shareholders' money has been facilitated by family domination of many companies. The Agnellis still own about 30 per cent of Fiat, while policy at Ferruzzi, which is 48 per cent controlled by the founding family, was dictated first by Mr Gardini and then by Mr Carlo Sama, both sons-in-law of the founder. While owner-managers can contribute greater commitment to a business and understanding of its operations than an outsider, they can also be liabilities. Some Italian owner managers find it difficult to distance themselves from their companies and deal with difficult decisions. In the case of Ferruzzi, owner-management may even have contributed to fraud. Ferruzzi's new management, imposed by creditor banks in June, believes executives and members of the Ferruzzi family covered up L435bn in trading losses since 1989. Even when outside executives are brought into a company, their freedom of action is often limited by the management structures and the need to defer to controlling family interests. The complex legal structure of many family-controlled companies has also restricted outside influences. Many well-known companies, such as Fiat, Pirelli, Ferruzzi and Benetton, are modelled on a pyramid, with a wholly owned holding company at the pinnacle, exercising control through separate holdings. For Italy's private sector companies to gain a sounder financial footing, such weaknesses need to be addressed. Ferruzzi, which is due to unveil a restructuring plan later this month, could provide the first opportunity to such changes into practice. The group's new management has already appointed a slimmed-down board that should be more accountable to shareholders. Members of the Ferruzzi family have been excluded and one director has been appointed to represent the group's 49,000 small shareholders. The re-organisation is expected to involve a substantial simplification of the group's complex structure, and a return to the food and agricultural businesses on which the group was based. If the changes are sufficiently ambitious, Ferruzzi could become the first of a new generation of Italian companies with a wide shareholder base, transparent structure and clear, commercial aims. If the plan fails, the weaknesses in Italy's corporate sector could worsen.</p>

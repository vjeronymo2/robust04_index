The official said that he expected the contact to be held as  early as next week.    When an IAEA inspection team enters North Korea, Pyongyang  and Washington will probably announce a date for the third round  of high-level talks, South and North Korea will have a  working-level contact on exchanging special envoys, and Seoul  will declare the suspension of its "Team Spirit" joint military  exercise with the United States.    "North Korea and the IAEA are expected to begin  consultations  soon on the method and schedule for the IAEA inspection of North  Korea's seven declared nuclear installations. After the  consultation is over, North Korea and the United States will  finally fix their agenda and schedule for the third round of  talks," the official said.    "If Pyongyang and Washington agree on details in additional  contacts in New York and smoothly push ahead with preparations,  then the third round of talks will be held. They will have  full-fledged discussion on resolution of the North Korean  nuclear problem."    Consultation between North Korea and the IAEA is not  directly  leading to solution of the North Korean nuclear problem, but it  is preparation for a third round of talks to solve the problem,  he added.    North Korea's willingness to consult with the IAEA is  progress, he said.</p>

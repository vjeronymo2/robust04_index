			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Amman, 6 May (MENA)--Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif  Sidqi stated that Egypt's leadership and security organs are  confronting terrorism and terrorists with the firmness and  strength they deserve and that all their activities are  confronted decisively. He said: We should not worry about Egypt.    Speaking at a meeting with members of the Egyptian community  in Jordan before leaving Amman this afternoon, the prime  minister said that compared with other countries, terrorism in  Egypt is decreasing in a big way.    Answering a question, he said that attempts were made over a  long period to hold a dialogue with these terrorists at times  between 1980 and 1987 or 1988. He added: The dialogue  continued in one way or another but they were not ready to  listen to the voice of reason and their ideas rendered the  dialogue useless. When they started to use bullets and kill, the  security organs confronted them decisively and firmly. [passage  omitted]</p>

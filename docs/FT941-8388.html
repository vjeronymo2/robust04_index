			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / As They Say in Europe: Dutch trick or treat for the Germans One problem the British scarcely worry about is what they call people from the Netherlands. They have been calling them 'Dutch' forever, but the Dutch started to use it to mean the Germans, and not themselves, around 1600. Schoolchildren in the Netherlands are usually asked, after their first English lesson, 'Are you Dutch?' They immediately yell that they are not. Maybe this is what makes them anxious to ensure nobody mistakes them for Germans. I recall such a moment at a press conference where a Dutch finance minister, I think it was Onno Ruding, was asked what he would do if he were running the Bundesbank. (There was one of the usual rows about German interest rates going on at the time.) 'Never ask a Dutchman what he would do if he were a German,' was the reply. But things are changing in the Netherlands, maybe. At the end of last month, the weekly, Vrij Nederland, ran a long piece headed 'On our knees before Germany'. It was a mildly critical study of a new German-friendly tone in Dutch official policy. 'Is a taboo against the Federal Republic being lifted? The new Deutschfreundlichkeit is on the map.' Now it is widely believed that it is the British who are mainly responsible for sustaining an anachronistic image of the Germans as scarred, monocle-wearing, swastika-covered thugs. The truth of the matter is that it is only the British who make jokes and draw cartoons inspired by such figures. But it seems the Dutch share the same stereotype: Vrij Nederland says that the only bit of German history Dutch pupils learn is the bit between 1933 and 1945. Today, however, Germany is 'in' - in political circles at least. The weekly newspaper reported that the nation's top diplomat, given the choice between taking over the Bonn or Washington embassy, took the one that mattered, Bonn. A new, friendlier atmosphere has been made possible because of the retirement of Hans-Dietrich Genscher as German foreign minister and the transition of his Dutch opposite number, Hans Van den Broek, to the Brussels commission. It seems that they did not like each other (I bet you did not know that.) But none of this has seeped down to the Dutchman in the street. One official told the paper, 'If you say your daughter is going as an au pair to Paris, everyone says, 'Fine'. Even better if you say she is off to the US. To Lausanne is good. 'But if your daughter is going to Berlin, everyone says, 'What - au pair in Berlin]'' And, it seems, when Dutch young people meet young Germans they speak to each other in Pidgin English. Which is hard to believe for anyone who thinks of Dutch as just a version of German. The Dutch writer, Harry Mulisch, once wrote, 'The Germans and Dutch stand together, back to back.' The latter have looked traditionally to Britain but might have to stand the other way now, for the British are partly responsible for the changes taking place in Dutch policy. 'England has turned its back on Europe . . . and we have to make ourselves more European,' said a former ambassador to Nato. This is all quite interesting stuff, but not as interesting as the German reaction: Vrij Nederland aroused sombre comment. Apart from the title ('On our knees . . . ') it was not a hostile piece. But instead of being pleased about the new turn in Dutch official attitudes, a writer in the Frankfurter Allgemeine took it all rather grimly. 'Between Germany and Holland there should rule the closest friendship.' Fortunately this is meant ironically; Germans no longer believe in the concept of compulsory friendship. The article continued with typical pessimism: 'There could exist between Germany and Holland the paradoxical relationship which existed between the old socialist 'fraternal countries': at the highest political level, an ostentatious friendship, while the people still show mutual distrust and want to know nothing of each other.' Actually this is quite false on one side at least: the Germans like the Dutch and have no idea how they feel. At least, not until the German national team plays football against the Netherlands, when the Dutch spit or show their backsides to German supporters. The few Germans who take note of Dutch attitudes seem to believe that they are formed by constant reading of the diary of Anne Frank and school visits to Nazi deportation camps. The Dutch education minister went to Bonn three months ago to say he was really trying to give his youngsters a wider view. The trouble is, in fact, that so much, not only in the Netherlands, is defined by the German relationship. After all Vrij Nederland means, as you will have guessed, Free Netherlands. 'Free from what?' I ask Dutch friends. 'Van de Duitsers, from the Germans, of course,' they reply. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

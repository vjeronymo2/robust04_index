			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Jakarta, June 28 (AFP) -- Australian Prime  Minister Paul Keating Tuesday told President Suharto he was  disappointed at the banning in Indonesia of three popular  publications whose closure provoked numerous protests and a  severe police crackdown.    Keating -- whose comments came as 21 people went on trial  for  protesting the ban -- said the press closures "appear to  conflict or at least contrast with the openness which generally  occurs in the Indonesian (?economy)."    Keating said at a press conference after meeting Indonesian  President Suharto that he had been asked to understand Jakarta's  point of view.    Suharto said it was "very important" to maintain "stability  and national unity at this time of great economic growth and  transformation, that these things were to be taken as given in  the society," Keating said.    "Journalists in question had put some of these things --  that's national unity and stability -- at risk," Keating quoted  Suharto as saying. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEGION DISTRICT 20 PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> SUN VALLEY CAUGHT STEALING;  </P> <P> ELIMINATION: TOP-SEEDED TEAM FALLS TO PANORAMA CITY AFTER NINTH-INNING STRATEGY  FAILS AGAINST WOODLAND HILLS EAST.  </P> <P> Sun Valley Coach Les Riley went for broke in the ninth inning of Thursday's  American Legion playoff game with Woodland Hills East at Birmingham High. But  after the last out was recorded, it was his team that was left to pick up the  pieces.  </P> <P> With Sun Valley trailing, 4-3, with two out and runners on second and third,  Riley sent Robert Aros home from third. On a 1-1 count, Eric Rothman threw a  low fastball that catcher Carey Wilbur caught cleanly, tagging Aros a couple of  yards from the plate to end the American Legion District 20 playoff game.  </P> <P> "I figured (Aros) could beat the pitcher; he just didn't leave soon enough,"  Riley said. "It was a straight steal, a flip of the coin. I was hoping  something would break and it didn't."  </P> <P> Woodland Hills East (21-4) and Woodland Hills West (21-4), the only teams still  undefeated in the double-elimination tournament, will meet today at 4 p.m. at  Birmingham. Sun Valley (20-6), which entered the tournament as the top-seeded  team among eight teams, was eliminated later Thursday, dropping a 7-1 decision  to Panorama City.  </P> <P> Panorama City's Russell Ortiz (5-1) left little doubt about the result of the  second game, handcuffing Sun Valley on four hits over eight innings. The  conclusion of the first game was a little more controversial, though, and  although East Coach Matt Borzello benefited from Riley's failed ninth-inning  strategy, he questioned it just the same.  </P> <P> "(It) was a gutsy call, I guess, but it shows me that they don't believe in the  kid at the plate," Borzello said. "You have to believe in the batter at the  plate."  </P> <P> That batter was designated-hitter Sef Carlin, who was hitless in three at-bats  Thursday after batting .370 during the regular season.  </P> <P> The bizarre ending offered a fitting conclusion to a game that was sloppily  played throughout. The game-winning run, for instance, was one of only two  earned runs in the game and it came home in the bottom of the seventh inning on  a ground out by a batter Borzello felt should have been on first base.  </P> <P> A one-out infield single by Wilbur, a ground-rule double by Benji Belfield and  an intentional walk to Jamie Zeichick loaded the bases for John Erganian, who  quickly worked the count to 3-2. Or at least Borzello thought it was 3-2.  </P> <P> The next pitch from Sun Valley's Jake Loveridge (6-2) wasn't even close,  hitting the dirt to the left of the plate. But Erganian didn't move and  Loveridge was almost set to wind up again before Borzello ran in from the  third-base coaching box to question the count.  </P> <P> Both the plate umpire and Erganian thought the pitch was ball three, and when  Borzello and the official scorer argued otherwise, the field umpire admitted  that he, too, had the count at 3-2.  </P> <P> So rather than walking to force in a run, Erganian had to face another pitch,  which he grounded to second, scoring Wilbur.  </P> <P> "It was a costly mistake, because there were now two outs with a run in,  instead of one out," Borzello said. "We could no longer use the squeeze play or  try to manufacture a run."  </P> <P> Belfield led a 10-hit East attack, going four for four with a pair of doubles.  Rothman (6-0) went the distance for East, finishing with a seven-hitter.  </P> <P> In the nightcap, Roland De La Maza had two hits -- including a double -- in  four at-bats to spark a balanced attack for Panorama City (20-6).  </P> <P> Dave Unter relieved Ortiz in the ninth and retired Sun Valley in order to  preserve the win.  </P></p>

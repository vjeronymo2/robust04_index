			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Thomson family sells 40% stake in Hudbay THE FAMILY of Lord Thomson of Fleet has sold the bulk of its controlling interest in Hudson's Bay Company, Canada's biggest department store group and North America's oldest public company. Woodbridge, the Thomsons' holding company, said yesterday that it has raised CDollars 545m (USDollars 439.5m) through the sale to a group of underwriters of 20m Hudson's Bay shares. The stock will be distributed to investors at a price of CDollars 27.25 a share, to be paid in two instalments over the next year. The sale cuts Woodbridge's stake in HBC from 65 per cent to 25 per cent. The Thomsons will remain HBC's largest single shareholder for the time being. They have agreed not to sell their remaining interest for at least a year without the underwriters' consent. Woodbridge said the initiative for the sale had come from the underwriting group and 'senior management decided the price was right'. The funds will be used to cut debt and augment working capital. Some of the proceeds will be available for unidentified future investment, though these are unlikely to be in the retail field. The present Lord Thomson of Fleet, who prefers to be known simply as Mr Ken Thomson, is the son of the former proprietor of The Times of London. With the help of a group of low-profile managers, he has diversified the family business, which now includes controlling stakes in Thomson Corporation, the media and travel group, and Markborough Properties, a North American property company, as well as the stake in Hudson Bay, originally acquired in 1980. HBC has a colourful history stretching back more than three centuries, when it was set up by King Charles II as a fur trading enterprise. It now controls three groups of department stores with revenues last year of just over CDollars 5bn. But it has had a spotty earnings record, suffering a CDollars 4.5m loss in the three months to April.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lieutenant General Chea Man, deputy commander of  the 4th Military region, visited units on active duty in Preah  Vihear Province recently. At a meeting with the 14th division  commander and the commander of Preah Vihear Province's  operational zone, he praised our officers and the rank and file  for their efforts to carry out their duties, abide by the orders  of their commanders at all levels, agreeably maintain solidarity  with local villagers, and help educate the people.    Afterward, Lt. Gen. Chea Man listened to reports presented  by  the units on the activities pursued by the genocidal Khmer Rouge  to destroy the property and livelihood of the people, causing  most of those who live in remote areas far away from townships  to flee their homes in the most miserable fashion.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by A. Karuppaswamy] </F>   [Text] The Indo-German relations and cooperation in  industry and scientific development has a new vigor with the  visit of the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, to Germany. The  Germans also take cognizance of the importance of such a visit  when Germany is renewing its outside endeavor and enagement  after two and a half years of internal problem of unification.  Businessmen and industrialists along with the government were  very busy during the last two years. Inactivities concerned  with creating parity between the two Germanys radically opposed  with each in everything except the geographical contiguity  artificially separated by a manmade wall [sentence as heard].    Germany is now looking for new grounds for investing and  adequate return for their investment. The economic reforms  toward globalization of market in India has made Germany  immensely interested in collaboration. Mr. Narasimha Rao's  assurance to the German industrialists that India is pressing  ahead with economic reforms is a reassurance to many of them for  removing their hesitation to open new units or financing Indian  projects. The creation of an Asian-Pacific Committee of German  Industry is a major step toward consolidating Indo-German  cooperation. The low labor cost and skill of workers and the  fairly unexploited market in India is the most potential market  for German industrialists. The meeting between the prime  minister and the federal minister for economic development and  the German cochairman of the Indo-German Consultative Group in  Bonn has paved the way for narrowing down some of the  constraints.    India's largest trading partner and market for Indian export  in Europe will further invite Indian exports of silk, textiles,  leather, basic chemicals, precious stones and engineering item.  On their side, investment in lignite-based power plants, joint  ventures like power equipment and scientific and institutional  establishments are some of the added German ventures in India  contemplated immediately. The German Investment Development  Company, which has an office in Bombay, is accelerating its  involvement in speeding up implementing the 2,500 approved  projects for collaboration. In all, Germany is expected to  exploit the scheme with the potentials of 75,000 rupees.    Politically, the Indo-German relations are always cordial  and  consistent with adequate understanding in international fora.  Germans are well aware of the fact that India was one among the  first to establish diplomatic relations with Germany after the  withdrawal of allied forces. The unequivocal stand of Germany  on developments in Kashmir and its neutrality speaks of its  noninterference in other country's affairs. Such friendly  attitude and closer economic ties are bound to reflect in  Indo-German growth as viable economic powers.</p>

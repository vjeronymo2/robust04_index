Biblical passages are cited as supporting evidence;  sometimes opposing arguments are backed by the same passages. No matter. The  discussion has shaken up established views of Israeli politics and set Israelis  to pondering unresolved issues of the nature of the state.  </P> <P> In Jewish tradition, God gave the land -- most often now defined as the  territory that makes up modern Israel proper as well as the West Bank and Gaza  Strip -- to the Jewish people. The focus of the current argument lies in  whether the value of conserving human life supersedes the value of keeping all  the land. In the name of peace, can a biblical inheritance be deferred to some  distant future when the Messiah comes and settles all these earthly affairs?  </P> <P> And what of the Arab inhabitants who live here? Are their vines and orchards,  not to mention their mosques and churches, standing in the way of the  fulfillment of God's will?  </P> <P> The rabbinical thrust into the most sensitive issue facing Israeli society has  brought out latent displeasure that holy men of any sort should be influencing  affairs of state.  </P> <P> "The implied presumption that rabbis -- or for that matter, priests, ayatollahs  and other clerics believed to represent divine authority -- should 'rule' on  the crucial matters of state is known as theocracy," advised Yirmayahu Yovel, a  philosophy professor at Hebrew University. "Theocracy opposes not only the idea  of the modern liberal state in general but specifically the idea on which  Israel as the modern Jewish state was built."  </P> <P> The independent newspaper Maariv, bemoaning the involvement of the rabbis in  political life, stated flatly: "The rulings on Jewish law, made by doves or  hawks, should not determine Israel's political direction."  </P> <P> Critics notwithstanding, Israel is a country where religion and politics are  closely entwined. Caucuses of black-clad bearded Hasidic politicians are common  fare in Israel's Parliament.  </P> <P> Religious parties representing various shades of Jewish Orthodoxy hold the  balance of power between the two main secular blocs, the Likud and Labor  parties, in the nation's Parliament. Likud, the party of Prime Minister Yitzhak  Shamir, favors keeping all the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel has occupied  militarily for 22 years. Labor, the junior partner in the fragile ruling  coalition, appears willing to give some of the land in return for peace with  the Arabs.  </P> <P> Any shift by major religious leaders could have important political  implications. If either of the two main parties splits from the government and  tries to form a new ruling alliance, religious parties will hold the key. If  new elections take place, religious parties will surely have a role in  subsequent coalition-building.  </P> <P> Labor politicians have already been canvassing religious groups to see if they  could build a working parliamentary coalition. For Labor, with its secular  traditions, that in itself is a small revolution.  </P> <P> It had been commonly assumed that religious parties lean toward keeping the  occupied lands at all costs. Settlers in the West Bank and Gaza often raise the  banner of religious determinism to justify their campaigns to settle the  territory.  </P> <P> But that assumption was upset by Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of  Shas, a party representing Orthodox Jews of North African and Near Eastern  origin. Yosef is widely viewed as the country's most popular and charismatic  rabbi; portraits of him wearing gold embroidered robes and dark glasses adorn  not a few Sephardic homes. Shas holds six seats in the 120-member Israeli  Parliament, more than any other religious party.  </P> <P> Yosef told a conference on Jewish law in Jerusalem that saving lives supersedes  the need to keep all the land, provided that generals and politicians agree  that giving up the West Bank and Gaza is not a security threat to the nation as  a whole.  </P> <P> "If territories are handed over, (if) the danger of a war will recede and a  chance of durable peace will arise, then it appears that by any reasoning it is  permitted to hand over territory of the land of Israel for the sake of  attaining this goal (of saving lives)," he said.  </P> <P> Yosef said the Arab inhabitants should not be driven out both for religious and  humanitarian reasons. On the one hand, the Muslims are not pagans because they  worship one god. And even if they were "idol worshipers," they should not be  driven away "out of a descent respect for the opinions of the nations."  </P> <P> The comments created an uproar in part because of the unexpected nourishment  they gave the hopes of Israeli doves. Yosef's constituency, Sephardic Jewry,  has been widely viewed as expansionist, anti-Arab and supportive of Likud  policies. Suddenly, the view was at least partially turned on its head.  </P> <P> The pro-Labor newspaper Davar called Yosef's lecture "the most significant  event in Israeli politics in recent years. The tens of thousands who are  influenced by (Yosef) could tip the scales between Likud and Labor."  </P> <P> Independent observers noted an undercurrent in Yosef's words that struck at the  urgings of muscular nationalism in Israel, a pillar of Likud's appeal.  </P> <P> "Yosef comes from the world of the yeshiva that is not seduced by nationalism,"  remarked Rabbi David Hartman, head of the Shalom Hartman Institute for Judaic  Studies. "They don't celebrate power. For them, nationalism and power are not  the organizing principle of Judaism."  </P> <P> Nationalist rabbis did not accept Yosef's analysis lying down. They struck out  with their own viewpoint, also firmly rooted in Jewish law.  </P> <P> State-appointed chief rabbis, one from the Sephardic community, the other from  the Ashkenazi or European community, ruled that it is forbidden to give up the  occupied land. It is a biblical duty to defend Jewish sovereignty; the danger  to individuals cannot excuse giving it up.  </P> <P> Argued Shlomo Goren, a former chief Ashkenazi rabbi, writing in support of the  current chiefs' ruling: "There are no grounds for discussing the retention or  return of parts of Israel in terms of the question of danger."  </P> <P> Goren rejected the idea that the lands should be returned for ironclad peace  treaties -- unless Israel were in danger of losing the territory through  weakness in war.  </P> <P> "If we find that from a purely military aspect we are not in a position to  vanquish our enemies, then even a shaky peace treaty is preferable to a defeat  on the battlefield," he wrote in the Jerusalem Post.  </P> <P> While not directly calling for the expulsion of Arabs, Goren noted that because  the largely Muslim population does not accept certain commandments laid down to  the sons of Noah, they could not be given "lodging" in Israel.  </P> <P> Goren defined Israel's conflict with the Palestinians as an "obligatory war"  that must be pursued with "the utmost devotion."  </P> <P> While the battle among the rabbis raged in newspapers and religious journals,  another stir arose over utopian proposals put forth by Menahem Froman, a rabbi  from the small West Bank settlement of Tekoa.  </P> <P> Froman's is the man-bites-dog story of the West Bank. A founder of the militant  settler movement Gush Emunim, he devised a formula to share not only the  disputed territories with Arabs but Israel proper.  </P> <P> Under his plan, the land between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea would  be ruled by two governments, one Israeli and one Palestinian.  </P> <P> The Jews would owe allegiance to the Israeli authorities, the Arabs to the  Palestinian. He calls his concept the foundation of a "humane state" in which  all sides would maintain cultural and political identity with their own people.  </P> <P> In answer to the widespread dismissal of his ideas as utopian, Froman shrugged:  "This is the land of the prophets. It has always been the land of ideas."  </P> <P> Froman's ideas attracted little attention until he decided to meet with Faisal  Husseini, a Palestinian activist linked with the Palestine Liberation  Organization.  </P> <P> "Nothing I said was overly controversial," Froman recalled. "But people were  bothered that I shook his hand."  </P> <P> His neighbors in Tekoa, a hilltop community south of Bethlehem set among a ring  of Arab villagers, are tolerant of the rabbi's views but less so of his meeting  with Husseini.  </P> <P> "He's a dreamer," said settler Murray Alon. "But he was meeting with the enemy,  and that is hard to take."  </P> <P> Froman's ideas stem from the notion that the state is not the sole, or even  primary, force motivating contemporary Jewish history. He recalled that when  his parents came to British-ruled Palestine, statehood was not their primary  concern.  </P> <P> "Zionism means to bring Jews home," Froman asserted. "The state is secondary.  Or at least, a balance must be struck between the state and humankind."  </P> <P> He reviles the image that many have of settlers as people who "wear religious  clothes, a kippa (skullcap) and have murder in their eyes."  </P> <P> "The biggest hope for peace is to spiritualize Israeli society," he concluded.  </P> <P> But does he not believe that possession of the land by Jews is a step toward  divine redemption?  </P> <P> "Yes," he responded, stroking his prophet-sized beard. "But there are many ways  to possess. If it means coming in and throwing others out and creating horrible  structures of control, what is good about that? If it is the beginning of a  higher spiritual process, then it means something."  </P></p>

Gary Gregson said the investigation was continuing. He asked the  public for assistance in identifying the vandals. The Union reported that  nearly 50 machines -- valued at $450 each -- have been damaged since the  weekend, and that stickers with the name of the AIDS-rights group ACT UP have  been found on the racks. ACT UP stands for AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power.  Representatives of ACT UP did not answer their telephones.  </P></p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Proventus buys 39% stake in leisure group PROVENTUS, the Swedish investment group, has bought a 39.4 per cent stake in Aritmos, one of the world's leading sport and leisure companies, for SKr730m (Dollars 101m). The acquisition for an average price of SKr85.50 per share makes Proventus the largest single shareholder in Aritmos. The investment company has bought the stake of KF, the co-operative group, which with 25 per cent was previously Aritmos's biggest shareholder, and has made further purchases in the market. Aritmos's brands include Puma, one of the world's leading suppliers of soccer footwear, Etonic, the second largest supplier of golf footwear in the US and Tretorn, the world's leading supplier of 'pressureless' tennis balls. Other units cover angling equipment, gardening machines and bicycles. Mr Mikael Kamras, Proventus president, said the group intended to be an active shareholder in Aritmos, and would be seeking board representation. 'We believe the group has a long-term possibility to be really profitable, despite the tough market conditions which have depressed the company's recent profitability,' he said. In 1991 Aritmos, which is based in Helsingborg in southern Sweden, achieved SKr201m in income after financial items on turnover of SKr5.82bn. In the first eight months of last year, income after financial items reached SKr156m on turnover of SKr3.61bn. More than three quarters of the group's turnover is outside Sweden, primarily in Europe and the US. The group's current market capitalisation is SKr1.93bn. The purchase has halved Proventus's previous liquidity level of SKr1.5bn.</p>

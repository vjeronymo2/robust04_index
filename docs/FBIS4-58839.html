During this call they reviewed  the development of the situation in the Yemeni arena. The prime  minister praised the Arab League's efforts to overcome the grave  developments as a result of the military outbreak of the  situation, which began with the attack on the 5th Brigade in  Harf Sufyan, the 3d Brigade in 'Imran, Ba Suhayb Brigade in  Dhamar, and later by launching the all-out war against our  Yemeni people by the bloody secessionist al al-Ahmar dynasty  with a view to undermining the covention document.</p>

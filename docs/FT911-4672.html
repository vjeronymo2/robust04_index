			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Far East production rises FORECASTS for sugar production in both China and Thailand this season have been revised upwards by Czarnikow, the London brokers, writes David Blackwell. It was feared that Thai production would fall well below the 3.5m tonnes of last season, but by the first week of this month that level had been surpassed. It now appears that final production could reach just under 4m tonnes in raw value, Czarnikow says in its latest Sugar Review. The Thai government has encouraged farmers to reduce paddy planting and they have opted for cane. China has been encouraging sugar planting with price incentives and by the end of February production was 1.5m tonnes above the previous year. If this gain is maintained, internal requirements, estimated at 7.2m tonnes raw value, 'could be almost entirely met with indigenous supplies', says Czarnikow.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Cost of healthy eating slammed THE price of healthy eating is often unnecessarily high, the Consumers' Association said yesterday. Shops often put higher prices on healthy foods - although the basic ingredients of good diet were often cheap, said the association's magazine Which? Way to Health. Lean mince might cost half as much again as standard mince, while olive oil was about four times as expensive as most vegetable oils, it said. The association also attacked manufacturers for not giving enough information about the amount of sugar in confectionery and soft drinks.</p>

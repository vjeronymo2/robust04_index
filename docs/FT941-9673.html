			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Call to open up European maze: Decision-making now too complex for ordinary citizens to understand Decision-making in the European Union has become so complex that it is impossible for the ordinary citizen to understand, according to the EU's senior lawyer in Brussels. Mr Jean-Claude Piris, head of the European Council's legal service, says the Maastricht treaty is partly to blame. New procedures and rules have turned the EU into a 'veritable labyrinth'. According to a paper circulating in Brussels, Mr Piris argues that reforms under way, though useful, do not go far enough. 'In order to be genuinely accepted and properly understood, the system ought to be profoundly reformed one day, so as to move toward more transparency.' Mr Piris was involved in drafting the Maastricht treaty. He also devised the formula which allowed the Danish government to argue it had won legally binding opt-outs, securing a decisive win in a second referendum last year. Mr Piris concedes reform of decision-making will be difficult because it implies a choice between those favouring deeper integration and those, such as the UK, prefering looser inter-governmental co-operation. The complex, opaque nature of decision-making in Brussels results from the need to compromise between these forces, not because of anonymous 'diplomats and technocrats' who took part in the Maastricht negotiations, he says. Mr Piris suggests several reforms: A 'single, shorter, more readable treaty' which would consolidate texts such as the Treaty of Rome, Single European Act, Maastricht and others governing EU operation. Clearer demarcation of areas of responsibility for Council, Commission and Parliament, as well as between the Union and member states. Modification of decision-making processes. Ministers involved in decision-making must at present follow at least 20 different procedures within Maastricht's framework. Streamlining the way the EU acts and is represented abroad. This could mean a seat for the EU at General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks in Geneva rather than separate national seats. In his paper, Mr Piris argues strongly that the EU has done more to improve efficiency, transparency, and democracy than first realised. He points to new powers gained by the European Parliament for scrutinising the European Commission; the creation of a European Ombudsman; publication of the Commission's legislative programme in the Official Journal in Brussels; and improved access to the public for official documents.</p>

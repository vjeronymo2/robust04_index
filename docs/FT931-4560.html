			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cautious optimism on diamond prospects DE BEERS, the company that dominates diamond sales, yesterday gave a cautiously upbeat view of the health of the industry, despite the weakness of the world economy. Speaking yesterday at the announcement of the company's annual results in Johannesburg, Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, the chairman, said: 'The Central Selling Organisation (the De Beers controlled group that sells 80 per cent of the world's rough diamonds) restricted its sales in the latter part of 1992 and the balance between rough supply and demand in the cutting centres has been restored.' Mr Ogilvie Thompson confirmed market talk that sales at the first two sights  -the rough diamond auctions that take place ten times a year - had been 'very good', but put this down to exceptional factors - the scarcity of diamonds from Angola, a hiatus in supply of Russian polished diamonds following imposition of a 20 per cent export duty and high demand from India. Directors of De Beers also stressed yesterday that diamond jewellery sales had held up very well in a recessionary climate. Mr Jeremy Pudney, a director of the CSO, said the volume of jewellery pieces sold, and the overall value of sales, had been very similar in 1992 to 1991. He said sales, by value, had grown by about 4 per cent in the US, 9 per cent in Germany and 6 per cent in France. Japanese sales fell by about 5 per cent in dollar terms, with sales in Italy and the UK also slightly down. Mr Gary Ralfe, a De Beers director, gave a positive account of relations between De Beers and the Russian industry. He confirmed that Russia was abiding by quota requirements, noting that its production had fallen by 25 per cent in 1992, with a further 15 per cent decline expected in 1993. Mr Ralfe predicted a 'deluge' of Russian polished diamonds on to the market if, as expected, the 20 per cent duty on diamond exports was lifted. He said their stockpile was estimated at up to Dollars 1bn. He stressed, however, that the Russians had not, in recent years, undermined prices in this market as they had done with other commodities. The sale of rough diamonds by Russia outside the CSO was a 'niggle' and not something that could affect the general balance of the market.</p>

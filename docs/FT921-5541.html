			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farmers recite litany of problems - Drought and politics fail to discourage South African managers / Farmer's Viewpoint LAST Thursday afternoon I went to a prayer meeting in a field. The congregation consisted of between two and three hundred black workers from the adjacent citrus farm and a dozen or so white South African managers. The Pastor was also white and spoke with a distinctive Glasgwegian accent. The service began with the singing of a hymn by a small choir of boiler suited black labourers, both men and women. The tune was familiar enough but the rhythm, the harmony and the clapping could only have been African. There followed impassioned prayers by the Pastor and others who felt so moved, for the rain which was so desperately needed for their crops. Indeed, there had been similar prayer meetings on the farm on the previous three Thursday afternoons but still those prayers had not been answered. The so-called rainy season had yielded only about one third of the 1000 or so millimeters expected in this part of the Transvaal and in the meantime daytime temperatures had soared to more than 40 degrees centigrade. The workers, some of whom were newly independent black farmers operating through a co-operative structure, were facing seriously reduced yields and quality of the fruit they had grown, largely for export to places like the UK, and the reservoirs used for irrigation water were almost empty. So they had paused in their work to seek Divine intervention. The previous day, I had been 150 miles further south at a cattle auction on a farm near the town of Ermelo. It was an annual sale of breeding stock of the Drakensberger breed developed from indigenous cattle to withstand drought and to thrive on the low quality grazing of the 5000 foot altitudes of the High Veldt. The animals have the black colouring and many of the characteristics of the Aberdeen Angus. On the way to the farm I had seen crops of maize decimated by the drought. Normally, at this time in the South African late summer, crops of maize should be seven feet tall and be carrying at least a couple of cobs apiece. This year, however, most were barely three feet high and the leaves were brown and scorched. Few plants had any cobs at all. It was no surprise, therefore, to find that few buyers had turned up at the auction. They had no feed either and the trade was bound to be depressed. In the event, prices for the quality animals, bred by one of South Africa's top breeders, were down about 30 per cent on those achieved at the same sale last year and the vendor was relieved to be rid of them. He too was desperately short of feed because of drought and the previous week another breeder had been forced to call off an auction at which there were no bids. Lack of rain is only one of the current preoccupations of South African farmers. Another is the March 17 referendum on continued reform towards majority rule: still another is the depressed state of the South African economy and last but certainly not least is the performance of their team in the World Cup cricket tournament in New Zealand. Paradoxically, all of these factors seem to have combined to create a generally optimistic mood in spite of the problems both present and potential. I have so far only travelled through the predominantly English speaking Natal, and the Transvaal but I have yet to meet or hear of a farmer, or anyone else for that matter, who does not support the De Klerk line on reform. Afrikaans speaking areas may well think differently, but I have not yet been to them. Reasons for supporting the President's policies are really quite simple, according to those I have met. They see it as inevitable. They readily concede that apartheid has not worked and that it has cut them off from the rest of the world. They blame the present depression in their economy on the withdrawal of investment from South Africa by the US and others and they see reform as the only way to attract it back and to reduce inflation and interest rates. Some farmers I have spoken to claim to be paying up to 28 per cent on borrowed money. They reckon they could survive the drought well enough without such a punitive overhead. The combination of the two problems at the same time, however, will, they fear, cause several of their neighbours and friends to go bust. For the record, I have not been able to find anyone who thinks it will happen to him; it is always the fellow down the road. There remains the question of what will happen to the abundant supply of cheap black labour come majority rule. Will black men and women still be prepared to work on farms for the equivalent of Pounds 25 per month plus the provision of main meals and very basic housing for their families? Indeed, will some future government of South Africa allow the present structures to continue? The farmers I have met are confident that they will still be in place as owners and employers for many years to come. They are convinced, they say, that a black government will recognise that it cannot do without their organisational expertise and will make it possible for them to continue much as before. Furthermore, they believe that they have treated their black workers so well in the past that they will be loyal in the future, whatever that brings. In the meantime, however, many of the farms I have visited feature multi-wire, six feet electric fences surrounding the farm house for protection against marauders. It is always explained that this is because of the mounting violence and theft by urban based blacks and that the rural workers are one big happy family whose children have grown up with their own. Clearly, however, they are hoping for the best while preparing for the worst. Meanwhile, back at the cattle auction, the auctioneer interrupted the bidding to announce that South Africa had just beaten Australia in the World Cup. For the rest of the sale, euphoria reigned and I would swear that prices improved slightly. In a sports mad country like South Africa, the mere fact of being allowed back into world competition could well be significant in influencing the way people vote on March 17.</p>

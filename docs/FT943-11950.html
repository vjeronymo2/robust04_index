			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Israel has no interest in seeking Lebanese soil Israel said yesterday it did not seek 'one square inch' of Lebanese territory or 'one cubic metre' of Lebanese water and would sign a peace treaty and withdraw Israeli forces from southern Lebanon as soon as the Beirut government demonstrated it controlled its sovereign soil. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said Israel would respect the accepted international border in any peace deal but complained Syrian troops and Iranian revolutionary guards were still in Lebanon and that an 'all out war' existed between Israeli and Israeli-backed Arab forces and the guerrillas of the Hizbollah or Party of God were being supplied by Iran through Syria. Mr Rabin accused Syria of failing to use its 'preventive capability' to rein in Hizbollah attacks. Once the Lebanese goverment proved it was in full control of its territory and could guarantee the security of its border Israel would agree to peace. 'I believe they are capable if somebody from the outside will not interfere,' he said.</p>

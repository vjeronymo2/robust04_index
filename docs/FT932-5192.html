			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Uzbek prices doubled as share trading halted THE Uzbekistan government has doubled wages and prices and issued a law halting trade in securities. The changes enacted on Tuesday are part of continuing efforts to stave off economic chaos but still leave Uzbekistan with lower basic prices than its neighbours, a point the government has stressed to prevent public opposition. There has been no noticeable public reaction to the rises despite a doubling of bread prices to Rbs16 and a more than twofold increase of petrol prices to Rbs100 a litre from Rbs40. Fees were also doubled for water, public transport and sewage services. The apparent public acceptance was probably attributable to the simultaneous doubling of state salaries. The moves by the nation of 21m people, the most populous in central Asia, are the latest in its efforts to retain social and political stability. Mr Islam Karimov, Uzbek president, has made it clear he is not retreating from his economic and political policies, despite complaints from western governments which have withheld loans and other assistance. This week the government continued its closed-door trial of Mr Shukrullo Mirsaidov, former mayor of the capital of Tashkent, and rival of Mr Karimov. Mr Mirsaidov faces charges of 'misusing state resources'. The trial, the latest in a series of cases against Mr Karimov's opponent, appeared to be a signal that the president is unwilling to tolerate even his conservative rivals. Meanwhile a confusing new securities law, published on May 25 in the local newspaper Pravda Vostoka appears to outlaw the trading of shares and bank deposit certificates. The law, a sub-clause in a new criminal code, banning 'speculation in securities' had halted business at a twice-monthly trading session.</p>

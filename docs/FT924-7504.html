			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (3): Inflation expected to fall further  -The economy AUSTRALIA'S Labor government is claiming victory over inflation, which fell to 0.8 per cent in the September quarter, the lowest in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Inflation is expected to fall further in the current quarter and is widely expected to remain below 2 per cent for much of 1993, in spite of the probable end of a two-year downward spiral in interest rates. In the longer term, cost-push inflationary pressures should be restrained by the government's agreement with the trade unions, which restricts wage increases to levels capable of holding inflation below the OECD average. However, the decline in inflation is not unadulterated good news. Largely, it reflects weak domestic demand caused by a slower-than-expected recovery from the 1990-91 recession. Technically, the economy emerged from recession in the September quarter of 1991. But growth has been weak and the government may have trouble hitting its 3 per cent growth target, outlined in the 1991-92 budget. Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer (finance minister) continues to insist that the government will achieve the target, but his confidence is not widely shared. Many business leaders have expressed scepticism about the pace of growth, including commentators such as Mr John Prescott, managing director of BHP, Australia's biggest company. Even Senator John Button, the government's third-ranking minister, admitted recently that he was 'not confident' the target could be reached, although he later withdrew his comments after a ticking-off from Mr Dawkins. The government has responded to slow growth with moderate pump priming which will increase the budget deficit to a forecast ADollars 13.4bn from ADollars 9.3bn in 1991-92, but unemployment is likely to remain above 10 per cent until at least mid-1993. In this environment of weak domestic demand, the best hope for growth lies in exports, which have been growing strongly, helped by a 13 per cent decline in the trade-weighted value of the Australian dollar over the past year. However, imports are growing even faster - up three times as much as exports in the September quarter, compared to the same quarter of the previous year. For the time being, the government remains on target to achieve its August budget forecast for a current account deficit of ADollars 15bn, equivalent to 3.75 per cent of GDP. However, the decline in the value of the currency, combined with a ADollars 1.5bn current account deficit in September - a 20-month high - has refocused market attention on Australia's external account. International worries about Australia's ADollars 150bn foreign debt have eased over the past two years as the debt burden appeared to be stabilising at about 35 per cent of GDP. But some economists say the falling Australian dollar could increase the debt load to more than 40 per cent of GDP, which might re-ignite international concern. If that happened, the Reserve Bank would probably have to display its determination to defend the currency - and continued low inflation - by raising rates, which is just what the sluggish economy needs least.</p>

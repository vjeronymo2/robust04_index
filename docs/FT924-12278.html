			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of Management Consultants (7): Management sees the benefits - Recession finds more and more companies farming out their 'non-core' activities ONE OF the effects of the recession has been to focus management attention more closely on corporate strategy. As a result many companies have decided to concentrate on their 'core competencies' and turn other activities over to external specialist contractors. The concept of facilities management (FM) or contracting out non-core activities, is not new. Services such as catering, cleaning, transport and security have long been managed externally. One recent estimate put the size of the existing UK market alone at Pounds 4bn a year, dominated by giant business services companies such as BET. But in the past few years many large companies and public sector organisations have begun to take a more radical approach, handing over or 'out-sourcing' higher level headquarters functions such as accounting, telecommunications and corporate computer networks to outside contractors to run and manage. Some draw a distinction between FM and out-sourcing, arguing that the old-fashioned FM function is at the commodity-end of the business with simple and well-defined tasks and the choice of contractor based solely on price. In contrast, they argue, out-sourcing has emerged during the past five years and involves contracts based less on price than on a range of more intangible benefits, with a strong relationship between the client and contractor. But whatever the definitions, use of FM and out-sourcing, particularly for IT functions, is growing rapidly. According to a recent survey of the FM market in the UK conducted by Computer Management Group (CMG), the privately-held consultancy, software and computer services group, a quarter of respondents were using third party FM services. Of the respondents who were using FM, 60 per cent were using hardware operations and application system maintenance services. Sometimes FM users also transfer assets and staff to the service company which then manages the operation for a fee and operates much like a business partner. US corporations pioneered the use of FM in the information technology (IT) field, using software and computer services companies such as Electronic Data Systems (EDS), now part of General Motors, and Computer Sciences Corporation (CSM). Mr Paul Hopkins, sales and marketing director for Sema Group's facilities management operations in the UK, reckons the British market is 'about four or five years behind the US', but says use of facilities management or out-sourcing in Europe is now growing rapidly, particularly in markets such as Germany, Spain and Italy. Frost &amp; Sullivan, the market research group, estimates that the total European FM market is worth about Dollars 3.6bn and will be worth more than Dollars 8bn by the mid-1990s. In spite of the growth on the continent, the UK is still by far the largest European market accounting for more than a third of the total. However, the UK is by no means a saturated market with penetration only a quarter of that in the US. There are several reasons for the rapid recent growth in the FM and out-sourcing market. Most of the leading suppliers of IT out-sourcing argue that its growth stems primarily from companies deciding how they want to run their businesses, what resources they need in house and where they can gain from complementing their business with skills and services brought in from outside. Thus the CMG survey confirms that, for most FM users, the motivating issue is the ability to concentrate on core business but, as Sema's Mr Hopkins notes, there are many other benefits claimed for FM. These include cost savings and better value for money because FM specialists can bring economies of scale to bear on IT operations while providing customers with greater control over budgets and performance. Other attractions are less tangible, such as the expertise that a specialist contractor can bring to an operation, and the ability to release management time for more important issues. FM can also be useful for organisations undertaking significant change, for example those reorganising their IT operations or moving from proprietary systems to open systems. Sema describes these 'bridging services' as one of four broad types of FM, the others being on-site management, where the FM company takes over the entire computer operation in situ and runs it, transferred facilities where the entire computer operation is transferred to the FM company's data centre, and first-time users who employ the FM company to set up a computer operations. Predictably, the rapid growth in demand for FM and out-sourcing services has led to a proliferation of suppliers, ranging from the software and computer service companies, such as EDS and CSC of the US, the Anglo-French Sema Group and Cap Gemini Sogeti (CGS) of France, to the consulting arms of the big accounting firms such as Andersen Consulting and specialist consultancies such as CMG. In addition, companies, such as the Capita group and ICL's 75 per cent-owned CFM subsidiary, have developed strong positions in the fast growing public sector market for FM while other companies such as Cadbury-Schweppes and Barclays Bank have set their internal IT operations up as semi-autonomous FM suppliers. Fierce competition and a rapidly changing marketplace have also encouraged hardware vendors such as IBM and DEC to enter the market for FM. Indeed Mr John Rogers, director of Dataquest's European Systems, Software and Service's group, predicted in a recent report on the European FM market that 'within five years, FM revenue will exceed mainframe revenue in the UK. The inclination to buy-in as opposed to do in-house will be unstoppable'. The Dataquest report suggested that the use of FM is probably the most important change taking place in the computer industry and that the main customers for mainframe machines in the future will be the FM suppliers themselves. The report also predicts that entry into the FM market by systems vendors will have a great effect on prices for FM in Europe. Indeed, as the UK market for FM matures there is already evidence of tighter margins for FM suppliers. In the UK, over 100 members in the Computer Services Association would claim to be FM suppliers. Some consolidation has already taken place, but Sema's Mr Hopkins believes this will accelerate in next four or five years and lead eventually to perhaps as few as seven or eight leading FM suppliers emerging. Other changes evident in the maturing UK market include the trend towards longer term and more variable contracts. Instead of fixed price contracts customers are insisting on contracts which vary according to IT demand. But perhaps most significantly Sema's Mr Hopkins says: 'People are also beginning to see out-sourcing as a partnership arrangement and FM suppliers are getting closer to their customers.' As a result he says more contracts are based upon 'open book policy' with agreed mark-ups and an element of risk sharing. Mr Ranald Bain of EDS-Scicon, EDS' UK subsidiary, also sees demand for FM and out-sourcing evolving rapidly in the UK. He says those in charge of business operations will concentrate on building alliances and partnerships, whether internal or external, which bring specific skills and solutions to support their plans. 'They will become less tolerant of generalists and more demanding of meaningful delivery commitments,' he says. 'This is already moving FM beyond IT-centred deals to relationships with third party suppliers to provide and support specific processes.' One example of the new style 'process management out-sourcing' contract comes from Andersen Consulting' Process Management unit, which earlier this year signed an initial five-year Dollars 89m contract with BP to run all the financial and accounting services - including the related IT function - for BP's North Sea oil joint venture operations. As part of the deal, 250 BP staff have been transferred to Andersen Consulting which has consolidated the operation from five BP sites to one in Aberdeen. Mr David Andrews, a partner with Andersen Consulting, says the market in Europe is 'exploding with opportunity' for process management as European companies seek to introduce rapid change. He argues that a new out-sourcing model is being developed in Europe - a vertical cut of business process rather than the horizontal cut of IT. FM and out-sourcing also have applications outside industry and commercial business. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration recently awarded EDS a five-year Dollars 508m computer operations contract - believed to be one of the largest US government out-sourcing agreements. In the UK, public sector organisations such as local authorities and government departments are also turning to FM. For example, Berkshire County Council has contracted out its printing to Kodak facilities management and cut costs by about 15 per cent. In the IT field many district and county councils have already contracted out their computer operations. But the biggest public sector FM contracts are likely to come from the introduction of 'market testing' in central government which could lead to the award of huge FM contracts. The Inland revenue is talking to most of the leading FM suppliers about a seven-year Pounds 300m contract to run its computer operations from September next year. Britain's government departments spend about Pounds 2bn a year on IT and employ between 20,000 to 22,000 IT staff, giving some indication of the possible scale of future central government out-sourcing contracts in the IT field alone.</p>

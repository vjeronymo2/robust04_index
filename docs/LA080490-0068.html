			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> TRAFFIC RESEARCH CENTER OPENS  </P> <P> A research facility where trainees will be taught to untangle traffic problems  has been opened at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> Growing counties, including Ventura County, will soon be beset with such  typical urban problems as traffic congestion, said Steve Hockaday, director of  the $500,000 traffic research program devised by the California Department of  Transportation, California Highway Patrol and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> The research facility simulates the Los Angeles Traffic Operations Center, a  control tower in which workers gather information from the roadways and then  direct police, tow trucks and emergency vehicles to clear up traffic jams.  </P> <P> "Caltrans and the CHP will be building a number of centers like the one in L.A.  throughout the state," Hockaday said. "This research facility will be used as a  training ground and as a way to test out new techniques."  </P> <P> A computer wall display will show a representation of roadway conditions,  traffic flow, simulated accidents, rush-hour traffic jams and other problems.  Trainees will phone in instructions, providing realistic practice in dealing  with traffic jams, Hockaday said. MAJA RADEVICH  </P></p>

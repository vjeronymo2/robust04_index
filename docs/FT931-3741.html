			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / German leaders struggle towards solidarity pact AS SPRING sunshine broke through the winter gloom of Bonn yesterday, the entire German political establishment was locked away behind the closed doors of the chancellor's office, searching for signs of daylight in the fine detail of their 'solidarity pact' for east Germany. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, with a string of top government ministers, the leaders of all the main parliamentary parties, the 16 prime ministers of the federal states, and their finance ministers and advisers, agreed to carry on negotiating in working groups all evening, and meet again today, in an attempt to forge the political consensus they have been seeking since last September. A formula has to be found to finance a spending gap of DM110bn (Pounds 46.6bn) in 1995 to pour more money in-to the collapsed eastern economy. The signs last night were that there was clear movement towards a political compromise, although the final figures - at least on the burden sharing - may take a little longer to agree. The opposition Social Democrats, led by Mr Bjorn Engholm, prime minister of Schleswig-Holstein, have won the first key battle to block any big cuts in social spending. Instead, they have agreed on a campaign to clamp down on unemployment and social security swindles, and to identify further savings of more than DM3bn in other parts of the budget. The other main move was a concession to the new states of east Germany for the government to shoulder a share of their DM51bn housing debt, thus freeing the way for faster privatisation of the dilapidated state-owned housing stock. What remains are the toughest nuts of all to crack: When and by how much to raise taxes through a new 'solidarity surcharge': Mr Kohl is adamant it must not come before 1995, and the SPD looking for a tax rise this July. How to split up the whole burden between the budgets of the federal government and the 16 Lander, and share the pain between the rich states and the poor.</p>

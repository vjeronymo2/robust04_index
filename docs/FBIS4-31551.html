			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandar Soljakovski: "With the Merits of </F> the Leadership"]    [Text] A party has started disintegrating! One may say  that this is nothing odd for a society in transition, for a  state in which changes have been moving so fast that, in spite  of peace and tranquility, changes, traumas, social  segmentations, political fervor, and disappointments are taking  place. They are yet to come!    The disintegration of the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian  Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Movement for Macedonian  National Unity] today, as an affair, is nothing new. It has  been the most evident political process going on for three  years. It has already broken down into several parties with the  same prefix. The leadership of this party was the only one that  did not become aware of this process, forecast long ago by  Macedonian political analysts! Actually, that is the main reason  for this disintegration. Perhaps it is traumatic for the common  affiliate, sympathizer, or member of this party. As far as the  leadership is concerned, as well as those who led it and created  it (and degraded it), there is simply no justification for lies  or ignorance. There were (we shall see that later in the text)  enough signs, indications, and warnings that advertised the  present situation. Ehether they could not or did not want to,  the VMRO-DPMNE leadership neither listened to the warnings, nor  wanted to see what was coming.  <H5>  "Spying" Affair </H5>   That is why the thesis putting the blame on the State  Security Service, which was said to be the main suspect for the  misfortune of the party that won the majority of seats in the  Assembly at the first multiparty elections in Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] simply cannot be  true. The plain and obvious reason for this is that if it were  correct, the logic would be -- if the VMRO-DPMNE had been a  party that articulated its political doctrine, united and solid,  there could have been no influences that could affect the  disintegration of the party, which had such great chances.  However, chances are one thing, political skill is another.    Yes, why is the VMRO-DPMNE actually falling apart?    The roots of this misfortune must be searched for in the  past. They are to be found right at the beginning of the  formation of this party, in the establishment of its  foundations, in the establishment of its political practice.    Since its formation, suspicions have been created that have  not been negated so far, nor have there been any attempts to  clear them up. Information on who created this party remains  obscure, as well as whose idea and intention it was. The  ideological founder, Dragan Bogdanovski, is still formally the  honorable president of the party, and he hinted that he would  discover the details, however nothing has happened so far.    In the euphoria of the election campaign, few people paid  attention to details, thus many inconsistencies, unproven claims  and promises, and unjustified attacks and insinuations came from  this party. Nevertheless, when that political embellishment  became regular practice, it was clear that this party was full  of contradictions that could only be removed with a wise, hard,  and realistic political work.    Instead, some recognizable (and predictable) events took  place in the party. Starting from the elimination of Vladimir  Golubovski just after the elections, in the style of communist  showdowns in the struggle for power, to the present purges --  the VMRO-DPMNE staff acted on the principles of "supreme" power  and feverishly sticking to the positions held by the leadership.    It is logical that such a party, not open to debate,  deprived  of the feeling for ideas and reality, will be left without a  clear perspective.  <H5>  Mistake After Mistake </H5>   At the root of the disintegration of the party that was  close  to power (and it alone is to be blamed for not achieving it),  there were uncounted elements, events, procedures, initiatives,  and excesses. All of them, together, have played their role in  today's outcome.    It is symptomatic that the VMRO-DPMNE did not succeed in  taking a decisive, consistent, and politically opportune stance  on numerous question in the area we refer to as "strategic." It  is still not clear why the VMRO-DPMNE opposed the referendum on  independence until the very end, offering instead the far less  important declaration on independence that had to be adopted by  the Assembly. The party's delegates were against the adoption of  the Macedonian Constitution until the last moment; they even  organized demonstrations in front of the Assembly building, with  the aim of blocking its adoption.    Everything continued in the same style. A range of laws that  this party had an interest in and proposed were not adopted, and  it contributed to this, because the manner of the parliamentary  group became that of an opposition, thus their stances and  dilemmas lost the crucial significance.    In the domain of the "hottest" question -- the dispute with  Greece -- the parliamentarians of the majority group in the  Assembly had a negative approach. Their proposals were limited  to support for a "more aggressive diplomacy" and their full  contribution was reduced to suspicions that somebody was  "selling off Macedonia," that somebody was doing something  devious. Regarding the importance of the admission of the  Republic of Macedonia to the United Nations, they constantly  repeated (without effect) that it was achieved in that awkward  name -- FYROM. We simply did not hear a single inventive  thought that could support their denial and opposition.    It is not known on the basis of what assessments they  expected the government and the parties that constitute it to  fall soon so that they may come to power, but it is even less  explicable that Georgievski left the position of vice president  of the presidency, thus losing the opportunity of learning  something and being, more or less, near the sources of  information that could provide him with more sense in decision  making when important issues are at stake. It is also unknown  why this party voted for the fall of [former Prime Minister]  Kljusev's government in which there were many persons affiliated  to the VMRO-DPMNE, after which they missed the opportunity of  forming a government in which they would represent the majority.    The present debacle is a result of the numerous staements  and  deliberations of the party in which it called for rebellion (on  2 August 1991), expressing semitruths and lies whenever it  suited somebody in the party, making statements that power could  be taken in Macedonia in a democratic way.  <H5>  Political Semi-People </H5>   The responsibility for the fall in the party's ratings falls  on the parliamentarians. Through the low level of their  discourse and the inarticulate deliberations and excesses, with  a lower-class vocabulary, the VMRO-DPMNE parliamentarians were  the leading personalities in debasing the reputation of the  parliament. The awareness that it is to do with political (and  moral) semi-people was overwhelming for many of those who  expected much from pluralism. Whether it was it by intent or  simply their nature, it will be noted that this party signed and  insisted on its verdict itself, in the presence of the public.    And finally, the suspicions about its affiliation to the  eastern neighbor were proven by the party itself after its  recent support for the Movement for Friendship between Bulgaria  and Macedonia. The same party that was strongly criticizing all  those who were allegedly affiliated to the northern neighbor is  now unreservedly acting under influences that are of a very  suspicious nature.    The VMRO-DPMNE is a sad story about the great wish for power  based on small possibilities, small efforts, and little reason.  Instead of using victory to define a political line that would  be compatible with the times and circumstances, the leadership  of the party involved itself in the schemes and inheritance of a  classical totalitarian and nationalist party (or movement) that,  at the moment it had nothing to support -- when the independence  of Macedonia and its self consciousness came so quickly and in a  relatively painless way -- did not find the strength to modify  its policy. The election victory, won as a lottery, was wasted  the way a poor person spends money that is easily earned.    That is why looking for the reasons for the disintegration  is  nothing but a bad excuse, a befogging and covering up of the  real guilt for the debacle. Fortunately, but it is also a great  disappointment, the members and sympathizers of this party know  perfectly well where the problem lies. We believe they  discovered it a long time ago.</p>

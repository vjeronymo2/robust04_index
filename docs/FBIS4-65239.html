			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Samuel Brittan article: "Single Currency Rises Again"] </F>   [Text] Most UK proponents of a European Union [EU]  referendum are studiously vague on what should be asked and  when. The merger of sterling into a common European currency  would, on the other hand, be the type of constitutional change  justifying a referendum, not now, but at the time it was  proposed. UK ministers are, moreover, deceiving themselves if  they believe that the issue has conveniently gone away, as it  seemed it might have done a few months ago.    At the beginning of August 1993, the old 2.25 percent  exchange rate mechanism [ERM] grid succumbed to a speculative  attack. An emergency meeting of finance ministers widened the  grid to 15 percent on either side of the central parities. This  was so broad as to constitute virtually freely floating rates.  The Euro-sceptics could hardly restrain their joy. The  derailment of the ERM would, they hoped, put paid to the more  ambitious European Monetary Union [EMU] project.    But then a strange thing happened. The French Government did  not take advantage of its freedom from ERM constraints to slash  interest rates, but continued to follow the Bundesbank lead.  And the franc, instead of diving like sterling and the lira  after they left the ERM, recovered. It re-entered the old grid  at the beginning of last December and has not strayed far from  it since. The fundamentals of a better-than-German inflation  performance reasserted themselves over the instant cynicism of  the currency markets.    A similar story with minor variations applies to the other  `core' members of the ERM, including the Belgian-Luxembourg  franc and the Danish krone. The Netherlands guilder has  remained within even narrower limits. And the Austrian  schilling -- technically outside the ERM -- has remained close  to the D-Mark.    There is room for argument about whether the French and  other  governments were right to stick so long within the narrow ERM  bands without a realignment in view of the long period of high  German interest rates. But having kept to the policy during the  most difficult period, it would be an unnecessary sacrifice of  counter-inflationary credibility -- as well as of wider  political aims -- to abandon the D-Mark related policy now, just  when German interest rates are approaching levels with which  neighbours can live.    It is worth noting that, although the UK was able to cut  interest rates early as a result of leaving the ERM, British  short-term rates are now no lower than French or German ones;  and long-term rates are 1-1.5 percentage points higher -- the  market's verdict on the credibility of a go-it-alone policy  without an independently accountable central bank.    Where do we go from here? An EU summit has to decide not  later than December 31, 1996 whether a majority of member states  fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single  currency.    The summit can fix a date for EMU [economic and monetary  union] at any time during 1997 and 1998. If, however, a date  has not been set by the end of 1997, "the third stage (ie EMU)  shall start on January 1 1999." Another summit, voting by  qualified majority, will decide which members fulfil the  necessary conditions. There is no minimum number. Conditions  which EMU participants must satisfy are:     -  A rate of  inflation "close to that of the three best performing  states";    -  Convergence of long-term interest rates;    -  A "sustainable  government financial position";    -  The observance of "the normal  fluctuation margins" of the ERM "for at least two years without  devaluing against the currency of any other member state."    The two EU countries with the lowest inflation rate are  France and Ireland with a rate of less than 2 percent a year.  The UK, Belgium and Luxembourg tie for third position with 2.3  percent, followed by Germany with 3.2 percent and the  Netherlands with 3.9 percent. The convergence of long-term bond  yields has gone even further for the core countries, where they  stand at about 6.5-7 percent.    The fiscal guidelines appear the most troublesome. A  Maastricht protocol mentions a budget deficit limit of 3 percent  of gross domestic product and a debt ratio not exceeding 60  percent. Only Luxembourg and Ireland fulfilled the deficit  criteria last year. The Bundesbank is particularly keen on these  criteria, and would be unlikely to recommend giving up the  D-Mark if they were too obviously flouted. Nevertheless the  Maastricht Treaty itself provides (Article 104c) escape  provisions if the excess deficit is "exceptional and temporary"  or if the excess is declining.    The central condition remains the final one about exchange  rate behaviour. The Treaty says nothing about the narrow 2.25  percent band. Thus, theoretically, members could declare the  present 15 percent margins to be the normal ones. But it is  inconceivable they will move to EMU if market exchange rates are  fluctuating throughout the wide band.    The French and the other governments are not disposed to  tempt fate by re-entering a narrow official ERM grid in the  foreseeable future. What they are doing is to commit an even  greater crime in Euro-sceptic eyes -- namely shadowing the  D-Mark. This means that in the face of a determined currency  attack there will be no firm floor for the speculators to aim  at, and there could be temporary dips, such as that in the last  few months of 1993. But monetary policy will be conducted with  the aim of keeping currencies near to the D-Mark.    If the inner group currencies remain de facto close to their  central rates, the governments concerned may move directly to  monetary union, bypassing the narrow ERM stage. This route has  been envisaged for these countries by, among others, Eddie  George, Bank of England governor.    The crucial step provided for in the Maastricht treaty is  for the participating governments to declare their parities  "irrevocably fixed." After that and a good deal of preparation  -- existing currencies would be replaced by the ECU.    Such developments would not be entertained until the  European  Union is clearly out of recession and German unification no  longer distorts policy. Some governments might then want to  move quickly while conditions remain right, and before too many  other countries had joined Italy in acquiring Euro-sceptics in  important government posts.    To those who are neither federalists nor nationalists the  relevant questions are clear enough. A single currency means a  single monetary policy tailored to the average needs of the EU  as a whole, just as Federal Reserve policy is designed for  average U.S. conditions rather than the particular needs of  California or New England. Would the advantages in reduced  uncertainty and transaction costs outweigh the disadvantages of  not being able to follow a monetary policy adapted (within  limits) to the needs of particular parts of Europe? And what  would be the gain for countries of doubtful counter-inflationary  credibility -- as the UK still is -- from substituting a  European currency under a European Central Bank [ECB] modelled  on the Bundesbank for its own? It would also be necessary to  cast a weather eye on the likelihood of the new ECB being just  as vigilant to avoid contractionary movements of nominal demand  as of rising inflation.    And finally, if EMU is going to go ahead in any case, what  would be the downside risk to the UK of staying outside? Not  necessarily the same as it would be for Switzerland or small  Southeast Asian economies without a currency anchor. These are  the questions which need to replace the futile UK debate on the  Conservative leadership.</p>

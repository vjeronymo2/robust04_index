			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Travel: Intimacy and grandeur - London feels like civilisation itself, a maze of divergent and overlapping threads / The FT guide to Civilised Breaks THERE ARE many Londons. When I was a boy in the country, I craved London's theatre, shops and famous sights. When I lived in New York, I missed strolling in London's parks and residential streets. When members of my farming family come to town for the day, I take them to an exhibition or gallery, a little shopping, lunch, and then a matinee. You choose your own London. Some visitors know that London is still the theatre world's capital, and they pack in as many shows as they can. Other visitors come to London solely for its classical music. And though London may not be the painting capital of the world, it keeps a gallery-goer busy. If you choose a cross-section of Londons, you take in not just the Londons you were looking for, but also the larger London that threads them together. London feels much more amorphous than Paris or New York. It can take much longer to get around; it has been assembled, merged, reconstructed over the centuries; it is diffuse. And that is its pleasure. London does not feel like the product of one particular phase of civilisation - it feels like civilisation itself, a maze of divergent and overlapping threads, with noise and calm in alternation. Here is my recipe for a weekend: Start late Friday afternoon, end late Sunday afternoon. First, a few rules: 1) Fit in a minimum of two plays (or operas, ballets, musicals) - one light, one serious, or one modern and one classic. Right now the West End has a number of first-rate offerings: Peter Hall's staging of Wilde's An Ideal Husband (Globe); Pinter's haunting No Man's Land (Comedy); Robert Lindsay in Cyrano de Bergerac (Haymarket); Giles Havergal's brilliant staging of Graham Greene's Travels With My Aunt (Wyndham's) and The Rise and Fall of Little Voice (Aldwych). If I do not recommend the National's Carousel or the RSC's Hamlet, it is only because they are sold out. But any weekender in London should already have checked what's on, not only at the National and RSC but also at Covent Garden and at the English National Opera. Several of ENO's productions are among London's finest. But be warned: the Coliseum's acoustics are only reliable in the balcony or the stalls; not all voices carry well into the two middle circles. 2) Fit in at least two galleries during the weekend. There is no point in spending more than two hours at a time in one; your head gets congested. But London's galleries are seldom crowded, and their range is great. 3) Walk (weather and health permitting) as much as possible. London is not one of those cities, such as Paris, that can be taken in almost entirely on foot, but it rewards as much pedestrianism as possible. And walk through at least one London park. 4) Do not spend too much time on big meals. You can eat well in London but it is easier to find poor restaurants in London than in most big cities. Food is not the reason to be here - unlike, say, Brussels, where meals should be prolonged. Friday evening: Drink and/or light pre-performance snack at Cafe Pelican (St Martin's Lane), deliberately French, beautifully coloured and very convenient for most theatres. After the performance, a meal in the West End. The traditional theatre-goers' haunt is the noisy Joe Allen's, where actors and dancers also dine, but you need to book in advance, and things are not much fun unless your table is well placed. (Lunch is quieter and easier). More reliable are Chez Gerard (branches in Dover St, Charlotte St, Chancery Lane), Bertorelli's (Floral St, Covent Garden), Cafe Fish (Panton St, Haymarket) or Plummers (King Street, Covent Garden). You can have three courses plus wine at most of these for well under Pounds 25, and a lighter meal much more cheaply. Saturday: If you can afford it, and can obtain a window view, try breakfast at the Savoy, or anywhere with a view over the Thames. Gallery-goers should then walk one block east to Somerset House - worth a look in itself - to see the Courtauld Institute. True, the paintings are not well-lit, but the collection, impressionist and post-impressionist, is first-rate. Now for an obvious but uncrowded tourist path along the riverbank, for the views. Cross Waterloo Bridge, walk along the South Bank to Westminster Bridge and cross back to inspect the Houses of Parliament. Those with a taste for monuments should make a slight detour to visit Westminster Abbey, and/or Rodin's Burghers of Calais statue nearby. Next, take a taxi or bus to the Tate Gallery (open 10am-5.50pm; Sunday 2pm-5.50pm), and head straight for the Turners in the Clore Gallery. There are too many of these for the space, and at first they can look like too much of the same thing. But try a few and you will find that you see light, and London, differently. Both the cafe (good) and restaurant (excellent) are recommended for lunch. After lunch, zoom as fast or slowly as you feel inclined through the Tate's modern art. You are bound to hate some of it, but its presence here reminds you that London is not just a city that happened in other centuries. And the Tate's pre-20th galleries give you, among other things, a sense of the historic continuity of England: Hogarth, Gainsborough, Blake, Constable. As you leave, there is the surprise of finding that the Thames looks different from when you entered. If you need to shop, head straight to Knightsbridge, Chelsea or Kensington. (Only masochists hit Oxford Street on a Saturday.) If energy and weather permit, you could carry on walking, through the squares and streets of Pimlico to Chelsea, possibly via Belgravia. Apart from the incidental fun of the different shops and pubs you pass, there is the larger pleasure of sensing London's rapid switches of scale, between village intimacy and grandeur, between ambassadorial formality and Bohemian ease. Then jump into a taxi, or on to a 19 or 22 bus, and return to the West End in time for the most controversial part of the day - tea. Whose tea is best? My friend Clare prefers the Ritz or the Dorchester; I plump for Brown's. We cannot agree. But upstairs at Fortnum's is cheaper (men do not have to wear ties), and simpler altogether is the cafe at the Royal Academy. After tea there is time to rest, and prepare for the theatre. For dinner after the show, see Friday - or splash out on somewhere more remarkable from The Good Food Guide. Since you have worked up an appetite by now, try Bibendum (Fulham Rd). The Michelin windows, the spaciousness of the restaurant floor and the calm good service are all particular pleasures. Then there is the food, rich and exquisite. A full meal with wine may well cost about Pounds 60 per head. Sunday: If the day is fair, you can venture on to the river. The river bus stops at regular intervals, and you can take it up to Hampton Court or down to Greenwich. Or, if you take Sunday as the Lord's day, try morning service at St Bride's, Fleet Street, with its memorable intimacy and choir. If the day is greyer, you can spend it walking. London is not quite the ghost-town it used to be on Sundays and crowd-lovers should hurry to the Trocadero in Piccadilly, or to the Covent Garden or Camden Town markets. But Sunday is still much London's quietest day, and the morning is a good time to take in the bare bones of the city. From Parliament Square walk north-north-east to St James's Park. (A slightly longer, terribly obvious but fairly irresistible tourist route is via Whitehall). When in view of Buckingham Place, head north-east, over the Mall, and thread through the streets of St James's, a district which gives you a taste of London's overlapping centuries. Now head east up Pall Mall and thus to Trafalgar Square. Whether the National Gallery's Sainsbury Wing is a stylish or anodyne piece of architecture is a question you can ponder over lunch later. But seldom will you find a space in which paintings are presented, spaced and lit to better advantage than in the Renaissance wing upstairs. One small room has one painting per wall; three of them are by Pero della Francesca. Traditional English cuisine is rare anywhere, but for Sunday lunch and a change of scene, try Kensington. Maggie Jones's (6 Old Court Place, off Kensington Church Street) does a trad three-course Sunday lunch. Afterwards, and after taking in a bit of Church Street, walk around and across Hyde Park. Possible highlights here include Kensington Gardens, the swings near Marlborough Gate, the Serpentine and Speakers' Corner. Then walk in a north-easterly direction to Manchester Square and the Wallace Collection. (Open 2pm-5pm; other days from 10am). If you have a taste for 18th or 19th century paintings (and much more), you know about this anyway. If you have not, the gallery itself, with its furniture and staircases and rooms, gives you a scent of bygone aristocratic eras. Life simply is not the same after you have seen a Sevres frying-pan. If there is serious rain you can spend more time in the galleries. In the afternoon, you can further investigate the best-tea debate (see Saturday). Or, for another change of scene and a taste of sheer whimsy, there is, from 3.30pm-6pm (Sunday or Saturday), the dansant at the Waldorf. Some of the older couples come in ill-advised 1920s outfits, and - yes - some of them should never tango. Sooner or later, however, if only for a shuffling foxtrot, you will find yourself on the dance-floor too. After that, you are no longer a spectator of London, but a participant.</p>

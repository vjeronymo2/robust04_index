"We can only regret about the breaking up of ties on the  economic space of the former Soviet Union," he said.    Snegur believes that Moldova is unable to reject the Eastern  market.    "We have had a try of following the agreements at  Belovezhskaya Pushcha. As a result our economic indices have  dropped very low," said Snegur.    He sees the way out of the situation in implemeting the  agreement on the formation of an economic union within the  framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States, which was  signed by Moldova.    Snegur has denied speculation saying that Moldova intends to  sign, within the CIS, agreements other than economic.    "We take part in integration on the issues that do not  infringe our independence," he said.    Speaking about the relationships with Romania, he said: "We  have one language, we are brothers and continue integrating  economically and culturally, but we are building our independent  states."</p>

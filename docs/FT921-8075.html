			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Limited scope seen for Whitehall agencies EVIDENCE of the limited scope for government agencies to improve their business performance is disclosed today in the National Audit Office's first report on an executive agency. The report by the government expenditure watchdog examines the Vehicle Inspectorate, which tests heavy-goods vehicles and public-service vehicles, supervises the annual MoT tests for cars and enforces some driver and vehicle legislation. The inspectorate was the first executive agency set up under the Next Steps initiative launched in 1988 to create arm's-length agencies to deliver government services. The NAO says the inspectorate has become significantly more efficient since it became an executive agency in 1988. Between 1989 and 1991, efficiency savings reached 8.8 per cent of costs compared with the government's target of 3.7 per cent. But scope for further improvements is limited by government policy, the NAO says. The Vehicle Inspectorate is not free to close under-used testing stations, some of which operate for only a few days a week. Moreover, Treasury rules limit the discretion of agencies to compete with the private sector for additional work. These limitations are 'a useful illustration of the differences between an executive agency and a market-led business', the report concludes. 'If the inspectorate were acting as a market-led business, they would now be looking more radically at the resources they have and the services they provide,' it says. 'For example, a business would be considering whether to rationalise under-utilised assets or whether to seek new business that would use assets more fully.' The NAO finds that the inspectorate has become more responsive to the needs of its customers since becoming an agency. According to a Mori opinion poll conducted for the NAO last year, 40 per cent of customers considered that the quality of service had improved since 1988 while 91 per cent considered that the overall service was very or fairly good. Customer service initiatives launched by the Vehicle Inspectorate since it became an agency are evidence of a determination to improve services, the NAO says. But success of the initiatives - which include Saturday testing and the sale of technical publications - has been mixed because no detailed market research or cost-benefit analysis was carried out. The NAO says there are still some practical improvements which can be made to the inspectorate's running. These include putting measures of quality in targets and greater devolution of management responsibilities to district offices. The Vehicle Inspectorate, HMSO. Pounds 7.10.</p>

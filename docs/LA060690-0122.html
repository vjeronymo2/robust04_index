			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> NIGHTCLUB'S PERMIT REVOKED BY COUNCIL  </P> <P> Acting on complaints from citizens and the police, the City Council voted  unanimously to revoke the conditional-use permit under which the controversial  Mr. Barry's nightclub has operated since 1977.  </P> <P> The council voted 5 to 0 Monday night to uphold an April 19 decision by the  Planning Commission, which voted unanimously to revoke the permit.  </P> <P> Commissioners said the business, operated by the Self family, was a nuisance to  the neighborhood because it generated crime, litter, noise and traffic problems  and violated terms of the original permit. The Self family appealed that  decision to the council.  </P> <P> Originally approved as a dinner house with a cocktail lounge, the club at 12675  Westminster Ave. has evolved into more of a disco, and late night complaints  from neighbors and police calls to the area have soared, city officials said.  </P> <P> Todd McWhirter, representing the Selfs, said Mr. Barry's is in the middle of a  self-imposed cleanup campaign that includes adding a self-closing rear door to  reduce noise and a crackdown on rowdiness in the bar and its parking lot.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to insult this council by saying that there's no crime in the  area of Mr. Barry's, but crimes of a violent nature have been drastically  reduced," McWhirter said.  </P> <P> He also suggested that the presence of a police substation nearby was a  contributing factor in the high number of police calls to the bar.  </P> <P> But Doug Holland, an attorney representing the city, said, "The Selfs are not  victims. They have failed to effectively manage their business."  </P> <P> The Self family may now apply for a new conditional-use permit to operate a  dinner house or take the matter to Orange County Superior Court, said Gary  Baum, assistant city attorney.

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government faces gloomy arithmetic THE parliamentary arithmetic still looks against the government for tonight's vote. In theory the Conservatives should be able to rely on 332 MPs, giving them a majority of 18 over all the opposition parties. Since Sir James Kilfedder, the Ulster Popular Unionist MP has said that he will vote with the government tonight, the paper majority rises to 20. On this basis it would take only 11 Tory rebels to vote with the opposition to defeat the government. Or the majority could be overturned if a smaller number of rebels voted with the opposition and other Euro-sceptics abstained. Almost all the opposition parties have a clear interest in voting against the government. Labour itself makes up 269 of the total. The 21 Liberal Democrats are set to line up with Labour, along with the four Plaid Cymru MPs, the four SDLP MPs, the three Scottish Nationalists and the three Democratic Unionists. The unknown factor is the Ulster unionists, with nine MPs, the fourth largest party in the Commons. While it is unlikely that they would vote with the government even if a deal were reached, they might all abstain. If so, the government's paper majority would rise to 29. This would mean that for ministers to be defeated 15 Tories would have to vote against their party. Again, if some sceptics abstained, a government defeat would be achieved with fewer rebels voting with the opposition. State of the parties: Conservative                              332 Labour                                    269 Liberal Democrats                          21 Ulster unionists                            9 Plaid Cymru                                 4 SDLP                                        4 SNP                                         3 Democratic unionists                        3 Popular unionist                            1 TOTAL                                     646 (Excludes the Speaker and her three deputies, and takes account of vacant seat)</p>

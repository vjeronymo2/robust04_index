			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mainz -- Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  Chairman Rudolf Scharping has warned employers in Germany not to  try and push through wage cuts, which would endanger the  economic trend. "However nice the 10-percent wage cut suggested  by the metal employers would be for companies costwise, the  effects on demand would be catastrophic," the  Rhineland-Palatinate minister president said in an interview  with the German Press Agency (DPA) on Tuesday [8 February]  evening. Such wage cuts "would kill off the economic cycle."    Cost cuts will have to be discussed, he said. "This is a  political task, especially with ancillary wage costs." In the  metalworkers' conflict a solution must be found at the  negotiating table, Scharping pointed out. "I do not think that  a strike would really help us now." But the appeal must first  be directed at employers, "because the trade unions have stated  very clearly that they are prepared to cut back a great deal in  wage demands, if jobs are secured," he said.    He said he was also moved by the terrible pictures from  Sarajevo, "but the latest figures by the Federal Employment  Office, with 4 million unemployed, stir me as well." This  "record high in unemployment in Germany's history is a worrying  signal," he stressed. Internal peace in Germany is also  endangered by the existing social contrasts.    What is also required now, Scharping said, is "the example  from the elites." This could very well mean higher burdens on  those earning higher incomes. In Bonn, an SPD government would  also set examples by cutting down on the number of ministries  and "especially the number of parliamentary state secretaries,  whose jobs have become mere maintenance posts."    It is high time that the social problems in Germany, where  as  many as 10 million people live close to the subsistence level,  are moved to the center of political debate. "We talk far too  much about foreign policy, missions in war zones, or people's  weariness of politics. People no longer concentrate on the  essentials. With politicians permanently talking about old  files and other marginal affairs, one must not be surprised that  people are weary of politics."    In foreign policy there is no big difference of opinion  between Helmut Kohl's government and the SPD, Scharping said.  The only exception is the issue of Bundeswehr peacekeeping  missions abroad. "There is no way the SPD will agree to such  missions."    The SPD chairman was also skeptical about a military  intervention in former Yugoslavia. "I do not think much of  military intervention, this would only make the bloodshed worse.  I consider a real enforcement of the economic blockade against  Serbia to be the instrument that could still help today,"  Scharping said.    Regarding military interventions, the SPD feels more close  to  the United States' policy, "which is more cautious today than  many a German Conservative." He said, "wanting to send troops to  all parts of the world and wage war is dangerous talk."    The latest developments in former Yugoslavia do not change  the government's and laender's intention to send Croat refugees  back to their country, he said. "But this must go hand in hand  with a reintegration program. Repatriation was intended from  the beginning, why should it not take place?" the SPD Chairman  said.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: S Africa opens doors to foreign explorers South Africa yesterday threw open its offshore acreage for international oil and gas exploration. In a move aimed at bringing the country back into the mainstream of the world energy markets, Pretoria solicited bids for licences to explore virtually all the country's coastal areas, divided into 18 blocks. Mr Pik Botha, the former foreign minister, who is now minister of mines and energy, told a launch seminar attended by oil and gas companies in London that his government 'sees this licensing round as a major step forward in exploring our offshore potential. 'We cannot guarantee that you will discover gas or oil or both,' he said. 'But we are setting in motion an intensive - and extensive - process of exploration never undertaken before'. Bids for licences have to be submitted by April next year, and Mr Botha said he hoped to have the allocation process complete by November 1995. Exploration programmes will have to be for a minimum of three years and a maximum of seven. International oil companies were active in South Africa until the early 1970s when most of them withdrew for political reasons. Since then, there has only been a small amount of exploration, mainly by Soekor, the state oil company. South Africa produces a third of its liquid hydrocarbons artificially from coal, and imports certain amounts of oil, mainly from Iran. Mr Botha said yesterday that the tariff protection given to the local oil and gas industry would continue because of its important contribution in saving foreign exchange. But he said South Africa was keen to widen its trade relations with energy-producing nations, and deals were pending with various OPEC countries which he declined to name. So far, 19 companies - 17 of them from abroad - had asked for information packs about the blocks on offer. Mr Botha said he was 'very encouraged' by the attendance at yesterday's seminar, which included many of the world's major oil companies. Asked whether South Africa was more secure than other new energy markets that are opening up, such as Central Asia, Mr Botha said: 'As secure, if not better' because of the well-developed state of South Africa's mining technology and infrastructure. 'I can assure you,' he added, 'that the rules are not only reasonable but will also be stable.'</p>

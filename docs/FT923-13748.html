			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Belfast is 'a clean, crisp Hibernian Rio' (official): The Northern Ireland Tourist Board believes battle-scarred West Belfast could attract visitors. Tim Burt looks at the changes which make the notion plausible TONIGHT is bonfire night in Belfast. Piles of old timber and rubbish are ready to burn and hundreds of Protestant children, some younger than 10 years old, are looking forward to the big event: the annual celebration of the Battle of the Boyne. Each year, the fires send a pall of smoke across hardline suburbs, reminding Roman Catholic communities of their rout in 1690 at the hands of William of Orange. Army helicopters sometimes help spread the smoke as they hover over the crowds, shining spotlights through the haze. And yet the Northern Ireland Tourist Board sees hardline areas as a potential attraction. It suggests visitors seeking a glimpse of the trouble spots should be encouraged. The board's corporate plan says: 'The opportunity to harness this curiosity factor should not be overlooked as a positive factor in encouraging people to visit and understand Northern Ireland.' The invitation from the tourist board contrasts with the advice I was given seven years ago by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The policeman who questioned me thumped his bullet proof vest and said: 'The Provos are trying to kill me. What protection can I give you - a Brit - on my doorstep? I can't do anything if they lift you . . . my advice is get out of West Belfast.' I was about to be charged under the Prevention of Terrorism Act for gathering information which might be useful to a terrorist. Taking pictures of security bases is forbidden in Northern Ireland and I was an easy catch, spotted outside the Woodburn army base by high-powered surveillance cameras mounted on a pylon over the streets. Tension was high then. More than 27 policeman had been killed that year and the security forces were edgy. Tension is expected to rise again tonight with the bonfires. The security forces will be on the look out for 'clodding' - stone-throwing battles which often lead to serious violence. In the worst parts of West Belfast stones give way to Molotov cocktails or condom bombs, home-made explosives filled with chemicals and acid. You can tell condom bombs by the terrible smell. Gelignite has the sweet aroma of marzipan. Shopkeepers will spend the night in cars outside their premises. They claim the police will not answer calls about burglaries and looting for fear of being set up for a terrorist attack. Officers say they can keep an eye on many premises from the security of police stations using the type of surveillance cameras which caught me. The RUC hope any trouble will die out by daybreak. Tomorrow is the actual anniversary of the battle between William of Orange and James II, but the traditional Orange Day marches have been postponed until Monday out of the respect for the sabbath. The interlude should give Belfast time to clean up before the Protestant celebration begins afresh with a two-day public holiday. The uniforms and tunes of the marchers have not changed in years, nor have the routes they try to take through sectarian areas. But the landscape of West Belfast is undergoing a slow and painful facelift. Fewer shops and offices are protected by wire grilles; two new shopping centres have been built on the site of the old Eastwoods scrapyard; and whole areas of derelict housing have been razed to make way for new homes. Divis, the notorious republican ghetto which marks the gateway to West Belfast, is being demolished as part of a Pounds 9m investment scheme. The high-rise blocks have been one of the main targets of the state Housing Executive which has built almost 1,000 new homes a year since 1982. The redevelopment scheme, part of a Pounds 200m urban rehabilitation programme, stretches from the Royal Victoria Hospital - the site of the former Belfast and District Lunatic Asylum - to the River Lagan on the fringe of the city. It has helped to reclaim waste ground and provided the impetus for Europe's largest community-led environmental project: Colin Glen, a spectacular park which cuts a green swathe through the western suburbs. These changes have helped make West Belfast into an area that is, in the eyes of the tourist board, fit for visitors. Unionist politicians have reacted angrily to the board's proposals, claiming tourist officials are trying to package the troubles for outsiders. A claim which the officials reject. They are not the only ones who take a kindlier view of tourists. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, offers tourists a guide to the protest murals and army bases. And privately, police officers say visitors are unlikely to be detained for taking pictures of security installations. Many of the improvements, however, are only cosmetic. Smart railings have replaced the concrete blocks that used to line grassy areas of the city to deter joyriders. But joyriding is as prevalent as ever. The local economy has been drained by years of neglect during which the government directed investment to areas of political preferment. That has left unemployment averaging 36.7 per cent, rising to more than 60 per cent in pockets of the Catholic Falls Road and Protestant Shankhill Road. With little prospect of work, many low income families live on estates suffering from vandalism and apathy. Most Belfast children never encounter violence or see a bomb thrown, but those who face the dole are not so lucky. They are ripe for racketeering and paramilitary recruitment. The tourist board ignores all this and describes Belfast as 'crisp, clean and inviting . . . a Hibernian Rio'. If the city centre compares to that Brazilian metropolis, then West Belfast is its favela: spirited but poor. There is, however, a group of entrepreneurs backed by the Industrial Development Board, which sees investment as the panacea for the problems. The West Belfast Business Opportunity group claims an enterprise culture is flourishing, with new companies taking advantage of cheap premises and labour. The economic optimism has been fuelled by this week's face-to-face talks between Ulster leaders and the British and Irish governments. Local community leaders say there is a ripple of hope rather than a wave. Too many residents have had expectations raised before only to see them dashed by industrial closures, recession and violence. The Phoenix Trust, a development group, says there is still 'severe multiple deprivation'. Eamon Hanna, chief executive of the trust, says: 'This would be a problem town even if a shot had never been fired . . . it's an uphill battle.' Hanna and other business leaders say winning the economic battle depends on overcoming the area's poor image. That image could take a further knock this weekend if the bonfires become a prelude to violence and the clodding persuades outsiders to follow the advice I received - get out of West Belfast.</p>

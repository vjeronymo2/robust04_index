			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Ray of sunshine after winter gloom: Experts detect the green shoots of German economic recovery starting to sprout Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his irrepressibly optimistic economics minister, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, insist that Germany's economic springtime has come, after a particularly vicious period of winter frost. After the sharpest downturn in gross domestic product since the war - a drop of 1.9 per cent last year - the economy is picking up again, they say. They would of course, wouldn't they? They have to face a testing series of elections this year, culminating in a general election in October, and they need all the good news they can get. Unfortunately, the one economic fact of life which no one expects to improve in the short term is unemployment, with the grim figure of almost 4m unemployed expected to linger all year. But yesterday the politicians won the weighty support of five of the country's independent economic research institutes, for their assertion that there will be a slow but steady recovery of 1.5 per cent in all-German gross domestic product this year - about 1 per cent in the west, and a good 7.5 per cent in the devastated east. Only the staunch neo-Keynesians at Berlin's German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) remain pessimistic in the annual spring review of the institutes. The DIW is convinced that the effect of the recession on domestic consumption - a drop in total real income of no less than 3 per cent - will outweigh any expected recovery in export demand. It argues that far from picking up steadily from this spring, the economy looks set for a summer 'double-dip' recession, with no recovery before the second half of the year. Overall, that means zero growth in west Germany, and 0.5 per cent for the economy as a whole. So who has got it right? A clear majority of government and industry, backed by the analysts of the financial markets, is convinced that the worst is past, except on the unemployment front. On the other side, the trade unions, the opposition Social Democrats, and the DIW, fear that the desire to see green shoots of recovery has overwhelmed perceptions of the reality, that domestic demand remains stubbornly stagnating, and the economy urgently needs an extra stimulus, such as investment subsidies, to pull it out of the trough. The other big question mark lies over the revival of the east German economy, now showing signs of recovery from its collapse of 1990 and 1991, when industrial production slumped by two-thirds. The upturn clearly depends above all on the maintenance of huge public and private transfers from west Germany to the east, running at about DM200bn (Pounds 80bn) a year. There is still no sign of consumer spending supporting a self-sustaining recovery, which depends on maintaining the level of investment. The question is whether the initial surge in private sector investment, maintained last year in spite of the western recession, can be kept going at the same rate. None of the participants are showing signs of over-optimism - in the east or the west. The Federation of German Industry (BDI) and the German Banking Federation warned yesterday against excessive hopes about the prospects for the coming year. The small business federation (ZDH) said it still had no firm evidence from its members that the recession was over. And the German wholesale and export traders (BGA) warned against exaggerated expectations from foreign trade. A growth rate of 1.5 per cent was at the 'upper limit' of likely recovery, the BGA said. Even the five optimistic institutes see only a feeble ray of sunshine in their forecast. 'The improvement in the economic situation clearly does not mean that the scene is set for a strong recovery of the west German economy, and for a high level of employment,' they said. Their arguments in favour of recovery are based on three main planks: export performance; significant improvements in business sector profitability thanks to drastic rationalisation measures, with modest pay rises and flexibility in wage contracts and working hours; and continuing relaxation of monetary policy by the German Bundesbank. As far as exports are concerned, the main hopes lie in the strengthening economic growth both in the US and the south-east Asian markets. Recovery in western Europe, by far the most important market for German products, is clearly lagging behind - interdependent as it is on Germany's own performance. Optimistic forecasts depend on no further strengthening of the D-Mark against other European currencies and, if possible, a slight weakening against the dollar. The strengthening of the dollar and the yen against the D-Mark over the past year has helped to improve German export competitiveness. That competitiveness also depends on the success of the rationalisation programmes introduced across most of German industry in cutting the very high costs of domestic production. Business confidence has grown, as have profit expectations. After a year of drastic losses reported from many of the blue-chip names of German industry, most are forecasting a return to the black in 1994. IBM Deutschland yesterday reported a loss of DM582m for 1993, but predicted profits again this year, and even such a long-term sufferer as Krupp-Hoesch, the steel group, believes it has done enough to break even next time round. The chemical industry - traditionally first into a recession, and first out of it - seems to be indicating the turn. Hoechst yesterday reported a 10 per cent increase in turnover in the first quarter, and a 16 per cent profits rise to DM506m. As for the last of the three recovery planks, the continuing relaxation of monetary policy by the Bundesbank may be the one most in question. The institutes yesterday agreed that the central bank could afford to - and should - cut another two percentage points from its short-term rates. This in turn would ensure that the continuing attractions of short-term financial deposits would be outweighed by the recovering profitability of long-term industrial investment, and fuel the recovery, they said. Financial analysts in Frankfurt are more doubtful. They believe that the downward trend of interest rates is likely to end by the summer, with the signs of economic recovery multiplying - and the Bundesbank still far outside its own monetary corridor for the M3 broad measure of money supply. On just such an assumption, the bond market remains extremely weak. The stock market, on the other hand, is less influenced by interest rate expectations these days, and more by the expectation of better profits from industry. For the time being, there is a lot of liquidity because of the retreat from the bond market, and the most likely destination seems into shares. What market observers do not seem to share is the outright pessimism of the DIW. They point out that even if real wages are cut this year, they only constitute about 50 per cent of disposable incomes. The latter include revenues from property, dividends, and transfers from government, all of which are more buoyant. Moreover, German consumers have shown a clear tendency in the past year to reduce their savings to maintain their living standards. The cuts in working hours could also have another perverse effect: a boost to the black economy, where increasing numbers of Germans work for cash to boost their shrinking official incomes. 'These don't appear in the statistics, but they show up in consumption,' said Mr Joachim Fels, international economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt. 'That is another reason why we are not so pessimistic.' Whether all that cautious optimism is enough to save Chancellor Kohl's political future in the coming series of local, state and federal elections is another matter. But it shows why he has perked up appreciably on the campaign trail, and started to talk of springtime.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- GERMAN ECONOMY: SIGNS OF A PICK-UP  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The institutes' forecast  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Western Germany  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1992            1993        1994* GDP**                            1.6            -1.9         1.0 Unemployment (000's)           1,808           2,270       2,600 Unemployment rate (per cent)     5.8             7.3         8.4 Inflation rate (per cent)        4.0             3.4         3.0 Public sector deficit (DM bn) Current account (DM bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Eastern Germany  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1992            1993        1994* GDP**                            9.7             7.1         7.5 Unemployment (000's)           1,170           1,149       3,820 Unemployment rate (per cent)    14.8            15.1        16.0 Inflation rate (per cent) 10.1             7.9         4.0 Public sector deficit (DM bn) Current account (DM bn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Unified Germany  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1992            1993        1994* GDP**                            2.1            -1.2         1.5 Unemployment (000's)           2,978           3,419       3,820 Unemployment rate (per cent)     7.7             8.9         9.9 Inflation rate (per cent)        4.7             4.0         3.0 Public sector deficit (DM bn)  -78.5          -101.8        -100 Current account (DM bn)        -39.4           -36.2       -28.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Institutes' estimate  **GDP in 1991 prices, per cent change over previous year  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Federal Statistics Office, Estimates of the Economic Institutes, spring 1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

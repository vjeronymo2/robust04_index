			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>   [Excerpts] A grim-faced John Major endured one of the  darkest hours of his premiership today, facing a furious Commons  after the Cabinet's acceptance of a compromise in the row over  Britain's voting powers in an enlarged European Union [EU].    His worst moment came when Tory maverick back-bencher Tony  Marlow sent a shudder through the Chamber with a stark public  demand that he should quit Downing Street and make way for  someone who would provide leadership. [passage omitted]    The Commons storm -- one of the most savage for months --  was the climax of a dramatic day during which the Cabinet faced  an ultimatum to respond by six o'clock tonight to a compromise  plan drawn up by the Greeks who hold the EU presidency.    And in Brussels tonight, European Commission President  Jacques Delors poured cold water on Mr Major's claims of new  concessions by the EU as a "sweetener" in the battle over voting  rights. He said he had simply clarified, at Britain's request,  the Commission's interpretation of Euro-social policy.    And Irish Commissioner Padraig Flynn insisted that no  concessions of any kind had been approved to soften the blow to  Britain of conceding more voting rights to Brussels.    Now Tory Euro-critics are on the warpath again, egged on by  Mr Marlow, as the Government -- after talking tough only a week  ago -- appears to be bending the knee to the Brussels  bureaucracy machine. [passage omitted]    Mr Major's already insecure position, almost certainly the  biggest threat to his leadership since he swept to power, was  made worse by denials in Brussels that Britain had been given  guarantees overnight that no social legislation would be sneaked  in "by the back door."    Mr Delors, asked if anything had changed as a result of  talks  with the British Government, replied: "No, no. I simply  clarified the programme of the Commission for the present year  and also the interpretation of the social protocol, that is all."    Mr Flynn said: "There was no such concession or change in  policy." He went on: "Nothing of that nature could take place  without my agreement and my agreement was neither sought nor  given."    Commission officials were pointing out tonight that even if  concessions had been given they would apply only to 1994 -- and  the voting changes which would be affected by any concessions do  not come in until 1995.    Mr Delors made it clear that he, presiding over a Commission  which stands down at the end of this year, could not make any  special arrangements with Britain which would bind a future  Commission.    But Downing Street officials later repudiated the denial of  any guarantees, producing documents to say that these  undertakings had in fact been given.    The Prime Minister, who looked distinctly uncomfortable  during the Commons exchanges, bluntly told Mr Smith: "What you  appear to have overlooked is that we have achieved a series of  concessions that would not have been available if we had adopted  your position of accepting, without let or hindrance, 27 for all  areas immediately.    ``We have not achieved the maintenance of the blocking  majority of 23. I would have ideally preferred that. But  neither have the other member states achieved what they would  have wished -- for we have obtained concessions particularly  that protect our most vulnerable flank on social affairs.''    Michael Heseltine, who is fast becoming the favourite to  succeed Mr Major, airily brushed aside any thoughts of a  challenge from him in the autumn. "We've been over that ground  and I'm bored to distraction by it," he told Channel 4 News.    He claimed there was widespread support for Mr Major,  saying:  "I saw it demonstrated extremely eloquently in Plymouth where  there were hundreds of Conservatives gathered for a very  successful conference on Saturday. I have not the slightest  doubt that that is testimony to what the party and the country  thinks, and I have not the slightest doubt that the party and  the House of Commons is determined to back the Prime Minister  and the Foreign Secetary on what has been a difficult, hard  fought negotiation."    The President of the Board of Trade denied the Government  had  given in over its battle with the EU.    He said: "It is a detailed negotiation in which Douglas Hurd  has won a commendable negotiating success in British interests,  and the only party that fought that battle was the Conservative  Party."    But many Tories feel that John Major has himself created a  personal crisis by building up expectations of a bitter battle  with Brussels over voting rights -- and then not fulfilling them.    And in Westminster tonight, some furious Tory backbenchers  believe the Prime Minister has bound a future British government  to a European Union with ever-increasing legal authority over a  sovereign power.</p>

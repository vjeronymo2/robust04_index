			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN 27 Jun Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] On 26 June, a government source disclosed that the  OECD plans to convene a meeting of a joint committee on  information-related matters in Paris on 28-29 June to begin work  on drawing up an international high-speed communications network  project. The OECD plans to look into establishing a social  infrastructure that befits an era of a highly advanced  information-oriented society, basing its plans primarily on the  following points: 1) to coordinate policies, including the  promotion of deregulation programs; 2) to revise existing  systems regarding such matters as intellectual property rights;  and 3) to promote the establishment of industry standards and  development of databases. The OECD plans to compile a report on  this project at a ministerial meeting in June 1995. The project  has drawn much attention as an effort to help realize the  "Global Information Highway Initiative (GII)," an expanded  version of the "National Information Super Highway Initiative,"  which has been announced by the administration of U.S President  Bill Clinton.    The OECD's joint committee consists of three separate  committees: one deals with industrial affairs; another with  information and computer communications policies; and the third  with scientific and technological policies. The fact that the  OECD has decided to convene a joint committee meeting indicates  that the issue of how high-speed communications networks ought  to work has become a priority issue among major industrialized  nations.    So far, the United States has promoted its "NII," which was  proposed by U.S. Vice President Al Gore. European nations have  proposed the "Trans-European Network (TEN)" project. As for  Japan, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has  announced that the nation plans to participate in the "GII,"  which has been proposed by the United States. At the same time,  Japan has also proposed the "Asia Information Highway Initiative  (AII)." However, there never has been an opportunity for  countries to hold comprehensive debates on policies related to  an international high-speed communications network project.    At the joint committee meeting, committee members will hold  discussions on how to promote international cooperation  regarding deregulation in certain areas that will be  indispensable toward expanding communications networks. Such  efforts will be directed toward facilitating access to data  communications businesses and determining how networks ought to  be mutually connected, among other goals. Committee members  will also hold discussions on how copyrights ought to be  protected in connection with users' editing and processing  visual and audio data which they have acquired through  multimedia networks and on other problems related to existing  systems which govern such matters.    Moreover, committee members will exchange opinions as to  what  measures ought be taken to make specific improvements on  international high-speed communications networks which primarily  deal with scientific and technological information and to  promote the establishment of standards among networks regarding  such matters as data processing.    In conjunction with such moves, Japan plans to set up soon  an  "Advanced Data Communications Promotion Headquarters" (tentative  name) within the cabinet, which will hopefully compile a  Japanese version of the "Information Super Highway" project  right away. It then plans to participate actively in debates  with other OECD member nations on the global communications  network project.</p>

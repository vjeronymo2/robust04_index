			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sufi Yusoff] </F>   [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Sat -- Malaysia denied the move by  Russia to sell 18 MiG-29 fighter jets was part of that country's  surplus defence equipment, adding the decision to buy was after  a thorough aircraft evaluation, and tough negotiations on  securing the best contract.    Defence Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Abdul Razak also denied  that Russia was going to supply the air superiority fighter  planes from its air force war surplus.    "What we will get will be new aircraft, and there is no  question of dumping arms here to revive the so-called ailing  Russian defence industry," he told the NEW SUNDAY TIMES here.    "We made a thorough evaluation of the aircraft before  finally  deciding on the purchase for the Royal Malaysian Air Force  [RMAF]," he said.    The negotiations for the US$550 million (RM1,419 million)  [RM  -- ringgit Malaysia] deal to be paid in cash and barter  involving palm oil began two years ago. Seventy five per cent  of the payment would be in cash and the rest in palm oil.    He was commenting on a AFP report last Thursday, quoting  Russian political commentator Rustam Narzikulov as saying in the  authoritive newspaper, SEVODNYA, that the June 7 contract  amounted to dumping of Russian military technology on the world  market. [passage omitted]    Najib said Narzikulov's statement was unfair criticism  especially he was not aware of the tough evaluation of the  aircraft by the RMAF and the protracted negotiations.    Under the contract, the RMAF had extracted a guarantee on  the  supply of spare parts, engine reliability and performance,  integration of Soviet avionics with Western equipment, and the  installation of the most advanced weapons systems.    Asked if Malaysia would have problems getting spare parts if  the defence industries were to close down, he said: "I cannot  comment on Russia's ailing defence industry, but under the deal,  the Russian Government has made a commitment to supply us with  the necessary spare parts."    He further said the success of the deal was as important to  Malaysia as it was to Russia, and this alone would ensure they  would not fumble on their contract commitments.    "This is because they see Malaysia as a stepping stone for  them to break into the lucrative regional arms market," he said.    He added spare parts for the MiG-29s were easily available  in  other former Warsaw pact countries which are operating the  aircraft, and India which has 60 such jets.    He said the contract, which stipulated the setting up of a  US$220 million (RM572 million) Technical Service Center [TSC] on  a joint venture basis between the government, the aircraft  manufacturer, and the Russian defence export agency, was also  another strategy to ensure adequate supplies of spare parts.    He said if it was economically viable, the TSC, to be set up  after the arrival of the first MiG-29 next April would jointly  manufacture certain aircraft components.    Najib also clarified the value of the deal was closer to  US$550 million, and not US$600 (RM1.56 billion) as some  newspapers had reported.    On the report which said Moscow chopped off US$65 million  (RM169 million) from the initial price tag to clinch the deal,  he said, a certain amount of "discounts" had been obtained in  the process of negotiations.    However, he declined to say how much. [passage omitted]</p>

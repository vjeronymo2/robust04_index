			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / How To Spend It: Hello palefaces, found a summer wigwam? - Lucia van der Post has been looking at ways of sheltering herself and her cucumber sandwiches from the ravages of the weather NOW THAT pale skins are the only fashionable sort to have, what every self-respecting garden, even British ones, needs is a refuge from the weather - if not the wind and the rain, then from the sun. No doubt inspired by the depleting ozone layer and insatiable demands for all things horticultural, a whole host of companies is offering all manner of structures in which to shelter from the elements this year. Some can be used as tranquil retreats in which to read and survey the landscape. Others are welcoming shelters from sudden showers and chill breezes. Others still can be shady bowers bedecked and embellished with climbing flowers. They come in all shapes and sizes and with a variety of names. Of all garden structures gazebos have the least practical purpose. They are there simply to be beautiful. They take their name (so The Secret Garden Company informs me) from a 'waggish pretence of Latin learning', purporting as they do to be places from which to gaze. A gazebo, it seems, should be open and octagonal, hexagonal or square. It requires a fine position and often can be heavily overgrown or intertwined with climbing flowers, with clematis and roses, with honeysuckle and ivy. Pavilions, on the other hand, are designed to give shelter from sun, wind or rain and are normally to be found beside swimming pools or tennis courts. From there you can take tea and sponge cake while watching a drama unfold on the croquet lawn or applauding a few sets of lawn tennis. Summer houses are where you sit peacefully and quietly, reading, taking in the view, enjoying those leisured afternoons where the sun always shines, there are cucumber sandwiches for tea, croquet on the lawn and punting on the river. If you have a garden which could do with a bit more structural interest, or maybe needs a little embellishing or even furnishing, then here are a just a few of the latest ideas around . . . Barnsley House, as many readers will know, does several ranges of clean and classic garden furniture. It has now started to sell a new line of Italian sun umbrellas, complete with wooden poles and frames and cream cotton tops, pictured above. Each umbrella also has double pulleys with nylon wheels and wind cowls. Not cheap, at Pounds 265 each, they are beautifully made and, to my mind at any rate, look so much more at home in an English garden than their more gaudily-coloured relations. They come in two shapes and sizes - round (3 metres in diameter) and rectangular (2 m by 3 m) and both cost the same. There is a lighter-weight version, with a single-wheel pulley and with no wind vents, that looks nearly as elegant and is considerably cheaper at Pounds 145 for the 2.5 m size. All can be bought by mail order from Barnsley House, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire GL7 5EE (Tel: 0285-740-561) and there is a splendid full-colour brochure of all their wares on offer. The Barnsley House showroom is open from Monday to Saturday from 9 am to 5.30 pm. Past Times is a mail order company which, it will not surprise you, is heavily into nostalgia. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Some of its wares are charming and when it comes to gardens it has much to offer. It has, this summer, produced a mini-catalogue devoted to the outdoor, horticultural life. The highly ornate gazebo pictured above is light, airy and romantic and made (so the catalogue tells me) in the 17th century tradition, all intricate and curly hand-made steel. Weatherproofed with a fashionable verdigris finish it is 8 ft high and 6 ft in diameter and sells for Pounds 995. You will have to assemble it yourself - unless you have a really handy handy-man. Much less expensive, at Pounds 249.50, is the portable Edwardian pavilion. Some 6 ft by 3 ft by 6 ft high, it has a weatherproofed acrylic cover supported by a folding hardwood frame. Look out, too, for wooden garden chests (for keeping wellingtons and garden tools), for fine wooden croquet sets, steamer chairs and Versailles tubs. The catalogue offers just one garden bench but it is a beauty - the Hatfield bench, reproduced from a classic design of about 1895 by JP White, who worked with Gertrude Jekyll and Lutyens. Measuring 6 ft by 1 ft 6 in by 3 ft 2 ins, it is made of solid unvarnished weatherproof teak, has a charming, delicate curving design incorporated into the back and costs Pounds 395. Past Times has some 21 shops throughout the UK but these particular items are available by mail order only, tel: 0993-779444. Orders may take up to 28 days for delivery, so hurry, hurry if you want to catch the summer. When Robin and Mary Ellis wanted a summer house beside their swimming pool they remembered the lovely Kentish oast house they lived in years ago and used its distinctive, pleasing lines as the basis of their own design. It was such a success, and so many friends wanted one, that they set up in business providing miniature oast houses. A team of first class builders will put one up in two weeks once planning permission, site surveys and other boring necessities have been gone through. They are built on proper foundations and are more of a real house than a summer house. Shiplap cedarwood is used for the octagonal walls and clay tiles for the conical roof. Douglas fir hand-turned pillars are on the veranda. The doors are either of mahogany or Douglas fir and come with brass or wrought-iron furniture. The result, pictured below, could be used for a host of purposes - study, playroom, artist's studio, gym, home office. They come in two sizes - 12 ft or 17 ft in diameter, for Pounds 15,000 or Pounds 18,000 (plus VAT). Write to Robin and Mary Ellis, Rumwood, Horseheath, Cambridge CB1 6QX (tel: 0223-892596) for details. The Secret Garden company of Ware offers at least six different structures to embellish a garden. There are gazebos and summer houses, pavilions or octagonal houses, all made from sturdy timbers such as Western Red Cedar and Ghanaian iroko, with leaded light windows and solid brass furniture for windows and doors. Six roof shapes and 17 panels are the basis of all the designs - whether a lightly romantic gazebo or a solidly protective summerhouse. Some, such as the gazebos, would look best carefully sited for views and vistas; others, such as the pavilions, could be placed beside a swimming pool or tennis court. The company delivers and installs the buildings but asks customers to provide the concrete base. Prices range from Pounds 2,500 to Pounds 8,000 - a hexagonal gazebo with open sides and Iroko railings would cost Pounds 2,971 (including delivery, installation and VAT) whilst the rectangular pavilion pictured above costs Pounds 5,436. For a leaflet illustrating the main designs write to The Secret Garden Company of Ware, Maplewood, Ware, Hertfordshire, SG12 OXN. Tel: 0920-462081. FOR THOSE who like their garden appurtenances old, battered and well-weathered Capital Garden Products has developed a new material, a bronze powder mixed with resins, which gives all the standard garden items - the urns, the jardinieres, the window-boxes and the planters - an air of great antiquity. 'For years,' says Jerry Carr, its managing director, 'we have seen some modest attempts at producing false verdigris bronze finishes and now after months of experimenting we have come up with this splendid material, which combines resins with a considerable amount of bronze. No one should be embarrassed at thinking our casts are made of solid bronze and finding that they are not.' The range includes things as small as a 10 in diameter Devil's Punchbowl (copied from a Jacobean antique) which sells for Pounds 36 and as splendid as the Rams Head Urn (24 in diameter by 24 in high) photographed below, which sells for Pounds 247.50. Write to Capital Garden Products, Hurst Green, Etchingham, E. Sussex TN19 7QU (Tel: 0580-201092) sending four first class stamps for a brochure or to buy by mail. Otherwise they can be bought from The Chelsea Gardener, 125 Sydney Street, London SW3 or from Clifton Nurseries, Clifton Villas, off Warwick Avenue, London W9. Chairs are essential to the outdoor or conservatory life. Classic deck-chairs, steamer chairs and safari versions all have one important quality - they stack, which means they can be easily stowed when summer is over or when the space is required for some other purpose. The Indian Ocean Trading Company has brought out a range of exceptionally sturdy folding garden furniture. All made from teak, the safari chair (Pounds 110) is photographed here left, but it also sells the other classics of the genre, the steamer chair (with cushions, Pounds 420) and the deck-chair (Pounds 80). The fabric is a heavy-duty marine dralon, scotch-guarded and flame-proof, and comes in dark green, burgundy or cream. Indian Ocean Trading Company has a showroom at 28 Ravenswood Road, London SW12 9PJ but it will take orders by telephone (081-675-4808). Barnsley House also has some wonderfully solid teak garden furniture - everything from armchairs to benches and this exceptionally elegant outdoor dining chair. Called the Tetbury, it is beautiful from almost every angle. The full length back makes it elegant from the back as well as from the front. As with all Charles Verey's designs much thought has gone into the measurements to make sure they are the right height for the tables they sell. As he puts it in the introduction to his catalogue: 'If you have fought with dining chairs just too wide to fit as pairs around a table, or benches that won't fit under tables, then you will appreciate the care we take to produce combinations which suit small and large spaces.' The Tetbury costs Pounds 205. The brochure has many other options. Write to Barnsley House, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire GL7 5EE.</p>

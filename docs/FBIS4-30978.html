			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tomaz Bukovec: "New Aircraft for Our Armed </F> Forces"]    [Excerpt] Brnik, 20 May -- A LET-410 UVP Turbolet aircraft  bought by the Slovene Defense Ministry from the Czech Republic  last year has been delivered. The Air Force brigade has thus  received its fourth aircraft in a little over a month. On 27  April the unit received three ZLIN 242 sport planes.    The purchase of these aircraft was agreed upon approved by  the former defense minister. The LET-410 plane arrived in Brnik  at 1200 on Wednesday. In addition to helicopters, the Air Force  brigade is equipped with seven aircraft: three antiquated UTVA  75's, three ZLIN 242's, and the new LET-410. We could not find  out the price of the new two-engine, high-wing, light  transport-passenger plane. However, we have learned unofficially  that the aircraft manufacturer, Narodni Podnik of Kunovice,  demanded about $800,000. We doubt very much that the final price  amounted to much more than $500,000. The Czech manufacturer used  to build these aircraft mostly for the Soviet Union and  therefore had a surplus stock as a result of the Soviet Union's  collapse. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Sharp squeeze forecast on profits COMPANIES face a sharp profits squeeze because of the faltering economy, according to the Ernst &amp; Young Item forecasting group. Item says in projections published today that companies will find little chance to expand margins over the next two years because of weak demand in the UK and other developed nations. Item says gross trading profits for non-oil companies will increase this year by 7 per cent against last year, a much smaller figure than profits increases seen in the early 1980s as Britain recovered from the previous recession. The group, which bases its calculations on the Treasury's computer model of the economy, says growth in average annual profits over the next five years will be about 5 per cent. 'The consensus forecast (among other economists) is for almost double this rate of growth, which suggests that the current level of the equity market is overvalued,' it says. Item envisages a 0.6 per cent decline in UK output this year after a 2.4 per cent fall last year. It says corporate profits as a share of gross domestic product this year will be about 13 per cent, increasing to just over 14 per cent next year, before falling back to just under 13 per cent by 1997. As the UK recovered from the previous recession, profits climbed from about 12.5 per cent of GDP in 1980 to peak at about 18.5 per cent in 1985. Item also expects the large debts run up by many consumers in recent years to constrain any sharp rises in consumer spending, leading to only a weak recovery. Uncertainty about the economy and stockmarket sentiment depressed the level of management buy-out activity in the second quarter of the year, with just Pounds 600m worth of deals completed, according to accountants KPMG Peat Marwick.

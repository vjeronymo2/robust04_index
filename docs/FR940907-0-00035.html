			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State has added the requirement that any person who is responsible for the operation of a vessel that meets 1 of the criteria for exemption shall maintain records of the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The capacity of the stationary vessel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The contents of the stationary vessel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The type of the stationary vessel.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> and may also include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) The type of primary seal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The true vapor pressure of the petroleum liquid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Rule 624&blank;(Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From an Existing Graphic Arts Line)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State has rewritten much of the Graphic Arts Rule. The new rule sets forth the emission limits, recordkeeping requirements, compliance demonstration requirements and exemptions for the affected sources. These rules, for the most part, are written to have a statewide effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> K. Rule 625&blank;(Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Existing Equipment Utilized in Manufacturing Synthesized Pharmaceutical Products)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State has added a provision which describes the method for comparing actual emission levels from alternative control technology to allowable emission levels. The method for determining the actual emission level is found in R 336.2004 and the allowable emission level shall be determined using methods found in Appendix B of ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions From Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Products,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;78&hyph;029.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State has added language stating that a person shall not be required to reduce the temperature of a gas stream flowing through a condenser below the freezing point of a condensible component in the gas stream if it can be shown using intrinsic chemical data that the condenser would be rendered ineffective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State has added a provision which describes the method for comparing actual emission levels from alternative control technology to allowable emission levels resulting from the use of a pressure/vacuum conservation vent. The method for determining the actual emission level is found in R 336.2004 and the allowable emission level shall be determined using methods found in Appendix B of ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions From Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Products,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;78&hyph;029.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State has removed the provision requiring interim reduction milestones since the dates of these milestones had all passed several years before this package was submitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State has added daily recordkeeping requirements which must be complied with within 3 months of the State's effective date of this rule. The records required shall include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) For reactors, distillation operations, crystallizers, centrifuges, and vacuum dryers which are controlled by a condenser or an alternative control technology:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) A list of all VOCs in the stream.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The vapor pressure, as measured at 20 degrees Celsius, of each VOC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The mole fraction of each VOC in the liquid mixture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The gas outlet temperature of each condenser.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For operations that are in compliance with the exemption provisions listed in this rule, the amount of material entering and exiting each reactor, distillation operation, crystallizer, centrifuge, and vacuum dryer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) For air dryers, the amount of material entering and exiting each air dryer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A person loading a VOC which has a vapor pressure of more than 210 millimeters of mercury, measured at 20 degrees Celsius, from a truck or railcar into an existing stationary vessel of more than a 2,000 gallon capacity using a vapor balance system or alternate control system shall maintain records of the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The date and time each vessel is loaded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The type and vapor pressure, as measured at 20 degrees Celsius, of each VOC loaded into each stationary vessel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) For centrifuges, rotary vacuum filters, or other filters that have an exposed liquid surface, where the liquid contains a VOC or VOCs and the sum of the partial pressures is 26.2 millimeters of mercury or more, as measured at 20 degrees Celsius, the following records shall be maintained:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) A list of all VOCs in the liquid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The vapor pressure, as measured at 20 degrees Celsius, of each VOC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The mole fraction of each VOC in the liquid mixture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) For any equipment from which a liquid containing a VOC or VOCs can be observed dripping or running the following records shall be kept:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The date and time each leak was detected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The date and time each leak was repaired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> L. Rule 627&blank;(Delivery Vessels; Vapor Collection Systems)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State lists the provisions which must be met by all delivery vessels subject to control by a vapor collection system required by R&blank;336.1606, R&blank;336.1607, R&blank;336.1608, R&blank;336.1609, R&blank;336.1703, R&blank;336.1704, R&blank;336.1705, or R&blank;336.1706. The modifications made by the State to this rule are: (1) Listing gauge pressures in inches of water as well as in pounds per square inch, and (2) moving the definition of ``vapor collection system'' from this rule to&blank; R 336.1122 (Definitions; V).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> M. Rule 630&blank;(Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Existing Paint Manufacturing Processes)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

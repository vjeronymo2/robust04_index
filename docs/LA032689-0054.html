			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN IMMORALITY CRUSADE;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON INSIDE-OUT  </P> <P> "They say that power corrupts," a political consultant observed, "but the lack  of power corrupts too."  </P> <P> The Democrats have been the majority party in the House of Representatives for  35 years. Holding power for so long has made them arrogant and corrupt, the  theory goes. Look at Speaker of the House Jim Wright (D-Tex.). He is the  subject of a nine-month investigation by the House ethics committee, the  results of which are due to be released early next month.  </P> <P> On the other side of the aisle, House Republicans have become frustrated and  demoralized after 35 years in the minority. The GOP leadership is ideologically  corrupt, many younger Republicans feel. They criticize Minority Leader Robert  H. Michel (R-Ill.) for being too accommodating. He makes deals with Democrats  and takes whatever crumbs they are willing to offer. Last week, House  Republicans repudiated Michel's approach by rejecting his candidate for  minority whip, the second-ranking GOP leadership position. Instead, they chose  Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), whose style is anything but accommodating.  </P> <P> People have raised questions about death and taxes, but you can always count on  a Democratic majority in the House. According to one favorite Washington story,  the Almighty becomes upset about the terrible state of affairs in the world. So  He decides to do something about it.  </P> <P> The Lord appears before British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and asks,  "What can I do to make the world better?" She replies, "You can figure out a  solution to the troubles in Northern Ireland." God considers her request and  says, "That is a difficult problem. It will take some time to resolve. But I  can promise you a solution by the year 2025." On hearing that, Thatcher weeps.  </P> <P> Then the Lord appears before Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and asks,  "What can I do to make the world better?" Shamir answers, "You can find a  solution to the Palestinian problem." God ponders this and says, "I can do  that. But it will take a long time. I can promise you a solution by 2040." And  Shamir weeps.  </P> <P> Finally the Lord appears before President Bush and asks, "What can I do to make  the world better?" Bush thinks about the question and replies, "The United  States is the world's last great hope of freedom, but we cannot govern  ourselves as long as we have a Republican President and a Democratic Congress.  Maybe you can figure out some way for the GOP to gain control of the House."  </P> <P> And the Lord weeps.  </P> <P> Republicans have not given up the faith, however. The Lord works in mysterious  ways, and right now, He has cast a pall of gloom over the Democrats. "We're all  very depressed," said one House Democrat. "It's like a morgue."  </P> <P> The immediate cause of Democratic depression is the Wright matter. The issue is  so sensitive that the ethics committee decided not to release its report --  rumored to be more than 450 pages -- until after the Easter recess. Democrats  did not want to go home to their districts and face a firestorm of criticism  over Wright.  </P> <P> If the committee finds that Wright violated House rules, even if it recommends  no more than a reprimand -- the mildest punishment -- Wright is probably  finished as Speaker. What if the report merely criticizes him for using poor  judgment but finds that he did not break the rules? He's still in big trouble.  As one congressman put it, "You can't have a 450-page report written about you  and expect to be exonerated."  </P> <P> Talk to Democrats in Congress and you will hear a constant refrain: "I'm not  walking the plank for Jim Wright." This is partly -- but only partly -- due to  the lack of esteem in which Wright is held by his colleagues. Many criticize  his leadership. They resent the way Wright handled the congressional pay raise  issue earlier this year. Instead of protecting members, he caved in to public  pressure and allowed a vote. Many members plan to return the favor by forcing a  vote on him.  </P> <P> But there is another, more important, reason why Wright is in so much trouble.  The environment of congressional politics has changed. There is no such thing  as insider politics any more. Politics is now an outsiders' game. "You can't  bury the committee report," said one congressman. "Not after what happened to  Gary Hart and John Tower."  </P> <P> Under the new political rules, everything is public -- and fair game. Wright  didn't play by the new rules. That's why he got into trouble. Gingrich was one  of the first congressmen to understand and exploit the new rules. That's why he  has been vaulted into a position of leadership.  </P> <P> The things Wright did were more or less accepted under the old rules. He had a  friend publish a collection of his speeches and then sell the book to  supporters and lobbyists under an arrangement involving unusually high  royalties. He intervened with bank regulators on behalf of Texas  savings-and-loan institutions. He accepted favors from a developer in his  district. In Lyndon B. Johnson's day, you could get away with those things.  </P> <P> But in LBJ's day, a politician could also drink and womanize and not expect  anyone to care unless it interfered with his work. No more. Tower represents a  turning point in congressional politics, just as Hart represented a turning  point in presidential politics.  </P> <P> Hart and Tower destroyed any remaining barriers between public and private  behavior. There was no "smoking gun" in the Hart and Tower cases. They didn't  get Hart and Tower on dereliction of duty. They got them on "judgment."  </P> <P> These days, if you want to run for office or accept a position of public trust,  everything is relevant. Your moral, medical, legal and financial background,  even your college records, are subject to public scrutiny. In the old days, the  scrutiny was done in private, and certain transgressions could be considered  irrelevant.  </P> <P> But look at the kinds of questions you have to answer today in order to be  eligible for a presidential appointment: Have you ever had psychological  counseling? Have you used any illegal substance, including marijuana, since age  18? Not that going to a marriage counselor or smoking pot in college makes you  unfit for public service, but such revelations might embarrass the President.  </P> <P> Wright feels confident that he did not violate House rules. "The main thing is,  in my case, I just haven't paid any attention to my personal finances," he said  last week. This is his way of explaining it.  </P> <P> The congressman who initially raised questions about Wright's ethics was none  other than Gingrich. He called Wright "the most corrupt Speaker in the 20th  Century" and said he typified the venal, arrogant Democratic rule of Congress.  Gingrich demanded a committee investigation, and the result was "a fishing  expedition that caught a whale."  </P> <P> Gingrich has never been an inside player. But he is a master of outside  politics. Here is how Congressional Quarterly describes him: "He has made his  name as the ringleader of a band of junior Republicans who perfected . . . a  brash political strategy for coping with their minority status in the House:  confronting and harassing the Democrats rather than negotiating with them." In  other words, taking it to the streets.  </P> <P> As GOP consultant Charles R. Black Jr. said, "Newt wakes up in the morning and  the first thing he thinks about is how to become the majority party."  </P> <P> One tactic is to go after the Democrats on issues such as pay raises and  honorariums. Expose the House leadership as corrupt and tyrannical. Not only  did Gingrich score a direct hit against Wright, several years ago he managed to  humiliate Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr., by having him ruled out of order  on the House floor. The younger Republicans loved it. The Democratic  Establishment was indignant. Now they are terrified.  </P> <P> Gingrich's objective is to carry on an ideological battle with Democrats. The  reason is simple: Democrats lose ideological battles. That's how George Bush  beat Michael S. Dukakis last year. Republicans are frustrated because Democrats  at state and local level seem able to immunize themselves from ideological  challenges.  </P> <P> Gingrich wants to break down their immunity. His allies in this ideological  offensive are Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican National Committee, and  Edward J. Rollins, head of the National Republican Congressional Committee.  Their tactic is to expose Democrats as liberals -- in Congress and at home.  </P> <P> While Democrats are masters of inside politics, they are not so good at outside  politics. Republicans are the ones with great communication skills. Democrats  know how to make deals. Republicans know they can't win the Democrats' game, so  they play a new game.  </P> <P> That's why something strange seems to be happening to House Democrats. They  think about their future under Wright and Gingrich. And the Democrats weep.  </P></p>

Following the  meeting, Karadzic stated that the Russian parliamentarians'  visit was important for many reasons. He recalled that Russia  was involved in the adoption of all resolutions on the Bosnian  crisis and that Russian soldiers are present in this area. Asked  whether they discussed the possibility of dispatching fresh  Russian troops to Bosnia, president Karadzic said the Serb side  is making steps in that direction, in order to act as a  counterbalance to soldiers from other countries. The Russian  parliamentarians visited members of the Russian UN Protection  Force battalion deployed in Grbavica.</p>

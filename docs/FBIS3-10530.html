			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lucia Helena Gazzola] </F>   [Text] The PT [Workers Party] has decided to change its  electoral strategy in light of the possible presidential  candidacy of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso.  Following a meeting that lasted all weekend, the party national  board yesterday released three documents attacking the PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], which had been a desirable  ally in the past. The three documents are: A strongly worded  note that excludes Cardoso's ticket from the PT policy of  alliances; an open letter to PSDB grassroots and voters asking  for support for Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's candidacy; and a  note criticizing the economic plan.    The note that excludes the PSDB from the list of possible  allies, which was approved by a 35-to-9 vote, charges the PSDB  leadership with "opposing PSDB democratic demands, becoming a  group allied with conservative sectors, and becoming a political  alternative to sponsor an anti-Lula candidate."    The open letter addressed to PSDB grassroots follows the  same  line. It states: "Despite our efforts, the main PSDB leaders  have approached the perpetual partners of power, who cluster  around the PFL [Liberal Front Party] of Antonio Carlos  Magalhaes. The continuity of this alternative give a neatly  conservative touch to the party." It adds: "Fernando Henrique  Cardoso's name is being put at the service of conservative  elites as the only alternative to face the reform movement  represented by Lula's candidacy." The letter calls on PSDB  members to prevent the party from "heading a conservative  coalition" and calls on them to join Lula's campaign.    In the third document, which opposes the economic plan, the  PT assures that the plan is "an ongoing electoral fraud led by  the same Cruzado plan team." The document also attacks Cardoso,  saying: "That is the context within which he obtained his only  victory through a vote." The Radical Democracy, led by Sao Paulo  Deputy Jose Genoino, was the only PT movement that disagreed  with excluding the PSDB from the policy of alliances.  "Narrowing the scope of the policy of alliances will reduce the  conditions of governability of the future Lula government," he  criticized.    At another meeting, the state PT board yesterday decided to  rule out the possibility of forming a coalition with the PSDB  for the election in Sao Paulo. The board also debated on Deputy  Jose Dirceu's campaign for governor, and nominated former  Prefects Luiza Erundina and Telma de Souza as candidates for the  Senate.    On Saturday evening, the national PT board allowed PT  lawmakers to participate in the constitutional reform. The  victory of the party bloc, which disagreed with the prohibition  imposed by party leaders, was by 33 votes against 19, and marked  the defeat of party radicals.    Lula, the virtual PT presidential candidate, yesterday  criticized PSDB President Tasso Jereissati and Finance Minister  Cardoso. Lula said Jereissati was "relapsing on conservatism,  neoliberalism, and backwardness," because his party approached  the PFL. Lula said he laments that Cardoso "is not interested  in debating a progressive solution for Brazil."    Lula claims that the PSDB is abandoning social democracy.  "It is deeply lamentable that Jereissati, who began his  political career by breaking the rule of bosses who dominated  the northeast, should now have this conservative syndrome,  seeking an alliance with the retrograde PFL, the party of Jorge  Bornhausen, Ricardo Fiuza, Marco Maciel, Antonio Carlos  Magalhaes, and Joaquim Francisco," Lula said before comparing  Jereissati's behavior with a sickness. "It is a dangerous  relapse. It is necessary to find a vaccine because the  epidemics is serious."    Lula admitted that the PT is concerned about Cardoso's  possible candidacy: "At a time when we can decide whether to put  the destiny of the country in conservative or progressive hands,  they chose the former." He said PSDB members will not agree to  a coalition with Bornhausen's party. "The grassroots, who in  1990 prevented the party from falling into Collor's hands, will  now prevent it from falling into PFL hands."</p>

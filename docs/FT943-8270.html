			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Minister warns signal workers Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, yesterday warned the RMT transport union that public sympathy for striking rail signalling workers could 'snap' as he urged them to drop their claim for an interim payment. He insisted that the government's public-sector pay policy would not change and said signal workers had already been rewarded for past productivity gains. 'Everyone is getting fed up with the disruption and inconvenience these needless strikes are causing to travellers, industry and the railway industry itself. Public patience can be elastic, but even elastic can snap,' he said. Meanwhile, the dispute is threatening to dominate this year's Trades Union Congress when it opens on September 5. Mr John Monks, the general secretary, denied yesterday that this would embarrass the TUC, which is being modernised and plans a relaunch at Blackpool. He said: 'The signal workers have widespread support in the trade union movement as well as among the public.' Mr Monks accused Railtrack, the state-owned company which owns the rail network, of being an 'incompetent and arrogant' employer. Last night Railtrack said that 16.5 per cent of the 4,600 signal workers had returned to work during this week's 48-hour stoppage. It said the numbers going back were 25 per cent in East Anglia, 19 per cent in the north-east of England, 15 per cent in Scotland and the south of England and nearly 20 per cent in the Great Western zone.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk held talks in Kiev today  with Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov. After the  talks finished, Saburov gave an exclusive interview to a  correspondent of the Ostankino radio and television company.    [Begin Saburov recording] We spoke about specific things  connected with the need to begin economic reforms in Crimea.  The situation is extremely difficult, extremely difficult. So  we will hasten to take the measures to enable us to adopt a law  on the division of powers between Ukraine and Crimea. We will  act within the framework of Ukraine's law. Of course, not all  of Ukraine's legislation facilitates reforms. Let us state this  frankly. This is obvious from the standard of living both in  Kiev and Crimea -- it needs to be improved. If the reforms in  Russia are sometimes cursed for having reduced the standard of  living there, I would advise the critics to come to Ukraine and  see what happens when reforms are not carried out. It is a  terrible situation. On the whole, the president's attitude  toward our proposals was one of complete understanding, and  since he is the upholder of the law, all of our activities  carried out within the framework of the law will naturally be  supported by him.

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (2): Solidity and maturity - The economy stirs, but expect no miracles Japan's consumers, industrial companies and banks are starting to adjust to the fact that they can expect nothing like the high growth of the 1980s during the second half of this decade. The change down in economic gear is one of the many factors forcing Japan to challenge the values that used to lie at the heart of its economic power, like the dominance of producers' interests over consumers, the lifetime employment system and the tight-knit organisation of business into keiretsu, or corporate families. Japan may have to learn to switch to a mature consumer-led economy rather than the fast growing industry-led exporter it used to be until the downturn hit, just after the turn of the decade. A faltering increase in private demand has just started to arouse the economy from its longest and deepest recession in the post-war era. It may only walk rather than run into its next recovery phase, but few doubt that the worst is over. Most economists in Tokyo believe that gross domestic product will recover from stagnation last year to growth between less than 1 per cent and 2 per cent this year, settling to something like one or two points below the 1980 average annual growth rate of 4.5 per cent. The main evidence for an upturn includes a 3.9 per cent annualised increase in gdp in the first quarter of this year, the best performance for three years. It could fall back again in the current quarter for seasonal reasons, but the underlying forces at work are clear, even if fragile. Government spending packages have fed through to strong rises in housing starts, private consumption and imports in the first three months of this year. Imports, spurred by the yen's sharp rise, increased by just over 16 per cent in the year to last month, the clearest evidence that Japan's huge and politically troublesome trade surplus might now be on the turn. Private consumption rose by 5.8 per cent in the first quarter. There has been a consumer spending spree in discount stores, often loaded with cheap imported goods, and helped by the gradual breakdown of Japan's retail and distribution cartels, incidentally one of the ways in which economic change is producing an adjustment in the structure of society. Industry has started to reduce its vast inventories of unsold goods, but industrial production has yet to show a clear pickup. Output showed an apparently encouraging rise in the first three months of this year by comparison with the last quarter of 1993. Yet the monthly figures have switched direction every month since last August. Recovery is being slowed in its early stages by the yen's recent historic break through Y100 to the dollar, an unwelcome new blow to the international competitiveness of Japan's manufacturing industry. Some business leaders, such as Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Nikkeiren employers' federation, believe the yen's sharp rise could nip the recovery in the bud, just as a jump in the yen did when a phantom upturn appeared this time last year. Most economists, however, believe industry has cut its costs so sharply during the recession that the latest rise in the Japanese currency will merely slow, rather than choke, recovery. Japan's chaotic political scene, with four governments in the past year, has also slowed the recovery by hampering ministers' ability to make difficult economic policy decisions. Successive governments have, to their credit, delivered three public spending packages worth Y45,000bn over the past 18 months. But badly needed income tax cuts and further public spending have been delayed or blocked. Japan's shaky governments have also done well to produce three deregulation packages over the past year, marking modest steps in the attempt to reduce Japanese costs and prices in line with international competitors. But the political upheavals have delayed and possibly weakened the implementation of the most recent deregulation package, published last month. This is not all bad, since many economists believe deregulation should in any case be slow, to avoid creating too much deflation at a time when wholesale prices are already falling. Looking beyond the immediate problems, the later stages of the recovery will be constrained by at least two structural problems - surplus industrial capacity and the weakness of the financial system. Surplus capacity will force the industries that used to be the engines of Japan's economy to hold down wage increases, new employment and investment in the mature domestic market. The car industry alone, for example, still has surplus production capacity of 2m vehicles, equivalent to the entire car market of Britain or France. It is not alone. The electronics, shipbuilding, engineering and financial services industries are all going into recovery with bloated payrolls. Their high costs are more of a handicap now than in the 1980s because of the sharp rise in the yen, by 35 per cent in trade weighted terms since early last year. This means that Japanese companies will continue, as they did in the recession, to curb recruitment and to encourage early retirement, as a way to reduce capacity in line with demand without breaking the taboo against heavy redundancies. Lifetime employment will come under strain, but it will weaken rather than collapse, say Japanese managers. According to a recent survey by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, companies will increase capital investment by 1.1 per cent in the year to next March, yet most of this new cash will go to cheap production sites in China and south-east Asia, which represent Japan's fastest growing export markets and investment destinations. The financial system, meanwhile, is making slow headway in running down the burden of bad debts, inherited from the boom in lending on the back of over-valued property during the sharp rise in asset values of the late 1980s. Since then, commercial property prices have fallen by up to 50 per cent and have shown no clear sign yet of recovery. It is feared that the experience has made banks so cautious over extending new loans that the economic recovery may prove hard to finance. This is born out by the weak performance of the benchmark indicator of money supply, M2 plus certificates of deposit. It turned the corner early last year, from a three year decline, but grew at a mere 1.7 per cent in the year to May, well below the 5 per cent annual growth which many economists believe is needed to fund a revival.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Managers 'ignorant' of training schemes MOST senior managers are ignorant about the relevance to their organisations of the government's main training initiatives, a survey published today claims. Managers needed evidence that initiatives such as National Vocational Qualifications would deliver positive results, according to the joint survey of 542 managers, all at board level or equivalent, compiled by the Institute of Management and employment services company Manpower. Only a third of managers believed that NVQs would significantly alter their employees' attitudes towards training. The government has just launched a big advertising campaign for Investors in People, a standard that assesses how far a company's training meets its business needs, but companies are still sceptical of what the standard can do for their profits.

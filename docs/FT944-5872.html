			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Lister loss increases Losses at Lister &amp; Co increased sharply in the half-year to October 1, because of depressed demand in the textile sector and losses in the engineering businesses. On static sales of Pounds 17.7m the pre-tax deficit jumped from Pounds 268,000 to Pounds 700,000. On a per share basis the loss worked through at 4.32p (1.85p). Lister said its engineering business had been reviewed and a new managing director had been appointed.</p>

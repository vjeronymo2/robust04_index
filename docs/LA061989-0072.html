Foley (D-Wash.) expressed outrage Sunday over the  Chinese government's attempt to deny that a mass slaughter of Chinese civilians  took place at Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> Foley also condemned the death sentences given to eight people accused of  attacking the Chinese army during the June 4 crackdown on the pro-democracy  movement in Beijing.  </P> <P> "We are outraged as a country about the death sentences, about the suppression  and about the enormous big lie that the Chinese government is attempting to  tell about that story," Foley said on NBC's "Meet The Press."  </P> <P> Foley said he believes that President Bush should be more vocal in his  criticism of the Chinese leadership and consider further actions against the  Beijing government "if matters turn toward the worse, as they apparently are  doing."  </P></p>

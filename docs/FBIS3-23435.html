			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Loukis Loukaidhis] </F>   [Text] In case of hostilities, Turkish agents, who move  freely in the areas controlled by the state, will act as a fifth  column and attempt to attack and damage military and other  installations with the aim of causing confusion and panic among  the legal government and the Greek Cypriots.    For a long time, the security authorities have had  information about hostilities, and these have been reinforced  with Theofilos Yeoryiadhis' murder. However, the authorities  cannot make any arrests due to lack of evidence. They simply  observe the moves and activities of people who are acting as  spies against the Republic of Cyprus.    Intense activity by Turkish agents has been noted in the  past  two months and cause concern to the police who are studying the  issue at various conferences.    The Turkish agents reportedly enter the free areas through  the British bases sometime during the night and they contact  various people who live in the free areas.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- The United States, while  seeking to improve relations with Mainland China, should not  damage the Republic of China's [ROC] national interests, a  Foreign Ministry official said Saturday [28 May].    Tu Chu-sheng, director of the ministry's North American  Affairs Department, made the call during a public hearing on  Taipei- Washington-Beijing ties sponsored by several private  groups here.    Tu said Taipei-Washington relations should be separated from  American relations with Mainland China.    "We have never intervened in Washington-Beijing relations,"  Tu said. "We hope both Beijing and Washington would never  promote their bilateral ties at the expense of our national  interests."    Taiwan also hopes the US Government will pragmatically face  the reality that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are now  ruled by two different governments which exercise full  jurisdiction over their own territories, Tu said. "We hope the  US can handle its relations with Taipei and Beijing separately."    He further said it has been Taiwan's goal to push the US  Government to treat the two sides of the Taiwan Strait equally  before China's reunification.    US President Bill Clinton announced Thursday he will renew  Mainland China's "most-favored-nation" (MFN) trade status and  sever the link between trade and human rights.    Tu said Clinton's decision marks a turning point in the  improvement of Washington-Beijing relations. However, it  remains unclear whether the Clinton administration will become  more flexible in handling its ties with Taiwan, he noted.    Recent public speeches by US Secretary of State Warren  Christopher show no signs that the Clinton administration is  ready to make any major change in the so-called "one China"  policy which the US has upheld since it recognized Beijing in  1979, Tu said.    He continued that Taipei-Washington relations have remained  steady under the framework of the Taiwan Relations Act, a US law  defining American ties with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic  relations.    However, Tu said, the current unofficial links cannot  effectively reflect close substantive relations between the ROC  and the US. America is Taiwan's top export market, while the ROC  is America's sixth largest trade partner.    The ROC Government has attached great importance to its  relations with the US, Tu said, adding Taiwan will use its  political and economic clout to further strengthen relations  with America.    Taipei hopes the US will continue to sell it defensive arms  and support its bid to join the United Nations and other  international organizations, Tu said. "We also hope the US will  agree to change the title of our representative office in its  territory to one that can better represent Taiwan," he added.    Taiwan's representative office is now called the  Coordination  Council for North American Affairs.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rules are, of necessity, general in nature with regard to criteria for designing adequate program elements. This generality arises due to the large variety of EIP types and designs which may be submitted, and the Agency's goal of encouraging creativity and innovation on the part of the States developing such programs. There are three broad, interrelated aspects of any program design that significantly affect the approvability of an EIP: How the EIP relates to other SIP provisions, the level of certainty in quantifying emissions and projecting EIP results, and the nature and extent of MRR requirements for enabling determinations of compliance. For example, today's notice reflects the Agency's view that the scope and nature of MRR requirements, including the extent to which an EIP exceeds the minimum requirements for such, would be among the factors to be considered in assessing the adequacy of any demonstration of projected EIP program results. The Agency anticipates preparing additional guidance on specific aspects of program design as it gains experience with EIP's, partly through participation in feasibility and demonstration projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Descriptions of a broad range of general types of incentive strategies which exemplify potential EIP's are appended to the final rules. These descriptions identify key provisions which distinguish the different model program types. These examples are general in nature so as to avoid limiting innovation on the part of the States in developing programs tailored to individual State needs. The EPA has placed in the docket support documents which survey a wide range of EIP's that have actually been implemented, as well as programs in the design stage. The EPA has also issued information and guidance, as required by section 108(f)(1)(A) of the Act, regarding the formulation and emissions reductions potential of various transportation control measures (TCM's). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Further information on potential TCM's and other mobile source measures is also contained in a staff memorandum, ``Preliminary Mobile Source Economic Incentive Program Strategies,'' from P.

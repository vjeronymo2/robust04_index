			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Political backcloth to global equity shifts Politics provided the set for last week's drama on some of the world's equity markets. While Hong Kong fell sharply after Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, enraged the Chinese on Friday by saying that he was to press ahead with democratic reform proposals, Australia rose, anticipating a change of government. Japan provided support for the 2 per cent gain in the FT-Actuaries world index, as the Nikkei average closed the week at a six-month high. The slide in Hong Kong continued yesterday, with the Hang Seng index having lost some 8 per cent over the two days. However, many analysts believe that the worst is now over and anticipate short term support at the 5,800 level. Most of the selling has come from domestic investors, with foreign institutions remaining on the sidelines, they comment; and the excellent results from HSBC have refocused attention on the underlying strength of corporate earnings. Regarding Mr Patten's efforts to seize the political initiative with his proposals to extend democracy, Mr David Bates of Asia Equity comments that there are doubts whether they will even win the support of the Legislative Council. As yet a date has not been set for debate but, says Mr Bates, there are indications that the LegCo is evenly divided. Australia rallied as investors anticipated defeat for Mr Paul Keating and his Labor government; but Labor, having clinched victory, the equity market yesterday lost 2 per cent. Mr Peter Wade of brokers JB Were in London commented that expectations that the Liberal/National party would seek further rationalisation of the banking sector and privatise other public sector companies had driven the market higher in the pre-election weeks. Nevertheless, with the likelihood of cuts in interest rates and corporate tax the downside in the market would probably be limited.</p>

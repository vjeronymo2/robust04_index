			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WITNESSES GIVE DETAILS OF DEPUTIES'  SPENDING  </P> <P> An array of bank officers, real estate agents, car salesmen and other business  representatives took the stand Friday in a federal money-skimming trial as  prosecutors sought to show the spending habits of seven Los Angeles County  sheriff's deputies.  </P> <P> The narcotics officers, accused of skimming $1.4 million during drug raids,  allegedly spent much of that money on vacation homes, automobiles, jewelry,  landscaping and other luxuries, according to prosecutors, who also subpoenaed  numerous bank records and invoices.  </P> <P> But in questioning witnesses, defense attorneys contended that although  deputies made tens of thousands of dollars in purchases -- much of it in cash  -- they did nothing illegal and made no effort to conceal those financial  arrangements.  </P> <P> The defendants, all veteran narcotics deputies, have pleaded not guilty to  conspiracy, tax evasion and other federal charges. Their trial resumes Tuesday.  </P></p>

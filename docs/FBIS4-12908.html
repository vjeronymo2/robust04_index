			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin </F> by political correspondent Udi Segal "held in Jerusalem a short  while ago" -- live]    [Text] The prime minister seemed very disturbed by the  Hadera terror attack. He spent several hours of interviews with  the various media summoned on Independence Day, and the report  on the attack came in the middle of them, in the middle of  Memorial Day. Prime Minister Rabin said that this was yet  another attack by fanatics trying to sabotage the peace process.  We, however, will stay the course and continue implementing the  peace process, thus foiling their intentions to harm it.    Rabin spoke about the announcement by Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement], stating that after the Hebron massacre and  again today Hamas announced it will carry out five harsh  retaliatory attacks inside Israel's territory to revenge the  massacre. According to Hamas, it has carried out two of those  attacks: the grave attack last week in 'Afula and today's  serious attack in Hadera. Prime Minister Rabin said Hamas and  the Islamic Jihad decided to focus on their activity inside the  Green Line boundaries with a political aim of diverting Israeli  public opinion against the peace process.    [Begin Rabin recording] I am primarily responsible for the  security of sovereign Israel, including united Jerusalem. There  are some 4.2 million Jews and over 900,000 Arabs inside  sovereign Israel. Some 120,000 Jews live in the territories, I  mean Judaea, Samaria and Gaza. They must be protected too, but  'Afula, Hadera, Netanya, and everywhere else should take  precedence over all that is in the Judaea and Samaria. In 1994,  23 Israelis in uniform and civilians were killed, murdered --  some 20 of them were killed inside the boundaries of sovereign  Israel.    The Hamas and Islamic Jihad organizations have reached the  conclusion that they should attack not only settlers -- although  they are included -- but primarily they decided to focus on  attacks inside Israel. They realized that they gain political  profit from the reactions of the Israeli opposition against the  peace process -- which is their main political aim. It earns  them more. Anyone who today calls for an end to the  negotiations is giving Hamas and Islamic Jihad an additional  incentive to continue their acts of terror. The true answer we  -- together with the PLO -- should give them is proof that we  can reach an agreement, that it can be implemented, and that our  reality changes as a result of the implementation. If we  succeed in doing this, it would be the answer to the murderers  of 'Afula and Hadera, and to most of the terror activity that  resulted in the deaths of Jews. [end recording]    The prime minister also spoke today of operative steps  which will be taken in view of the Hadera attack. He will soon  instruct the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to move forces from  inside the territories and deploy them between the Green Line  and the territories thereby reinforcing the closure. This will  create a thicker barrier between the territories and the area  inside the Green Line. Forces will be moved out from areas  densely populated by Arabs, the city centers, and create a  barrier, for example, between Janin and 'Afula and between  Tulkarm and Hadera. Rabin admitted that the closure does not  provide an absolute solution. Anyone who really wants to, can  get out.    [Begin recording] [Rabin] The closure is not hermetic. It  is effective in preventing laborers from carrying out individual  attacks. It does place some burden on the terror organizations,  but does not prevent their activity altogether. Some 10,000  Israeli cars cross daily from Judaea and Samaria alone into  Israel. No one can expect soldiers at checkpoints to be able to  discern whether a car bearing a yellow [Israeli] license plate  is not driven by an Israeli civilian and is getting across.  Unless we introduce a more serious separation, there would be  no certainty that a bomb is not placed in an Israeli car stolen  in Israel, or that an individual does not cross the lines and  reach 'Afula or Hadera on foot. All he has to do is cross a  certain line, catch a ride, or walk. Most of them speak Hebrew  and are able to do this. We must invest more in this and, as I  said before, we will move out troops currently engaged in the  protection of settlements. After all, Elon More [Jewish  settlement] does not protect 'Afula! It is protected by the  IDF, the Israel Police, and the Shin Bet.    [Segal] Mr. Prime Minister, you spoke of the wave of terror  striking at us now. Do you believe that after the Gaza and  Jericho agreement is implemented the situation will improve?    [Rabin] The test will be in Gaza and Jericho. I cannot  demand that an Arab leader in Tunisia be able to have a bigger  impact on Judaea and Samaria than the IDF has while in control  of the territory. Can the PLO influence Hamas or the Islamic  Jihad which carry out most of the terror acts? Here and there  are some who quit the PLO and take to terror, but we have such  people everywhere. Therefore, the real test will be when they  assume responsibility, after we reach an agreement. Then, they  will have to meet the commitments they made in the agreement.  That is why we insist on reaching an agreement that would  provide us with the utmost security. [end recording]    Another question posed to Rabin was on the recent decline in  the public's support for the government's moves. Rabin said in  response that the opposition does not have an alternative. What  they are suggesting is a political freeze which will lead to an  escalation. This, in fact, is exactly the aim of the Palestinian  factions which carry out the terror attacks. Rabin was asked  for his view of the public opinion polls showing this decline in  public support.    [Begin Rabin recording] I became prime minister of my own  free will. I struggled through Labor primaries and the Knesset  elections. I did not seek this chair just to sit there. I  believed that I should do things differently from the previous  governments, also on domestic issues, but let us leave this for  the moment. Primarily, I wished to give new meaning to  negotiations on the basis of the Madrid conference. I  acknowledged that there is only one Palestinian partner, if we  stop the masquerade -- the PLO. The Palestinians are split:  Some support the PLO, and there are those who opt for terror,  but the bulk of the Palestinians support the PLO and opt for  negotiations. The other half, the other part, are the  supporters of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad who want to continue  the war, terror, and violence against us, and reject any  political arrangement. We must find a partner for the  agreement. Past hopes that Palestinians from the territories  could do this were proven absolutely unreal. I know that I am  facing a decline in the Israeli public support for the move --  because of the terrorism, not because of the nature of the  political solution. I will not change my policies in view of a  certain public opinion poll held on a certain day, week, or  month. As long as I have a Knesset majority, I will carry on in  this way. I wish to exhaust the chance to attain peace. As I  have said before, the alternative is a freeze and escalation  with all that entails. Let us not forget, the signing of the  Declaration of Principles had an impact on the Arab world.  Otherwise Israeli delegations could not have gone to Oman to  prepare a meeting of a multilateral committee there, or in  Qatar. Did anyone believe such things and others which will  follow could happen? Many in the Arab world and outside it had  believed that the heart of the conflict is the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- and I am not saying that this is  correct or incorrect. The fact that we dared to deal with it  has opened new horizons for us. [end recording]</p>

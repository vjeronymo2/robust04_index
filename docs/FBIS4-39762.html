			<p>BFN     [Text] Mass rallies organized by the association of  defense workers' unions were held in a number of Russia's cities  in protest at the destruction of the defense industry.    The chairman of the association's central committee, Sergey  Shuklin, told Interfax that only representatives of the aviation  industry had failed to take part in the rallies.    Shuklin said a number of St. Petersburg enterprises kept  their sirens on and held shop-floor meetings. Their workers  also picketed the administrative building. Similar actions were  also held in Novosibirsk, Barnaul, Kirov, Perm and Moscow.    In particular, defense workers demanded their salaries be  paid, jobs preserved, a mechanism to reconcile mutual debts be  set up and state control over fuel prices established.</p>

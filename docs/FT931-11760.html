			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Big rise forecast in growth of US manufacturing industry US manufacturing industry is poised for its fastest growth in four years, a sharp increase in the Purchasing Managers' Index indicated yesterday. Boosted by an increase in new orders, the index rose from 55.4 per cent in December to 58 last month, the highest level since July 1988. This was higher than financial markets expected and, taken with other recent strong data, could lead economists to revise upwards their estimates of US growth this year. The index has been above the 50 per cent level that indicates an expanding manufacturing sector since last October, when it registered 50.7 per cent. The Purchasing Managers' Index, based on a monthly questionnaire to over 300 industrial companies, is regarded as a reliable barometer of trends in manufacturing. In a separate report yesterday, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 6.2 per cent last year, the biggest increase in six years. However, spending was down 0.4 per cent in December and figures for October and November were also revised down. Mr Robert Bretz, a spokesman for US purchasing managers, said low levels of corporate inventories and rising order books indicated the economy would continue to strengthen in coming months. If the purchasing index remained above about 53 per cent - the average for last year - growth of real gross domestic product was likely to exceed 3 per cent this year, he said. Yesterday's figures follow reports last week of a 9.1 per cent increase in new orders for durable goods between November and December and economic growth at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter. Sales of existing homes at the end of last year were reported at their highest level in 13 years. Most components of the purchasing index sent encouraging signals. The index for new orders rose from 64.4 per cent in December to 67.2 per cent. The index for production rose from 59.4 per cent to 64.6 per cent. However, the index for export orders did less well, rising to 53.9 per cent against 53.3 per cent in December. Productivity leads, Page 15</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Workforce cuts now less likely: Adjustment to high yen complete Most Japanese companies believe they have made the adjustments to their workforces necessary to cope with the high yen, according to a survey released by the labour ministry yesterday. Of about 1,000 employers it polled in mid-July, only 4 per cent said they had taken steps to shed jobs since the currency began its renewed climb in June. A further 6 per cent were planning such measures. A previous survey conducted last August, when the yen first touched the Y100 level against the US dollar, showed that 10 per cent of companies had taken recent action and a further 10 per cent intended to do so if the exchange rate stayed at current levels. The yen closed in Tokyo yesterday at Y98.13 to the dollar, held back by Bank of Japan intervention after strong overnight buying in New York pushed it as high as Y97.85. Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, international trade and industry minister, told a press conference he was worried that the effect of the strong currency on export performance would hinder a nascent economic recovery. And Mr Toshio Morikawa, chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan, while saying the country was certainly headed for an upturn, cautioned the level of the yen would mean revival was slow. If the currency rose further, 30 per cent of the companies surveyed by the labour ministry said they would have to take action. Half the sample had previously carried out some sort of employment adjustment amid the country's three-year economic downturn. As the Japanese lifetime employment system inhibits compulsory redundancies, measures commonly include transferring workers to affiliates and offering early retirement incentives. But the number of new programmes of this type reported is falling. The government's Economic Planning Agency said yesterday the economy was on the dividing line between recession and recovery, according to its diffusion index for June. The coincident index, reflecting prevailing conditions, stood at 50 per cent. It had been above that level for the past three months, achieving its most optimistic recent scores of 60 per cent in April and May, but the agency said the fall was milder than expected. The leading index, which projects conditions three to six months ahead, stood at 54.5 per cent, compared with 58.3 per cent in May. It was the sixth successive reading above the boom-or-bust level. The lagging index rose to 42.9 per cent, below the halfway mark for the ninth month in a row but up from 14.3 per cent in May. The EPA spoke of a heightened possibility the economy was moving into recovery, and dropped a previous description of conditions as sluggish. But it warned the July index might show no progress, because of weak industrial output.</p>

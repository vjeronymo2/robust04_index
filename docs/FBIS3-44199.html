The Angolan head of state  noted that, first and foremost, Blondin Beye has known how to  abide by Angolan law, adding that he has tried to have the  warring sides reach whatever understandings they possibly can.    Asked whether he thinks today that the National Union for  the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] had planned all along to  launch a war in the event that it lost the September 1992  elections, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos replied that it is  possible that UNITA already had alternate plans, like all the  forces -- especially the more backward forces -- that have  assisted him during the conflict.</p>

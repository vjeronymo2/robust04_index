			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Ford cuts margin on Mondeo FORD has cut its dealers' official profit margin, which is usually 16 per cent to 17 per cent, to 10 per cent on its Mondeo cars, which are due to go on sale on March 25. The move helps Ford to claim that the Mondeo's retail prices, announced yesterday, will be up to several hundred pounds lower than those of Sierra models which the Mondeo will replace. The new car is not quite the bargain Ford is seeking to make it, however, because the Sierra's retail prices include a margin of 16 per cent to 17 per cent for the dealer. In addition, prices of the Sierra, which is imported from Ford's German and Belgium plants, rose in January by an average of 7.5 per cent. Ford, which increased prices of UK-built models by an average of 4.5 per cent at the time, said the Sierra rise was necessary to compensate for sterling's devaluation. It rejected speculation that such a rise would help to make the Mondeo - Ford's first 'world car' - appear less expensive. The company had little choice about cutting dealers' margins on the new car because all its main rivals have already done so. Such a move has allowed all these manufacturers to cut 'official' retail prices. However, this has little, if any, effect on the amount customers actually pay for their cars. This is because the severely depressed new car market is so competitive that dealers had been 'giving away' much of their 16 per cent to 17 per cent margins anyway. The cut to an official 10 per cent margin merely gives the dealers less room to manoeuvre.</p>

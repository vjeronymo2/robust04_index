			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> ARMY DRUG TESTING OF CIVILIANS UPHELD  </P> <P> About 7,000 civilian employees of the Army can be required to undergo random  urine tests to detect drug use, a federal appeals court ruled. The 3-0 decision  by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld most  of a 1986 Army plan to ask some civilian employees to undergo drug tests. The  ruling means that civilians who fly or service the Army's planes and  helicopters, work in law enforcement or as drug counselors will be required to  submit to urinalysis on a random basis. The plan would also require them to  pass a drug test before being hired, if their supervisor had probable cause to  suspect on-duty drug impairment or if they were involved in a mishap. But the  court declined to uphold testing for workers with access to chemical or nuclear  warfare agents, or for laboratory employees who conduct urinalysis tests for  the drug and alcohol control program. The ruling was prompted by six lawsuits  filed by the National Federation of Federal Employees and the American  Federation of Government Employees.  </P></p>

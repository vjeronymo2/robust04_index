			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Peru seeks Dollars 7bn debt overhaul Peru's economy and finance minister, Mr Jorge Camet, meets the country's leading commercial bank creditors in New York today following the approval of a law which will allows bank debt to be used as payment in privatisations. Mr Camet and the banks, led by Citibank, are aiming to initiate renegotiation of Peru's Dollars 7bn debt with about 230 international commercial banks. Peru's Congress approved the law, under pressure from the administration of President Alberto Fujimori, on Friday. However, it left in place a potential stumbling block to the negotiations with the banks by postponing debate over recognition of a controversial Dollars 20m loan. The loan from Chemical Bank and American Express, made in 1984 for the purchase of two steamships, was repudiated by ex-president Alan Garcia on the grounds it was fraudulent. In Lima, the new legislation drew fire from some economists. They say it confuses two contradictory objectives: the reduction of Peru's total debt stock and the attraction of more bidders to the sluggish privatisation programme. They accuse the banks of exerting pressure on the government to benefit from the spiralling value of Peru's debt paper in the secondary market. Three years ago, Peruvian secondary debt was quoted at an all-time low of around 4 cents on the dollar. By February this year it had climbed to 20 cents and now stands at about 54 cents, even though Peru's capacity to pay is unchanged. The country's entire foreign debt totals some Dollars 22bn. The precise amount of the commercial debt has yet to be determined. Principal is only Dollars 2.7bn, but interest and penalties since Peru halted service have pushed the total to between Dollars 6.5bn and Dollars 7bn. According to economy ministry figures, the new law frees more than Dollars 10bn of secondary debt paper for privatisations.</p>

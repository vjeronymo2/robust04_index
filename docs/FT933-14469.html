			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / High-fliers push aside corporate old guard THE TRADITIONAL British boss, famed for being poorly educated, elderly and insular, is being pushed aside by a younger generation of better-qualified managers. A survey of British company boards by Korn/Ferry, the firm of international headhunters, says a 'transformation' is taking place in the education of British managers. The survey, taken from The Times 1,000 companies, shows almost 80 per cent of top executives at companies with a turnover of over Pounds 250m are under 55, and 40 per cent are under 50. Fewer younger managers had been promoted from within, compared with older ones, and almost half had been in their jobs for less than five years. Of younger directors, 27 per cent could speak at least one language in addition to English, compared with only 15 per cent of directors between 50 and 55. Two-thirds of those under 50 had degrees, compared with less than half the older group. Of the top executives of companies with turnover above Pounds 1bn, 13 per cent have a master of business administration qualification, more than twice as many as last year. Mr George Bain, president of London Business School, said: 'People have always said that the British manager lacks quality as he doesn't have the same training as his competitors and is insular. These figures begin to suggest that that is changing.' Mr Michael Brandon, the report's author, said pressure exerted by the recession had helped to promote younger managers, and explosive growth in MBAs and management consultancies had made management more attractive to young people. He argued the change was part of a general move towards a better-educated society and resulted from the expansion in university education since the 1960s.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris </F> Silajdzic by Mario R. Dederichs; place and date not given:  "Punishing the Instigators"]    [Text] [Dederichs] Will the agreement between the Croats  and Bosnians finally bring peace for Bosnia?    [Silajdzic] It is a very important step to ending the  conflict between two peoples that have coexisted in an exemplary  manner for centuries. The war has destroyed a great deal of  confidence, but in the end we will have to live together.    [Dederichs] Why was the agreement signed in Washington?    [Silajdzic] The United States has made a decisive  contribution. I hope that it will continue its efforts because  the Europeans are currying favor with the Serbs and rewarding  aggression by recognizing conquests.    [Dederichs] Which Europeans?    [Silajdzic] The appeasement started in London and was  completed in Moscow. The Germans were ready to help but were  not always consistent. Germany has provided valuable assistance  for our refugees.    [Dederichs] The European Union has demanded that the Bosnian  Serbs should give up some of their territory. Is that not  sufficient?    [Silajdzic] The principle of not recognizing occupied  territories remains hollow if it is not implemented everywhere.    [Dederichs] The United Nations wants to prosecute the war  criminals.    [Silajdzic] Culprits from all the ethnic groups must be  punished, not only the criminals but the instigators, too, those  who are responsible for "ethnic cleansing."    [Dederichs] Including the Serbian leaders Karadzic or  Milosevic?    [Silajdzic] They must also be punished! We all must face up  to the truth, otherwise 1994 will be like 1939. A total of  16,000 children have been killed in the war in Bosnia. We know  who is responsible.</p>

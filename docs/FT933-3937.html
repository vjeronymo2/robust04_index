			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: ANC offers miners hope of exchange control relaxation THE AFRICAN National Congress yesterday raised the prospect that a new government might relax exchange controls to encourage investment by South African companies in the region, especially in the mining sector. Speaking at a mining conference in Johannesburg yesterday Mr Trevor Manuel, head of the ANC's department of economic planning, said the ANC was 'considering the possibility of creating a special window for investments in the region'. He said the ANC was anxious to stimulate local mining companies to invest in the region and thus to assist in its economic revival. Existing exchange control regulations make it very difficult for South African companies to finance investments beyond its borders. Companies have to convince the Reserve Bank (central bank), which administers exchange control, that there will be a virtually immediate benefit to the country from any such investment. The ANC - likely to be the largest party in a future government - has acknowledged that no such change could be expected before the second half of 1994, and even that may be an ambitious target. Although, as one bank official acknowledged, South Africa has a 'soft spot' for Africa, the selective relaxation of exchange controls for South Africans, while foreign lenders still find some of their loans subject to a sovereign debt repayment scheme, would be controversial. And while the ANC clearly feels a debt to its neighbours, all of whom suffered to some extent from South Africa's destabilisation policies in the past, it may have difficulty convincing the business community that the national interest is best served by favouring regional investment. In a speech outlining the ANC's view of the future of mining in South Africa, and on the continent, Mr Manuel said the ANC was 'committed to maintaining the international position of the (mining) sector and to creating conditions for guaranteeing the high levels of investment needed to replace depleting reserves'. He said that the ANC recognised that mining was a high-risk industry and that investors required 'above average' guarantees if they were to be attracted. The ANC was planning a review of the system of access to mineral rights in an attempt to encourage investment, he added. 'Mineral rights need to be freed up, but this needs to be done in such a way as still to guarantee the investor the right to mine with adequate tenure. The fiscal terms need to be stable and the investor must be given access to foreign exchange, both for imported inputs and the repatriation of profits.' The ANC, Mr Manuel added, was also committed to 'guaranteeing the investor a stable economic environment, including guarantees against nationalisation without compensation'. Mr Manuel did not lay much emphasis on the 'responsibilities' of the investor, other than to note that the legacy of apartheid in the industry would have to be addressed through training of the local population. 'We hope that we will see much greater black South African participation in ownership and the higher paid positions.' He endorsed the conventional wisdom that the future of the local mining industry lay in the route of beneficiation, or adding value, to minerals. Examples suggested were stainless steel and aluminium kitchenware and cutlery.</p>

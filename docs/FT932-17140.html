			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Manufacturing growth slows US MANUFACTURING industry is still expanding, but the pace of growth has slowed since the start of the year, the National Association of Purchasing Managers reported yesterday. The Purchasing Managers Index fell for the second month running in March to stand at 53.4 per cent, the lowest level since October. This was well above the 50 per cent threshold which indicates growth in the sector but sharply lower than January's 58 per cent. The greatest weakness was in export markets: in March the sub-index for new export orders fell below 50 per cent for the first time since the association began collecting export data in 1988, 'reflecting the slowing in the economies of our major trading partners'. The overall index is based on a survey of 300 companies and is regarded as a reliable indicator of trends in manufacturing. Mr Robert Bretz, an association spokesman, said there were 'encouraging signals for continued moderate growth in the economy'. Within the manufacturing sector 16 of 20 industries reported growth last month. The average level of the index in the first quarter, moreover, was well above the average for 1992, which saw a significant rise in gross domestic product. However, said Mr Bretz the rate of growth of production appeared sharply lower than in February. Growth of new orders was also declining. The fall in the purchasing managers' index follows a number of mildly discouraging economic reports, including confirmation this week that the post-election surge in consumer confidence late last year has largely evaporated.</p>

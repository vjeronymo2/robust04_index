			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 26 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- A meeting took place  today at the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs'  building between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who is in  the capital on an official visit, and Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev.    Speaking to Russian and foreign journalists after the  meeting, Andrey Kozyrev stressed that the conversation between  the high-ranking guest from Israel and Russian Federation  President Boris Yeltsin which took place earlier covered a great  many topics and touched on all aspects of bilateral relations  and of the problems of a Near East settlement. "We can state  that our relations are improving," the minister said. "They are  developing in a positive, specific way both with regard the  former and the latter range of issues. Russia has serious and  long-term interests in the Near East; they spring from  full-scale cooperation and partnership with Israel and the Arab  states, and from providing maximum assistance to the Near East  peace process as a co-sponsor of it."    Summing up the results of the meetings already held, Yitzhaq  Rabin noted that during the meetings he understood Russia's  striving to continue assisting the establishment of peace and  security in the Near East. Russia and the United States are  helping the sides at the talks when it is requested of them, he  pointed out. The Palestinians would like Moscow to help them in  attaining certain aims, and we view this with understanding.    The Israeli head of government spoke of the desire to  develop  broad contacts with Russia, particularly because they have been  frozen for the last four decades. "Therefore, cooperation needs  to be started virtually from scratch and not only in the areas  on which agreements were signed yesterday," he said. He said  that he has invited Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and also  the speakers of both houses of the Russian parliament to visit  Israel because "the bilateral dialogue should take place at the  highest level."    Yitzhaq Rabin said that he expressed profound gratitude to  Boris Yeltsin for the fact that Russia granted its Jewish  citizens the right to emigrate. "In all my meetings," he said,  "I stressed that outbreaks of nationalism, neofascism, and  neonazism can be seen in many countries. A careful watch must  be kept on these processes." The prime minister also noted  Russia's desire to assist in the release of Israeli  prisoners-of-war seized at various times by the Arab side, and  greeted with satisfaction Andrey Kozyrev's statement that Oleg  Soskovets, a first deputy chairman of the Russian Government,  who is visiting Syria, will raise this problem in talks with  Syrian officials.</p>

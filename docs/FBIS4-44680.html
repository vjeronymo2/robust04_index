			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Airbus Working on A300 and A310 </F> Adaptations for Military Transport"]    [Text] Paris--Three partners of the European Airbus  consortium are working to adapt the A300 and A310 wide-body  commercial aircraft for military transport and refueling; they  thus hope to find an outlet for second-hand aircraft and a  market for new replacement aircraft.    Shown last week at the Singapore Aeronautical Show, the MRTT  (Multi-Role Tanker Transport) has a market estimated at 110  units worldwide by the year 2010, according to Aerospatiale--one  of the three project partners with Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) and  British Aerospace (BAe). The fourth consortium member, CASA  [Spanish Aeronautical Engineering Company] does not participate  in the study.    The project promoters hope that the airlines that will sell  some of their old A300 or A310 to be retrofitted for military  purposes will replace them with more recent aircraft, ranging  from the A320 to the A340 and including the A330 twin-jet.    According to Mr. Louis Gallois, the Aerospatiale president,  the MRTT is said to be developed mostly for France and Canada,  which need military transport aircraft. Singapore might  participate in the program if the country is interested in the  MRTT. "But we need a number of orders before we can launch it,"  Mr. Gallois added without mentioning any precise figure.    For the time being, this market segment is dominated by U.S.  aircraft that are about 40 years old: the KC135 (derived from  the Boeing 707) and the KC10 (derived from McDonnell Douglas's  DC10).    The MRTT might be offered in several versions: in-flight  refueling, military transport (up to 270 soldiers), cargo  transport, and all-purpose versions. According to Aerospatiale,  it might be available by the middle of the decade.    This program, however, should not interfere with the FLA  (Future Large Aircraft), the military transport aircraft for  which feasibility studies were started in November by the Airbus  partners and several other groups: the Turkish Tusas, the  Portuguese OGMA, the Belgian Flabel, and the Italian Alenia. "We  do not think that there will be any interference, as the FLA  will be tactical and the MRTT logistic," a project official at  Aerospatiale indicated.</p>

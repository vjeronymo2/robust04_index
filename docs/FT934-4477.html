			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / US and EU close to farm deal: Market-opening accord still under discussion as Gatt deadline nears The US and European Union appeared close to settling longstanding differences on international farm trade last night. However, negotiators fell short of the comprehensive bilateral market-opening deal needed for successful completion of the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation. The farm trade issue has dogged the round since it was launched in 1986. In prospect is a deal providing improved access for US and other farm exporters to Europe's market for grains, meat, dairy products and 'other speciality crops'. Negotiators were also confident of satisfying French demands for amendment of the US-EU Blair House agreement regulating Europe's subsidised farm exports. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said: 'We are talking of an overall agriculture package that not only the EU, but every country in the Community can agree to.' Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, and Mr Kantor talked of 'tangible progress' at the end of 36 hours of intensive negotiation in Brussels. EU foreign ministers last night gave a positive response to Sir Leon's report on his talks with Mr Kantor, but they asked him to provide detail on all the outstanding issues at a second meeting on Monday. Sir Leon said the plan was to reach a comprehensive bilateral deal on Monday and for him to accompany Mr Kantor to Geneva to accelerate agreement between all the other parties. Mr Kantor has returned to Washington for further consultations with President Bill Clinton and the US Congress. Key differences remain over US access to Europe's film and television markets, and on liberalising maritime services. US demands for better protection of its anti-dumping laws under the draft Uruguay Round agreement and its proposed amendments to the deal in financial services and taxation are also being fiercely contested by the EU and many other US trading partners. Sir Leon last night reported on the outcome of the negotiations directly to a special meeting of EU foreign and trade ministers, where it was critically important that he won backing for the commitments already made to the US and the likely compromises that will have to be made. Conscious that time is rapidly running out ahead of the December 15 deadline to complete a deal satisfactory to all 116 countries participating, Sir Leon acknowledged the 'awesome responsibility' of the US and the EU to reach agreement. He said Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, had been kept fully informed on progress. Mr Sutherland is making a statement in Geneva today to a meeting of Gatt negotiators from all 116 countries involved. Market-opening offers from other countries have been held back as the critically important US-EU package has been awaited. 'It is essential for other nations like Japan, the Asians and in Latin America to come forward now with their best efforts,' Mr Kantor said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi, May 21 (YONHAP) -- Vietnamese Foreign  Minister Nguyen Manh Cam vowed Friday to remove obstacles to  foreign investment including that from South Korea.    "It's important that we realized Vietnam has many faults in  its investment laws," Cam said in a press conference with  visiting South Korean reporters. "It's important that we decided  to overcome these obstacles and provide the right conditions to  foreign investors."    Cam said Hanoi, in this connection, is prepared to simplify  entry procedures for foreign visitors.    The foreign minister said Vietamese-South Korean economic  cooperation reflects what is happening all over the world -- the  creation of one giant market in which all countries are  interdependent.    "Moreover, we are located in the same region and share much  in common in culture and history. We have very favorable  conditions for mutually beneficial cooperation," said Cam.    Hanoi can learn from Seoul's experience in economic  development and adapt the lessons to suit Vietnam's own style.  The Vietnamese, in return, will guarantee a solid return for  South Korean businesses in the process, he said.    South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu concluded his  visit to this Southeast Asian capital Friday, meeting Cam and  President Le Duc Ahn. The two countries reaffirmed Seoul's  promise to provide financial aid to Vietnam that will go into  youth job training programs and many infrastructure projects.    On the standoff over North Korea's nuclear program, Cam  advised patience.    "Our principle is that the entire world should be  denuclearized," he said. "No matter how complicated the  situation, one can surely find the right solution through  patience and respect."    Cam declared Hanoi's unflinching commitment to socialism  with  a market economy.    "We made a grave mistake, the mistake of believing that a  market economy can be applied only to capitalist societies. It  was not a mistake that only we made. Other socialist nations  made the same kind of error," he told South Korean reporters.    Macroeconomically, the Vietnamese Government will intervene  to ensure balanced growth, he said. In addition, the government  will guarantee free competition, a market based on the principle  of supply and demand, he said.    He confirmed that Hanoi and Washington will soon exchange  liaison offices, a development that is "an essential aspect in  normalizing bilateral relations."    "There are so many things to be done before complete  normalization. Just how fast they can be completed depends on  efforts by both countries," he said.</p>

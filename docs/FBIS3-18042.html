			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Munich/Nuremberg -- As the new minister for European  affairs, Bavaria's Minister President Edmund Stoiber (Christian  Social Union) wants to urge Bonn to change the Maastricht  timetable and to set a new course for Europe. The "big  structural conference," scheduled for 1996, must be held as soon  as possible, Stoiber stressed in a DPA interview during the  weekend [26 February]. This is the only way incorrect  developments concerning the integration process can be corrected  on a timely basis, he pointed out. Renate Schmidt, chairwoman  of the Bavarian Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD],  however, accused the Christian Social Union [CSU] of  marginalizing Bavaria as far as European policies are concerned.    Stoiber believes that a transfer of power from Brussels to  the national states and laender is urgently required. "We must  exert pressure here." Stoiber has caused a considerable stir in  the past few months with his criticism of the government's  European policies. After the forced resignation of Environment  Minister Peter Gauweiler, he appointed the minister for European  affairs, Thomas Goppel, as Gauweiler's successor, declaring that  he himself will take care of European policies in the future.    In the DPA interview, Stoiber strongly criticized the  financial burden that the European Union represents for Germany.  Thus, at 22 billion German marks, Germany contributed about 70  percent of the balance of net payers in 1992. In view of a  nearly 30 percent contribution to the finances of the European  Union, a return of only 13 percent is not sufficient. Thus, in  the upcoming financial negotiations, Chancellor Helmut Kohl  (Christian Democratic Union) must insist on the agreement  adopted by European Council in 1984.    This decision stipulates that "every member state that  carries too large a budget burden in view of its relative  prosperity may profit from a correction measure at an  appropriate time." This topic was not raised on the occasion of  German reunification so as not to provoke resistance on the part  of the partners, Stoiber stressed. "It must now be put on the  agenda." Stoiber accused the European Council of Ministers of  making decisions "behind closed doors" without sufficient  democratic legitimation.    According to Bavaria's SPD Chairwoman Renate Schmidt,  Bavaria  threatens to be marginalized as far as European policies are  concerned. Instead of vigorously defending the interests of  Bavaria and Germany at the right time, members of the Bavarian  government and leading CSU politicians at the federal level are  misusing the topic to acquire a stronger profile in the election  campaign, Schmidt criticized.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Arts: A cradle for new music - Andrew Clark visits Vienna, home of Europe's largest contemporary music festival It may no longer be a hot-bed of the avant-garde, but Vienna is still home to all that is modern and contemporary in music. That much is confirmed by Wien Modern, founded by Claudio Abbado in 1988 and now the biggest, most popular contemporary music festival in Europe. It is an extraordinary achievement. The festival virtually takes over Vienna's concert life for four weeks, drawing full houses night after night. This year's event was more wide-ranging than the previous five, and no less palatable. Vienna has advantages. As well as being a city of musical entertainment, it has always been a cradle for new music, from Schubert to Schoenberg, and composers still form an important part of the local music establishment. It has two ensembles whose raison d'etre is to interpret modern music: the excellent Klangforum Wien - Vienna's answer to the London Sinfonietta - and the Austrian Radio Symphony Orchestra. And the city government backs Wien Modern to the tune of Sch10m (Pounds 625,000). Such foundations do not guarantee the viability of a large-scale festival; the key seems to be the way Wien Modern sells itself. It builds its programme around four established composers, but leaves room for subsidiary themes. It encourages a youthful audience by spotlighting a younger Austrian composer and offers the complete set of 40 concerts for the all-in price of Sch650 (Pounds 40). It does not restrict itself to the new or avant-garde, but sets these in the context of a postwar retrospective. And it unites the city's two main concert promoters - the Musikverein and the Konzerthaus. No wonder Wien Modern is a success. This year, there were mumblings that four weeks were too long, that some of the visiting ensembles were of indifferent quality. A more sustainable complaint was that Abbado, as artistic director, should be less of a figurehead and more of a participant. He conducted just one short work; more is promised next year. My own impressions left such quibbles in the shade. The four main composers were Bernd Alois Zimmermann, Toru Takemitsu, Krzysztof Penderecki and Erich Urbanner. Zimmermann died a generation ago, but the concerts I heard underlined how advanced his music sounds even today. Takemitsu is virtually unknown in central Europe, so this was a chance for Vienna to catch up. The 60th birthday tribute to Penderecki suggested there may not be such a marked difference between his early and later output as previously thought. The inclusion of Urbanner, born in 1936 and unknown outside Austria, seemed more of a sop to local interests. Zimmermann at his most dynamic, sinewy and down-to-earth was represented by the early Violin Concerto (1949), played with tremendous spirit by Ernst Kovacic. Antiphonen for solo viola and 25 instrumentalists (1961) was at once more absorbing and perplexing, its oblique collage of sound experiments and multilingual texts challenging the imagination but offering little to the heart. It formed the centrepiece of a Klangforum concert conducted by Hans Zender, whose own Furin No Kyo ('Songs about wind and bells') - beautifully vocalised by Julie Moffat - bore the stamp of a Zimmermann clone. Zender should stick to conducting, at which he is expert. Of the younger generation of Austrian composers, the spotlight fell on Georg Haas, whose microtonal Descendiendo was a delicate filter of isolated sounds and sudden, massive climaxes, confidently scored for large orchestra. It is an unmistakable product of the Viennese school, currently dominated by Friedrich Cerha - whose own Langegger Nachtmusik III (1991), conducted by Cerha himself, gobbled up all the resources that the Austrian Radio Symphony Orchestra could muster. Cerha will never be able to free himself from the language of Berg, but Langegger was more uninhibited than anything else of his I have heard. It incorporates some spicy African and Arabic influences, and supplements the main orchestra with an instrumental group in the body of the auditorium - as echo, counterpoint, conversational partner and rival band. Probing the relationship between space and sound is nothing new: from Gabrieli to Gruppen, there are plenty of ground-breaking precedents. But Cerha has offered his own valid contribution. The Docklands Sinfonietta brought Harrison Birtwistle's Three Movements with Fanfares (1965) - a fount of brilliant, tightly-compressed ideas - and Jonathan Harvey's Easter Orisons (1989), a unbroken skein of sound which takes on a momentum of its own and rewards patient listening. In this context, it was hard to take Takemitsu seriously. Nostalghia, a tribute to the late Andrei Tarkovsky, mirrors the slow, funereal world of his film. Tree Line sounded so familiar - so Debussyan - that it is a wonder no-one has accused Takemitsu of plagiarism. Sian Edwards conducted performances of commitment and refinement. Her orchestra's visit was part of a British mini-invasion of Vienna over the past fortnight. Independent of Wien Modern, the Northern Sinfonia gave two guest programmes featuring music by John Casken and Nicholas Maw. A new production of Kenneth MacMillan's Manon has just given the Staatsoper ballet its biggest success of recent seasons. And this weekend Simon Rattle makes his debut with the Vienna Philharmonic.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / BP ruffles the City with an unchanged final dividend MR Robert Horton, chairman of British Petroleum, disappointed the company's shareholders yesterday by declaring an unchanged final dividend for 1991. The move, after weeks of speculation about BP's dividend policy, pushed the share price 10p lower to 274p. The final payment of 4.2p a share brought the 1991 total to 16.8p, a 4.7 per cent increase, which Mr Horton argued was roughly in line with inflation. Some institutional shareholders plan to take up the issue of the company's dividend policy with Mr Horton (pictured above) in coming weeks. Mr Horton said he wanted to 'knock firmly on the head' any suggestion that there was a board split over the dividend decision. There was no division, he said. The unchanged dividend was coupled with results BP called 'extremely disappointing.' Pre-tax profits for the fourth quarter, hit by plunging oil prices, dived on a replacement cost basis from Pounds 456m to Pounds 72m. Full-year profits were Pounds 1.04bn, down 14 per cent from Pounds 1.2bn.

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Canadian bonds top performers in August The Canadian government bond market outperformed the rest of the world's bond markets in August. JP Morgan's government bond index shows Canadian bonds posted a return of 2.78 per cent, measured in local currency, followed by Australia with a gain of 1.51 per cent and the UK with 0.79 per cent. Investors were attracted into the Canadian market 'by favourable inflation figures, 10-year yields above 9 per cent, and real yields that are among the highest available in the bond markets', JP Morgan says. The core European markets of Germany and France gained at the expense of the higher-yielding markets of Italy, Spain and Sweden. Interest rate rises in Italy and Sweden were seen by investors as 'portents to rate rises by other continental European central banks', triggering losses across European markets. Sweden, which saw a return of minus 0.93 per cent on the month, also suffered from investor concern over heightening political tensions ahead of the general election. The worst performer in August was the Danish government bond market, with a return of minus 2.76 per cent in local currency. The average rate of return across all countries was minus 0.46 per cent. The UK gilt market was boosted by economic data which pointed to low inflation, 'banishing fears of an early rise in interest rates'. US Treasuries posted a gain of 0.13 per cent in August, with unhedged dollar-based investors benefiting from the dollar's recent decline.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: Western Union banks on a rapid transfer - The movement of cash is expanding in emerging economies For generations of Americans, Western Union means money in a hurry, especially to the 25 per cent of the US population without a bank account. The company, now owned by New Valley Corporation, enjoys a 90 per cent share of the US market for rapid cash transfers. Many of America's unbanked, mainly lower paid or irregular workers, are immigrants for whom low hassle cash transfer provides the basic service they most want - a fast, sure way of transferring cash to the family back home. Five years ago the growth in demand for cash transfers from the US to Mexico, Puerto Rico and other countries with large migrant populations alerted the company to the wider potential in servicing ethnic communities around the world. Starting with Central America the company has rapidly expanded operations to the rest of Latin America, the Far East, Africa and the Middle East, so adding a new dimension to its traditional overseas operations - providing emergency cash transfers to tourists and others, including US military personnel, businessmen and students. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the re-integration of the former communist states into the global economy, provided another opportunity to expand operations and acquire the capacity to transfer funds globally. The company now operates in eight of the former Soviet republics and all three Baltic states. This week it added Slovenia and Hungary, bringing to 75 the number of countries served by Western Union Financial Services International (WUFSI), a subsidiary set up up four years ago to develop the company's overseas interests. International operations are both fast-growing and profitable. Last year the company handled over 18m individual transfers involving more than Dollars 5bn. Operating profits rose to Dollars 101m from Dollars 90m on revenues of Dollars 438m up from Dollars 401m. This year turnover is expected to exceed Dollars 500m. In London for a board meeting last week Mr Paul Vornle, president of WUFSI, said the company intended to be operational in 100 countries by the end of this year. It is negotiating to open up in potentially the biggest market of all, the unbanked millions of far-flung China plus the flow of remittances from the many millions of overseas Chinese. The numbers involved in these ethnic niche markets, can be substantial, like the near 4m Filipinos in the US or the 300,000 Albanian 'boat people' who fled as penniless refugees from the collapsing communist dictatorship in 1991 but last year sent Dollars 330m back to relatives. Millions of overseas Indians, including the discreet and wealthy Indian population in South Africa, as well as the UK, the US and Africa have also become an important target market as Western Union goes global. But, as the company's recent rapid growth in Europe testifies, there is still plenty of scope for growth even in relatively sophisticated markets. 'A recent European Commission study on the European banking system strongly criticised the cost and inefficiency of money transfers through the banking system. We pay out within minutes of funds being placed with us. It can't get lost. Each transaction is separate and the cash can only be in two places - either with Western Union or in the hands of the client,' says Mr Vornle. 'We do not transfer money, just information,' he adds. The simplicity of the transaction - a sender deposits cash at one of 24,000 money transfer locations worldwide for a recipient to pick up in local currency and with the minimum of form-filling - requires as many branches as possible which can be relied upon to keep sufficient sums of cash on hand and remain open for as long as possible. The company has set up its black and yellow nameplate in supermarkets, street-corner stores, military bases, student unions and other sites accessible to long-distance workers as the inevitable annual crop of tourists who lose their wallets or need immediate cash from home for any number of different reasons. It also works closely with credit card companies which are fast extending their operations to former unbanked areas such as the former Soviet bloc. Visa, for example, which has worked with Western Union for 15 years, has introduced its credit cards to Latvia, Belarus, Estonia and Uzbekistan over the past month alone. In Russia, virtually unbanked five years ago, apart from thousands of primitive savings bank branches, WUFSI chose Mezheconomsberbank, the Moscow-based International joint Stock Bank of Savings Banks, as its joint venture partner two years ago. 'The bank has 47 locations all over the former Soviet Union at which it is possible to transfer and receive cash, and this will be up to 100 by the end of the year,' says Mr Vladimir Kolbaev, chairman of the bank, which has the savings banks from 13 former Soviet republics and nine of the biggest Russian commercial banks among its shareholders. 'We started working with Western Union in 1991 because we believed we could do profitable business if it was well organised, and so it proved,' Mr Kolbaev says. 'We not only transfer funds into Russia but also transfer substantial amounts of roubles abroad for commercial companies as well as individuals,' he adds. Funds transferred in this way make up only a small part of the Dollars 15bn to Dollars 20bn annually which left Russia clandestinely over the past two years. But with so much Russian money now in Russian-owned accounts in western banks, and with most Russian banks enjoying an unenviable reputation for losing and misplacing funds, the scope for money transfers through the Western Union system is expanding fast. To ensure that its fast cash, few questions asked facilities do not attract money-launderers, Western Union keeps a small army of former secret service agents on the payroll - and US transfers have to abide by the general rule that all cash transactions over Dollars 10,000 have to be notified to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>

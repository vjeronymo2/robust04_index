			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Restructured Symonds halves loss to Pounds 126,000 Improved profit margins and cost reductions arising from restructuring helped Symonds Engineering, the Cheshunt-based precision engineer, to halve pre-tax losses from Pounds 256,000 to Pounds 126,000 in the six months to September 30. Turnover fell from Pounds 2.31m to Pounds 2.09m as a result of reducing the number of low margin contracts. Losses per share were down from 1.93p to 1.27p. Mr Rod Ackrill, chairman, said he was confident the company would shortly return to profitability. Since March, the workforce had been reduced by about 25 per cent to 155. Improved systems and procedures had been introduced by appointing a financial controller, together with a sales manager to expand the existing business customer base. There is no interim dividend - last year's distribution was 0.15p but no final was paid.</p>

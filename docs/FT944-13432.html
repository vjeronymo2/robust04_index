			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Pennzoil to pay Dollars 454m extra tax on settlement Pennzoil said it had reached agreement with the US authorities to pay Dollars 454m in additional taxes on a Dollars 3bn settlement it received from rival US energy group Texaco six years ago. The amount is less than half the Dollars 957m tax assessment by the Internal Revenue Service earlier this year. The taxes stem from the settlement of a dispute between Pennzoil and Texaco over the latter's takeover of Getty Oil in 1986. The acquisition thwarted a deal that had already been agreed between Pennzoil and Getty. A Texas jury initially awarded Pennzoil Dollars 10.3bn in damages, forcing Texaco to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Energy tax move by EC ministers EUROPEAN Community finance ministers yesterday reserved the right to make the final decision on whether to introduce the controversial energy tax proposed by Brussels to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions. Their proprietorial move came as the current Danish presidency of the EC confirmed it was calling a special meeting of environment and energy ministers on April 23 to try to break the logjam on the tax and the EC's overall emissions strategy. There are still serious reservations among the Twelve about how the tax  - which would rise to the equivalent of Dollars 10 a barrel of oil by 2000 - would work. But introducing it at all has been made conditional on the EC's main trading partners following suit. The finance ministers yesterday said they were encouraged by the recent US proposal to introduce a fuel tax, but emphasised it was still not clear what was planned by the EC's other main competitors, such as Japan. Denmark is nevertheless still hoping a decision can be reached at June's meeting of finance ministers.</p>

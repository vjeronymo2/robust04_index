			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ryszard Bugaj, chairman of Union of Labor, </F> by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on  the "Guest of Radio Zet" program--live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Woyciechowski] Let us go  back for a moment to the political nature of these strikes. Do  you think the political nature of the strikes is associated with  the coming presidential election, or is it perhaps still too  early?    [Bugaj] You know, I do not think so. At any rate, I think  that, so far, the president has been acting with some restraint.  I have had the opportunity in the past to voice views in this  very studio that were critical of the president, but, regarding  this conflict, I must say he has been demonstrating restraint....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Will you vote for Walesa in  the presidential election?    [Bugaj] I do not think so. I hope there will be a  countercandidate for whom I could vote....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And what kind of candidate  would it have to be? Let us not give specific names.    [Bugaj] You know, I would put it this way--and you are right  about not mentioning any names. Whether he would be someone of  left-wing or right-wing views--that is rather irrelevant to me,  or at least I see that as a secondary issue. But, of course, I  would like him to be someone who respects the Constitution very  much, who is capable of resolving situations relevant to the  president, and who is capable of being an umpire and of enjoying  strong authority. But I must say I would prefer this person not  to have very strong views because it might happen that he will  have to cooperate with very different types of government, of a  very different nature, with very different [words indistinct]    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Do you know of such a person?  Is there anyone like that in Poland?    [Bugaj] You know, I know an enormous number of such people,  indeed, but the problem is that none of those figures are  distinguished or outstanding enough to be able to take up the  post without problems. I think there are such people in the  Freedom Union [UW], and perhaps I could find them in our party,  too. I would not hesitate to say there are also such people at  the very right-wing end of the political scene. I think the  most important matter is that we shape the Constitution in a way  that would prevent the presidency from becoming something like  the chief executive office, or something of that nature  because....    [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And can I ask you to give a  name now?    [Bugaj] You know, what I think is that, for instance, when  it comes to the UW, both Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Jacek Kuron are  the kinds of people who fulfill my criteria, and when it comes  to our circles, both Karol Modzelewski and, for instance,  Aleksander Malachowski fulfill the criteria. Which does not  mean that they want or are able to run--that is a separate  issue. [passage omitted]</p>

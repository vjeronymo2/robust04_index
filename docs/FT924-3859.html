			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Independence is best guarantee of trust - A look at the AITC's swift response to the Cadbury report INVESTMENT trusts, despite their ultra-respectable outward appearance, have often been involved in scandal, with examples dating back to the 1929 Wall Street crash and including the empire of Sir Denys Lowson in the 1960s. More recently, there was the affair of First Tokyo Investment Trust, part of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's empire, where Pounds 37.6m of the trust's Pounds 44.8m of assets were lent on the basis of verbal agreements, without a board resolu-tion. The incestuous nature of some investment trust empires, with families of trusts owning crossholdings in each other and in their management groups, creates opportunities for abuse. So it is not surprising that the Association of Investment Trust Companies was quick off the mark yesterday in publishing guidelines for the sector in the wake of the Cadbury report on corporate governance earlier this week. The AITC guidelines start from the proposition that an independent board is the best guarantee of good practice. 'Shareholders' interests are, of course, paramount', says Mr Paul Manduca, chairman of the Association. 'Our guidelines ensure that the board will always put shareholders' interests first and that a majority of the board is independent of the management house and of other interested parties.' Indeed, this principle may soon become a listing requirement. As part of its present review of the Yellow Book, the Stock Exchange is proposing the introduction of the following condition for investment companies. 'The board of directors (or equivalent) body of the investment company must be able to demonstrate that it will act independently of any fund managers to the investment company and that a majority are also independent of any fund manager.' And independence may need to be rigorously defined. The AITC guidelines state: 'The condition of independence cannot be fully satisfied where a director is an employee or former employee of the manager or a professional adviser to the manager or is in any way remunerated by the manager.' One issue which has brought the independence of trust boards into question is the tendency to 'brand' a range of trusts with the manager's name. Some trusts were founded in the late 19th or early 20th centuries and were given names relating to particular individuals or groups. Such names no longer bear any relation to the investment policy of the trust concerned. Outside investors may be confused as to the real nature of the trust, and ignore it as an investment option. This is a disadvantage in a competitive savings market. Branding a range of trusts gives them an identity and allows investors to see what type of investment beast they are buying; whether it is a high income or European for example. But does branding create a strong incentive for boards to retain their existing investment manager, rather than face the inconvenience, and possible loss of investor recognition, involved in a name change? The AITC does not believe branding is a problem, provided the majority of the board is independent. 'We believe that branding can strengthen, rather than weaken, the board's position, since the independent board of a branded trust has a very powerful weapon to exact an improvement in service and commitment from unsatisfactory managers, while retaining the ultimate freedom to change managers.' The Association also suggests that each trust should establish an audit committee which would: receive a report from the management each year confirming that the management company has conducted the company's affairs in compliance with the regulations receive an annual report from the company's auditors and have the opportunity to question auditors without management present review the company's investments, paying particular attention to the valuation of unquoted holdings. A management engagement committee, which could be the same as the audit committee, should also be established to review the terms of the management contract 'to ensure that they are competitive and sensible for shareholders'. But there is no guarantee that proposals will ensure the security of shareholders in the sector. There is still the prospect of losses through investment mistakes. And the AITC is just a voluntary body with no sanction over its members. Indeed many trusts are not members of the Association. However, trusts will have to indicate to shareholders in their accounts when they do not comply with the Cadbury report. According to Mr Hamish Buchan, an investment trust analyst at County NatWest WoodMac, 'these things are all good news and definitely a step in the right direction. But shareholders should still be prepared to look out for their own interests.'</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Protecting pay in low-cost countries Sir, I was glad to see Samuel Brittan ended his Economic Viewpoint (January 6) on the implications of free trade for labour markets of industrialised countries by calling for more research on pay trends in developing and former communist countries. Factor price equalisation in the labour market can, in theory, be achieved by wage increases in the non-OECD world as well as by cuts in the industrialised countries. Indeed, it is in the global public interest for workers' wages in low-cost exporting countries to rise as productivity increases, thus boosting consumer demand and staving off the spectre of Marxist immiseration (growing poverty) of the proletariat. The problem is that many employers do not volunteer pay rises and unions cannot bargain effectively because of repressive laws and intimidation. Surely, the best way to avoid the destabilising tensions inherent in low pay relative to productivity in developing and former communist countries is to link trade liberalisation to the observance of minimum labour standards, including the right to organise a union.

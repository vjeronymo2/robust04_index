			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: Nat'l Semi improves to Dollars 14.5m NATIONAL Semiconductor reported sharply higher earnings for its third quarter, ended February 23, helped by a pre-tax gain of Dollars 8.5m from patent licensing fees. The US company reported net earnings of Dollars 14.5m, or 11 cents per share, against net earnings of Dollars 5m, or 2 cents, in the same quarter a year ago which included a restructuring credit of Dollars 21.1m from the sale of a production facility. Sales for the quarter were Dollars 401.8m, up from Dollars 386.8m last year. 'We have achieved our announced goal of improving operating profit by reducing the break-even point to below Dollars 400m per quarter by the third quarter,' said Mr Gilbert Amelio, National Semiconductor president and chief executive. 'Profits from operations improved over the previous quarter and the comparable quarter a year ago, even though the third quarter traditionally shows the greatest seasonal weakness each year.' For the nine months, National Semiconductor reported a net loss of Dollars 147.6m or Dollars 1.49, including a first-quarter restructuring charge of Dollars 149.3m in connection with its plans to consolidate worldwide manufacturing operations. Last year, the group recorded a net loss of Dollars 157m or Dollars 1.59. The 1991 results also included a restructuring charge of Dollars 120.1m. Sales for the first nine months were Dollars 1.23bn, down slightly from Dollars 1.26bn last time. During the third quarter National Semiconductor announced a Dollars 120m expansion of its Arlington, Texas, manufacturing facility. 'This is our first focused major investment in accordance with our restructuring plan,' Mr Amelio said. National Semiconductor remains cautious about the current quarter.</p>

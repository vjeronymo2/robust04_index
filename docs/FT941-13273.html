			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: MCI in Mexican joint venture with Banacci MCI Communications, the innovative US long-distance telecommunications group, and Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival (Banacci), Mexico's largest financial group, joined forces yesterday to compete in the Mexican long-distance market, which is being thrown open to new entrants from August 1996. They announced the establishment of a joint venture, owned 55 per cent by Banacci and 45 per cent by MCI, to compete against the national carrier, Telmex. Initially capitalised at Dollars 1bn, the venture will apply for a Mexican long distance licence and build a state of the art fibre-optic telecommunications network. Banamex, a subsidiary of Banacci and Mexico's largest commercial bank, already provides private telecommunications services to Mexican businesses, using its own communications network. MCI, in which British Telecom is buying a 20 per cent stake, has played the leading role in opening up the US long-distance market to competition over the past 20 years. Earlier this month it announced plans to compete in the monopolistic local US market and extend its long-distance reach under a new brand name, networkMCI. MCI said the Banacci deal was a key international element in the networkMCI scheme and would allow the company to complete the first integrated North American network, providing services with identical features to customers throughout the region. In 1992 MCI formed an alliance with Stentor, the long-distance arm of Canadian regional phone companies, which uses MCI's intelligent network for services between the US and Canada. The Mexican long-distance telecommunications market is growing quickly, thanks to rapid economic development and the boost to commerce from last year's North American Free Trade Agreement. MCI estimates that the country's international long-distance market is growing at more than 20 per cent a year, that 40 per cent of all its long-distance traffic is international, and that 90 per of Mexican international calls go to the US or Canada.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (22): Disputes delay securities law - Local and foreign stockbrokers want one authority to admininster a single set of rules This time last year China's securities market regulators and participants were looking forward with confidence to the nation's first securities law, a law that would bring market supervision, licensing and regulation under one authority. Today, summing up the situation, one regulator described his position as 'dismayed and ineffective.' China's attempts to emulate the West in devising a regulatory framework for its rapidly growing securities markets appear to have fallen foul of bureaucratic politics in Beijing. The problems which policymakers in Beijing have met in producing a unified securities law are emblematic of decision-making in modern China. To some observers the process is an endless series of behind-the-scenes horse trading as interest groups in the bureaucracy jockey for preferment and position. The outcome is often a second-best solution to the problem. The local and foreign stock broking community in Shanghai - the financial centre on the mainland of China - is almost completely agreed on the need for a coherent set of rules, administered by a single institution, by which to operate. Mr Huang Guexian, a director of Shenyin Securities, the biggest broker in Shanghai, says the securities industry in China is in urgent need of an all-encompassing securities law. 'If companies from other provinces want to list here we can only regulate them using Shanghai regulations,' he says. 'We are in urgent need of such a law. The market also wants a unified power. If every province goes its own way, you get a contradiction in regulation. You can set up a branch of the regulator in Shanghai who represents the power.' Shanghai's small but growing group of western investment bankers share Mr Huang's views. Mr John Crossman, general manager or Jardine Fleming in Shanghai, says that what the market has hoped and argued for is a regulator in Beijing based on the model of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US - 'we've been telling them: 'Give us an SEC, tell us what the ground rules are and enforce them for all.' 'I suspect we are not going to see a securities law for some time,' he adds. Not all, however, agree that changes to the proposed law will be bad. Mr Huang Jun, head of institutional sales at Shanghai International Securities, says: 'You just can't put a US system here. It needs substantial changes. The delay in the securities law is to make the law more acceptable to local conditions.' The failure by Beijing to produce a securities law - it was due out this summer - appears to be the result of bruising contest between the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and a number of powerful institutions, such as the People's Bank and the Ministry of Finance, which are loath to yield power to the CSRC, an institution less than two years old. The battlefield for this contest has been in the standing committee of the National People's Congress - China's parliament - in whose name national laws are promulgated. The participants have been the economic and finance sub-committee of the NPC - with support from the CSRC's - and the legal work committee. Both committees produced conflicting versions of a securities law and have been unable to reconcile those differences. The exact details of where the two proposed bills disagree is not known. A key difference is believed to be the authority conferred upon the CSRC. Under the economic and finance committee's law the commission was to be the sole regulator. The draft prepared by the legal work committee is believed to have left the issue of which institution has regulatory power vague. 'The legal work committee wants to leave it fuzzy,' says one knowledgeable observer. 'So regulatory power will be divided between the State Council, Ministry of Finance, the central bank, CSRC . . . everyone. 'They said they didn't want to make it clear because no-one wants to make it clear.' Observers in Shanghai also say that the delay in the publication of the law reflects a certain hesitancy by the authorities. Western brokers say that it has been difficult for the Chinese authorities to come to grips with what a securities market is and how it can work for the benefit of China. 'They are trying to regulate what should happen, rather than describe a framework in which a market can work,' one broker observes. 'I think they have become confused and don't know what to do with the securities law; they don't want to make a mistake.' Mr Richard Graham, chief representative of Baring, the UK investment bank, detects a change in policy that appears to be political - 'there was a definite change from the Party Congress (in 1992) to this year's National People's Congress typified by the change in language from 'reform' to 'stability',' he observes. This, he claims, led to a change in the central banking law, which drew back from allowing banks the freedom to set interest rates and reserved that power for the People's Bank. The securities law is a victim of the same thinking. 'The law was going to confirm the CSRC as the regulator of the securities industry but the People's Bank put its foot down; it wants to control the listing of companies and the supervision of the stock exchanges,' he said. The bureaucratic infighting about the securities law has raised fears that it may end up with similar deficiencies to those from which China's newly promulgated company law suffers. The company law came into effect on July 1 and is ambiguous as to the precedence of national over provincial law, especially in the area of securities. This leaves vague the position of Shanghai and Shenzhen regulations in relation to the national law. Moreover, the law lacks adequate provisions for the overseas listing of mainland companies; it fails to specify the maximum proportion of a company which any individual may own (as did previous regulations); or, what constitutes a quorum at an annual general meeting of a company. In short it is weak in adequately defining ownership. In the particularly harsh judgment of one local observer, the company law as drafted is 'incongruent with the principle and practice of company law.' In the view of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, 'the transition from the old to the new system envisaged under the company law will certainly be marked by confusion and may take years to accomplish.' The new securities law may not have been able to rectify the errors in the company law - some of which will be the subject of 21 supplementary regulations currently being drafted - but officials and investment bankers had hoped the law would have coherence. It is not now clear if those hopes are well-founded.</p>

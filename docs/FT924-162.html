			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Bargain hunting One day of traffic jams as bargain hunters head for the sales may not make a retailing summer, but there is at least the hint of spring in the air for UK stores. Consumer confidence may be starting to revive now that the shambles of sterling's exit from the ERM is a fading memory. Spending will also rise a little in 1993 once the effect of lower mortgage rates feeds through. And as retailers currently hold small stocks, the uptick may feed back down the chain if the January sales go well. Yet it would be wrong to get carried away by the enthusiasm. With house prices still weak and wage settlements low, consumers will not feel much richer next year. The high savings rate indicates that individuals are still reluctant to borrow, so any modest increase in consumer spending is unlikely to exceed the rise in disposable incomes. Even suggestions of a rise in housing turnover will take quite some time to translate into sales of carpets and curtains. In any event, retailing shares have already discounted a recovery. Given the sector's rating, stores will need more good news to push much higher. The defensive qualities which supported the likes of Marks and Spencer and Boots through the recession will also limit their progress into the upturn. There are some recovery prospects, particularly among groups whose young adult customers were hit by high interest rates, but only those with strong management and a well-focused business are likely to benefit.</p>

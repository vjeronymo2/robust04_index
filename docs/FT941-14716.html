			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Arts: A trip down Quantity Street - Television Still they come, the new series for the 1994 new year season. In the whole history of British television - scarcely a half century, admittedly - there cannot ever have been so many series launched in such a short period. Television is still expanding, and even though none of the programmes mentioned here today was provided by a cable or satellite company (apart from news and sport the amount of original material coming from these new sources is virtually nil, which may explain why their share of total viewing is still only 6.5 per cent across the nation as a whole) the development of cable and satellite has nevertheless intensified the competition among terrestrial broadcasters. So has the government's tough attitude towards the BBC and its insistence that ITV be run like a whelk stall. The result, even if you leave aside such trivia as game shows and soap operas, is a cascade of new programmes so intense that it makes logistical problems for a column such as this. In the past two weeks in this space I have reviewed, however briefly, the drama series Broadway Stories, Smokescreen, A Dark Adapted Eye, The New Adventures Of Superman and 99-1; the comedies Health And Efficiency and Comic Asides - The High Life; the factual series Art Of Conducting, Auction and Nomads Of The Wind; and Jonathan Meades' brilliant but uncategorisable Further Abroad. Still queueing for review are the following series, none of them fresh batches of old titles, all of them genuinely brand new: Family Watch presented by the oleaginous Robert Kilroy-Silk. Network First which ITV is putting in place of such memorable documentary series as First Tuesday and Viewpoint. An American comedy called Flying Blind which contained in the opening episode the lines 'That's my idea, a communion wafer with a sort of toffee flavour' and 'You mean that my ability to delay my orgasm for two hours counts for nothing?' Try it tonight at 12.10 on C4. Scotland Yard, a documentary series indistinguishable from the last six about the police. Just A Minute which may be enjoyed by those who liked it on radio, though perhaps not. The Great British Garden Show which is equally concerned with flower and vegetable shows and gardening. A bizarre American conjuring series called The Unpleasant World Of Penn And Teller. A series on Scottish arts called The Bigger Picture presented by Billy Connolly. John Mortimer's drama series set in a London auction house, Under The Hammer. All Quiet On The Preston Front, a drama series about the Territorial Army. A Channel 4 documentary series about police in Pakistan, Karachi Kops. A BBC1 current affairs series with the unnecessarily pessimistic title Living With The Enemy about parents and teenage children. Another BBC1 drama series, this time featuring management recruitment: Headhunters. A half-hour magazine programme which attempts to handle complex concepts such as Big Bang theory in a popular manner, probably doomed: Big Science. Yet another transfer from BBC Radio, Fantasy Football League, in which 'celebrities' act as managers and 'buy' soccer players, gaining points according to what these players do in real life: narcoleptically boring except to football's version of train spotters. A drama series called NYPD Blue which has the most explicit sex scenes to emerge from American television, and A slow, underpowered and old fashioned comedy vehicle for Penelope Keith, Law And Disorder, in which she plays a barrister. Then of course there is the BBC2 drama, set in a small town in the 19th century, in which everyone gallops around on horses though the railroad is coming: the locomotive steams to the end of the line to deliver the sleepers for the next bit. The town is riven by factions made up of the banker and his cronies, landowners, and a young doctor with modern ideas who has just ridden in from the east. The women, who wear bonnets and bustles and ride side-saddle, are treated as mindless little things waiting for a handsome stranger to arrive on the stagecoach, and the men congregate in the saloon to gamble and drink. Not the wild west, of course, but Middlemarch. The parallels are not merely coincidental. Americans have used the western as a means of considering their national heritage, social structures, political difficulties, sexual mores, and collective ambitions. Judging from the opening episode of this adaptation by Andrew Davies, Middlemarch will prove to have many of the same concerns. It looks wonderful: from the heath scene in the opening shot which was worthy of Constable, to the honeymoon scenes in Rome, from the costumes to the hospital interiors, this is the BBC at its most painstaking and authentic. Some of the country's best actors - Michael Hordern, Patrick Malahide, Elizabeth Spriggs - are as good as you would expect, and the unknowns - especially Juliet Aubrey as Dorothea - are better than we are entitled to expect and will not be unknown for long. Davies, whose position as top drama adaptor on British television is currently unassailable, has managed to make it sound as though Eliot wrote the dialogue for television. This is, in other words, a splendid example of what we are always being told the BBC ought to be doing. And yet . . . in the past Davies has created his own series such as A Very Peculiar Practice, and if ever it came to a choice between another adaptation from 19th century literature and a Davies original I would not need to ponder a second before opting for the Davies. The list above is not even exhaustive, so we can hardly complain about the amount of new material we are being offered; probably no audience anywhere has ever been offered more. Yet we can and should protest about the type of material. Staying with drama as our example, there is a bleak absence of passion, personal communication, and vision. However high the production values in Under The Hammer, All Quiet On The Preston Front, 99-1, Headhunters and NYPD Blue - and they are mostly very high indeed - these are all clearly formula works which have been created to win ratings. Though there was certainly pleasure in watching this week's yarn in Under The Hammer, about a puritanical wife who chucked the nude-adorned silver salt into the lake in Cromwell's time and today's killjoy wife who followed with the Petrus '61 (all topped off by John Wells' cosy little cameo as the obit vulture) you could never mistake it for something that Mortimer felt he had to write . . . unless of course his accountant insisted. Similarly with NYPD Blue, and the story of the ageing cop with an obsession and a dangerously regular date with a prostitute, there was never any sense that creator Steve Bochco had any purpose more serious than repeating the success of his previous series, Hill Street Blues. It is slick and watchable and passes an hour effortlessly, but it has no challenge to make, nothing fresh to say, no determination to engage with the viewer. As for Headhunters and All Quiet On The Preston Front, they look as though they could have been made to fulfil quotas. We have had dramas built around oil men, bankers, psychologists (and of course policemen; 99-1 is yet another police series which, contrary to the impression conveyed by Episode 1, appears now to be simply more of the same old crime guff) and somebody at the BBC must have flicked through a careers book and realised there had never been a series about headhunters. Unfortunately the most interesting aspect of the opening episode was Francesca Annis's accent which swung alarmingly from French to American and back. Drama series about life in the Army and the RAF have also appeared in the last couple of years, so the Territorial Army hardly comes as a surprise. But All Quiet On The Preston Front is another series which shows no indication of a desire to do more than attract good ratings. More television may be better than less if it means more choice, but in this new age of market driven broadcasting it seems ominously clear that the increase in quantity is going to be at the cost of quality.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (1): Climate changes for industry - The Marxist government is wooing foreign investment amid clear signs of industrial revival in the state A sense of quiet optimism pervades West Bengal's business community. After a quarter of a century of decline, the state's industrial revival seems very much on the cards. In Calcutta, the eastern seaport which is the natural gateway to emerging Asian nations, there is a strong campaign to revive some of the region's lost glory as India's prime industrial heartland. Two and a half years ago, when the Indian government embarked on its economic reforms programme, it seemed unlikely that West Bengal, plagued by power cuts, dead telephone lines and a declining economy, could compete with other states to benefit from the opening up of India's economy. Today, industry leaders are confident that West Bengal, with its strategic location, skilled manpower and wealth of natural resources, will recreate the industrial climate that was allowed to wither in the late 1960s. There is reason for the optimism. After a period of stagnation, when virtually no new investment was made in the state, over 258 projects involving foreign investment of Rs55.9bn had been cleared by the government up to September 1993. The Marxist state government is actively wooing foreign investment. There has been a dramatic improvement in power supplies - West Bengal already has a surplus, and new power projects are being commissioned. Telecommunications have been modernised, and telephones actually work. Last month, businessmen, who were forced to travel to Delhi or Bombay for international flight connections, rejoiced when British Airways and KLM resumed operations to Calcutta. The first signs of an industrial revival came in 1990, with the country's two largest private sector groups - the Tatas and Reliance Industries - investing Rs30bn and Rs3.9bn respectively in a new petrochemicals complex at Haldia and a plastics factory. The Reliance project has yet to materialise, but the interest shown by the two big houses was enough to put Calcutta firmly back on the country's industrial map. The government has claimed that the setting up of a new industrial belt at Haldia, south of Calcutta, could create 150,000 jobs, but work on the Haldia project has been slow in starting. Other large projects include a Rs7.5bn pig iron plant proposed by the Birlas, a leading Calcutta business group, Tata Iron and Steel's pig iron plant which is nearing completion in Kharagpur, and telecom- munications and electronic projects by Siemens and Philips respectively. According to the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, industrial investment in West Bengal, which averaged 9 per cent growth a year until the mid-1960s, was falling by 0.5 per cent a year by 1985. The resource-rich region once accounted for over 80 per cent of the country's industry but its virtual monopoly did not survive Independence. Other parts of the country were not obliged to deal with the problems of over-manning which new technology exposed in West Bengal's industries. Management controls deteriorated and several companies closed when British and other overseas-owned companies were forced to reduce their stakes by the socialist government in Delhi. The political instability brought about by the ultra-left Naxalite movement in the late 1960s accentuated the problem for a while. West Bengal's decline had begun and little was done to arrest the damage for over 25 years, 16 of them under Marxist rule. 'The flight of top management, more than the flight of capital, contributed to Calcutta's slide,' says Mr Mumtaz Ahmad, past president of the Bengal Chamber. Companies such as Bata, Britannia Biscuits, Brooke Bond and Lipton moved away from Calcutta. Even though ITC, an associate of BAT Industries, stayed, it invested in other Indian states. Meanwhile, the national government exercised strict control over new investments so that it could often influence business houses to set up in the part of the country it favoured. 'All that has changed now,' says Mr Ahmad. 'In terms of infrastructure, natural resources like coal, plentiful water and power, and the disciplined attitude of labour, we are all set to compete, industry-wise and state-wise. 'The new investor to India will take the path of least resistance, and the state government has now realised that unless we woo him, he will go elsewhere,' says Mr Ahmad, a member of a West Bengal government committee on infrastructure improvement, who was largely responsible for British Airways' return to Calcutta. 'India was opening up, and Mr Basu's government realised that if it didn't fall into line, it would be left behind.' Indeed, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) government with Mr Jyoti Basu at the helm, sees no contradiction between its traditional ideology and the encouragement of a free market economy. He once explained the reason for 'the change of climate' in the state, saying: 'We criticised capitalism, but the capitalism we criticised, no longer exists. Capitalism has changed, and we have to change.' Addressing potential investors in London in September last year, Mr Basu admitted that his government had turned its immediate attention to agriculture 'with a special emphasis on land reform for restructuring retrograde agrarian relations.' The West Bengal government has established a successful local self-government system, or 'panchayats' at the village level, to allow peasants exploited by feudal land acts to enhance their dignity, and thus their productivity. Almost 50 per cent of the state's plan allocation has been channelled to this decentralisation process, and as a result food output is growing at about 5 per cent a year, one of the highest rates in India. Better living conditions in the villages have reduced migration to the cities, though the influx from neighbouring states Bihar and Orissa, and from Bangladesh have put a strain on West Bengal's already overstretched urban resources. Mr Basu believes that agriculture can now serve as a springboard for industry in the state. The chief minister, who many people say is single-handedly steering reform in the state, is keen to develop food processing to augment traditional agro-based industries such as tea and jute. The development of an electronics industry could, in turn, complement the traditional steel and engineering industries. The potential of export-led, labour-intensive industries has appealed to Mr Basu, who is hard-pressed to solve the state's high unemployment. The example of neighbouring Bangladesh as a leading garment exporter is tempting to follow: the chief minister once remarked that Calcutta had a lot of tailors, but virtually no garment industry. For the new investor, West Bengal has very real advantages over other Indian regions. The state is rich in mineral wealth - coal, graphite, china clay, granite and other precious minerals. It has a highly diversified agricultural base, and its climate and soil are perfect for horticulture. Technical personnel and skilled manpower are easily available, and the financial services and banking sectors are well-developed. But many disadvantages have still to be surmounted: an inadequate seaport, a capital city bursting at the seams and virtually no development of satellite townships around Calcutta, or any infrastructure to talk of in the state's hinterland. At Writers Building, the state's seat of power, bureaucracy is rife, with most ministers sitting on mountains of unattended paperwork. 'Change takes time to permeate,' says Mr Pradeep Das Gupta, secretary of the Bengal Chamber. 'The government has been late in announcing a new industrial development policy, and the sooner this is done, the better. But it is clear that the government means business, and is thinking of an aggressive marketing approach to sell West Bengal to foreign investors.' Mr Krishan Lal Chugh, chairman of ITC, one of the few multinational companies with roots firmly entrenched in Calcutta, believes the 'much-maligned city' can become a showpiece for the rest of India. He points out that 'power cuts have been banished to Delhi,' and that Calcutta, with its reasonable rents and stylish clubs is 'the cheapest Indian city for executives to live in today.' The labour climate has improved, and the quality of skilled workers and management-level executives is still the best in the country. 'Bengal should sell,' says Mr Chugh resolutely.</p>

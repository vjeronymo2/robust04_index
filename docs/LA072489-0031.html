His Canadian team squeaked by their rivals from the United  States, 13-12, in a celebrity game for charity, and Mulroney, at first base,  was named player of the game. Security was heavy but the prime minister joked  that there were no police around him because "they're not good enough to make  this cut . . . this is the big league." Among those on the losing side were Los  Angeles Kings hockey standout Wayne Gretzky, his wife, actress Janet Jones, and  actors Gene Hackman and Richard Dean Anderson. Also in the game were former  hockey star Gordie Howe and actresses Catherine Mary Stewart and JoBeth  Williams. Wheelchair athlete Rick Hansen, playing for Canada, got the only  standing ovation when the teams were announced. Musician-producer David Foster,  who organized the game, said it raised as much as 250,000 Canadian dollars to  help families of children who need organ transplants.  </P> <P>  -- More than 900 fans spent the weekend at the third annual Three Stooges  convention in Trevose, Pa., competing in a Curly sound-alike contest, nyuking  along with the trio's filmed comedies and bidding on Stooge memorabilia.

"Everybody's been a Stooge at one time in  life and can relate to it," Phyllis Reighter said. She and her husband, Frank,  organized the convention with the head of the national Stooges fan club, Gary  Lassin. Phyllis Reighter said that Sally Starr, who appeared in the Stooge film  "The Outlaws Is Coming," was at the conference.  </P> <P>  -- Buck Owens, Tanya Tucker, Anne Murray and other country music artists are  going to adopt 18 bald eagles from Alaska that will be released into the wild  in Tennessee.

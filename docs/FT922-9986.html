			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Arts: Today's Television The only line in any of Shakespeare's plays which, in my experience, causes spontaneous applause every time it is delivered occurs in 'Henry IV Part 2', Act 4 Scene II: 'The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers'. My guess is that audiences have clapped this every time the play has been performed since 1597. Could it be something to do with the way that human misfortune so often seems to result in fat fees for lawyers? First Tuesday investigates the English bar at a time when even more calls than usual are being made for reform.(10.45 ITV). Earlier BBC2 begins a six-part documentary series on The Racing Game just as English racing seems to be going down the drain - or rather, overseas. Trainers, by all accounts, are leaving because there is no longer as much money here as in the US or France. During the last flat season the producers based themselves in the stable yard of Newmarket trainer Luca Cumani. From there they follow the fortunes of owners, stable lads and punters (9.20). BBC1 continues with its spin-off from 'Crimewatch', Crime Limited in which Nick Ross and Sue Cook report on criminality generally.</p>

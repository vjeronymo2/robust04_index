			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP / ROCK  </P> <P> Perhaps to see if you can go home again, Bob Dylan will make a rare concert  appearance in his home state of Minnesota, performing Aug. 3 at the RiverFest  in St. Paul. Dylan, who was born in Duluth and raised in Hibbing, started as a  folk singer in a coffeehouse near the University of Minnesota in 1959 but has  performed locally only three times since -- at the Minneapolis Auditorium in  1965, the St. Paul Civic Center in 1978 and the Metrodome in 1986.

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Car sales end year-long decline West European new car sales rose by an estimated 6 per cent to 1.023m in January, halting 12 months of unbroken decline in the European market. New car sales in 1993 fell by an estimated 15.2 per cent to 11.45m, the steepest decline since the war. Carmakers' forecasts suggest only a marginal recovery this year of 1-2 per cent. According to industry estimates, sales in January were higher in 11 of 17 markets across west Europe, led by big increases in three of the large volume markets, the UK, France and Spain. New car sales fell by 10 per cent in Italy, however, and sales in Germany were little changed, with an estimated fall of 1 per cent. Motor industry leaders cautioned that the apparent strength of the overall market in January was misleading, as sales a year ago had been depressed by changes in taxation and exhaust emissions regulations. New car sales in Spain last month were 28.6 per cent higher than a year ago but were still 26 per cent below the average for January during the last five years. Sales in France rose last month by 15 per cent year-on-year, but according to the French carmakers' federation the underlying trend in demand was still downward after eliminating distorting factors. Among the big six volume carmakers, Ford and General Motors (Opel/Vauxhall) both gained market share helped by their large presence in the UK, where the overall market grew by 20 per cent year-on-year. The Volkswagen group of Germany and Fiat of Italy, both of which plunged into heavy losses last year, continued to lose market share in January, as they suffered in particular from the weakness of their home markets. Among the specialist carmakers Mercedes-Benz has reversed a long period of decline and has overtaken BMW, its arch domestic rival, which had outsold Mercedes-Benz for the last two years. Mercedes-Benz's fortunes have been boosted by the successful launch last summer of its new C-Class executive range. BMW will take on a new scale in Europe, however, through its planned purchase of Rover from British Aerospace. Rover, the strongest performer among leading carmakers in the west European market last year, clearly outperformed BMW in January. It increased its sales by an estimated 17 per cent year-on-year to capture a market share of 3.5 per cent, while BMW's sales declined by 5 per cent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                         JANUARY 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Volume    Volume     Share (%)   Share (%)                           (Units)   Change (%)   Jan 94      Jan 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET            1,023,000      +5.9       100.0      100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen group          161,000      -0.1        15.7       16.7  -Volkswagen              111,000      -1.5        10.8       11.6  -Audi                     25,000      -1.7         2.4        2.6  -Seat                     22,000      +2.9         2.1        2.2  -Skoda*                    3,800     +51.0         0.4        0.3 General Motors***         131,000      +9.4        12.8       12.4  -Opel/Vauxhall           126,000      +9.4        12.3       11.9  -Saab**                    3,500      +3.8         0.3        0.3 Ford***                   126,000     +10.8        12.3       11.7  -Ford Europe             124,000     +10.7        12.1       11.6  -Jaguar                    1,200     +10.3         0.1        0.1 PSA Peugeot Citroen       125,000      +6.8        12.2       12.1  -Peugeot                  71,000      +1.1         6.9        7.2  -Citroen                  54,000     +15.3         5.3        4.9 Fiat group****            121,000      -5.1        11.8       13.2  -Fiat                     92,000      -2.8         9.0        9.8  -Lancia                   16,000     -11.4         1.6        1.9  -Alfa Romeo               12,000     -15.5         1.1        1.4 Renault???                100,000      -0.1         9.8       10.4 BMW group??                68,000      +5.5         6.6        6.7  -BMW??                    32,000      -5.2         3.2        3.5  -Rover??                  36,000     +17.3         3.5        3.1 Mercedes-Benz              43,000     +57.8         4.2        2.8 Nissan                     37,000     +18.1         3.6        3.2 Toyota                     24,000     +11.8         2.4        2.3 Volvo???                   17,000     +22.1         1.7        1.5 Mazda                      15,000      +0.3         1.5        1.6 Honda??                    12,000     +15.3         1.2        1.1 Mitsubishi                  9,000     -10.5         0.9        1.1 Total Japanese            111,000      +5.9        10.9       10.9 MARKETS: Germany                   235,000      -1.4        23.0       24.6 United Kingdom            199,000     +20.4        19.4       17.1 Italy                     182,000     -10.0        17.8       20.9 France                    130,000     +15.0        12.7       11.7 Spain                      53,000     +28.6         5.2        4.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *VW holds 31 per cent and management control of Skoda. ***Includes cars imported from US and sold in western Europe. **GM holds 50 per cent and management control of Saab Automobile. ???Renault and Volvo are linked through minority cross-shareholdings. ****Fiat group includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Innocenti, Ferrari and Maserati. ??BMW plans to take an 80 per cent holding in Rover vehicle operations, where Honda holds a 20 per cent stake.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: industry estimates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

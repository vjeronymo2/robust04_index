			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Revived CrossRail project may take 10 years to finish The government yesterday revived the Pounds 2bn CrossRail project, using a complex procedure which means the east-west railway through London could take at least 10 years to complete. After the failure earlier this year of a private bill authorising the scheme, the Department of Transport believed it was left with no choice but to use the 1992 Transport and Works Act, a new and untried procedure. This will involve Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, laying an order before parliament following the request from the promoters of the project - London Underground, British Rail and Railtrack. Objections will then be heard at a public inquiry or inquiries along the route, which is why Whitehall officials fear the project may not be completed until 2004. Mr Michael Cassidy, policy director of the Corporation of London, warned that the government procedure for promoting the project was 'enormously complex'. 'I don't think the Transport and Works Act was ever intended for such large projects,' he said. The corporation is continuing its studies of plans to raise up to Pounds 500m from a levy on business rates coupled with an international bond issue. Mr MacGregor said: 'It remains government policy that the project should be financed as a joint venture, with a substantial private sector contribution.' The government could have promoted a hybrid bill - so named because it involves both public and private interests. But the Department of Transport is already committed to one hybrid bill for the high-speed rail link from London to the Channel tunnel and felt it was unlikely to be awarded parliamentary time for a second. The transport secretary announced his decision in an answer to a parliamentary question from Mr David Lidington, Tory MP for Aylesbury, who had been supported by more than 250 MPs calling for a private bill authorising CrossRail to be sent back to a quasi-judicial committee which rejected it. But Mr Michael Morris, the deputy Speaker, blocked the motion. Mrs Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, supported Mr Morris. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said it feared it would take at least another 10 years before CrossRail is completed. 'We have got to find a speedier mechanism for implementing major national infrastructure projects.'</p>

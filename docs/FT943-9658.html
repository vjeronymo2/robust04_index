			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Walker 'denied Pounds 7.5m transfer' Mr George Walker, former chief executive of Brent Walker, denied to police that he had ever stolen money from the property and leisure group, an Old Bailey jury heard yes-terday. He also denied authorising the transfer of Pounds 7.5m from the company, in spite of his signature's appearance on documentation for the transaction, the court was told. Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, the company's former finance director, are accused of fraudulently boosting the profits of Brent Walker by some Pounds 19m. They deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiracy to falsify accounts. The prosecution alleges the profits were boosted by bogus transactions carried out within the group's film division. It claims the Brent Walker group in effect funded its own profits, and that the bogus transactions were disguised through a circular money trail. The jury was read the transcripts of interviews Mr Walker had with police attached to the Serious Fraud Office in April 1992 before his arrest in January 1993. Mr Walker was questioned about the transfer of Pounds 7.5m from Brent Walker to the Arab Bank Corporation in New York in May 1989. The prosecution alleges this payment was part of the circular money trail used to boost the profits. Mr Walker agreed that a document concerning the transfer bore what appeared to be his signature, but denied having authorised the payment. Although he did not accuse anyone of forgery, Mr Walker told police he would never have sent such a letter, which was written on paper that had not come from his office. Police officers put it to him that the Pounds 7.5m had been stolen from Brent Walker. Mr Walker replied: 'I have never had a penny out of Brent Walker. I never touched this money ever. That is a fact.' If money had been stolen from the company, he added, then nobody would help the police more than himself. Mr Walker said it was often his practice to sign papers without reading them. He trusted fellow directors to have done their job properly. Had he questioned everything they did, he would never have had the time to to build up the company, he said. The trial continues today.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / World Trade News: Power plant makers revel in Asia - Andrew Baxter on capacity additions running at triple the 1970s' rate AMID the deluge of facts accompanying Asea Brown Boveri's annual results presentation last month was one nugget that spells business - and profits - for the world's contract-hungry power equipment suppliers. According to Mr Goran Lindahl, the Swiss-Swedish group's executive vice-president for both Asia and for its power plants business, China and Hong Kong will be adding 12,000-15,000MW of new power capacity every year for the rest of this decade. That is the equivalent of Switzerland's entire installed power capacity. Last week ABB underlined China's status as one of the world's more promising markets for power generating equipment by announcing it had won Dollars 300m (Pounds 211m) of contracts to supply two separate combined-cycle gas turbine power plants to Guandong province. The developing economies of Asia, and in particular China because of its sheer size, are looming large in the plans of the western equipment suppliers. Power capacity additions in Asia are running at triple the rate seen in the 1970s, while in western markets new capacity is being added at only two-thirds of rates seen 20 years ago. For ABB, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, expanding its presence in the Asian market is particularly important. The company has just completed five years of trading since it was formed from the merger of Sweden's Asea and Brown Boveri of Switzerland. The result so far is a company that exudes technological and management competence but whose financial performance has yet to dazzle. The company has been hit badly by recession in several leading industrial countries and business sectors, and is still falling short of financial targets set by Mr Percy Barnevik, its president and chief executive. Now both Mr Lindahl and Mr Barnevik are signalling clearly that they are stepping up recent efforts to build greenfield plants in Asia and form joint ventures in manufacturing, engineering and service. Already, ABB has more than 20,000 employees in Asia and Australasia, and the region accounted for 21 per cent of its Dollars 31.6bn total order intake last year. But Mr Lindahl plans to spend Dollars 1bn in Asia over the next five years to make sure ABB exploits the region's fast-growing economies and their demand for new power plants, related transmission and distribution equipment, and transportation equipment. Over the next five years, says Mr Lindahl, Asia, Australasia and the Gulf will rise from the current 17 per cent of ABB's total business volume to about one-third as European business falls back. For ABB - and its big rivals General Electric, Westinghouse, GEC Alsthom and Siemens - the next few years are likely to witness considerable activity building on the joint ventures already concluded in Asia and forming new ones. There are already dozens of deals linking western companies to developing country markets through manufacturing licences, technology transfer and component supply. ABB alone is talking to some 50 companies in the Asia-Pacific region about joint ventures. A classic example of ABB's strategy is its deal announced in February with Hefei Transformer Works, based in Hefei City, about 280 miles west of Shanghai. A joint venture majority-owned by ABB, with HTW and the People's Construction Bank of China as the other owners, will make power transformers in Hefei City using technology and training provided by the European company. The production capacity at Hefei will be more than trebled to 5,000MW a year, but there could still be several more deals like it, says Mr Lindahl. In fact, spending Dollars 1bn goes a long way in Asia because the bulk of investments will not be costly. There will be a lot of service shops and assembly works costing anything from Dollars 1m to Dollars 8m rather than Dollars 50m-Dollars 100m investments, says Mr Barnevik. Getting the most out of Asia will be an important element in Mr Barnevik's ambitions to improve ABB's operating margins from the current lack-lustre 6.1 per cent last year to 10 per cent in a few years' time. All ABB's rivals have much the same idea, however. GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French group which is ABB's arch-rival in Europe, has a particularly strong track record in China and Hong Kong, and with GE of the US recently won the fiercely-contested Dollars 1.25bn contract for the Black Point power station in Hong Kong. This 2,500MW combined cycle station will be one of the largest in the world. But there are plenty more where that came from.</p>

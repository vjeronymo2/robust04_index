Currently the government allows the importation of 1,664  merchandise items from the mainland. The government has sought  to limit the impact of cheap mainland products on the Island's  economy by allowing only semi-finished products to be imported.    According to the Economic Affairs Ministry, the ROC  [Republic  of China] is considering lifting import restriction on mainland  products. Over the next two years, the number of permitted  imported products may increase from the current 1,664 to 5,000.  In addition, once the 5,000 target has been reached, a  recommendation will be made to the Cabinet that the list of  permitted imports be dropped in favor of a list of banned  imports. The ministry estimated that this year, Taiwan's total  imports from the mainland will grow more than 20 percent.</p>

Signing the agreement for Macau was Jorge Ferreira  Guimaraes,  president of the Civil Aviation Authority. The agreement now  will be reviewed by the Sino-Portuguese Liaison Group.    A DAC communique states that the agreement "is characterized  by liberal operational provisions enabling the two parties to  offer air services between Brazil and Macau to meet the needs  for transportation of both passengers and cargo between the two  parties, including those of third countries."    Macau is located on the southeastern coast of Asia, 64 km  west of Hong Kong. The agreement will give Brazilian companies  greater access to the Asian market.</p>

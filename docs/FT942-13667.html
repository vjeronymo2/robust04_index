			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Littlechild's lecture It was always clear that the regional electricity companies would be unable to hang on to the excess profits from their distribution businesses for ever. What surprised the market yesterday was the speed with which the electricity regulator currently envisages clawing back those earnings. On its own, the proposed annual price cut of 3 to 4 per cent after inflation would have seemed soft: the Recs should have little difficulty achieving cost reductions of that order. It is the rumoured 10 to 20 per cent cut to start the ball rolling that hit share prices. If this turns out to be the eventual price control regime, a further fall in the shares would be justified. But Professor Stephen Littlechild's letter is, of course, only an opening shot. The companies are muttering about taking the issue to the Monopolies Commission if he does not back down. The threat is probably not idle given the new hard line being taken by institutional investors over what they see as excessive interference in privatised utilities. Having set a precedent by encouraging water companies to stand up to Ofwat, they can be expected to put spine in the Recs too. The MMC is unlikely to give the Recs much more favourable treatment than their regulator. Prof Littlechild's estimated cost of capital of 6 per cent in real terms looks about right. But that is not the point. The question is rather whether Prof Littlechild can be pressed into giving ground before going to the MMC. If his willingness to compromise with the generators earlier this year is any guide, the chances of a partial retreat must be high.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The FAA's authority is not limited to regulation for aviation safety, efficiency, and development. Subsection 307(c) of the FAAct provides that FAA air traffic rules and flight regulations may be adopted ``for the protection of persons and property on the ground.'' The FAA considers this protection to extend to environmental values on the surface as well as to the safety of persons and property. Section 611 of the FAAct, ``in order to afford present and future relief to the public health and welfare from aircraft noise,'' directs the Administrator to adopt regulations ``as the FAA may find necessary for the control and abatement of aircraft noise,'' including application of such regulations to any of the various certificates issued under Title VI. Finally, it is the general policy of the Federal government that the FAA, like other agencies, will exercise its authority in a manner that will enhance the environment, and that the FAA will make a special effort to preserve the natural beauty of public park and recreation lands, wilderness areas, and wildlife refuges. Section 101 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321; Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C. 303; and Executive Order 11514, as amended by Executive Order 11991. In addition, the DOT has further authority to regulate services by commercial operators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Fees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, August 10, 1993) amended Section 4 of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 4601&hyph;6a) requiring the NPS to impose a commercial tour use fee on each vehicle entering a unit of the national park system, that presently charges an entrance fee, for the purpose of providing commercial tour services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to surface transportation, this commercial use fee applies to aircraft entering ``the airspace of units of the National Park System'' identified in sections 2(b) and 3 of Public Law 100.91 (Grand Canyon National Park and Haleakala National Park) as well as any other park areas where the level of commercial aircraft services are equal to or greater than these two identified areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The actual fees established by the legislation are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;$25 per vehicle with a capacity of 25 people or less, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;$50 per vehicle with a capacity greater than 25 people. The legislation also gives the Secretary the authority to make reasonable adjustments to these recommended commercial tour fees. Currently, there are no additional NPS areas that charge entrance fees, and also have a level of commercial aircraft services equal or greater to Grand Canyon or Haleakala National Parks. As a result of the legislation, the NPS will need to monitor the number of air tour operations over the affected parks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Grand Canyon National Park <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> At Grand Canyon, 42 companies offer aerial tours operating from five states (Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico). These companies provide air tours of the Grand Canyon to about 750,000 people and generate revenues in excess of $100 million. During peak summer months, the number of tours exceeds 10,000 each month. On June 5, 1987, the FAA issued Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) No. 50&hyph;1 (52 FR 22734, June 15, 1987) which provided rules to enhance safety of overflight operations in the vicinity of the Grand Canyon National Park. Section 3 of Public Law 100&hyph;91 required the Secretary of the Department of the Interior (DOI) to submit to the FAA Administrator recommendations for the protection of resources in the Grand Canyon from adverse impacts associated with aircraft overflights. The recommendations were to provide for substantial restoration of the natural quiet and experience of the Grand Canyon. With limited exceptions, the recommendations were to prohibit the flight of aircraft below the rim of the Canyon and to designate zones that were flight free except for purposes of administration of underlying lands and emergency operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Law 100&hyph;91 further required the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and issue a final plan for the management of air traffic above the Grand Canyon. In December 1987, the DOI submitted recommendations to the FAA for an aircraft management plan at the Grand Canyon. The recommendations included both rulemaking and non-rulemaking actions. On May 27, 1988, the FAA issued SFAR No. 50&hyph;2 (53 FR 20264, June 2, 1988) which revises the procedures for operation of aircraft in the airspace above the Grand Canyon. The rule implements the preliminary recommendations of the Secretary of the Interior for an aircraft management plan at the Grand Canyon with some modifications that the FAA initiated in the interest of aviation safety. SFAR No. 50&hyph;2 establishes a Special Flight Rules Area from the surface to 14,500 feet above mean seal level (MSL) in the area of the Grand Canyon. The SFAR prohibits flight below a certain altitude in each of five sectors of this area with some exceptions. The SFAR also establishes flight free zones from the surface to 14,500 feet msl above large areas of the park. The ``flight free zones'' cover virtually all of the visitors to the North and South Rims and about 90 percent of backcountry users. The SFAR also provided special routes for commercial tour operators and transient operators through the canyon area, Commercial air tour operations are required to be conducted as air taxi and commercial operations under part 135 with stringent requirements including special operations specifications for Grand Canyon. The NPS believes the SFAR has been successful in limiting some noise-associated adverse impacts to the park but most, if not all, of the gain has been, or may be, lost as a result of the exponential growth in numbers of flights over the canyon. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

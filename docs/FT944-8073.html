			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Exchange unveils Pounds 30m computer update The London Stock Exchange has unveiled the main elements of the technology which it hopes will secure its future as a world operator in equities markets. It announced yesterday the availability of London Market Information Link, the most important phase in the 'Sequence' programme of electronic trading and information services. In the next two years Sequence will replace the exchange's collection of incompatible computers and software systems which have grown up since the 'Big Bang' in 1985. LMIL provides traders and independent information providers with trading data in digital (computer code) form, as well as the infrastructure to support future services. It is intended to operate in parallel with MarketLine, the existing computer readable service, until March 31 next year when the older service will be closed. About 30 customers - chiefly the bigger market makers such as BZW and information providers such as Reuters - already receive the new data feed, which has so far cost the exchange about Pounds 30m to develop. They have had to develop their own software to receive the feed. The software was developed under contract by Andersen Consulting, which also has a contract to manage the exchange's computer systems. Mr Hugh Morris, Andersen partner with responsibility for the exchange account, said LMIL was the foundation for a programme which would help the City cut costs and simplify its systems. Ms Christine Dann, director of business operations at the exchange, said: 'Sequence demonstrates the exchange's commitment to maintain the competitiveness of the markets as a whole and London's position as an international financial centre.' The short time-scale for the Big Bang's implementation in the 1980s forced the exchange to build systems on an ad hoc basis, resulting in higher costs and a lack of flexibility for its users. It is determined not to repeat the experience with Sequence. Customers will receive information and be able to trade through a single digital interface. New services can be added without altering the interface, and changes to exchange rules will be possible by simple amendments to existing software. There are as yet no firm plans for linking the new electronic trading systems to Crest, the electronic settlement system under development by the Bank of England. Unless the two systems can be linked information will have to be keyed in twice at higher cost and with greater risk of errors. Not all exchange members are convinced about the new service. ADP, the US-based information provider, is offering software which will convert the new service into the old format.</p>

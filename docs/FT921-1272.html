			<p>920325 FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Northern boost for Cussins Property A strong northern housebuilding performance helped Cussins Property Group cut annual losses from Pounds 4.04m to Pounds 365,000. The company said that prospects had improved following the 'painful measures' taken during the year. The Newcastle-based company decided to concentrate on housebuilding and as a result, turnover for 1991 fell from Pounds 21.8m to Pounds 18.4m, all of which related to housebuilding in the north-east of England. The pre-tax line was helped by the elimination of losses from associates which took Pounds 8.06m last time. Of the Pounds 2.21m (Pounds 2.7m) interest charge, a significant part was for discontinued activities.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: SIGNS OF CHANGE AT BILLBOARD MAGAZINE?  </P> <P> For years, Billboard magazine has been the music industry's bible, offering a  strong, independent voice in its coverage of the record business. Whenever  industry observers cite the progress of a new album, they draw from the  Billboard charts.  </P> <P> But is the pop trade magazine in danger of losing some of its editorial  freedom? In other words, could advertisers influence what Billboard will  publish?  </P> <P> Some industry insiders have already begun to wonder after reading Xeroxed  copies of a recent two-page internal commentary sent to Billboard staffers by  Group Publisher John Babcock Jr.  </P> <P> Largely devoted to encouraging more cooperation between the magazine's  editorial and advertising staffs, Babcock's vaguely-worded memo suggests:  </P> <P> * That Billboard's editorial staff should be "habitually querying" its ad sales  people -- "they have info on new products, marketing strategies and people."  </P> <P> * That activities at the largest record companies whould get more play than the  same activities at smaller companies. But "when there's a difficult choice to  be made on the same subject, I say the advertiser gets the call."  </P> <P> * That its editorial staff "should react positively to sales requests . . . Ad  Sales needs to be able to show an advertiser by example that for the right  story they can help communicate it to Editorial with positive results."  </P> <P> * That with the magazine's ad sales being off over the past year, "we need to  take care not to assume a we-they attitude. For without Editorial and  Advertising constantly acknowledging and listening to each other we miss  opportunities and alienate revenue sources."  </P> <P> Babcock makes it clear he is firmly opposed to any "quid pro quo stance"  between ad and editorial staffs. And according to several Billboard columnists  and writers, they are very rarely -- if ever -- under pressure to pull punches  with their coverage.  </P> <P> Still, some industry observers say the magazine has rarely taken the lead on  reporting such controversial industry issues as independent promotion  investigations or MCA's alleged involvement with mob figure Sal Pisello --  issues which received far more coverage in trade papers like Daily Variety and  the Hollywood Reporter.  </P> <P> Others disagreed. "Considering how many times I've had to call and complain  about the slant of certain stories I wouldn't say Billboard has gotten any  softer," said MCA Records sr. vice president Larry Solters. "We still in get  fights over the way they cover stories."  </P> <P> Babcock was in France and could not be reached for comment. However, John  Babcock Sr., Billboard's vice president of corporate communications, insisted  there had been "positively no change" in Billboard's editorial policy.  </P> <P> "Billboard doesn't give advertisers any preferential treatment. In fact, we've  probably bent over backwards too far the other way, with our editorial staff  having absolutely no contact with the advertising side. I think John's just  trying to remedy that by encouraging better communications between editorial  and sales. Billboard has always called it the way we see it. We did a lot of  hard reporting on (legal problems involving veteran industry exec) Morris Levy  and the industry came down on us like a ton of bricks."  </P> <P> Asked about the memo's recommendation that in certain instances "the advertiser  gets the call," Babcock Sr. replied: "I can see where that could be  misinterpreted, but I think John just wants to create better harmony between  the editorial and ad staffs."  </P></p>

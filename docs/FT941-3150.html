			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Cash gets through political bars: Rapid changes in smaller European telecoms markets An odd pattern is emerging in Europe's telecommunications industry. While the larger continental EU states dither, the smaller ones are rushing to restructure and sell off their public telecoms operators. The Greek socialist government announced this month its intention to sell a 25 per cent stake in its public telecoms operator or PTO. On the same day the Irish PTO publicised an offer from Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecoms group, for a strategic partnership - short of privatisation, but a first step on the way. Denmark and the Netherlands are well advanced on the privatisation trail, while the Portuguese government is restructuring and valuing its telecoms operators. The Belgium PTO and telecoms ministry are deep in talks about a sell-off, with British Telecommunications touted as a possible partner. The pattern is odd because privatisation usually goes hand-in-hand with liberalisation, yet ostensibly smaller EU states are under less pressure than larger ones to liberalise telecoms. While the rest of the EU (besides Spain) must allow competition in basic voice services by 1998, Greece, Ireland and Portugal need not do it until 2003. Furthermore, most of the smaller states have left-wing or centre-left coalitions whose trade union allies are fiercely opposed to privatisation of their PTOs. Greece is the starkest case: the socialists, under Mr Andreas Papandreou, won an election last year promising to scrap the previous right-wing government's privatisation plans. But they have revived them, only reducing the proportion of OTE, the Greek PTO, to be sold from 49 to 25 per cent. By contrast, the right-wing French government has put the privatisation of France Telecom on the back-burner. Legislation to privatise Deutsche Telekom is advancing at a snail's pace and Italy is far from proceeding with a sale of its various state-owned telecoms operators. In reality, fiscal and business pressures are dictating policy, irrespective of party programmes and Brussels derogations. Three acute pressures are evident among the PTOs in the smaller states: network modernisation, shortage of cash, and internationalisation. Not that all the smaller EU states have backward telecoms networks. Ireland and Portugal have fewer lines per head than the average, but Denmark is at the top of the EU league and the Netherlands third behind France. However, for most of the smaller states the challenge is to ensure adequate funding and know-how to keep up with the pack. Belgium, for instance, has an adequate network, but not good enough to match its ambition of becoming Europe's telecoms hub. In mobile communications, Belgacom, the state operator, first brought in Pacific Telesis, the US regional Bell operator, to help build a cellular mobile network. Now Belgacom is establishing a mobile subsidiary in which Pactel is likely to take a 25 per cent stake. 'In effect this is a dry run for privatisation,' says a consultant close to the company. If know-how were the only requirement, modernisation need not require privatisation. But modernisation needs investment too. With state deficits piling up, PTOs are looking to privatisation to fund investment. Telecom Eireann, for instance, has a respectable network, but with debts approaching IPounds 1bn (Pounds 960m) the attractions of a deal with Cable &amp; Wireless, reported to be worth up to IPounds 500m, are obvious. However, governments want privatisation proceeds to alleviate budget deficits. In Greece a row has erupted between the government and OTE over the division of the estimated Dollars 1bn proceeds. Ministers want 60 per cent to go into state coffers; OTE wants 60 per cent for network investment. Internationalisation is equally pressing. Smaller PTOs fear multinationals will steal lucrative business customers. They believe they cannot afford to wait to form alliances. For many, last year's Dollars 5.3bn alliance between BT and MCI, the second-largest US carrier, was the moment of truth. PTOs need not be privatised to form alliances, but that way they are more attractive to potential allies, most of whom are private concerns. Mr David Wheeler, director of the telecoms group at Lehman Brothers, the merchant bank, says: 'In the smaller states, it is much easier to persuade PTOs and their ministers that they cannot survive globalisation without the flexibility that privatisation gives to forge alliances and stay in the international telecoms game.' It is not a foregone conclusion that all alliances will be permitted. Mr Philip Lowe, head of the EU's merger task force, said this week that the commission intended to police telecoms joint ventures closely to ensure competition did not suffer. However, competition is driving the alliances. The EU obligation on PTOs to make leased-lines available upon request is already giving large customers and companies dedicated to line resale the opportunity to side-step PTOs and their high international tariffs. The competitive threat is particularly strong in Ireland, where Telecom Eireann faces a haemorrhage of its international traffic to re-sellers. Ironically, the largest of them is Cable &amp; Wireless. If you can't beat 'em  .</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Leader of Russia's Liberal-Democratic Party Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy stated in Moscow on Monday that "sooner or later  historical justice will triumph and the Vilnius territory which  was always part of Russia, would be re-joined to Russia and the  Kaliningrad Region will cease to be isolated from us."    He told the press conference devoted to a State Duma  delegation's visit to Russia's Baltic exclave, located between  Lithuania and Poland, that "Kaliningrad is an inalienable part  of Russia and that neither Lithuanians, nor Estonians, nor Poles  or Germans, will be able to tear it away from the motherland."    The Kaliningrad Region (former East Prussia) was joined to  Russia following the Potsdam conference in 1945. The Vilnius  territory is the south eastern part of Lithuania which was  occupied by Poland in 1919-39. In 1939, following the  occupation of Poland by Germany, the Soviet Union sent its  troops to this territory and subsequently joined it to Lithuania.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): BBC to decide in May on options for future THE MANAGEMENT and governors of the BBC will decide on a range of options for the future of the corporation in May in preparation for the re-negotiation of its Royal Charter, which runs out at the end of 1996. The range of possible options is being collated by a committee headed by Mr Howell James, director of corporate affairs, and Ms Patricia Hodgson, head of the corporation's policy unit. They are choosing from a list of options, some contradictory and none of them costed, drawn up by 15 internal committees set up last year to examine every aspect of the corporation's future. The proposals are believed to include the abolition of Radio 5, the enhancement of BBC local radio and the recognition that in areas such as drama and entertainment the BBC should be popular, but should not try to match everything offered by the competition. Radio 3, it is suggested, should end drama and concentrate on classical music, including live performances, together with serious information and arts journalism. Some of the committees' proposals have already been rejected and others have received powerful backing in advance of a formal decision. Sir Michael Checkland, the director-general, has rejected a proposal that the corporation's orchestras should be privatised. He has argued that such arts patronage is a central part of the corporation's role as a public service broadcaster. The BBC hopes to agree a blueprint for its future by late spring and publish the document early in the autumn in order to open a public debate. The debate is likely to be at its peak next year with the legislative process on the Royal Charter getting under way in 1994.</p>

"There is no reason for us to continue discussions with the  PDSR," said Senator Ion Diaconescu. The PDSR was informed of  this even during the meeting held with the National Peasant  Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD]. Both the talks at Cotroceni  and those conducted with the CDR parties were initiated by the  other side, namely President Ion Iliescu and the PDSR. In the  PNTCD's view the terms for continuing the dialogue are the  participation of the entire CDR and only following an invitation  coming from the PDSR, as it did so far. "The Convention will  then decide whether it will participate and if the invitation is  not sent, then no harm is done either way," Mr. Diaconescu also  said. It seems that the PDSR executive president is concerned  about the unity of the Convention, "he cares for it." The  common desire and struggle to replace the current regime that  has been in power in Romania since the 1989 revolution  constitutes the commitment of the CDR, Mr. Diaconescu  reiterated. The current regime is considered to be the  continuer of the communist regime. All the parties within the  CDR are united in this struggle and when the goal has been  achieved, each one is to follow its own ideology and program.  "If Mr. Nastase wants to say that the executive power is united  -- at a time when we believed that the PDSR distanced itself  from the viewpoints of Messrs. Funar, Vadim Tudor, or Paunescu  -- the opposition will treat this bloc as such," the Peasant  Party leader concluded.</p>

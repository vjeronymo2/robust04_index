			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Greece expels Albanians GREEK police rounded up more than 4,500 Albanians in a 48-hour sweep and have begun expelling the suspected illegal refugees, the Public Order Ministry said yesterday, Reuter reports from Athens. Tension between the neighbouring Balkan states has risen sharply since Friday, when there were reports of clashes between ethnic Greeks and Albanian police in the southern Albanian town of Gjirokaster. Greece said the violence was sparked by Albania's expulsion of a senior Greek Orthodox priest, Chrysostomos Maidonis. Greek officials said the violence was one of the worst ethnic Greek-Albanian clashes since the second world war. 'The Albanian action proves this country is shamelessly violating human rights,' said Foreign Ministry undersecretary Virgina Tsouderous. Police were holding many of the illegal Albanians at the Hellenikon Air Base at Athens international airport and private coaches were being hired to take the refugees to the border. Between 150,000 and 300,000 illegal Albanians are thought to be in Greece. They walk across the long, rugged border and often return quickly after being expelled by Greece. Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis has reacted angrily to the deporting of the priest on Friday, calling it an 'unwarranted provocation' and warned Albanian authorities that Greece would 'take whatever step it deems necessary'. The sweep of Albanian immigrants began after the warning by Mr Mitsotakis. Greece also announced that planned trips to Albania by Foreign Minister Mihalis Papaconstantinou, National Economy Minister Stephanos Manos and Defence Minister Ioannis Varvitsiotis were being cancelled.</p>

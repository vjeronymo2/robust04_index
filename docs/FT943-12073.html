			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Labour's report In one sense, it is unfair to assess Mr Tony Blair's leadership of the Labour party on the basis of yesterday's policy paper on education. He has, after all, been leader for less than a week. As for the paper, its contents were determined by the party's labyrinthine policy-making committees long before he took up the reins. Yet the prominence Mr Blair accorded education in his leadership campaign means that some sort of assessment is inescapable. On general sentiments, the paper cannot be faulted. The importance of skills and knowledge in the modern economy is undeniable. The failure of the UK education system - in particular, English schools - to deliver either in sufficient quantities is widely accepted. Few will disagree with the proposition that the quality of education must be raised. On detailed policies, there is also much to welcome. Broadening the scope of A-levels and a professional structure for the teaching profession are necessary steps. An expansion of nursery education is also desirable. In launching the paper, Mr Blair rightly emphasised the importance of standards and discipline in schools. He also made much of the need to build on the Conservative reform that gave schools control over budgets, in order to increase their autonomy. But Mr Blair's well-crafted presentation could not disguise the continuing impact on Labour's education policy of the teachers' unions. The paper attacks Ofsted, the new inspection service set up to inspect schools more frequently, as insufficiently independent of the education secretary. It rejects the use of tests to monitor schools and teachers. And it describes school league tables as simplistic and flawed, and 'not acceptable' as management tools. Parents and taxpayers need simple and objective measures of school performance, including the examination results which are so important for children's life-chances. Instead, Labour promises a deluge of information that will let underperforming schools off the hook. The verdict - in the words of school reports over the years - is 'must try harder'. If Mr Blair is serious about putting education at the centre of his agenda for national renewal, he must ensure that Labour's policy papers match his rhetoric. A clearer focus on the ends of education is needed, with less influence for the producers. A first step would be to find a new shadow education secretary. Mrs Ann Taylor, the existing incumbent, appears out of step with his priorities.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;We clarify the term ``professionals'' as it relates to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the members of a survey team by setting forth examples and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by stating that the State, subject to HCFA approval,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines what constitutes a ``professional.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We modify the qualifications for temporary managers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set a salary floor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We expand the financial, employment, and familial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances that disqualify a surveyor from surveying a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We limit the instances in which a reduction in FFP is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken for inadequate survey performance to situations when a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State demonstrates a pattern of failure to identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies in Medicaid facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We redefine what constitutes inadequate survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We amend the regulations text at &sect;488.312 (&sect;488.162  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed rule), consistency of survey results, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that State survey agencies study surveyor accuracy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as consistency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We clarify that the survey agency will review complaint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allegations and conduct a standard or abbreviated standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> if <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the survey agency concludes that a deficiency in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one or more requirements may have occurred and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> only <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can confirm the existence of the deficiency or deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We limit HCFA's and the State agency's discretion to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct an extended or partial extended survey to situations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in which substandard quality of care has been identified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA or the State will, however, continue to have complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion to examine any and all aspects of a facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance in order to determine compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We add directed in-service training as a new remedy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We expressly state that denial of all payment for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare residents in a facility may be imposed by HCFA and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that HCFA may deny payment to the State for all Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents in a facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We clarify that one or more remedies may be imposed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one or more deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We eliminate as a remedy denial of payment for certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnostic categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We add the following to clarify the civil money penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;The amount of the civil money penalty can be adjusted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reflect changes from non-immediate jeopardy to immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy and from immediate jeopardy to non-immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;A civil money penalty is increased for repeated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies within the same regulatory grouping of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in those cases where a civil money penalty was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed as a remedy for the first occurrence of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;The interest rate for civil money penalties is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the rate fixed by the Secretary of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treasury and used by the Department for Medicare and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by the State for Medicaid;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;The HCFA notice of the imposition of the civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty does not have to be sent by mail;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;The HCFA notice of intent to impose the civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty includes more information regarding the nature of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the noncompliance, dates of accrual and dates of collection;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;The State's notice to non-State operated NFs when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State takes action must include at a minimum the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in the HCFA notice;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;If the facility waives its right to a hearing in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> writing within 60 days from the date of the notice of intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to impose the civil money penalty, HCFA or the State reduces  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the civil money penalty by 35 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> +&blank;The civil money penalty may start to accrue as early as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the date the facility was first found out of compliance, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by HCFA or the State. This may be the last day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the survey or, in certain situations, before that date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

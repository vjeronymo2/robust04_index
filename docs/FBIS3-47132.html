			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- National Chairman of  the Communist Party of the USA Gus Hall in an article published  in the party's organ PEOPLE'S WEEKLY WORLD urged all the  Americans to protest Clinton's policy threatening North Korea  with a nuclear preemptive strike.    In an article calling for a nuclear-free world he pointed  out  that the current threat to world peace comes from the US policy  of nuclear aggression against North Korea.    He noted that the United States is stepping up preparations  for a nuclear preemptive strike at North Korea.    Direct nuclear threat to North Korea is part of the anti-  communist and anti-socialist policy pursued continuously by the  United States, he said, and added: It is the same policy as the  nuclear business in the old cold-war era.    Facts show that Clinton is more bellicose than his  predecessors, he stated.    He branded the U.S. imperialists as the very one actually  threatening world peace.    He called upon the anti-war, anti-imperialist forces to  rebuild America's peace movement to conduct activities with a  demand for a stop to the threat to North Korea and demand for  the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from South Korea.</p>

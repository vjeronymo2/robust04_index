Ovsyannikov, candidate of technical sciences, State Institute of  Applied Optics, Kazan; UDC 621.384.326:629.7]    [Abstract] Based on the principles of aerial infrared  imaging for explorative survey of natural resources by gapless  scanning of the ground surface, the performance of an infrared  imaging device carried by an aircraft and operating in the  superposition of images mode is analyzed for its dependence on  the aircraft pitching and heeling dynamics. An example of such  an infrared imaging device is one which includes SPRITE  radiation receivers operating with internal integration of  signals, which ensures a very high detection power but normal  operation within a very narrow range of scanning speeds only.  The effectiveness of an infrared imaging device is defined as  the angular space frequency _n_ of the equivalent thermal  pattern to be resolved and thus as the reciprocal of its angular  resolution, the latter being uniquely and monotonically related  to the probability of detecting or recognizing objects on the  ground. That angular space frequency can be determined from the  temperature-frequency characteristic Q=  _D_T[.sub]R[/]/_D_T[.sub]0[/]= _ps_(x) of the infrared  imaging device (x= _ps_; _D_T[.sub]R[/]- effective  difference between temperature of object and ambient  temperature, taking into account the transmissivity of  atmospheric air and deviation of the equivalent pattern from the  standard one; _D_T[.sub]0[/]- temperature difference  equivalent to the set noise). Another characteristic needed for  evaluating the effectiveness of infrared imaging is the  dependence of the threshold m of Q-magnification due to  superposition of image rows or frames on the total relative  shift between images. The scan cycle period is assumed to be  usually much shorter than the periods of angular oscillations of  an aircraft about any of its principal axes. It is also assumed  that the photodetector noise may have a hyperbolic component.  Figures 2; references 6.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Bank note circulation up 6.5% British bank notes in circulation in the week to January 12 were 6.5 per cent above the level in the same week a year ago, the Bank of England said. Although this was below the 8.6 per cent recorded in the previous week, and the 7.1 per cent in the week to December 29, it indicates buoyant consumer spending. The week to January 12 had no bank holidays, so may be a more reliable indicator than the two previous weeks.</p>

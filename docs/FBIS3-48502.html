(KOTRA) said Monday.    Canada landed a preliminary dumping margin of 45.6 percent  on  Korean steel plate on Jan. 17 and as a result Tongkuk Steel Mill  Co. has to make deposits equal to the amount for its exports to  the North American country.    On Jan. 6, the Argentine Government said it would slap  punitive anti-dumping tariffs on Korean-made men's shirts of  under 4.95 U.S. dollars on its market at the free-on-board rate.    Mexico recently announced that it will continue  investigation  of Goldstar Co., Daewoo Electronics Co., Sonil Metal Co., and  Hanil Precision Industries Co., which are suspected of exporting  at between 5.15 percent and 55.47 percent less than fair prices.    Under preliminary dumping findings of between 6.77 percent  and 29.16 percent on high-density polyethylene and between 11.24  percent and 17.39 percent on low-density items, the Taipei  Government went into final screening of Korean exporters.    At complaints by local manufacturers, Australia embarked on  a  preliminary investigation into Korean and Singaporean PVC  (polyvinvyl chloride) homopolymer earlier in the month.    Hanyang Chemical Corp., Lucky Corp., Goldenbell Co., and  Samsung Chemical Industries Co. are under charges of dumping  between 10 percent and 38 percent. The preliminary ruling is  due sometime in April.    India, Korea's major synthetic resin buyer, is said to be  preparing an anti-dumping attack on the Korean export.</p>

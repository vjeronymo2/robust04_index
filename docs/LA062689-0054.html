			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES WANTS NEW IMAGE IN AD CAMPAIGN;  </P> <P> REVIEW COULD LEAD TO ANOTHER AGENCY  </P> <P> A more contemporary advertising image -- and possibly a new ad agency -- are on  tap for the Los Angeles Times.  </P> <P> In a bid to present a more up-to-date image and to boost circulation, The  Times, which spends about $5 million each year to advertise and promote itself,  has begun an agency review. The current ad agency, J. Walter Thompson, is still  in the running, but several other agencies, including BBDO/Los Angeles, have  made presentations to Times officials.  </P> <P> "We're looking to see if there's a way to energize our advertising and build  circulation," said Don Clark, executive vice president of marketing. Clark said  The Times plans to break a more upbeat campaign -- with a strong Southern  California theme -- in the fall.  </P> <P> The new campaign is expected to focus on some of the recent changes that have  taken place at The Times. Changes include the redesigned Real Estate and Sunday  Calendar sections, addition of color photographs to the front page and  introduction of several new columns and the new P.M. Final.  </P> <P> To spur circulation, The Times plans to offer special discount prices to new  subscribers in some areas this fall -- a rarity for the paper. The Times will  rely heavily on direct response advertising for this circulation drive -- both  through the mail and also with the use of TV commercials that provide toll-free  phone numbers, said Clark.  </P> <P> Also, The Times recently hired a Los Angeles specialty company, Edge Films, to  create new ads shown before movies at theaters. Clark said the new ads will be  more entertaining and have the theme line, "Southern California -- where  anything is possible."  </P> <P> "There's a lot more to the Los Angeles Times than the 'gray lady,' " said  Jeffrey S. Hall, vice president of marketing services, referring to the blur of  black print on white paper. "The paper is more engaging and more compelling,  and we want to get that message across."  </P></p>

According to Shevardnadze's press service, there are 104  such  apartments, most of which have been seized by Georgian military  officers, who threaten to use arms if any attempt is made to  evict them.    A source in the press center of Russia's Armed Forces Group  in the Transcaucasus told Interfax this was the first time the  Georgian authorities had taken up the matter. If Shevardnadze's  orders to give back the apartments were ignored, relations  between Russian and Georgian troops could deteriorate, the  source said.</p>

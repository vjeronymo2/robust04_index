Willard  Scott says it's being goofy. "Fall on your face, tell a dumb joke, be a little  bit of a buffoon," the "Today" show weatherman says in TV Guide. "Even though  people will just barely tolerate you and almost (embarrassingly) shake their  heads and say, 'My God,' they'll always invite you to the party." Bryant  Gumbel's opinion notwithstanding, Scott says one key to his success is being  corny. "Absolutely!" he says. "I mean, it's my mantle. I love it. Corn is  forever!" Another key is sincerity. "I do make some stupid mistakes and say  some dumb things but there's an honesty," he says. "And people know that I love  them and that I love what I do." Shauna Snow  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'GOOD LORD, NO,' CHAMBER SPOKESWOMAN SAYS;  </P> <P> SHEEN INVITES HOMELESS, ALIENS TO MALIBU  </P> <P> Actor Martin Sheen, appointed honorary mayor of the film star colony of Malibu,  today declared the area a sanctuary for the homeless and a nuclear-free zone.  </P> <P> Homes in the beach colony sell for up to $12 million and give shelter to such  stars as Barbra Streisand, Julie Andrews, Larry Hagman, Dustin Hoffman, Nick  Nolte, Sylvester Stallone and Goldie Hawn.  </P> <P> Sheen, the star of such films as "Apocalypse Now" and "Badlands," issued a  statement saying: "I hereby declare Malibu a nuclear-free zone, a sanctuary for  aliens and the homeless and a protected environment for all life, wild and  tame."  </P> <P> Sheen, 48, has been arrested several times while taking part in anti-nuclear  protests and has also crusaded for the homeless.  </P> <P> The colony's honorary mayor is appointed by the local Chamber of Commerce.  Asked if the chamber had approved Sheen's statement, a startled spokeswoman  replied: "Good Lord, no." She said the chamber intended to hold a meeting to  study the statement.  </P> <P> Sheen succeeded actress Ali MacGraw as honorary mayor. "I hope that by some  miracle Malibu will be able to retain its unique qualities," she said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BRIEFS: GROWTH LIMIT BACKED  </P> <P> Pasadena city officials, despite having their growth-control plan rejected by  voters March 7, will move quickly to carry out the wishes of voters who want  severe limits on apartment, condominium and commercial construction in the city  through the end of the century.  </P> <P> "The voters have spoken and it is now incumbent upon the city board of  directors to implement (the initiative sponsored by Pasadena Residents in  Defense of our Environment) . . . ," said Mayor William E. Thomson Jr., who  opposed the winning initiative.  </P> <P> Voters approved the PRIDE measure 57.2% to 42.8%, while rejecting the city's  rival measure by nearly a 3-to-1 margin. The PRIDE initiative limits  multifamily housing construction to 250 units a year and limits construction of  commercial projects larger than 25,000 square feet to a total of 250,000 square  feet a year. The measure exempts single-family houses, affordable housing and  commercial projects in Pasadena's northwest side. DAVID M. KINCHENFrom staff  reports  </P></p>

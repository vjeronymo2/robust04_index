			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Computing: Pleasures of working in free form EVERY ONCE in a while you come across a software package that has you hooked as soon as you use it. This happened to me in the space of a few days after I received a copy of Info Select in the post. Info Select is a special type of database - called a free-form database. Many top-marque database programs such as dBase, Paradox and DataEase, offer excellent retrieval methods for data conforming to a particular structure. But, much of the information we gather day-to-day has no structure and it is for this type of data that a free-form database is needed. Info Select allows you to create a file with data on all manner of different subjects. Each individual note is held within its own window. The windows are in many ways like an electronic Post-It note but with an ability to record approximately 5,000 words (to typed pages) on each note and to keep up to 64,000 of these notes together in one file or stack. The only overall restriction is the amount of memory available in your computer. If Info Select only recorded notes, then it would have no significant advantage over other word-processor and notepad applications. What makes Info Select so useful is that it can search all those notes for particular words and present you with a subset of the windows to browse. It is not restricted to finding just one string of characters. A feature called neuron searching allows several unconnected strings to be requested. Info Select will find all the windows with the best fit. Perhaps you specify five words to look for and no window has all five. The neuron search will retrieve those windows with any four of the five strings suggested. If you are the sort of person whose telephone hardly stops then, as you are talking to your contact, you can type pertinent notes of the conversation into a window. It may be an inquiry from a potential customer who, initially, just requires literature on your product. A couple of keystrokes will date-stamp the window and then you can type in his name, address and telephone number, the literature he requires and any other things of note. When he rings off you can carry on with what you were doing. Near the end of the day you ask Info Select to print all notes with that date and then get on with replying to all the enquiries. Two weeks later the same person phones and within seconds you can find their last inquiry. They will be impressed. You have remembered them by name and what you discussed. This type of personal service gives customers confidence in ordering from you. There are a myriad of uses for Info Select in a business environment but what about in your private life. You may be a keen gardener and glean information from various newspaper and magazine horticultural features. You may have made notes on all the different plants in your garden when suddenly your roses are plagued with greenfly. All you would have to do is ask Info Select to get all the references relating to roses and greenfly, or aphids, and, almost instantaneously, you will be presented with the windows containing those words to browse through. It would be a subset of the complete gardening file. Info Select may be used as a word processor. As you would expect it does not have the sophistication of Microsoft Word or Wordperfect. But, it can create everyday letters, memos and similar documents with ease and, because of its underlying database nature, it has sophisticated mailmerge features. It can also work with the more structured data of a normal database. Setting up your own data entry screens is simple. So if, as I intend to do, you wish to set up a file on articles culled from newspapers and magazines you can combine the structured nature of a bibliographic database with the free-form nature of notes. Info Select does not need sophisticated computer equipment to run - I have used it on an Amstrad 1512. It does need a hard disk if you are to use it with any seriousness, though it can be run on a twin-floppy machine. The program operates as a TSR (Terminate Stay Resident) so if you are working on your accounts a simple keypress - the default is Alt-J - will call Info Select, where you find the information you require, and a second similar keypress will return you to your accounts package at the point where you left off. The first thing I ask of a software product is: 'Does it fulfil my need?' and secondly 'Is it easy to use?' Info Select meets both these criteria in capitals. The software comes with a good manual, an on-disk tutorial, and context sensitive help via the normal Fl key. A Windows version is available from Monday. Info Select costs Pounds 99.95 plus Pounds 24.54 for VAT, post and packaging from First Hand Software, Manor Studios, Maningford Abbots, Pewsey, Wilts, SN9 6HS tel-0672-63163 fax-0672-64301.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In the view of Free Democratic Party  of Germany [FDP] Chairman Klaus Kinkel, Chancellor Helmut Kohl  showed the will to fight and win with his speech at the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Federal Congress in Hamburg.  The admonitions by the CDU chairman to his opponents in the  party were clear and unmistakable, Kinkel said on Monday [21  February] after a meeting of the FDP Presidium in Bonn. Kohl  has probably laid the foundation for bringing his party out of  the current low in the polls.    According to Kinkel, the FDP emphatically welcomes the fact  that Kohl did not leave any doubt that he wants the coalition of  the CDU/Christian Social Union and FDP to succeed. In addition,  the foreign minister considered it positive that the chancellor  came out against a grand coalition at the federal level.    The FDP politician called on the CDU to make a clear  commitment to Europe at its party congress. There are some  forces in the CDU that want to reinterpret Europe and want  Germany to follow a special path. Kinkel said anyone who wants  to reduce Germany's share in the process of European unification  is cutting off the branch on which he is sitting.</p>

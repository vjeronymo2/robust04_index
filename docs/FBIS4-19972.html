			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Late last night in New York, the United Nations  decided to cut back on its mission in Rwanda. [passage omitted]  Many nonaligned and African nations have criticized this  decision. The Rwandan ambassador to the United Nations wondered  why the United Nations was cutting back on its presence in  Rwanda while in other difficult situations, like Bosnia, it was  bolstering its forces up to 30,000 men. We spoke earlier to  Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, Burundi's interim president, who  deplored the departure of the UN peacekeepers from Rwanda and  reminded the United Nations that human rights knows no race.  [passage omitted]    Many people feel that the international community is  abandoning the Rwandans to their fate. A moment ago, we asked  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe if the West, and France in  particular, had decided to abandon Rwanda:    [Begin Juppe recording] Not at all. You know that diplomatic  efforts are under way, particularly in Uganda, to restart the  Arusha process; in other words, to work toward reconciliation  between the various parties and toward setting up a government  that can share power. A project has been drawn up with this in  mind. It was necessary to adjust the strength of the UN force  in Rwanda, UNAMIR, in order to take account of the situation on  the ground. France was insistent that UN activity should not be  interrupted, but it has been suspended. It will be able to  resume once we have moved forward in talks about a cease-fire  and a return to the Arusha accords. [end recording]</p>

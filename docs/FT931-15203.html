			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cross-party backing for action against Iraq AS THE western allies began a limited air strike against Iraq, the government last night secured effective cross-party support for military action, provided that the measures were in compliance with international law. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, told MPs that Iraq had 'not complied with the representations made to them on the southern no-fly zone, they have violated the border with Kuwait, they have moved missiles into northern Iraq'. He promised that measures taken 'would need to be and would be in full compliance with the international law.' Britain hoped that the Iraqi regime 'will not miscalculate, that the violations of the border will cease immediately . . . and that Iraq will comply with the United Nations,' Mr Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister, later added. For Labour, Mr George Robertson, foreign affairs spokesman, said there was widespread international agreement that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's recent conduct had been 'designed as deliberate and calculated provocation by a despicable regime'. Emphasising there was 'no question at all' that Saddam must comply with the provisions of UN resolutions, he said Labour would continue to support the air exclusion zones and their enforcement. He welcomed the government's assurance that action would be in accordance with international law. Two Labour MPs - Mr Tam Dalyell and Mr George Galloway - formally exempted themselves from the frontbench consensus on last night's action. Mr Dalyell said that Egypt and Bahrain 'do not support us in military action in these circumstances.' Sir David Steel, for the Liberal Democrats, said it was important that the government enjoyed cross-party support for 'whatever action they take in an international context against Saddam Hussein'. Mr Gerald Kaufman, former shadow foreign secretary, said many MPs would support action to ensure Iraq obeyed ceasefire resolutions - 'provided civilians are protected'. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, meanwhile, pressed Mr Hurd regarding newspaper reports that he had 'personally authorised a visit to Britain from people from Iraq to discuss the purchase with GEC of telecommunications systems'. Mr Hurd said it was certain that neither he nor a colleague would authorise action 'which could have led anyone . . . to believe it was correct or possible under our law to break the sanctions of the UN'.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Boeing cuts workforce by 28,000 Boeing, the world's largest commercial jet manufacturer, plans to cut its workforce over the next two years by 28,000, or 20 per cent, because of the worldwide slump in the airline industry, Patrick Harverson reports from New York. Although Boeing originally unveiled plans for major job cuts last month when it announced a significant reduction in aircraft production, the scale of the lay-offs was larger than expected. Boeing said this year about 15,000 jobs will be shed in its home state of Washington, 6,000 will go from its operations in Wichita, Kansas, and another 2,000 or more will be cut from various sites across the US. Some 5,000 or more jobs will be axed in 1994. Boeing will employ about 115,000 people when the lay-off programme is complete. See Lex, Page 24</p>

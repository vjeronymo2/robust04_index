Qiao added that co-operation between the two countries will  surely see faster development in 1994.    He made the remarks in a meeting with Yi Man-sop, speaker of  the National Assembly of the ROK, and his party at the Great  Hall of the People.    Yi and his delegation arrived here today as Qiao's guests.    Qiao noted that China and the ROK have had frequent contacts  in the past, and that since the two countries set up diplomatic  ties two years ago, such contacts, especially economic and trade  ones, have recorded rapid development.    Moreover, the two parliaments have conducted multi-level  exchanges, which have played a positive role in promoting the  mutual understanding and friendship between the two parliaments  and two peoples, Qiao added.    The current visit here by Yi and his delegation will surely  promote the development of Sino-ROK friendship, he said.    The ROK has made remarkable achievements in its national  modernization, Qiao said. "As its neighbor, we are interested in  its economic development," he added.    He said that China welcomes ROK enterprises to invest and  seek co-operation here.    During the meeting Yi expressed gratitude to Qiao for his  invitation.    Yi said the ROK and China have a long tradition of  friendship  and that he had been looking forward to the current trip.    He expressed the belief that ROK-China co-operation would  have an even brighter future.    After the meeting Qiao hosted a banquet in Yi's honor.</p>

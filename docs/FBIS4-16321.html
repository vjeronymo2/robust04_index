			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tuva [Tyva] Republic President Sherig-ool </F> Oorzhak by Viktor Serov; date, place not given: "Accountable to  the People. Tuva Republic President Sherig-ool Oorzhak Answers  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA Correspondent's Questions"]    [Text] [Oorzhak] The political situation in our republic  is stable. Needless to say there are plenty of problems, but  there are no strikes or interethnic friction. We have adopted  our own Constitution -- 54 percent of the registered voters  voted for it. Typically, "Russian" rayons voted in the same way  as "Tuvan" rayons.    [Serov] Does the Tuva Constitution coincide with Russia's  Constitution on the fundamental points?    [Oorzhak] There are three differences -- and fundamental  ones at that. First, we have enshrined the republic's  self-determination -- up to and including secession. But that  does not mean of course that anyone intends to leave Russia  today.    Second, according to last April's referendum, land is not  for  sale in our republic. You can understand why: The republic has  1.5 million livestock that graze throughout its territory and so  it cannot be divided up into squares. Although a decision on  buying and selling land within cities and villages may quite  possibly be adopted in order for people to build homes and for  dacha plots and garages.    Third, we have our own system that determines the conditions  for the existence of all branches of power. The main  requirement here being periodic accountability and  replaceability. Unlike Russian regulations, for instance, a  judge can be elected for a maximum of two five-year terms. But  he can receive a vote of no-confidence prior to that. Any other  approach is impossible in a republic with strong kinship and  clan customs and traditions which may give rise to corruption.  And as president and head of the executive I am  constitutionally strictly accountable.    After the long CPSU monopoly we must particularly defend  democracy in order to ensure that the new generation can grow up  in different -- democratic -- conditions.    [Serov] Is there a guarantee that there will not be forces  wanting to take advantage of the relevant paragraph of Tuva's  Constitution and proclaim the slogan "Let Us Secede!"?    [Oorzhak] There is a guarantee. Our Constitution enshrines  the idea that, on the basis of the Federation Treaty, Tuva is  part of Russia, which acknowledges our republic's sovereignty.    [Serov] What is your attitude toward political and economic  autonomy for parts of Siberia? What are the possible parameters  of this autonomy?    [Oorzhak] Republics, krays, and oblasts must undoubtedly  have equal political and economic rights. As for relations with  the center, the regions must voluntarily delegate to it the  resolution of those problems which they themselves cannot handle  (the army, communications, transportation, power engineering,  higher education, etc).    A law is needed on the mechanism for the implementation of  the Federation Treaty. It is necessary to clearly determine  what is delegated to whom, who tackles what, to whom the land  and mineral deposits belong, and the center's role. The  adoption of this law can be organized by the upper chamber of  parliament and the Committee for Federation Affairs, the  Federation Treaty, and Regional Policy.</p>

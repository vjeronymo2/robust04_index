			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Scientists fight bill on French language France's scientific establishment yesterday made a last-ditch effort to water down the government's controversial new language bill by appealing to the national assembly not to make French compulsory in conferences where non-French speaking scientists are in the majority. Mr Jacques Toubon, the culture minister, has presented his language bill - requiring the use of French in contracts, product labelling, advertising and the media as well as in conferences held in France - as essential to preserving the French language from the onslaught of what he calls anglo-marchand, or business English. Otherwise, French would eventually go the way of Latin and ancient Greek, he warned MPs this week. The national assembly was due late last night to take a final vote on the bill, which passed the Senate last month. One of its clauses, Article 5, would require the interpretation and translation into French of papers and proceedings of any conference organised by French citizens in France, though other languages could equally be used. An amendment to limit this requirement only to conferences receiving government support was defeated in the senate. The Toubon bill has pitted France's august 'academies' against each other. The Academie Francaise strongly backs the bill but its sister institution, the Academie des Sciences, yesterday returned to the fray against Article 5, urging deputies to limit it to conferences where French scientists are 'in a large majority'. French scientists, notably the Pasteur Institute and the science academy itself, already carry articles in English as well as in French in their publications. The science academy said yesterday that in big conferences which France has promoted in cities such as Paris and Nice, 'it would be practically impossible to ensure a French version of resumes and financially impossible to ensure simultaneous translation'. The whole point of such conferences was to spread the findings of French science throughout the world, the academy said, and this was often only possible through the medium of English. Though the bill is sure to go through in some form, the conservative government ironically finds itself backed solidly by the communists, but with many sceptics about the bill among its own backbenchers, as well as among opposition Socialists. Mr Pierre Lellouche, a Gaullist RPR deputy whose English is excellent, said that while French undoubtedly needed to be saved from further 'degradation', he doubted that the use of it could be legislated. Mr Didier Mathus, a Socialist deputy, queried whether the image of French needing to be 'protected by a policeman with a big stick' was the right one for the health of the language.</p>

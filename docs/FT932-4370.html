			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil consortium formed to explore onshore field in north-west China A CONSORTIUM of four oil companies has been formed to bid to explore and develop a potentially vast onshore field in the Tarim Basin, north-west China, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group official said in London yesterday. The consortium comprises Shell and Amoco Corporation, with 36 per cent each, Total, with 18 per cent, and Marubeni Corporation with 10 per cent. The consortium has filed an application with China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corporation, the official said. The Chinese government announced in February that bidding would be opened to foreign companies for its onshore reserves. The deadline for compnies to submit bids is the end of October. Companies are understood to be worried, however, about the vast cost of developing such a remote region and about political risks.</p>

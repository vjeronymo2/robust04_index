			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with TEC representative Mac Maharaj, SACP </F> National Chairman Joe Slovo, and IFP representative Dr. Ziba  Jiyane in the Durban studio and Foreign Minister Pik Botha via  telephone by announcer Freek Robinson on the "Agenda" program --  live, in English; italicized passages in Afrikaans]    [Text] [Robinson] Good evening. The Transitional  Executive Council [TEC] is increasingly in the news following  its action in Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, and now also in kwaZulu.  Questions are also being asked about the council's  accountability concerning its relations with government and how  it makes its decisions. Well, to comment on this issue I have  with me in the studio Mr. Mac Maharaj from the Transitional  Executive Council [TEC] and also Mr. Joe Slovo of the  SACP [South African Communist Party], whom we will be talking to  a little later, and then Dr. Ziba Jiyane of the Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP] in our Durban studio. We are also linked  by telephone with Minister Pik Botha. I would like to begin  with Minister Pik Botha. Can you hear me Minister Botha?    [Botha] Yes, Freek, I hear you clearly.    [Robinson] Minister Botha, let us first refer to  today's developments. What is the latest information you have  concerning developments in Ciskei?    [Botha] It was a very tense day, and I was continually  in contact with President de Klerk and President Mandela to try  and defuse the tense situation today, where people gathered at  the stadium. At one stage we were concerned for Brigadier  Gqozo's life. It seems that at the end of the day things  improved. Mr. Mandela gave me the assurance this morning that  he would contact the ANC [African National Congress]  official in the Ciskei to ask the people to leave the stadium  and to conduct themselves in an orderly manner, so actually  today was an example of what can be achieved if the ANC and the  government work together.    [Robinson] We heard tonight on the news that you  expressed concern at the general spirit of uprising and violence  in the country. What do you mean by this?    [Botha] Well, everywhere...[pauses]  Yesterday in Mabopane, the Bophuthatswana police handed out  title deeds typed on ordinary paper, not worth anything, and the  black civilians thought that these were their title deeds --  developments in Ciskei, developments in Bophuthatswana, the  developments in kwaZulu -- and kwaZulu is not Bophuthatswana or  Ciskei. KwaZulu is something big, monumental, and serious and  cannot be pushed over. This is not a picnic. This is a huge,  serious situation, and throughout the country, in all  communities, people are buying canned foods, paraffin, candles.  They are scared of the future. This is worrying. I must be  honest with you. This is worrying -- the fear in the hearts of  our people. I feel that there should be a plan of action  through which political differences should be of lesser  importance in South Africa's interest. If we do not grow  economically then it does not matter which political party  wins.    [Robinson] Minister Botha, would you say that this fear  and the recent developments are spontaneous, or not?    [Botha] The problem is that people are faced with  uncertainty and political parties are making statements of a  wild and aggressive nature, and the people hearing this do not  know, they do not know what type of decisions to make, how to  vote. They do not know in what direction we are moving. They  do not know where we are heading, and this is a shame, and I  foresee problems because the outside world will come here.  Heads of state -- after election day -- they will come here for  the inauguration. After that they will depart and leave us  alone, and we must decide now what is most important for us. I  am really concerned. Tonight, I must tell you honestly, I am  concerned about the spirit of uncertainty throughout South  Africa.    [Robinson] Mr. Botha, thank you. I would like you to  stay linked to us by telephone and for you to listen to our  discussion so that you can also participate. Could I go to  you, Dr. Jiyane, in Durban?    [Jiyane] Yes, sir.    [Robinson] I have spoken to Minister Botha. I don't know how  much of that you could hear or understand, but basically he said  that he was very worried about the general spirit of violence in  the country. I asked him the question, whether he thought that  it was spontaneous and with due respect to the minister we  didn't get a very clear answer on that. What is your assessment?    [Jiyane] Well, my assessment is clear in that you are seeing  here the fifth column in action, that is in communist lingo,  that means the destabilization efforts that are orchestrated by  the South African Communist Party-ANC alliance.    [Robinson] How do you know that?    [Jiyane] Well, we know because, here in kwaZulu, we have  clear evidence that they are planning the same thing.    [Robinson] Who?    [Jiyane] The ANC and the South African Communist Party.    [Robinson] What evidence do you have?    [Jiyane] Well, you are going to hear from the Goldstone  Commission. We have evidence of documents that have been  written by the Communist Party in which they outline exactly  what they are doing now, which of course, true to their, what  you call, character, they will deny publicly but you will see  they will do exactly that which is in that document because it  is orchestrated by them.    [Robinson] Well, Mr. Slovo, according to Dr. Jiyane, true  to your character you will deny that?    [Slovo] Well, I do deny it, not because it's true to my  character, but because the document is a fraud. And anyone  reading that document carefully would conclude that. I could  give a few examples.    [Robinson] Please do?    [Slovo] For example, the document talks about  reincorporating  kwaZulu into South Africa. I think even a member of ours who  has been a member for a week will know that kwaZulu is in South  Africa. It also talks about chiefs being reactionary  institutions which we must take under our wing, and that goes  completely contrary to everything we've done in the negotiating  process, to the provisions of the interim constitution. We've  recognized chieftainship, something which both the ANC and the  South African Communist Party have supported and will continue  to support.    [Robinson] Mr. Slovo, the reason why you are here tonight,  obviously is as the result of this document, and then also Mr.  Maharaj, to talks to us about the powers of the TEC and how we  can resolve these issues, to have free and fair elections which  is after all the task of the TEC. Now can I refer you to the  statement made tonight by the ANC, and you are in alliance with  the ANC, and whatever you might deny about this document, the  fact of the matter is that the tension in the country is rising  and one might say that having mass action at this time is just  going to add to the tension?    [Slovo] Well, you know this cliche of mass action and  rolling  mass action must be examined. Because the dividing line between  what people call mass action, and the right of people to assert  their democratic right to march, to have meetings, to protest,  that line is very thin indeed, and if we take this concept of  stopping mass action completely, what we are really saying, or  what some people are saying, is that political activity must  stop.    [Robinson] Mr. Slovo: But Mr. Radebe, who is one of the most  prominent leaders of the ANC in Natal, himself talked about mass  action, and he is launching a campaign?    [Slovo] Well, there is nothing wrong with mass action. It  was mass action by the Bophuthatswana Defense Force and Police  and civil servants which corrected the historic injustice of  Bophuthatswana. It doesn't have to be accompanied by violence,  unfortunately in that case violence asserted itself in the  initial stages. Now it's mass action today in the Ciskei by the  civil servants and so on, which resulted in Gqozo stepping down  and handing over to the TEC. Now, all that is mass action.  There is nothing wrong with mass action as long as it is not  accompanied by violence and is in accordance with the democratic  norms of political activity and protests.    [Robinson] Would you say that mass action in itself does not  in any way add to the tension?    [Slovo] It can. It obviously can. It depends what kind of  mass action. If you want to know the kind of mass action that  adds to tension, it's when Mandela wants to go and visit the  king and you see IFP organizing 10,000 people, many of them  armed with bazookas and AKs, that kind of mass action obviously  adds to the tension.    [Robinson] But no mass action by the ANC, that could not add  to tension?    [Slovo] Well, obviously there have been occasions when,  during the course of mass action, all kinds of events have  occurred which one does not approve of. There is a danger, but  it's the duty of organizations to ensure that it doesn't spill  over into illegalities and violence.    [Robinson] Dr. Jiyane in Durban, do you accept the right of  people, spontaneously or otherwise to go into the streets and to  voice their feelings?    [Jiyane] Yes, as long as they know that all rights go with  responsibility or duty. Duty to keep the peace, and not be  violent.    [Slovo, interrupting] And to let the other organizations  have  their meetings in the stadium and not occupy them before their  speakers arrive.    [Robinson] Mr. Maharaj, you want to come in?    [Maharaj] I was going to say, Freek, one of the critical  problems facing the country is the question of free political  activity. We are 35 days from the elections. The right of  people to vote or not vote is one that is fundamental. The  problems that are arising, are for example, we need all  administrations, all government departments to make available  schools, police stations etc, available to the IEC [Independent  Electoral Commission] for the conduct of the elections. We have  a problem, the kwaZulu administration so far refused, now if Dr.  Jiyane could make that commitment tonight, I'd be happy to hear  it. In keeping with the agreement his leader made with Mr.  Mandela that there will be free political activity, those who  want to vote will be allowed to vote, those who don't want to  vote need not vote. Will the schools, buildings, resources  available to the kwaZulu administration be available to the IEC  for polling purposes?    [Robinson] Let's hear your response to that, Dr. Jiyane.    [Jiyane] Well, if you listened the news tonight, you would  have heard that our leadership in Ulundi told Judge Kriegler  about the fact that we are open, we voted for this in  parliament, we are open to that, but he pointed out that schools  here that are still left, that were saved from the UDF [United  Democratic Front] onslaught when they burned schools because  they thought in the ashes of bourgeois society they will build a  new society. Now those schools that are still remaining are run  by parents here who pay their own money. The fact that the  leadership has agreed does not mean that on the ground the  parents will necessarily agree.    [Robinson] I think Dr. Jiyane, the specific question is:  Will  you be willing to put to the control of the IEC all of those  officials buildings that are in kwaZulu-Natal?    [Jiyane] That's what our leadership said tonight.    [Maharaj] Can I ask you the same question connected with  free  political activity. The kwaZulu administration has sent out a  circular to all civil servants to report to Ulundi on the 27th  and 28th of April. Those are election dates. Surely, if you  are committed to allowing people to exercise the vote, you  should not be calling civil servants to such a meeting on those  two days because you are directly challenging their right to  exercise the vote on that day. Will you withdraw that circular  and instructions?    [Jiyane] Well, no, that circular is neither here nor there.  That circular I'm not aware of it, nor other authorities that I  work with are aware of it. It's just a figment of imagination  by some people. Why would we do such a thing? And in any case  of course, the kwaZulu government as long as it is in authority,  it has the right to talk to its civil servants, but I don't  think what is being said here is true in specific terms.    [Robinson] Since you do not know, let's leave that for a  moment. Mr. Botha, do you want to comment on the issue of  mass action?    [Botha] Yes, I think that there are entirely wrong  impressions created tonight. The people in Bophuthatswana and  Ciskei and elsewhere want their pensions because they do not  trust a new government. It is no consolation for Mr. Joe Slovo  or Mac Maharaj. It actually means a lack of trust in them, and  the sooner they realize that, the better. There is uncertainty  in the minds of the people, and the whole program here tonight  is once again occupied with touchy, petty issues while the basic  facts of the country are that Inkatha and the ANC are engaged in  a war against each other. These are the simple facts. And  unless these two leaders and these two parties reach an  agreement to create peace, South Africa on the whole will pay  the price.    We have to stop now with these touchy and petty debates  and nonsense. These are the facts of the matter. Inkatha is in  war with the ANC. These are the facts. This is how the world  sees it. This is what every international visitor has told me.  Mr. Maharaj talks a lot about free political activity, but  Holomisa says the National Party may not hold a gathering in the  Transkei. What is he doing about that? Why does the TEC not  step in and say give all parties in the Transkei the right to  conduct free, active politics? They are too scared to  intervene.    [Maharaj] I think Mr. Botha could control his language. I  was speaking in a very controlled way. I'd like to remind him  that he and I went to Bophuthatswana, and we went there  precisely because by working together, we present the most  credible face to control the situation. Insofar as he alleges  the matter to the ANC, let me ask him: His deputy minister has  condemned the IEC, the Independent Election Commission, drawing  inferences of betraying credibility in them. This is from a  government minister. I did not want to raise this but in the  tone that he raises it, is he prepared to repudiate today his  own deputy minister who has been on record, Deputy Minister Fick  from regional government. Secondly...    [Robinson] Can we have a response from Mr. Botha, then I  would like to follow up on questions also raised.    [Botha] I do not know what my deputy minister said. I  am saying what the government's standpoint is.    [Maharaj] A deputy minister is a member of the  government.    [Botha] No, it is not so. He is not a member of the  cabinet. And I think it is unfair because he is not here with me  to say exactly what he said.    [Robinson] Let us skip that matter, Mr. Botha. I just  want to follow up on some of the things that you said. And  Mr. Maharaj will remember that at the beginning of this program  I referred specifically to the TEC and the powers that you do  have. Now it seems to me with all great respect that the  perception is rife that you are trying to assert your powers in  Bophuthatswana, that you are doing so in Ciskei, that you are in  the process of trying to do so in kwaZulu, but that we do not  see the evidence that you are trying to do so in Transkei, to  see to it that there is free and fair political activity in that  country.    [Maharaj] The TEC so far has addressed the question of  Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, kwaZulu, and the general question of  free political activity, and that is with the participation of  Minister Botha's government, with their agreement, and we are  addressing that question in terms that are extremely serious.  Now Minister Botha knows that. He knows also that the NP  complaint on the question of Transkei is under discussion and is  being dealt with.    [Robinson] By whom?    [Maharaj] By the TEC, as well as the IEC, as well as the  response. In particular the Transkei has responded to the  complaint and said one of the problems they have is security.  This is a reason that Minister Botha will understand, that when  the question of security arises as it has arisen in  Bophuthatswana, it had to be dealt with. And in particular they  are saying there are specific problems, and they accept the  right of the NP. What we have to do is to facilitate....    [Robinson, interrupting] What can you do? What are you going  to do?    [Maharaj] In particular, we have brought the Transkei into  discussion with the South African Government. We have  encouraged them to resolve this matter peacefully. In the case  of Bophuthatswana, we sought to resolve it peacefully, and in  the end it became necessary when the Mangope government lost  control to remove him from power and put an administration in  place. In the case of the Ciskei, it is Brig. Gqozo who  appealed to the TEC, including Minister Botha, and Minister  Botha referred it to the TEC to say he cannot control the  situation. And then we stepped in. We never tried to step in  as the TEC, steamrollering the process and disrespecting the  institutions that exist.    [Robinson] Mr. Botha, do you want to respond?    [Botha] Yes. Where I agree with Mr. Maharaj: Within  five weeks from now we must form a government of national unity  in any case. So I do not want to be technical. I think it is  better that the TEC and we should work very closely, and on some  important matters there has been that cooperation which I  appreciate, but the one point which I want to mention here: It  is not acceptable to me that the Transkei does not allow us --  and it is not acceptable to me that Mr. Maharaj is putting the  blame on security reasons, which means that we may  not campaign in Transkei because our people are going to be  shot. But at the same time they are demanding action in kwaZulu  -- it is just not acceptable.    [Robinson] What would you suggest the TEC do  specifically to ensure that you have the freedom that you would  like to have?    [Botha] The TEC must take a decision to inform the  Transkei government they must fall in line with the norms and  standards and the TEC's objective aims -- namely, that all  parties have the right to campaign there freely.    [Robinson] Would you say there is a difference in  approach with the TEC regarding Transkei, vis-a-vis the others  where they have already acted?    [Botha] No, because my own colleagues are sitting in  the TEC, and I know that they are fighting for this. All that I  am asking is: Please treat Transkei exactly the same as  Bophuthatswana and Ciskei.    [Slovo] I presume Minister Botha doesn't mean by that that  we  should take over the Transkei with administrators. What he  means is that we should be egalitarian in our approach. And I  agree with that, but if I could come back to something else that  he said about the war between the ANC and the IFP. What he has  omitted to mention is that that war has also a third factor in  it, and that has come out clearly in the recent Goldstone  report, and Minister Botha didn't refer to that even though the  evidence is prima face at the moment. We've been saying it for  years that this violence is very much instigated by elements  within the security forces. The train violence, the murders  that are taking place, the instigation on the ground between the  various forces. I'd like Minister Botha to say something about  that because he has completely omitted that and like Minister  Kriel, all he does is talk about the war between the ANC and the  IFP. The people who pull the trigger on the ground might be  black, but behind it there are many other hands coming from the  security services.    [Robinson] Could you react to that? And then I  would like to have the comments of Dr. Jiyane, as well.    [Botha] But of course, Mr. Mandela phoned me this  morning and briefed me about attacks on ANC institutions and  people who fled to the sugarcane fields. I agreed with him and  I said to him we have to end this violence. What I want to say  frankly here is: Those generals in the police are entitled --  and I hope Mr. Slovo and Mr. Maharaj will agree with me -- they  are entitled to a public hearing of their side of the story. I  am sorry to say tonight that I do not agree with a procedure  where people who have been charged cannot seek legal  representatives. Where a case is conducted behind the  scenes....    [Robinson, interrupting] You are referring to Mr.  Goldstone?    [Botha] Of course. I want to be very frank with you.  Let these things be exposed -- Mr. Slovo is right there. Let  it be opened up so that the people involved can get a fair  chance to state his case in the presence of all South Africa's  media, with legal representatives, because that is freedom.    [Robinson] I do not think anyone will argue about that  particular point. But Mr. Botha, the point made here by Mr.  Slovo is the specific allegations which have been made about the  government's involvement in destabilization, and with great  respect, I must also tell you tonight that we really tried in  this program to get a view from the government for the last few  days and nobody has as yet given it to us.    [Botha] But I will state the view. No entity in  South Africa has worked so hard -- and I sit in the cabinet and  I know President de Klerk, and I know what goes on -- to get  down to the truth. I promise you this and I promise South  Africa here tonight, to us it is a case of extreme seriousness.  What can we gain as a party or government from such acts? We  condemn it. And all that I am asking is: Let it be tried  according to the legal system of a civilized country.    [Robinson] Dr. Jiyane, could you come in specifically on the  question of complicity by Inkatha and the kwaZulu government in  so-called third force activities?    [Jiyane] Yes, this is yet another example of the hypocrisy  and double standards that the TEC is all about. It was  originally intended to level the playing fields, but it is  clearly there now to serve the African National Congress and the  government. Take for example, you know that the IFP has lost  about 400 leaders and thousands of its members, and we don't  know who are the hit squads that are killing these people. Not  a word has been said about that. Now, you also know that there  are things called defense units which the late Comrade Chris  Hani already pointed out that many of them were being used by  police, and those have killed hundreds of IFP people, and even  ANC Youth League leaders have been killed by the SDU's  [self-defense units], given guns by the police some of them. Now  because the whole aim of this so-called transition and TEC is to  favor the ANC against others, we are hearing all these things  from the Goldstone Commission that is such a willing partner to  this communist plot.    [Robinson] Dr. Jiyane, I have listened to you, and it's  clear  to me, with all due respect to all of you, that you are just  going to accuse each other here tonight. Neither of you is  going to admit to anything.    [Jiyane] If it is true that there are hit squads or even  suspected hit squads in kwaZulu, but don't you at least take it  as fair to ask who are killing IFP leaders -- 200 of them -- if  there aren't hit squads of the MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of  the Nation; ANC military wing] and the SDU's and reports have  revealed this, but that is beyond any examination because those  are immune....    [Robinson, interrupting] Dr. Jiyane, could I say, as a South  African myself, that I'm deeply concerned about the violence, in  particular as you will know also today that a peace monitor has  been shot down, and that was an Inkatha man, now obviously that  must be condemned. Could I just ask you that it is clear to me  that I have been through many of these debates that nobody  admits to anything, and we have just accusations. Can I ask you  Mr. Maharaj what the TEC can do to try to bring some order now,  free and fair elections, and whether you will be fair in your  own conduct.    [Maharaj] Freek, I think that the situation in Natal is one  of the sharpest ones in the country. The violence is escalating  at an unacceptable rate, and there is no free political  activity. The TEC in addressing this question has put two  proposals that can solve the problem peacefully and in the  interest of the people and the country. One, it has called open  the kwaZulu government and the Natal Provincial Administration,  and all other administrations to cooperate with the IEC, the  TEC, and the South African Government in realizing free  political activity. Secondly, it has called on all government  departments, civil servants components to participate in the  rationalization process, and to cooperate as a means to ensuring  their own futures through the implementation of the new  constitution. These are two issues that could bring about  stability in the current disquiet and the current violence.    [Robinson] Dr. Jiyane, what can you do as some high-ranking  official of Inkatha to try to ensure peace.    [Jiyane] We can only repeat that which was repeated before.  All people of South Africa have the right to have an input in an  inclusive constitution that must bring peace in this country.  As long as the TEC and the IEC, which are clearly favoring the  ANC, which are very shy to investigate the ANC's intimidation of  the National party, DP [Democratic Party], and everybody else,  with such alarming alacrity they jump to investigate the IFP  because that's the whole aim. As long as such double standards  exist and persist, there is not a hope for any free and fair  elections.    [Robinson] But will you yourself promote it?    [Jiyane] We ourselves have promoted that for all our  history.  We still do now, but we have said we will not be held  responsible when the anger of the people at the grassroots level  -- here in particular in kwaZulu/Natal -- is such that nobody  can control it, because they know that they have a king whom  they love, and he's been disregarded, ignored. In fact, the TEC  thinks that it has more claim over this land than even the king.  The anger of the people of this region will show the people who  are so stupidly disregarding us that that which was done in the  19th century, and the Zulus stood up, will be repeated now. You  will never destroy the spirit of the people to resist.    [Robinson] Thank you Dr. Jiyane. Those are very grave  words. Mr. Slovo, if you can do so, please refrain from  reacting and making counter accusations. What can we do to  resolve this situation and have peace?    [Slovo] The key situation at the moment is the situation in  kwaZulu. And in order to have peace, it is necessary to ensure  that the people of kwaZulu, who, according to the latest poll --  even the IFP supporters--the majority of them want to  participate in the election, have a free and fair right to take  part in that election. Mr. Jiyane has said that they want a  certain kind of constitution, and people have a right to a  certain constitution. Yes, but basically at the moment in the  coming 35 days, the basic rights that people must have is a  right to vote without intimidation, and without threats of  violence. Mr. Jiyane has repeated some of the statements of his  chief minister which amount to thinly-veiled threats of drowning  the process in blood, and that must stop.    [Robinson] Our time has run out, but I must give Minister  Botha an opportunity. Mr. Botha, it seems to me like a  considerably bad situation. What can you and the government do  to ensure that peace will be restored?    [Botha] We appeal to all parties: Please come to your  senses. The future of this country depends on economic  development, to give people jobs, to open new factories, to get  the international community to come and invest. I am appealing  to all, please settle your differences. My appeal is, people of  South Africa -- black, white, Indian, colored -- let us join  hands and create a new South Africa. Let us stop with these  disturbing debates on differences and hatred and envy and  killings, and look past the election to a new South Africa. I  blame no one, not Inkatha, not the ANC. I am appealing to the  ANC and Inkatha, please throw your weapons in the ocean as Mr.  Mandela once said. Let us build this new South Africa.    [Robinson] Thank you Mr. Botha, our time is up. I  thank you for the sober words. Thank you very much to all  of you for your participation tonight. Thank you Dr. Jiyane in  Durban. I hope from the bottom of my heart that all of you who  are in power at the moment, in a position of influence can make  some contribution. Thank you very much, we'll see you next time.  Goodbye.</p>

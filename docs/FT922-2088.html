			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: NFC There is something comfortably predictable about NFC. In announcing flat first-half profits of Pounds 45m, it confirmed its forecast of Pounds 90m-Pounds 100m for the year. It also gave the City no particular reason to question the forecast. That may explain the 4 per cent jump in the shares yesterday. Recent weakness has been above all due to fears that NFC would not escape the downgrades to which much of the rest of the transport sector has been subject. Granted, the company could do with some economic recovery to boost its truck rental and home removal business. Its figures point to some improvement between the first and second quarters, but that may be mostly due to a heavier bill for redundancies in the first quarter. Nor should one read too much into the planned additions to its rental fleet. Trucks can be sold as well as bought. NFC's current appeal owes something to the fact that it is less of a cyclical stock than other companies in this sector. Its logistics division is a leading player in the growing dedicated distribution market which is both difficult for competitors to enter and relatively recession proof. On the basis of its own forecast, NFC is on a prospective multiple of about 18. That is not particularly expensive, but other transport companies may eventually have more recovery potential.</p>

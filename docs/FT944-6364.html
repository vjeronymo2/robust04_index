			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Sinn Fein barred from forum Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, will not be allowed to attend an important Belfast investment conference. The decision emerged yesterday as cabinet ministers involved in the Northern Ireland peace process met in London for the first time since the collapse of the Dublin coalition. The move reinforced the mounting impression at Whitehall that preliminary talks between the government and Sinn Fein are unlikely to start before the conference, which will be held on December 13 and 14 and is to be launched by Mr John Major, the prime minister. The Northern Ireland Office denied that yesterday's decision had any bearing on the starting date for the talks, which the government has promised would begin before Christmas. But Sinn Fein attacked the move, saying it was 'another stalling tactic by the British government in its efforts to reduce the momentum of the peace process'. Meeting at Downing Street, ministers are understood to have discussed both the prospect of talks with Sinn Fein and progress on the so-called UK-Irish framework document which will form the basis for future talks involving Ulster's main political parties. Senior civil servants have continued to make headway on the document in spite of the power vacuum in Dublin. But they are understood to have gone as far as possible with-out further ministerial guidance. Three main sticking points remain: Article two of the Irish Republic's constitution, enshrining Dublin's territorial claim over the province. The so-called 'European dimension' dealing with how relations between the north and south of the island and the rest of Europe are handled. The so-called 'default mechanism' dealing with the handling of reservations about decisions made by the planned Ulster assembly. Dublin is understood to have argued that this mechanism should take the form of a joint committee of the Anglo-Irish conference. London wants both governments to be able to examine such reservations separately. Meanwhile in Dublin, another adjournment of the Irish Republic's parliament seems likely today with political parties still unable to agree terms for a new coalition in the wake of the collapse of the 22-month Fianna Fail and Labour government and the resignation of Mr Albert Reynolds as prime minister. Fianna Fail, the largest partner in the outgoing government, last night seemed close to initiating formal negotiations with Labour. However Mr Bertie Ahern, Fianna Fail leader, is coming under pressure from within his party to take a tough line with Labour.</p>

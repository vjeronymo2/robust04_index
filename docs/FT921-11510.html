			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Intl Resort dives by 78% to Pounds 368,000 Interim pre-tax profits tumbled 78 per cent to Pounds 368,000 at International Resort Holdings as the golf course and leisure group again passed its interim dividend. Profits would have been even lower but for a Pounds 161,000 (Pounds 214,000) exceptional gain on the sale of the nursing home division. Earnings per share tumbled by 3.5p to 1.5p. Mr Stephen Alexander, chairman, said the board intended to maintain the final dividend, as current trading levels were satisfactory. Turnover in the period to September 30 fell from Pounds 8.08m to Pounds 3m, partly because of the sale. However, the greatest decline came in the development division, which builds golf courses. Mr Alexander said development had been reined in to avoid an increase in debt, which was Pounds 12m (Pounds 24m) at the half-year. He also warned that the profit outlook for this division was uncertain, as necessary development contracts had not yet been signed. Development sales fell by Pounds 2.42m to Pounds 1.38m. The operations division, which encompasses golf course and hotel management, increased sales by 66 per cent to Pounds 771,000. Mr Alexander also announced the intention to take over EGP Sports, which would form the basis of the new merchandising and events division. Total cost of the purchase would not exceed Pounds 1m. EGP holds a 50 per cent stake in PGA Merchandising, a joint venture with the Professional Golfers' Association, and 50 per cent of the English Open Golf Championship.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Watson Can Compare"] </F>   [Text] During the past decade Alexander Watson, U.S.  Assistant Secretary of State for Hemispheric Affairs, lived in  Peru for three years. He thus has first-hand knowledge with  which he can compare the Peruvian human rights record at that  time with the current situation, and can help unveil lies. For  example, he can check the responsibility of organizations like  Americas Watch, whose director a short time ago wondered on a  Lima radio station -- according to a report sent by Aprodeh  [Peruvian Human Rights Association] -- "how much more is  necessary to make the Fujimori government substantially change  its policies concerning human rights and democracy."    However, rather than placing the emphasis on such  ostentatious and unacceptable expressions, the important thing  now is to ask Ambassador Watson to himself compare the  antisubversive policy and the human rights policy in force when  he was ambassador to Peru with the current policy in those  areas. He should then conclude which of those policies  preserves human rights. He should also reflect on whether it is  not actually true that human rights are now more respected than  they were four, seven, or 10 years ago.    It is true for a simple reason, which we will tirelessly  repeat: There is a consistent antisubversive strategy that is  based precisely on a systematic alliance with people: on  respectful treatment, "civic support," and help for their  defense organizations; on intelligence work that does not make  use of violence; on a system of summary trials which has become  more flexible, and has in fact prevented all attempts to take  justice "into one's own hands"; and last but not least, on legal  pincers made up of strong penalties with a simultaneous legal  path toward repentance.    If there is anything on which almost all Peruvians agree, it  is that this strategy should not be modified, and even less so  "substantially" modified, as Americas Watch put it. Contrary to  what had happened up until four years ago, people no longer feel  terror of the Armed Forces. Now people invite them, help them.  No one wants to change this policy. It turned out to be  positive and successful precisely because it is based on respect  for people's human rights.    No one is in a better position than Ambassador Watson  himself, who is acquainted with the previous situation, to make  this comparison, to verify how far the Peruvian human rights  record has advanced over the past three years, and consequently  to verify the magnitude of the lies of those who charge that  Peru has adopted a systematic human rights violation "pattern."  Quite the contrary. There is a tremendous difference with  previous times: in the treatment given to people, in the  penalties imposed on terrorists, in the treatment of prison  inmates, and in participation by the people.    Ambassador Watson can help dismantle this gigantic infamy  against Peru, this disinformation campaign which, far from  recognizing and praising this substantial progress, has ignored  -- we do not know whether deliberately -- that the great news in  Peru is not the La Cantuta Prison case, because there were  dozens of cases like this in the 1980's, but the implementation  of the strategy based on support for the people and on respect  for their human rights.    This is how the Armed Forces fortunately understood things  in  1990, and it is what the international community should praise,  instead of condemning.</p>

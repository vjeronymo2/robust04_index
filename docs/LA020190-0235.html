			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PACT OR NO TRAINING CAMPS, OWNERS SAY;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: LAWYER MAKES THREAT AS PLAYERS UNION COMPLAINS THAT IT IS BEING  IGNORED.  </P> <P> The chief negotiator for baseball's owners said today that spring training  camps will not open unless both sides agree on an outline for a new collective  bargaining agreement.  </P> <P> Chuck O'Connor, general counsel of the owners' Player Relations Committee, made  the statement in response to a question at the end of a nearly two-hour  briefing for reporters on the proposal being pushed by the owners.  </P> <P> The first players are scheduled to report for spring training Feb. 15. Asked  what would happen if there is no agreement by then, O'Connor said  unequivocally, "The camps will not open."  </P> <P> After the briefing, the union and management began their 15th negotiating  session in an effort to replace the contract that expired Dec. 31. The sides  had met Wednesday without progress as the owners continued to argue in favor of  their revenue-sharing proposal.  </P> <P> "I'm a little frustrated with it," union Executive Director Donald Fehr said  after Wednesday's three-hour session. "Their strategy is to talk about their  stuff. It's clear they are not of a mind to seriously discuss the players'  proposal."  </P> <P> The sides are to negotiate three more times next week before owners meet in  Chicago on Friday.  </P> <P> Management's plan calls for the players to get 48% of the revenue from ticket  sales and broadcast contracts. The proposal is tied to a pay-for-performance  plan that calls for players with fewer than six years in the major leagues to  be paid according to statistical formulas.  </P> <P> The owners withdrew their proposed change in the collusion language that would  have made it harder for the union to prove its cases.  </P> <P> Fehr said the union's proposals on economic issues did not get any "meaningful"  response, but he emphasized that the talks still are at an early stage.  </P> <P> "The season is not going to be canceled tomorrow, I hope," he said.  </P> <P> The players are asking that the minimum salary rise from $68,000 to between  $100,000 and $125,000, that the service time for salary arbitration be reduced  from three years to two, that team rosters go back to 25 players from 24 and  that draft-pick compensation for certain free agents be dropped.  </P> <P> "They're not willing to agree to any of the suggestions we've made," Fehr said.  "The reason, they say, is cost, but they can't quantify the cost."  </P> <P> Owners say they need revenue sharing because they fear there will be a gap in  income between teams from large and small cities. But they have been unable to  tell the union when they think it will happen.  </P> <P> "We're looking for the rationale," Fehr said, adding that the owners' inability  to pinpoint their problem "does take the urgency off it."  </P></p>

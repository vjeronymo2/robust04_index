			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BARDOT ONLY BELIEVES IN 'VERITE'  </P> <P> Brigitte Bardot, French cinema's best-known sex symbol, said today that she  would not care if all but one of her dozens of films disappeared.  </P> <P> "Everything I appeared in during that period can disappear forever; I couldn't  care less," Bardot, 55, told the newspaper Liberation in a rare interview.  </P> <P> "If only one trace of my passage on screen remained, I wish it was in 'La  Verite' (The Truth) . . . where I truly felt I was a real actress," said  Bardot, now a leading animal rights campaigner.  </P> <P> Filmed in 1960 by Henri-Georges Clouzot, "La Verite" portrayed a real incident  in which a young Frenchwoman murdered her lover. It won an Oscar for best  foreign film.  </P> <P> "For me, the cinema is linked to such confusion in my (personal) life that I  never wish to hear about it again and, obviously, never want to act again,"  said Bardot, whose last screen appearance was in 1973.  </P></p>

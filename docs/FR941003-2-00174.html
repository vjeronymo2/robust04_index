			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. The Agreement will not obligate a Fund to retain the services of a trustee, nor will it obligate a Fund to pay any particular level of fees to any trustee. The proposed arrangements will not affect the voting rights of any of the Funds' shareholders. If a Fund purchases Underlying Securities issued by another Fund, the purchasing Fund will vote such shares in proportion to the votes of all other holders of shares of such affiliated Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants believe that the deferred fee arrangements are in the best interests of each Fund and its shareholders, and that the arrangements will enhance the ability of the Funds to attract and retain high caliber trustees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Sections 18(a) and 18(c) restrict the ability of a registered closed-end investment company to issue senior securities. Similarly, section 18(f)(1) generally prohibits a registered open-end investment company from issuing senior securities. Section 13(a)(2) requires that any registered investment company obtain shareholder authorization before issuing any senior securities not contemplated by the recitals of policy in its registration statement. Applicants contend that the Agreement possesses none of the characteristics of senior securities that led Congress to enact these sections. The Agreement would not: (a) Induce speculative investments or provide opportunities for manipulative allocation of the expenses and profits of a Fund; (b) affect control of a Fund; (c) confuse investors or convey a false impression of safety; or (d) be inconsistent with the theory of mutuality of risk. All liabilities for deferred fees are expected to be offset by essentially equal amounts of assets that would not otherwise exist if the fees were paid on a current basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Section 22(f) prohibits undisclosed restrictions on transferability or negotiability of redeemable securities issued by open-end investment companies. Applicants contend that any restrictions created under the Agreement clearly would be set forth in the Agreement, are included primarily to benefit the Eligible Trustees, and would not adversely affect the interests of any shareholder of any Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Sections 22(g) and 23(a) generally prohibit a registered open-end and closed-end investment company, respectively, from issuing any of their securities for services or for property other than cash or securities. Applicants assert that, while a trustee would receive fees for services, such fees would be payable independent of the Agreement. The Agreement would merely provide for deferral of payment of such fees and thus should be viewed as being issued not in return for services but in return for a Trust not being required to pay such fees on a current basis. Applicant further assert that these sections primarily are concerned with the dilutive effect on the equity and voting power than can result when securities are issued for consideration that is not readily valued. Applicants submit that the Agreement would not have such effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Rule 2a&hyph;7 imposes certain restrictions on the investments of ``money market funds,'' as defined under the rule, that would prohibit a Fund that is a money market fund from investing in the shares of any other Fund. Applicants submit that the requested exemption would permit the Funds in question to achieve an exact matching of Underlying Securities with the deemed investments of the Deferred Fee Accounts, thereby ensuring that the deferred fees would not affect net asset value. Applicants further assert that the amounts involved in all cases would be  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in relation to the total net assets of each Fund, and would have no effect on the per share net asset value of the Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Section 6(c) provides that the SEC may exempt any person, security, or transaction from any provision of the Act, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants believe that the proposed arrangements satisfy the standards for an exemption from the provisions discussed above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- NEC Corp. said Thursday  [13 January] it has developed a technique to enhance the memory  capacity of a magneto-optical disc by eight times as much as the  current method.    The technique makes it possible to store data equivalent to  some 80,000 Japanese newspaper pages or two hours of VHS-format  video movie pictures on a magneto-optical disc which measures 13  centimeters in diameter, the same size as a music disc, the  company said.    A magneto-optical disc is based on a recording method that  combines laser and magnetic technologies to create high-density  erasable storage discs. Its surface is made of a magnetic  recording material that records magnetic spots or bits using a  laser to pinpoint them.    NEC's new technique combines a signal-processing technology  called the partial response maximum likelihood (prml) method  with a red-color data-reading laser.    NEC said it plans to develop products using the technique  for  commercial use as it can be applied to a range of multimedia  equipment.</p>

This action is necessary for consistency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Nutrition Labeling Education Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. The PDCAAS is a more accurate, efficient and less costly method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for measuring protein quality of this food product used in the National School  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lunch Program (NSLP). This rule also makes clear that enriched macaroni  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products may not be used for infants under one year of age. In addition, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule deletes reference in the NSLP regulations to the FDA Standard of Identity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (21 CFR 139.117) for enriched macaroni products with fortified protein which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been stayed by FDA and clarifies that protein quality is to be determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the dry basis not on the cooked food. This rule also makes a typographical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction and in accordance with the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 adds the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metric equivalent for all weights and measurements. This final rule further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarifies that manufacturers of enriched macaroni with fortified protein must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notify the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) if there is a change in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein content of their product after the original testing. FNS will assume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the protein content of the product remains the same as that submitted for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original testing unless otherwise notified. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This final rule is effective on October 7, 1994. The incorporation by reference of the ``Official Methods of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analysis of the AOAC International'' (formerly the Association of Analytical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemists) 15th Ed. (1990) and the ``Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation,'' as published by the Food and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed in this regulation is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of October 7, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Ms. Marion Hinners, Section Head, Food Science and Nutrition Section, Nutrition and Technical Services Division,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USDA, (703) 305&hyph;2556. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612). The Administrator of FNS has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial number of small entities. There are currently fewer than ten  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> companies participating in the Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs) under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation. In addition, the changes contained in this regulation are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to reduce costs for the manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrator of FNS has determined pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (d)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that notice and comment on this rule prior to implementation is unnecessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and contrary to public interest. The public interest would be better served  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by allowing a more accurate and efficient method for measuring the protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality of foods used in the NSLP. This change will allow food companies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize costs, thereby allowing them to provide quality products at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lowest cost possible. Moreover, receiving prior comment would be unnecessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and impracticable in this case for the following reasons. First, requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior notice and comment would waste valuable government resources. The Food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety and Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already have received and reviewed comments on this issue in response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rules governing nutrition labeling of all regulated products,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including products covered by this FNS regulation, and have published final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations which accept the PDCAAS method. Second, FNS, with FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concurrence, has already recognized the merits of the PDCAAS method in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitting its use for vegetable protein products (VPPs). Third, this rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides affected parties an implementation period of 30 days during which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either protein quality test may be used for enriched macaroni products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Among them, over 1,100  became party members in the 1940's and 420 in the 1950's. The  reason for withdrawal from the party given by most is: The  party's existing line goes against the party's manifesto and  their beliefs when they joined the party. It was disclosed that  over 500 among a total of about 2,200 who applied to withdraw  from the CPC changed their minds after they reconsidered the  issue and after relevant organizations carried out ideological  work among them. Among those who resigned from the party, more  than 90 were once cadres at ministerial or provincial level or  members of the Central Advisory Commission.</p>

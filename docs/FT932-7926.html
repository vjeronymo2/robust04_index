			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / IRA blast injures 20 people in Belfast A 1,000lb IRA bomb exploded in the centre of Belfast yesterday, injuring 20 people and badly damaging the headquarters of the Ulster Unionist party, as counting started for Northern Ireland's local elections. The explosion came as early returns from the polls, held on Wednesday, suggested that the hardline parties on both sides of the sectarian divide had performed strongly, an outcome which would damage the prospects of renewed inter-party talks on the province's future. The bomb, similar in size to the one which killed three people and badly damaged the Baltic Exchange in London last year, was placed in a skip lorry in a side street between the Europa Hotel and the Grand Opera House, yards from the UUP headquarters. It was near the spot where another powerful IRA bomb was detonated in December 1991. The device went off during the morning rush-hour, as the Army attempted to disarm it by two controlled explosions. It badly damaged the Europa Hotel and surrounding offices and shops, blowing out windows over a wide area. None of the injured was seriously hurt. The IRA claimed responsibility for the blast. The Belfast Opera House - repaired at a cost of Pounds 1m after being hit by the IRA bomb of late 1991 - took the full force of the explosion. A huge hole was blasted in the side of the 98-year-old building. The bombers evaded an intensive security cordon which has been thrown around the city centre during the week leading up to the elections, in which 582 councillors are to be elected to 26 district councils in the province. Mr Jim Wilson, general secretary of the UUP, said: 'I would suggest the IRA have identified their real enemy, the Ulster Unionist people of the province. They obviously know they didn't write us off at the ballot box and they won't do it with a bomb either.' Dr Joe Hendron, Social Democratic and Labour party MP for the nationalist area of west Belfast, said: 'I look on the people who did this as gangsters. It is a dastardly act and I condemn all those associated with planning it and executing it.' The final results of the elections are not expected until this afternoon, as the proportional representation system used in the province entails numerous counts of transferable votes. Early returns suggest that the UUP vote has slipped from 31 per cent to 30 per cent, while the vote for the hardline Democratic Unionist party, and for Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has strengthened in the urban centres of Belfast and Derry. If this trend is confirmed in the final result it will prove a bitter disappointment to Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary. He hoped that a strengthened vote for the UUP and the SDLP, the more moderate parties on either side of the sectarian divide, would facilitate his efforts to renew the inter-party talks on the province's political future, which were abandoned without agreement last November. At Westminster yesterday Sir Patrick told MPs that proposals the government was drawing up for the province's future would 'give some direction and focus' to any renewed talks. But he said that the government had no plans to publish its suggestions  - expected to set a framework for devolved government in the province. The government wants to keep details of negotiations confidential, he said. Sir Patrick is due to meet the leaders of Northern Ireland's main political parties, once the local elections are com-pleted. Two Anglo-Irish conference meetings are expected before any round-table talks start, however, suggesting a resumption of negotiations is at least another month away. There also seems to be only lukewarm support among local political leaders for such talks.</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DAUGHTER OF ROBERT BADHAM TO LAUNCH CAMPAIGN FOR GIL FERGUSON'S ASSEMBLY SEAT;  </P> <P> POLITICS: PHYLLIS BADHAM HOPES HER FAMILY NAME MAKES HER THE GOP FRONT-RUNNER  IN THE 70TH DISTRICT. IT HINGES ON THE INCUMBENT'S QUEST FOR A SENATE SEAT.  </P> <P> Phyllis Badham -- born into a political family and reared in Orange County --  said Tuesday that she is on the verge of making her first run for elected  office.  </P> <P> Badham, daughter of former U.S. Rep. Robert Badham, said she has "been meeting  with a lot of people, and getting a lot of encouragement" to run for the  Republican nomination in the 70th Assembly District. That post is held by  Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), but he is vying for the state  Senate seat in District 31.  </P> <P> If Ferguson wins that race, his vacant seat would likely be contested by  several local Republicans. But if he loses, most if not all are expected to  back out.  </P> <P> Tuesday, Badham refused to speculate on how Ferguson's fate in his race would  affect her decision on whether to run.  </P> <P> "We're all waiting to see what happens," she said, "but I'm putting my campaign  together today."  </P> <P> For Badham, 30, the race would mark her first attempt at elected office, but  she said her family background, as well as her experience in public relations  and lobbying, would make her the early front-runner. Badham added that she is  still completing position papers, but said she was "pro-choice" on the issue of  abortion and advocates ocean and beach cleanup.  </P> <P> "I've been called the wild card, and I love that," she said. "I know how to get  things done in Sacramento, and I am the only professional woman running. I  think those things will help me."  </P> <P> Her likely opponents are less convinced that Badham's credentials would propel  her into the spotlight. Chuck Devore, for instance, believes that Badham would  help "liven up the race" but added that he does not consider her an automatic  front-runner.  </P> <P> "Taken as a whole, I'm more than willing to match up my credentials against any  other candidate," said Devore, a former aide to Rep. C. Christopher Cox  (R-Newport Beach) who has already set up a campaign office and raised several  thousand dollars in his quest for the Assembly seat.  </P> <P> Badham is public affairs director for Ricoh Electronics in Tustin.  </P> <P> Previously, she has worked with Rockwell International, the National Assn. of  Manufacturers and a Los Angeles consulting firm.  </P> <P> She attended Newport Harbor High School and received her bachelor's degree in  political science and communications from Cal State Chico.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Japan has yet to fix a  schedule for Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's expected visit to  South Korea, the top government spokesman said Friday [17 June].    South Korean President Kim Yong-sam expressed a desire to  meet Hata as early as possible during Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa's recent visit to South Korea, Chief Cabinet Secretary  Hiroshi kumagai said at a news conference.    "But nothing has yet been decided concerning when and how"  the premier will make the journey, he said.    On Thursday, a senior Foreign Ministry official indicated  Hata may visit South Korea for talks with Kim later this month  or early next month.    A newspaper report said Friday the government has started  preparations for a visit by Hata to South Korea on July 1-2.    It would be Hata's first visit to South Korea since assuming  office in late April. The premier has voiced hope for an early  visit to South Korea.</p>

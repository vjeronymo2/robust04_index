			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by the Public Relations Department of KEYHAN </F> Publications]    [Text] The respected director general of foreign press and  mass media affairs at the Ministry of Culture and Islamic  Guidance has sent a letter to the chief editors of the country's  newspapers, inviting them to attend a meeting with 13 chief  editors of American publications affiliated with the Association  of American Editors which is to be held at the ETTELA'AT  publications office this afternoon. The respected director  general's letter does not indicate who invited this 13-man  delegation and what the objective behind this dialogue is. He  also does not clarify if the dialogue with the Iranian chief  editors is the only program or if something else has also been  planned. The choosing of the ETTELA'AT offices as the venue of  this meeting gives rise to the strong belief that the American  chief editors have been invited by ETTELA'AT Publications to  Iran! If this is so, then the question is: On what criterion  was this invitation based? And if there was no criterion, then  what is happening?    The letter from the director general for foreign mass media  affairs at the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance to the  Public Relations Department of KEYHAN Publications invites some  of the chief editors of KEYHAN Publications to attend a dialogue  with the American chief editors. Since the aspects of this  dialogue have not been clarified and the experience of the past  few years has clearly shown that the American mass media, namely  American publications, have continuously had a spiteful attitude  toward the Muslim people and the Islamic revolution, and since  the ugly and black record of the American mass media and  publications shows that they have always distorted facts and  disseminated false reports in order to poison public opinion  toward Islamic Iran and its people, none of the chief editors of  KEYHAN Publications will attend the meeting. The esteemed  Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance is asked to give more  explanations on why this invitation was extended and what the  objectives behind it are.</p>

Public use of a parcel of land and water consisting of approximately 3,955 acres will be restricted from June 25 through September 30 annually to individuals participating in a refuge-sponsored bear viewing program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This seasonal closure is necessary to prevent incompatible conflicts between people and brown bears at an important bear concentration area, during the season when conflicts and impacts on bears are most prevalent. It is intended to control increasing human use of a very important bear concentration area so that human uses in the area remain compatible with refuge purposes. Research and experience have clearly demonstrated that control of human activity in major bear concentration areas is necessary to avoid conflicts between people and bears. Organized bear viewing programs elsewhere in Alaska have proven highly successful in reducing conflict to an acceptable level while maintaining quality public use opportunities. This action will allow quality public viewing and photography opportunities through the O'Malley Bear Viewing Program without adversely affecting bear use of this important feeding area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An interim rule that would provide a restriction on public access from June 25, 1994, to September 30, 1994, is being published elsewhere in this separate part of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  with this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments may be submitted by July 11, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should be addressed to Assistant Regional Director_Refuges and Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Attention: Tony Booth, 1011 E.

Roosevelt established the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge by Executive Order 8857 on August 14, 1941, to ``preserve the natural feeding and breeding ground of the brown bear and other wildlife.'' This action withdrew about 1.9 million acres from unreserved public domain on Kodiak and Uganik Islands. Congress redesignated the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge in 1980 when it enacted the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). All the lands, water, interests, and submerged lands retained in federal ownership at the time of statehood were included in the refuge. This legislation also added about 50,000 acres of public lands on Afognak and Ban Islands to Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. Section 303 (5) (b) of ANILCA states generally that ``[t]he purposes for which Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge is established and shall be managed include (i) to conserve fish and wildlife populations and habitats in their natural diversity including, but not limited to, Kodiak brown bears, salmonoids, sea otters, sea lions, and other marine mammals and migratory birds; (ii) to fulfill the international treaty obligations of the United States with respect to fish and wildlife and their habitats;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) to provide, in a manner consistent with purposes set forth in subparagraphs (i) and (ii), the opportunity for continued subsistence use by local residents; and (iv) to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable and in a manner consistent with the purposes set forth in subparagraph (i), water quality and necessary water quantity within the refuge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Kodiak Refuge Comprehensive Conservation Plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1987) provides primary guidance for management of the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. According to its approved alternative, ``the Service will undertake detailed management planning to guide implementation of the plan and operation of the refuge.'' In support of that mandate, utilizing a full spectrum of public involvement, the final draft of the Kodiak Refuge Public Use Management Plan has been written. This proposed rule and the interim rule which is being published elsewhere in this separate part of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are a result of direction provided by both these planning processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During 1990&hyph;91 the Service tested a trial bear viewing program, staffed by Refuge personnel, at the Dog Salmon Creek Fish Pass on Kodiak Refuge. No closure was utilized for unguided use, but guided use was restricted through the special use permit process. This trial bear viewing program was successful except that the presence of artificial fish passage structures significantly impaired the quality of viewing opportunities available to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

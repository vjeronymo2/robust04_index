Senior negotiation sources confirmed on Wednesday [23 March]  that Mr Kissinger would head the commission which must decide on  the federalist content of the new transitional constitution. It  is understood that the commission would comprise four men, the  other two being from the USA and India.    The same sources said that agreement had been reached  between  the two disputing parties -- the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and  ANC [African National Congress] -- that they would abide by the  decision of the mediators.    It was also agreed that if the mediators ruled in favour of  the IFP, it could lead to a postponement of the April 27  election.    The ANC and IFP agreed to mediation on the issue of  federalism which the IFP claims is not present in the interim  constitution. It is demanding more regional powers for the  provinces and a greater measure of independence from the central  government.    Mr Kissinger shared the Nobel Peace Prize with his north  Vietnamese negotiation counterpart for securing the agreement  for the US withdrawal from Vietnam, thus ending the Vietnam War.  Lord Carrington was the central mediator in the Lancaster House  negotiations which brought about the end of Rhodesian UDI  [Unilateral Declaration of Independence] and the war for the  liberation of Zimbabwe.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong leads the losses in a weak region THE Nikkei average fell by 2.1 per cent yesterday as investment trust funds took profits after the recent rally in share prices, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index fell 370.61 to 17,313.04 after a high of 17,704.01 in the morning and a low of 17,307.72 just before the close. While prices moved narrowly in early trading, afternoon selling by dealers and investment trusts outpaced buying by public funds. Volume rose marginally to 260m shares from 238m. Declines led advances by 637 to 359 with 133 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks dropped 19.27 to 1,304.08 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.54 to 1,054.21. Traders said that after the 10.5 per cent rise in the Nikkei average over the past eight trading days, a decline had been expected, but that overall sentiment remained positive. 'People were starting to become scared of a possible crash, and we needed a breather,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. Other traders said some investment trusts placed sell orders to raise cash for redemptions and cancellations. High-technology issues, which had risen recently on hopes of a US economic recovery, were hit by profit-taking. NEC fell Y20 to Y675 and Fujitsu lost Y17 to Y550. Car stocks were also weaker with Nissan Motor down Y13 to Y557 and Toyota Motor retreating Y10 to Y1,410. The weakness in Nippon Credit Bank, which lost Y140 to Y4,800, dragged down other banking stocks. Reports, later denied by Nippon Credit Bank, that the bank had sold off land taken as collateral for troubled loans to a property agency, prompted selling by discouraged investors. The Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y50 to Y2,450 and Mitsubishi Bank lost Y60 to Y2,220. Dealers took profits on speculative theme stocks. Mitsui Mining and Smelting, the most active issue of the day, fell Y10 to Y498. Aids-related issues were also weak with Okamoto down Y10 to Y1,100 and Meiji Milk Products down Y4 to Y940. Nippon Housing Loan was one of the few bright spots of the day, rising Y13 to Y288 on short-covering. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 187.98 to 18,773.07 in volume of 41.7m shares. The OSE said trading volume for November surged 36.5 per cent to 429.9m shares as an increasing number of life assurers and banks realised profits on holdings. Roundup HONG KONG suffered its biggest one-day fall since August 1991 as Sino-British tension continued to unnerve investors. The region's other markets were also negative. HONG KONG lost another 5 per cent in volatile trading on reports that China would repudiate contracts signed by the present authorities after 1997. The Hang Seng index, which fell to an intraday low of 5,400, closed down 308.92 at 5,501.71 in moderate turnover of some HKDollars 3.85bn. Financial stocks were among the day's biggest losers with HSBC Holdings down HK3.50 at HKDollars 54.50 and Hang Seng Bank HKDollars 2.50 lower at HKDollars 50.00. SEOUL was disappointed that the central bank failed to cut interest rates and the composite index declined 3.43 to 659.93 in turnover of Won545.8bn. Kepco, the electricity generator, lost Won700 to Won21,700. TAIWAN retreated in thin trading as the weighted index lost 28.25 to 3,646.76 in turnover of TDollars 6.34bn. The financial sector, which has been relatively strong recently, lost nearly 1 per cent. AUSTRALIA lost ground in late trading as the local currency weakened against the US dollar. The All Ordinaries index slipped 3.8 to 1,444.3 having been briefly revived by the publication of better-than-expected economic data. Turnover rose to ADollars 237.7m from ADollars 188.2m. NEW ZEALAND fell back as the market consolidated its recent strong gains. The NZSE-40 Index lost 8 to 1,539.34 in turnover of NZDollars 50m. SINGAPORE's Straits Times industrial index eased 5.0 to 1,464.07 although gains were seen among several banking and industrial blue chips. In KUALA LUMPUR the composite index was also lower, down 4.66 to 637.23. MANILA rose on bargain-hunting following Monday's holiday and the composite index finished 2.90 higher at 1,266.48 in turnover of 168.6m pesos. BANGKOK traded lower with the SET index losing 3.88 to 861.33 in thin turnover of Bt4bn.</p>

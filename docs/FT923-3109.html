			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Letter: ERM exerts no constraints on freedom of currency markets Sir, From time to time your columnists assert that the exchange rate mechanism is a denial of the free market, because it attempts to fix the price of sterling. Joe Rogaly did so scathingly last week ('Mr Majtricht's logic', September 8). In fact, the market in sterling - and any other ERM currency - is totally free: no private buyer is constrained to buy, and no private seller is prevented from selling, at the going price. No foreign exchange traders are told to obey price controls. No exchange controls are constraining the free decision of investors to get into or out of the currency. There happens to be a powerful swing producer at work. The British government is to sterling what Saudi Arabia is to crude oil. It is not the sole creator of sterling - the banking system makes money too - but it is a very powerful supplier of it. In any trade, those in such a privileged position always have two options, both consistent with the free market. They can decide, in some way, on an output and let the price move around. Or they can decide on a price and alter the supply. Both strategies are an everyday part of business life. There is room for argument as to which of those two options the government and the Bank of England should pursue. Those who believe - count me in - that the main function of money is to have a stable worth will be inclined to maintain its price against something, whether gold, the D-Mark or goods in general, and vary its supply. Those who see sterling mainly as a lubricant for economic activity will want to print a generous supply of it, and let the markets value the result. That is the essence of the argument about the pound in the ERM. In conducting it, neither side can argue that the other is trying to throttle market forces.

Because of the sensitivity of the idea, he was careful not  to  set out a specific timetable. But "this year and next year  could be crunch years for APEC" to show some concrete results,  he said.    Trade liberalisation is an issue that is "coming to the  fore"  in 1994, and Australia wants to see trade liberalisation within  the group "when people are ready for it" he said.    APEC should liberalise at a pace that its 17 members find  "comfortable", but not "proceeding at the pace of the slowest  country".    Mr McMullen's comments come at a time when Thai officials  are  talking about a rethink of the country's policy towards APEC and  other regional economic groupings.    The officials identify the United States and Australia as  the  two APEC members pressing hardest for economic integration  within the group.    They are particularly concerned about the failure of  Thailand  and other ASEAN countries to influence APEC's agenda and to  resist what they see as less desirable developments in the group.    Thailand and ASEAN fear that the larger nations will use  APEC  as a forum for exerting pressure on the smaller countries, for  example to obtain lower trade barriers, tighter protection for  intellectual property rights and market-opening in service  industries.    APEC would be used, Thai officials fear, to make commitments  that go beyond what has been agreed globally in the Uruguay  Round of trade talks.    Some Thai officials say the government needs a clearer  assessment of where APEC is heading so that Thai and ASEAN  responses can be prepared ahead of time.    So far, they say, the steady insertion of new items on the  five-year-old group's agenda -- by Australia and the United  States in particular -- has subtly but swiftly shifted APEC away  from the loose grouping that ASEAN initially accepted.    At each stage, they conclude, ASEAN was caught unprepared.    The Australians have always argued openly that if APEC is to  be meaningful it should work for trade liberalisation. The  Americans, on the other hand, have repeatedly stated that they  have an open mind about APEC's development.    The Thai officials take a different view, citing in  particular a draft investment code that US officials are  circulating for comment by APEC members, and proposals for trade  liberalisation contained in a report by a group of "eminent  persons" commissioned by APEC. The group's chairman is an  influential US economist, Fred Bergsten.    Some Thais contrast the Australian pressure for trade  liberalisation on a broad front with what they describe as the  Americans' gradual introduction of new issues such as the  investment code and financial services liberalisation.    One Thai official recently recounted how APEC had started  off  as a "loose consultative forum" when it was launched at its  first ministerial meeting in Canberra in late 1989.    After that, work programmes were introduced on a number of  topics, ranging from the creation of trade databases to human  resources development. Those programmes needed funding, which  led to an APEC budget and a secretariat.    Last year saw US President Bill Clinton host the first of  what is increasingly seen as a regular series of APEC leaders'  meetings, and the creation of a new APEC committee on trade and  investment. This month APEC finance ministers met for the first  time.    The official said this demonstrates how far ASEAN has  allowed  APEC's original shape to be eroded. Other officials say ASEAN  should counterattack by proposing its own agenda so that APEC's  emphasis can return to areas of interest to smaller countries,  for example training and technology transfer.    There are some differences of opinion in the Thai  bureaucracy. While some Thai officials talk of hidden agendas  and a US "master-plan" for APEC, others question whether the  Clinton administration would be able to pass APEC trade  liberalisation laws through Congress.    Some Thai officials believe the conclusion of the Uruguay  Round of world trade talks could ease some of the pressure for  specific trade agreements in APEC.    For example, earlier suggestions that APEC might handle  trade  disputes between its members might be dropped because the  Uruguay Round deal includes a stronger and more streamlined  dispute settlement process under the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade.    The possibility of APEC being a forum for the United States  and Japan to patch up their bilateral trade dispute was raised  yesterday when Mr McMullen was interviewed in a  television-telephone link-up with Canberra.    "APEC is not a dispute settlement body," he said. But he  added that APEC meetings could be occasions for ministers from  the two countries to discuss their differences.    Mr McMullen said that while Australia is concerned about the  Japanese trade surplus, Canberra opposes Washington's use of  unilateral pressure to try to force Japanese markets open.    One of the reasons why US companies have insisted on the  controversial numerical targets set by Washington for access to  Japanese markets is the fact that earlier American success in  lowering Japan's trade barriers against beef led to a surge in  Japanese beef imports from countries, including Australia.</p>

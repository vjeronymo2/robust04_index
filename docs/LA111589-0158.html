			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: FRIENDS STICK BY DELTA THROUGH THIN AND THICK  </P> <P> "I WANT to go after all the tabloids and sleezoids who seem to be saying if you  are beautiful and you get fat, you no longer have a right to live," says  producer and chief writer of "Designing Women" Linda Bloodworth-Thompson.  </P> <P> Linda was addressing the everlasting, on-going issue of F-A-T, which has beset  her popular hit TV series on CBS in the person of one of its stars, the divine  Delta Burke. This unusual and gifted comic actress has, as this column remarked  the other day, made herself practically a legend of our time via her character,  Suzanne, the Southern beauty queen who lives for her image, wreaks havoc on the  men in her life and provides a saucy antidote to the more sensible, reasonable  characters of the other three "designing women" -- Julia, Mary Jo and Charlene  (played by Dixie Carter, Annie Potts and Jean Smart).  </P> <P> DELTA, LIKE 80% of the women in America, struggles constantly with her weight  in real and professional life. But after her recent marriage to actor Gerald  "Major Dad" McRaney, it became a real problem for Delta. The show's producers,  however, insist that the tabloids are 100 percent wrong in reporting they ever  told Delta to "shape up or get off the show." It was simply Delta's OWN  obsession and problem that worried her so much. She became frantic and it  affected her work. The producers told their star to relax. They even echoed a  thought expressed here -- that getting plumper only made the narcissistic  character funnier and more interesting. But Delta couldn't cope. So she was  suspended for her own good with the hope that she'd get easy about it all.  Then, the other day, Bloodworth-Thompson called in her four stars and read them  a script she'd written which deals with F-A-T.  </P> <P> After the meeting, Delta jumped up, ran across the room and planted a big kiss  on her producer-writer. The episode, titled "Big," will deal with the issue  head on and is set to air Dec. 11.  </P> <P> SPEAKING OF the tabloids, here is a note from the Star's editor, Dick Kaplan:  "Dear Liz, we'd be glad to put Ken Wahl on the cover with a story on how he's  getting fat, but it wouldn't sell a copy. Believe me, both here and elsewhere  at magazines appealing to women, I've tried diet stories starring male  celebrities. With zero results. As for Delta Burke, we stand by our story, as  painful as it was."  </P> <P> PEOPLE ARE talking about the split in the long, deep friendship between Nancy  Reagan and Mike Wallace. (It was Mrs. Reagan's late mother who was Mike's  original pal, but he developed a deep affection for the first lady.) So, when  Mike's interview about Mrs. R's book, "My Turn," appeared on "60 Minutes," many  people began to congratulate Mike on how "tough and aggressive" he'd been with  his friend.  </P> <P> When this happens, Mike looks sincerely pained. He insists his feelings for the  former first lady have not changed. He sings her praises, remarking: "She is  simply a really wonderful lady; loyal, vulnerable and terrific." But he knows  that the manner of the cutting of his interview by "60 Minutes" makes his  questions seem rather abrupt.  </P> <P> In fact, Mrs. Reagan has not returned Mike's recent call to her. She has told  intimates, "He betrayed me!" She also said to producer Rich Bonin when the  interview ended: "I think this was better for you than it was for me!"  </P></p>

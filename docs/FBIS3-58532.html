			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Josef Joffe editorial: "The Bill and Boris Show"] </F>   [Text] This was Bill Clinton's summit and Boris Yeltsin's  knighting as the United States' junior partner -- not a bad  balance sheet for the two politicians but hardly a promotion for  old Europe. In exchange for a small porcelain figure showing  Clinton as a saxophone player, Yeltsin received a belated  Christmas package -- consisting of four sizable presents.    One was a personal gift from Bill to Boris: The  demonstrative hug for the Russian president by the U.S.  president, designed to signal to the whole world: Yeltsin is  our man. Secretary of State Warren Christopher made it clear to  Moscow prior to Clinton's trip that Yeltsin "is by far the best  advocate of the democracy progress and thus the best guarantor  of stability." Whereas Clinton met three times with Yeltsin,  his rivals -- old communists and neorightists -- were put off  with a few friendly words during the reception.    The other three presents were not intended for the leader  but  for the population. The first was dispatched long before the  Moscow trip and merely approved by the Europeans at the NATO  summit in Brussels. Its name is Partnership for Peace and it  contains -- with Western approval -- a Russian right of veto  concerning the military relationship between NATO and Moscow's  former satellites in East Europe. The Partnership proposal is  full of sweet words, and includes some attractive offers for the  reform countries, but excludes membership in the alliance. As a  result of noisy Russian warnings, the terms "maybe/sometime" and  renewed discussion were used in connection with the questions as  to who will be accepted when.    The second present consisted of Ukraine's nuclear weapons.  The United States and Russia had already reached agreement on  what Clinton described in the following way in Moscow: The  "clear opportunity" has come "for us to be able to draft a new  security structure for Europe." When Ukraine's President  Kravchuk signed the treaty on elimination of the inherited  Soviet nuclear missiles, he did that because of joint pressure  by U.S. and Russian leaders. He was bribed by Clinton and  blackmailed by Yeltsin: Ukraine will receive money from the  United States -- $1 billion -- and Russia will resume its supply  of oil and gas, which it has suspended systematically over the  past few months.  <H5>  New Structure </H5>   The third present was more symbolic but still quite  valuable.  The two presidents announced that Russian and U.S. nuclear  missiles will no longer be directed against one other but at the  sea. This will not really decapitate the hydra-headed monster,  because the United States can reprogram the targets within a few  minutes, even while the missiles are in flight. Yet, symbolism  is politics and, for this reason, Yeltsin was right when he  stressed: "We have met to settle the final point of the last  problem of the Cold War."    Thus, the Cold War has been declared as ended. What will  follow now? In fact, in their enthusiasm and relief over  America's return to the old continent, the Europeans have not  really realized that Clinton showed them in a friendly way who  dominates world politics. The Partnership for Peace concept was  developed in Washington, and the Ukrainian nuclear potential was  not brought closer to the scrapping sites by Kohl and Mitterrand  but by Clinton and Yeltsin. If a "new security structure for  Europe" is to be built, the architects will be the United States  and Russia. For a country that "lost" the Cold War, this is an  honor that would have made Talleyrand envious after 1815 and  Adenauer after 1945.    However, can one blame Bill Clinton for that? He may indeed  be influenced strongly by Russia's ardent supporter, Strobe  Talbott, the new deputy secretary of state. However, who else  could he have chosen as "hero of the continent?" France? De  Gaulle has always been governing there, no matter whether under  a socialist or conservative flag. The French made life a  perfect hell for Clinton during the GATT talks. They seem to be  dreaming of a neo-Napoleonic "continental system," designed not  to fend off England but the United States.  <H5>  "European Concert" </H5>   What about Germany? Washington considers this country too  unpredictable to assume the part of first violin. Germany is  for free trade and for France; it is for Europe (Chancellor  Kohl) and against Europe (Bavarian Minister President Stoiber);  it is for NATO expansion (Defense Minister Ruehe) and against it  (Foreign Minister Kinkel); for out-of-area missions (Christian  Democratic Union) and against them (Social Democratic Party of  Germany and -- occasionally -- the Free Democratic Party of  Germany). German foreign policy is playing too many instruments  -- it is trying to safeguard too many interests -- to be able to  set the tone in the "concert of Europe" (as the club of major  powers was called after 1815). Maybe it does not even want to,  which need not necessarily be a sign of false modesty with a  view to its nervous neighbors.    Thus, the U.S.-Russian junior partnership has been  established partly for want of something better. Yet, it is  also in Europe's interests if it is subjected to the right  rules. Just as after 1945, at this point in time, Russia is  Europe's most urgent problem. Yet, it is not the external  strength of the giant but the internal weakness that makes the  country dangerous. Moscow must not become a Weimar raised to  the third power.    The conclusion is that Russia's fear of "isolation or  encirclement" must not be fanned, as Chancellor Kohl demanded in  his government statement on the NATO summit. Yet, as in  medicine, the doctor's task is to determine the right dose here,  too. A Russian right of veto over East Europe, that is a  diplomatic "Brezhnev doctrine" with NATO approval as it were,  was not the first wrong signal. It followed the West's roaring  silence when Moscow restored its predominance in the neighboring  Caucasus region. In spite of the required sensitivity on this  issue, it is clear that Kohl was right when he added that  "hegemonic efforts" are incompatible with partnership.    Clinton also gave the right answer -- rather in passing --  to  the question of whether the West would do nothing -- as on the  eve of World War II -- if an East European country were  attacked. Clinton stressed that this lesson has not been  forgotten, and thus he "doubts" that nothing would happen. A  "Russian Weimar" would be a disaster, but so would a "Polish  Weimar". Those who want to help Yeltsin because they are afraid  of a weimarization must grant the same aid to Presidents Walesa,  Havel, and Goncz. They are as close to our hearts, and even  closer to our borders.    Sorting out the entire legacy of Soviet communism will be  more difficult than its containment. Yet who ever claimed that  foreign policy is easy? Bill Clinton has made a good start, and  the Europeans should not be concerned about his star  performance. Left to their own devices, they would have been as  successful as in Bosnia.</p>

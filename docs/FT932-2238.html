			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Long-awaited dollar move THE DOLLAR broke through the critical DM1.67 level against the D-Mark yesterday, touching a 15-month high against the German currency, and looking well set for a strategic move upwards, writes James Blitz. Yesterday's move in the dollar was the most important event in the currency markets this year. The dollar has been trapped in a range of DM1.56 to DM1.67 over the last six months, and has made several attempts to breach the DM1.67 level. There was a strong feeling among analysts yesterday that the dollar could now hit DM1.72 or even DM1.80 in the near term, after closing in London at DM1.6800, some 2 1/2 pfennigs up on the day. The currency's move came against the background of a weak D-Mark, which dropped in value against most European currencies amid concern over the deteriorating state of the German economy and the budget deficit. However, the market may have been moved by comments from officials in the US and Germany which suggested that the interest rate differential between both countries is set to narrow, placing higher value on dollar investments. Mr Horst Schulmann, a Bundesbank council member, said on Thursday night that German inflation was easing, and that the Bundesbank could continue its rate cutting policy. Two Federal Reserve governors were also reported to have made hawkish noises on US inflation. Sentiment towards the dollar was very strong, but Mr Steve Hannah, an economist at IBJ International, said that the dollar could come down again if the outlook on interest rates changed. Yesterday's move also appeared to have been backed by modest volumes. 'Some of our dealers would like to have seen bigger flows,' said one London-based analyst. Yesterday's move in dollar/D-Mark added muscle to the extraordinary reversal in the yen following the resignation of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa as Japanese prime minister. After opening in London at about Y107.60 to the dollar, the yen yesterday tumbled nearly 2 per cent in value to a low of Y109.47 and remained at those levels at the European close. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank, believes that this is a short-term reversal and that the upheaval in Japanese politics could even be seen in a positive light. The D-Mark was beleaguered in Europe, falling to minus 29 on its divergence indicator in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. The French franc traded below FFr3.36 to the D-Mark while sterling closed 1/4 pfennig higher at DM2.5125.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / MPs demand pensioners on trustee boards A cross-party committee of MPs has called for new laws to force companies to include pensioners on the boards of trustees of corporate pension schemes and to raise employee representation to half of all trustees. The committee also called for laws to bar companies from winding up pension schemes without the consent of a new pensions regulator and for regulations requiring employers to seek the permission of their employees before transferring them to a new scheme. The recommendations, in a report by the Commons social security committee, go well beyond those made by the government's Pension Law Review Committee. The government is considering that report and is preparing legislation for regulatory reform. The Commons committee accused Mirror Group Newspapers of failing to honour pension commitments to thousands of former scheme members who were employed by other companies controlled by Robert Maxwell. In June 1991, the trustees of the MGN scheme agreed that such schemes should be amalgamated with their own. The assets of these schemes never reached the MGN scheme. MGN's position is that it will only honour pension commitments to its own employees. Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the committee, said he was 'looking at ways to force MGN to honour the agreement by the previous trustees of the scheme'. MGN's pension scheme has been the most successful of all the former Maxwell company schemes in obtaining the return of missing assets  - Pounds 57m in assets have been returned, reducing MGN's liability significantly. The committee is urging that the refunded sums be used to finance pensions for the excluded scheme members. Mr Field expressed concern about fees earned by legal firms, insolvency practitioners and others in sorting out the Maxwell empire. 'The sum is Pounds 77m and rising,' he said. While praising efforts to seek a 'global settlement' in which securities firms voluntarily return pension scheme assets, Mr Field said greater haste was needed. 'It is very crucial that those who are part of the global settlement can distinguish the wood from the fees,' he said. He also called on MGN to help pensioners rather than taking part in the consortium to take over The Independent. 'At a time when MGN believes itself to be so financially solvent that it can attempt to take over another newspaper, most people in the country would have thought their first priority was to meet their responsibilities to pensioners rather than extend their empire.' Mirror Group Newspapers last night attacked Mr Field's 'disgraceful and untrue comments' and said it was considering legal action for defamation. Some of Mr Field's comments were made at a press conference. MGN added: 'Every single person who works at MGN has committed, for the next 11 years, to bend their backs in order to repay to the rightful owners the hundreds of millions of pounds stolen by Robert Maxwell.'</p>

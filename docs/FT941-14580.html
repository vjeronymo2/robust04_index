			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Hurd seeks to deepen ties between Turkey and EU Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, yesterday promised an initiative to deepen ties between Turkey and Europe, in a move which Greece promptly attacked as in breach of European Union foreign and security policy. Mr Hurd, who arrived in Ankara yesterday, was due to deliver a speech on Europe and Turkey, ahead of talks today with both his Turkish counterpart, and Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister. With the Germans joining the talks, Turkey has an opportunity to air concerns about being isolated in the process of European integration, a discussion which has often been difficult to hold in the EU because of the Greek veto. The Anglo-German initiative is the first joint action to co-operate in areas of common concern. Turkey, a Nato member, has had an agreement of association with the EU since 1963 and applied for full membership in 1987 but was rejected in 1989. Relations have since been strained over concern on human rights, Cyprus and Greece's use of its veto as an EU member to block financial support for Turkey. Mr Hurd's visit coincides with the start of the six-month presidency of the EU by Greece, Turkey's long-time rival. In Athens a Greek government spokesman said the meeting breached the foreign and security policy outlined by the Twelve at the Maastricht summit in 1992. In the unlikely prospect of an early decision on Ankara's application for full EU membership, the UK is seeking new ways to cement Turkey's relations with Europe. Ankara fears losing ground to applicants from Efta and former communist states of east Europe. In talks yesterday with his opposite number, Mr Hikmet Cetin, and separately with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, Mr Hurd touched on a range of topics from Cyprus, Turkish worries about Russian intentions in the Caucasus, to Turkish concerns over Moslems in Bosnia. 'Turkey should continue to be fully involved in the evolving arrangements for European defence,' Mr Hurd said last night, in a clear attempt to ease Turkish concern at the offer of associate, rather than full, membership of the Western European Union defence organisation.</p>

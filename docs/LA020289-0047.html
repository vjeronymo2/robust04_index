			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Federal investigators for the first time cited a pilot's use of cocaine as a  contributing factor in a commercial airliner crash in which passengers were  killed. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that pilot Stephen  Silver, who was killed in a Jan. 19, 1988, commuter crash in Colorado along  with eight other people, had used cocaine 10 to 18 hours before the flight left  Denver. Although investigators said that Silver, 36, did not have enough  cocaine in his system to have been high and the co-pilot was controlling the  plane's descent to Durango, the board concluded that cocaine contributed to the  pilot's "ineffective monitoring of an unstabilized approach."  </P></p>

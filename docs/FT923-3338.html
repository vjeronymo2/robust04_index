			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Barclays vows to fight writs BARCLAYS BANK, the largest of the high street clearers, yesterday vowed to fight writs served on it alleging that its customers lost money through 'phantom' cash machine withdrawals. Five banks and building societies - Barclays, Midland, TSB, Nationwide Building Society and Lloyds - have been named as defendants in an action brought by Mr Denis Whalley, a Merseyside sollicitor. The action is on behalf of nine alleged victims of 'phantom' withdrawals from automated teller machines. Barclays said yesterday the action was 'misconceived' and that it had complete confidence in its auto-teller systems. 'At the same time, we are very pleased that at long last we will have the opportunity to defend our position in the courts,' it added. The bank said it had already made a payment to Mr Stephen Raw, one of the three Barclays customers among the nine plaintiffs. The payment did not constitute an admission that there had been a 'phantom' withdrawal. Midland and Lloyds also confirmed that they had received writs from Mr Whalley. Each bank faces two claims. Lloyds says it has paid the disputed amount in one case, even though it would have preferred the case to go to the banking ombudsman for a definitive ruling.</p>

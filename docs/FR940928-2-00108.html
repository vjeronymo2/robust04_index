			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part A:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed change will permit expansion of the current allowable power/flow operating region to allow operation in the extended load line limit (ELLL) region. Operation of BFN Units 1 and 3 in the ELLL region will not increase the probability of any accident previously evaluated since the Average Power Range Monitor (APRM) system and flow-biased scram setpoint are not identified as initiators of any design basis accidents or transients. Additionally, no credit is taken for the APRM flow biased scram in any accident or transient analyses. Therefore, the proposed change can not significantly increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TVA's analysis of operation in the ELLL region verified that the consequences of previously evaluated accidents are within the acceptance criteria of the licensing basis. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve an increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part B:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed change does not increase challenges or create any new challenges to safety-related systems or equipment, or other equipment whose failure could cause an accident. The proposed change does not change the function of the rod block monitor (RBM) subsystem. The RBM subsystem will continue to block control rod withdrawal to ensure that fuel safety limits are protected. The revised RBM limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements provide increased assurance that the RBM will function to ensure that fuel safety limits are protected. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve an increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised RBM operability and surveillance requirements provide increased assurance that the RBM will block control rod withdrawal to ensure that fuel safety limits are protected. Accordingly, operation of BFN Units 1 and 3 with the revised RBM upscale setpoint does not involve an increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part C:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The miscellaneous editorial changes do not affect any plant operations, equipment, or any safety-related activity. These changes increase the probability that the specifications will be correctly interpreted by adding clarifying information and/or correcting errors. Therefore, these editorial changes do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part D:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed change will delete the specific value for the rated loop recirculation flow rate found in the limiting safety system settings. This flow rate is in the TS to provide additional information, and is not a TS requirement. The proposed change does not change the limiting safety system settings or alter the method for calculating the settings. The proposed change does not affect or change operation of the plant, plant equipment, or any safety-related equipment. The proposed change does not change the APRM rod block or trip settings, the method or frequency of calibration of the APRM flow biased network, or any other operational features of the APRM system. The proposed change will only delete an incorrect flow rate from the TS. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part E:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed change will remove specific equations for the APRM rod block and RBM upscale trip setpoints from the TS and relocate them to the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR). Removing these equations from the TS does not affect or change the APRM and RBM subsystems or the functions of these systems. The proposed change does not affect or change operation of the plant, plant equipment, or any safety-related equipment. Accordingly, the proposed change does not involve an increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Removing the specific rod block equations from the TS does not change the requirements to comply with the limits of these equations during plant operations, since the TS will reference the COLR as the source of the equations. The actions to be taken in the event of noncompliance with the COLR-specified equations will also remain unchanged. Both the APRM rod block and RBM subsystems will continue to block control rod withdrawal to prevent reactor power from increasing to excess levels and to ensure that applicable limits of the plant safety analysis are met. Additionally, in accordance with the requirements of TS 6.9.1.7, these equations will continue to be developed using NRC-approved methodologies and will continue to ensure that applicable safety limits are protected. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve an increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

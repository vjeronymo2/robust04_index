			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Security Council will present its  security policy for 1994-1998 for the southern region to the  Cabinet on Tuesday, Government House sources said yesterday.    The policy is aimed at establishing security in the South,  which has been plagued by Muslim separatist attacks and bombings.    According to the sources, the policy will aim at:    -- Social psychology: The building of understanding and the  decreasing of suspicion to increase cooperation at all levels of  society.    -- Economic development: Ensuring that development plans can  yield results. While there will be no more special investment  privileges than in the other three investment zones, it is  necessary to develop other facilities to attract investors,  since the South is far from the centre of government. These  include basic infrastructure, such as communications and  transportation.    -- Administration: Improve the political and administrative  methods, in particular the efficiency of civil servants so that  they do not become a cause for dissatisfaction among the people.  Increase the participation of the people through local  administration bodies, and improve the efficiency of agencies  responsible for realising policies at the national and local  levels.    -- Law and order: Continue to use politics before military  action, in conjunction with covert operations, to pressure armed  rebels. Separatist movements are still capable of terrorist and  sabotage acts, and resources will have to be put into security  work in the police and military.    -- Foreign affairs: Continue to forge good relations with  neighbours so that cooperation can bring mutual benefit.  Cooperation will have to be sought from Muslim countries while  increasing economic links, trade and investment.    -- Policy administration: Though there is a special form of  administration under the Fourth Army Region Commander, there is  disunity and inefficiency, which lead to difficulties in solving  problems. Better coordination will be needed and resources  provided, and the frame of reference for any work will have to  be made more clear.</p>

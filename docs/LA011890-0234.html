			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TRUMP TO SELL YACHT FOR BIGGER  </P> <P> Captain of capitalism Donald J. Trump is selling his sleek Trump Princess, the  world's longest private yacht, and will upgrade to an even bigger flagship.  </P> <P> "We've had quite a lot of inquiries," said a spokesman for London yacht agents  Nigel Burgess, which is charged with selling the Princess.  </P> <P> An advertisement in the Financial Times described the 282-foot Trump Princess  as "the world's most spectacular motor yacht . . . considered by all to be the  greatest yacht ever built."  </P> <P> Trump, 43, bought his Princess, built as Nabila for indicted Saudi arms dealer  Adnan Khashoggi, from the Sultan of Brunei in 1987 for what he called a "song"  -- a mere $30 million.  </P> <P> Trump's new craft, being built by Amels Holland shipyard for delivery in 1992,  will be 420 feet, or 10 feet longer than Britain's royal yacht Britannia.  </P></p>

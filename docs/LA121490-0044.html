			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: PROFESSOR LEADS THE WAY IN RENEWING A CHICANO CHRISTMAS TRADITION.  </P> <P> It started out as a lesson for a Mexican-American studies class at Cal State  Dominguez Hills.  </P> <P> Prof. Miguel Dominguez wanted his students to experience Mexican culture rather  than read about it in a textbook. At the same time, he wanted to establish a  direct link between the university and the nearby historic Rancho Dominguez.  </P> <P> So, three years ago, Dominguez (no relation to the founders of the rancho) and  a handful of students asked the ranch for permission to stage a posada, the  traditional Mexican re-enactment of Joseph and Mary's search for room at an  inn. It has become an annual event and has taken on the trappings of a  broader-reaching Mexican folk festival.  </P> <P> Although the Mexican tradition, called Las Posadas, involves several  processions that take place on a series of nights, the Rancho Dominguez  celebration is a one-day event.  </P> <P> On Sunday, Dominguez's students will again act out the Nativity story at the  ranch, and the festival will include dancing, food and pinatas. Tours will be  given of the Dominguez Adobe, decorated with 19th-Century Christmas artifacts.  There will also be a performance by the Ballet Cultural de Cal State Dominguez  Hills.  </P> <P> "Students learn faster if they actually go through what it is to become part of  a culture," Dominguez said. "It is not adequately learned about in textbooks."  </P> <P> Dominguez said that although the custom has its roots in Old California and  Mexico, until recently many Chicanos were unfamiliar with the tradition. Its  resurgence, Dominguez said, reflects the growing presence of Latino immigrants.  </P> <P> "Las Posadas is an old Mexican custom and was celebrated in Old California long  before it became part of the United States," Dominguez said. "It is only  fitting that a posada be held at the Dominguez Adobe -- the site of the state's  first Spanish land grant."  </P> <P> He encourages participants on Sunday to wear traditional Mexican dress, such as  ponchos for men and blusas tipicas for women.  </P> <P> Sandra Ponce, a political science junior minoring in Mexican-American studies,  said the celebration brings back a lot of memories.  </P> <P> "It's kind of a nostalgic tie," she said. "I attended (a posada) one time when  I was in Mexico. (This is) basically a smaller version of what goes on in  Mexico."  </P> <P> Ponce said the festival is a source of pride among students, who have been  preparing for the event since the semester began in September.  </P> <P> "It keeps us in touch with our culture," Ponce said.  </P> <P> About 50 students have been working on colorful decorations, sprucing up the  ranch and preparing food. Traditional Mexican tamales and pan dulce, a sweet  bread, will be offered for sale.  </P> <P> In Mexico, the posadas generally take place in homes from Dec. 16 to Christmas  Eve.  </P> <P> A typical posada consists of a small procession that winds up at a different  house each night. Sometimes, large figures of Mary and Joseph are carried at  the head of the procession. At others, children act out the parts of Mary and  Joseph, angels and shepherds.  </P> <P> Upon arrival at a designated house, the people in the procession ask for  lodging from others in the house. What takes place is a ceremony in song during  which the people outside and the innkeepers inside banter back and forth until  the latter are persuaded to allow the procession to enter.  </P> <P> Said Dominguez: "Then the party starts."

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> An Italian lawmaker in Rome demanded a ban Thursday on concerts such as the one  last weekend in Venice by British rock band Pink Floyd that smothered the city  in rubbish and damaged its monuments. The demand was made as the Venice City  Council, stung by calls for its resignation over Saturday's concert, was  studying a proposal to limit the number of tourists allowed to enter the lagoon  city each day. Sen. Piergiorgio Gradari of the neo-fascist MSI party made a  formal request to the Interior Ministry to ban events that could threaten  public order or could damage any city's artistic heritage. Senators from the  Greens environmentalist party asked the Rome government to put a value on the  damage done to Venice during the concert. Venice's mayor and City Council have  come under fire for allowing the free concert to be held without providing  sufficient sleeping, eating or toilet facilities for the more than 150,000 fans  who poured into the city. The fans, who included film director Woody Allen and  actress Mia Farrow, crammed waterfronts and clambered onto monuments and roofs  of churches to watch the concert, staged on a floating platform off St. Mark's  Square.

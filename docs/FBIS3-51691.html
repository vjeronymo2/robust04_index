			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Carlos Menem obtained yesterday a clear  political victory by getting the provinces of Neuquen and Rio  Negro to join the fiscal pact.    After two days of negotiations in the Chapadmalal tourist  resort, the government was able to get practically all the  provinces to join the economic and fiscal guidelines of the  central power.    Eduardo Angeloz [Cordoba Province governor] thus remained  the  single "rebel" governor who has not yet signed the pact drawn up  by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. But the legislature of  Corrientes Province must also decide whether or not it will  approve the signing of the pact by Ideler Tonelli, who was then  the trustee of that province.    Intense negotiations were carried out by Domingo Cavallo,  presidential General Secretary Eduardo Bauza, and Interior  Minister Carlos Ruckauf to get Neuquen Governor Jorge Sobisch  and Rio Negro Governor Horacio Massaccesi to sign the pact.    Bauza himself later denied that pressure was exerted on the  two governors, saying that the agreement with Neuquen and Rio  Negro "considers the interests of the nation and of each  province."</p>

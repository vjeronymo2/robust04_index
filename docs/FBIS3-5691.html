			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Prime Minister Urged To Quit Rough-and-Ready </F> Technique"]    [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was forced to give  up a cabinet reshuffle plan, which he was very eager to realize.    A widening gap and amplified discord among the coalition  parties are the net result of his bungled attempt, which he  suddenly brought forward after returning from a Japan-U.S.  summit.    "Hastiness" stalks the prime minister. Still fresh in our  memory is his aborted "national welfare tax" concept. Having  made one blunder after another, he must take full blame for  causing so much confusion in politics and state affairs.    When he first expressed his desire to reorganize the  cabinet,  we questioned the propriety of a reshuffle at a time when he  faced imminent deliberations on fiscal 1994 budget, which  contains, as its main pillars, economic measures designed to  overcome the recession. It does not surprise us that he ended up  having to forgo his bid.    It is true that there are precedents where cabinets were  reorganized after the compilation of draft budgets, but in those  cases the draft budget process had invariably been completed in  December, leaving ample time before budget deliberations began  in the new year. In Hosokawa's case, had he reshuffled the  cabinet on 3 March, he would have had only one day before his  scheduled 4 March policy address to the Diet.    In addition, newly appointed ministers without adequate  knowledge would have had to answer questions from the opposition  parties on draft budget items compiled by their predecessors.  That certainly would have brought the severe criticism that the  prime minister had treated the people and the Diet with contempt.    Given the fact that he faced so many obvious pitfalls, it is  hard to understand why he sought to ram through his initiative.    The prime minister tried to explain that a reshuffle was  necessary to secure a line-up of ministers to form a cabinet  devoted to economic reform that should constitute his next  central objective now that political reform has essentially been  achieved.    It sounded reasonable. However, Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura, who was asked by the prime minister what he  thought of the reshuffle plan, disclosed that the prime minister  asked him "to move to another post because of strong criticism  against him (from within the coalition)."    However, it was evident that the prime minister's "abrupt"  move for a reshuffle was simply to "oust Takemura."    Moreover, it was also obvious that this scheme had its  origin  in Shinseito representative secretary Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito  Secretary General Yoichi Ichikawa, rather than the prime  minister himself. Ozawa and Ichikawa are in rivalry with  Takemura and their opinions are becoming far apart. Observers  agree that it was, in fact, not only a power struggle over  whether the future political map should consist of two major  parties or a "tripolar" arrangement, but also a difference in  their political styles and a personality conflict.    Although we respect the prime minister's exclusive  prerogative to hire and fire his ministers, we question his  inclination toward one party. It is said that fiduciary  relations between Hosokawa and Takemura have loosened since the  confusion over the failed "national welfare tax" proposal. If  the rift between the prime minister and the chief cabinet  secretary -- who is supposed to be his closest confidant -- is  widening, they may have to "negotiate a divorce." Although it  is a prime minister's exclusive right to reshuffle his cabinet,  Hosokawa, as leader of a coalition government, should have  enlisted the views of the coalition parties and reached a  consensus before moving for a reshuffle. He must remember that  he is driving a coach drawn by "eight horses," and he must  handle the reins with extreme care if he wants to stay in his  seat. We urge Prime Minister Hosokawa to go back once again to  the starting point of the coalition government.</p>

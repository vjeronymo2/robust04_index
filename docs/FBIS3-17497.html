Several political commentators have assessed Russia's  policy on using force as the beginning of a new cold war and a  wave of military pressure directed on the former Soviet Union,  particularly the republics in the Caucasus.    The statement was not a new development in Russia's policy  of  strengthening its military presence in the CIS republics. But  Kondratyev's statement indicated that Russia has ignored the  international community's opinion and challenged international  norms. That was a new and undesirable factor in his statement.    Undoubtedly, one of the reasons Russia moved to use force is  the radical political developments in that country. Another is  Russia's failure to realize its views on international and  regional developments during the past few years.    Russia tried to find a legal solution to two problems in the  international arena until as recently as yesterday. It called  for international status for the MDB [not further identified],  as in the case of the CSCE. It will be recalled that Moscow has  an influential position in the MDB. Russia called on the world  to agree to the deployment of its military forces in the  troubled areas in the former Soviet Union as peacekeeping units.  But the international community has rejected its proposals on  the grounds that they conflicted with international norms.  Consequently, Russia now seems to have abandoned its diplomatic  initiatives and adopted a different policy.    Deputy Defense Minister Kondratyev's statement has revealed  a  sharp turn in Russia's policy. Naturally, that has created  several questions in people's minds. Why does Russia, which has  deployed military units in several republics on the bases of  bilateral agreements, insist on giving the status of a  peacekeeping force to two of its divisions?    That aspect promised nothing favorable for Azerbaijan.  Russia has no military troops in Azerbaijan and Baku does not  wish to allow any to be deployed in the Republic. Everyone  knows that Russia covertly directs pressure on the sides  involved in the Karabakh problem. Apparently, the deployment  of its military units in the region as a peacekeeping force will  create a favorable opportunity for it--politically and  legally--to direct pressure on the sides without having to  conceal it.    Azerbaijan's political leaders have often stated that they  oppose the deployment of Russia's troops in the disputed region  under any title. They believe that the Russian troops will most  probably be based between the warring sides, that is, in  Karabakh. But that will make the dispute worse. Undoubtedly,  the move will prolong the dispute indefinitely and create an  undesirable situation for Azerbaijan.    Despite its assuring but misleading aspects, the deployment  of Russia's military forces in the region in the form of a  peacekeeping force could place Azerbaijan in an unfavorable  political and military situation.    Regarding Kondratyev's fearful statement, REUTER has quoted  Western observers as saying that the effort made to realize its  stipulations will, undoubtedly, create a clash between the  Western world and Russia, which is already in a difficult  situation.</p>

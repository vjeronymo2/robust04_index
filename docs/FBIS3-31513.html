			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Feb 17 (CTK) -- The Slovak Parliament  has passed the government's bill amending the law on large  privatization with certain alterations.    The amendment allows cabinet members to retain posts in the  Presidium and Inspectorate Council of the National Property Fund  (FNM), whereby they can continue to intervene in the  privatization process in Slovakia.    Members of the FNM Presidium and Inspectorate Council will,  however, be elected by parliament. The government coalition of  the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and part of the  Slovak National Party (SNS) has a minority in parliament.    "Wild privatization in Slovakia will go on while Premier  Vladimir Meciar signs the parliament-approved bill on an  amendment to the Law on Large Privatization," Juraj Plesnik,  member of the Parliamentary Commission on Administration and  Privatization for the Democratic Left Party (SDL), told  journalists today.    If Meciar does sign, however, it will lead to the separation  of political power from economic power in the state, Plesnik  said.    The passing of the amendment represents a victory for the  opposition because the National Property Fund (FNM) will be  liberated from cabinet influence. Meciar, who is also acting  privatization minister, will lose his claim to the post of  chairman of the FNM Presidium and Finance Minister Julius Toth  will have to resign from the post of chairman of the FNM  Supervisory Council.    Opposition deputies believe, however, that Meciar will not  sign it, but submit it to the president, who in turn will return  it to parliamentary committees for discussion. This will allow  Meciar to continue with privatization as he has done over the  last few days, when the government for example approved 20  privatization projects on the direct sale of the property of  strategic Slovak companies.    Plesnik said the amendment precisely defined the extent and  manner of the use of FNM property. High-ranking state officials  will be able to work in the FNM once approved by parliament, but  cabinet members cannot, he said.    The amendment requires the FNM to present a fresh list of  companies to be privatized and companies to be excluded from  privatization. Parliament will decide when the new lists have  to be submitted, Plesnik said.</p>

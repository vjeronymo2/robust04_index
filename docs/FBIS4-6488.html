			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Spirit of Playa Giron Still Alive" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Papers here today  dedicate signed articles to the 33rd anniversary of the victory  in the Playa Giron battle.    The Cuban people's victory in the Playa Giron battle showed  that any formidable imperialist enemy can never bring to their  knees the people who have risen as one, rallied close around  their leader, convinced of the justness of their cause, stresses  MINJU CHOSON.    Recalling that after the battle the fraternal Cuban people  have defended the gains of revolution and stepped up socialist  construction, valiantly smashing the never-ceasing aggression  and intervention, subversive activities and sabotages of the  U.S. imperialists and their stooges, the paper says:    The Cuban people under the correct guidance of the Communist  Party of Cuba headed by Comrade Fidel Castro are notching up  success in different sectors of the national economy including  industry, agriculture, education and health service, and working  hard to stabilize and improve the people's living.    They are striving to get the U.S. troops withdrawn from  Guantanamo and to preserve peace in Central America and  Caribbean region.    The Korean people rejoice as over their own over the  achievements gained by the fraternal Cuban people in their  struggle for the defence of the country, revolution and  socialism and for the independent development and prosperity of  the country and extend militant solidarity to them in their  righteous struggle.    They are happy to have such courageous and honest friends as  the Cuban people in Latin America.    They wish the Cuban people greater success in their efforts  to build socialism, believing that the traditional relations of  friendship and cooperation between the two peoples will grow  stronger and develop in conformity with the aspirations and  desire of the Korean and Cuban peoples.    NODONG SINMUN in a signed article says that the Cuban people  are now pressing forward the revolution and construction with  redoubled efforts under the difficult conditions of the "special  period of peace time". It stresses that no one can stop the  Cuban people from advancing in an indomitable revolutionary  spirit.</p>

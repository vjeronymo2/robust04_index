			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ERRATIC STEWART GAINS SHARE OF SERIES LEAD  </P> <P> PGA champion Payne Stewart overcame the potential disaster of a double bogey to  move into a three-way tie for the third-round lead Saturday in the World Series  of Golf at Akron, Ohio.  </P> <P> Stewart had an erratic 68 -- six birdies, two bogeys, a double bogey -- on the  Firestone Country Club course and finished 54 holes at 207, three under par.  </P> <P> He was tied with Paul Azinger, who shot 67, and David Frost, who shot a 69, but  quickly pointed out that "a lot of guys have a chance to win this; certainly  everybody on the board there."  </P> <P> Stewart gestured to a leaderboard that showed nine players under par, including  Ben Crenshaw, Australia's Greg Norman and defending champion Mike Reid.  </P> <P> Norman, a winner last week in Castle Rock, Colo., Crenshaw, and Jones, the only  three-time winner on the American tour this year, were a stroke off the lead at  208, two under par.  </P> <P> Jones had a 69, and Norman matched par with a 70. Crenshaw, who led through the  first two rounds, had his second consecutive 72.  </P> <P> Reid was tied at 209 with Corey Pavin and Larry Mize. Pavin had a third-round  68; Reid and Mize shot 70s.  </P> <P> Stewart was three under par after six holes and appeared ready to pull away  from the pack until he bogeyed the seventh and chopped up the eighth.  </P> <P> After driving into the rough on No. 8, he hit into a greenside bunker, overshot  the green and made double bogey.  </P> <P> That dropped him back to even for the day, and he had to make a 45-foot putt to  save par on the ninth. He played the back nine in 33, making a 15-footer on the  15th to regain a share of the lead.  </P> <P> Brian Mogg, boosted by an ace at the 201-yard seventh hole, turned in a  seven-under-par 63 to become the leader in the clubhouse at 10 under par before  lightning and rain suspended third-round play at the $500,000 Hamilton  County-Chattanooga tournament at Chattanooga, Tenn.  </P> <P> Mogg, who set a course record with a front nine of six-under-par 29, was one of  36 golfers in the field of 83 to complete the third round.  </P> <P> Ted Schultz, the 36-hole leader at 11 under, parred his first two holes before  play was suspended.  </P> <P> PGA officials announced the third round will be picked up this morning with the  final round of the 72-hole tournament to follow.  </P> <P> Betsy King , a five-time winner this season, rolled in a 15-foot birdie putt on  the 17th hole to take a one-shot lead after the third round of the $265,000  LPGA World Championship tournament at Buford, Ga.  </P> <P> King shot a two-under par 70 for a 54-hole score of 207, nine shots under par  on the hilly, 6,107-yard Pine Isle Resort course.  </P> <P> Pat Bradley and second-round leader Patty Sheehan are tied for second. Bradley  made the big charge of the day, shooting a 68. Sheehan had a 72.  </P> <P> Dottie Mochrie pitched in a 96-yard wedge shot for an eagle on the 14th hole en  route to a five-under 67 and a share of the lead at 140 with Tina Barrett after  two rounds of the LPGA Ocean State Open at Cranston, R.I. Barrett shot a 73.  </P> <P> Bob Charles, seeking his third consecutive victory in this event, shot a  three-under-par 69 and held a one-stroke lead over Charles Coody and Jim Dent  after two rounds of the Charley Pride Senior tournament at Albuquerque, N.M..  </P> <P> Charles has a 36-hole total of nine-under 135. Coody, who began the day tied  with Charles for the lead after an opening 66, struggled to a 70 whereas Dent  matched Charles' 69.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin said here today that China highly treasures its  good-neighborly relations with Russia and wishes to make joint  efforts with Russia to push such relations up to a new level.    He made the remark when meeting with a delegation of the  State Duma from the Russian Federation headed by Chairman Ivan  Rybkin.    Extending a warm welcome to Rybkin and his party on their  visit to China, Jiang said that he expects the chairman's  current visit to play a positive role in developing bilateral  good-neighborliness and promoting mutually-beneficial  cooperation between the two countries.    Jiang expressed his happiness with the fresh development of  the friendship and cooperation between China and Russia over  recent years and said that both China and Russia, sharing a  boundary line of over 4,000 kilometers, need a peaceful external  environment for developing their economies.    He said that sustained and stable good-neighborly relations  between the two countries are in line with the common wishes and  fundamental interests of the two peoples and also beneficial to  the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region and the rest  of the world.    The leaders and statesmen of the two countries are  duty-bound  to fulfill the wishes of the people, Jiang said.    The president said he hoped both China and Russia would  handle bilateral relations from a long-term point of view so as  to bring into the present good-neighborliness an enduring  vitality.    Rybkin said that the Russian people wish to maintain their  relations of close cooperation with the Chinese people and the  Russian State Duma is willing to conduct earnest and  constructive cooperation and exchanges with the Chinese National  People's Congress.    At noon, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing also met with the  delegation.    The delegation, which arrived in Beijing last Saturday [14  May] at the invitation of the NPC Standing Committee, will also  visit Shanghai and Shenzhen during their 5-day stay in China.</p>

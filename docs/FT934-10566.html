			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Banker calls for more supervision of derivatives MARKETS in derivatives products require greater scrutiny, according to Mr Hans Georg Fabritius, the vice president of the Deutsche Bundesbank's regional bank in Hesse, AP-DJ reports from Frankfurt. Mr Fabritius called for international harmonisation of supervisory guidelines in light of the globalisation of markets. Greater transparency also is needed, he said. Derivatives have been the focus of several recent high profile reports, notably a critical appraisal by the Bundesbank itself. 'For me, there's no question that the controls and supervision must be increased,' Mr Fabritius said. Non-binding recommendations for market participants aren't enough. Market transparency, which is 'more than unsatisfactory' in Germany, also must be improved, he said. Annual reports published by German banks offer essentially no description of an institution's activities in the derivatives market, he said. 'The banks should contribute to improving market transparency out of self-interest and which would allow them to better gauge and steer counter-party risk,' he said. Netting, the process of offsetting transactions against each other, has yet to be regulated on an international basis, Mr Fabritius said. In Germany, for example, it's not clear how netting would be treated in bankruptcy cases. While noting that netting diminishes individual counter-party risk, he argued that it does free up equity, thereby permitting further derivatives transactions. The question of determining overall market risk depends in large part on whether derivatives are a stabilising or destabilising factor in the markets, he said. Although they are considered neutral in theory, that has not always been confirmed in practice. Although derivatives do improve the transfer of risk from the more risk-adverse to those willing to take on risk, there are signs that derivatives are used more for trading gains or speculative purposes than to hedge risk, he said. In that way, they become fresh sources of risk. One sign of this is that swap transactions between traders outweigh agreements involving end users, Mr Fabritius said. Some also consider high levels of open interest in the futures markets as an indication of large speculative trades.</p>

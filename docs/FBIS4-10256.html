			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 7 Apr (EFE) -- British Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd denied here today having negotiated an agreement to  sell arms to Brazil during his talks with President Itamar  Franco and with several Brazilian ministers.    Asked about possible negotiations for the sale of British  arms to the Brazilian Armed Forces, Hurd said in a news  conference that "no agreement has been made by the two  governments in this area, but there has been ongoing, steady  aid" by private companies.    Hurd said that he and the Brazilian Army minister, General  Zenildo de Lucena, discussed the development of "joint work"  that would enable Great Britain "to help meet the needs of the  Brazilian Armed Forces."    Hurd added that there are "promising areas" for cooperation,  and that as a British official it was incumbent upon him to  persuade his Brazilian counterparts.    A senior British military official also attended the meeting  between Hurd and Gen. Lucena.    Hurd said he has promoted in Brazil a privatization process  similar to that which was successfully implemented in his  country. He added that in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo he  discussed the possible participation of British businessmen in  the privatization of state-owned electricity and water companies.    Hurd's entourage consists of British businessmen from the  trade, construction, generator and electricity distributor,  arms, and fire equipment sectors.    Hurd emphasized the need for the two countries to reach  agreements that would promote trade and economic relations, such  as the elimination of double taxation, the mutual protection of  investments, and the solution of controversies.    Hurd added that there is heightened interest in Brazil among  British investors. He also said that he had conveyed to Mines  and Energy Minister Alexis Stepanenko the desire to transfer  British know-how to the area of privatization to Brazil.    In his meeting with Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero, Hurd  discussed the Brazilian stabilization program to eradicate  inflation.    Hurd believes that the economic plan formulated by  Ricupero's  predecessor -- Social Democratic presidential candidate Fernando  Henrique Cardoso -- is popular in Brazil. He conveyed his hope  that the plan might be instrumental in defeating inflation,  which currently stands at 45.7 percent monthly.    He added that in light of Brazil's potential, its economic  prospects are "fantastic."    Brazil is the largest market for British exports in South  America. Brazil is also the fifth largest recipient of British  investments, with an estimated total of $2 billion.    According to official figures, Great Britain has a deficit  in  its bilateral trade with Brazil, because in 1993 its exports  totaled $662.5 million while its imports of Brazilian products  totaled $1.3545 billion.    British exports increased by 52 percent in 1993 compared  with  1992.</p>

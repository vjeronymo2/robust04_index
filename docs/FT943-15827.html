			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Electric shocks GEC is struggling to increase its earnings. Though the company warned last December that profits would not advance substantially, yesterday's flat full-year results took the market by surprise. There was no single factor behind the disappointment apart from the competitive nature of most markets in which GEC operates. Since that is not expected to change, the 8 per cent dive in the company's share price looks appropriate. If GEC can wisely invest its Pounds 2.8bn cash mountain, earnings would of course move ahead strongly. But that is a big 'if'. Lord Weinstock, managing director, has been casting around for the right deal since his 1989 Plessey acquisition. Joint ventures with Italy's Finmeccanica and France's Thomson are in the offing but neither will absorb much cash. Marconi may be well-positioned for the much-heralded rationalisation of the European defence industry but it could take a long time to materialise. The scope for strategic moves in GEC's other businesses is limited. Given that GPT's technology is intertwined with that of Siemens, it is hard to see GEC taking independent action in telecommunications. GEC Alsthom may spend some cash by taking equity stakes in power stations around the world but again the sums will not be large. Equally, the promised rationalisation of GEC's other businesses is welcome but may actually add to the cash pile. Lord Weinstock is not inclined to take the alternative route of handing cash back to shareholders. His appointment for another two years at GEC's helm has put an end to that debate at present. But unless he can find the right deal, his successor will be under pressure to switch tack.</p>

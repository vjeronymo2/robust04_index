			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali has spoken in support of Germany becoming a  permanent member of the UN Security Council [UNSC]. This was,  however, a purely personal view, Butrus-Ghali said after a talk  with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in Bonn today. The  decision on this issue lay with the UN General Assembly, he said.    Butrus-Ghali underlined the United Nations' desire that  Germany should play a greater role in international UN missions.  He hoped that the constitutional clarification needed for this  is achieved soon and that Germany will then also be able to  participate fully in UN missions.</p>

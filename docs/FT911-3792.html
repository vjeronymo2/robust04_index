			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investments - Portugal (2): Preparing for turbulence - The Banking Community IN THE past five years the Portuguese banking sector has risen swiftly from a very low base. The question troubling bankers now is whether the growth can continue in the years to come. 'There have been five terrific years of banking,' reflects Mr Carlos Rodrigues, president of Manufacturers Hanover (Portugal). Margins have been high, competition from the state-owned banks - which even after the latest privatisations account for 75 per cent of the sector - less than vigorous. Up until earlier this year, the financial authorities maintained a strict credit ceiling on bank lending. According to Mr Timothy Bradbury, managing director of Lloyds Bank, Portugal (recently bought by BBV, Spain's largest bank), this meant that corporate customers 'were competing to borrow. In the meantime, the private banks could buy liquidity from the public banks and lend it out under their own credit ceiling.' Even now, savers are paid 14-15 per cent on their deposits, subject to 20 per cent withholding tax, which works out at less than inflation. Banks then lend out the funds at 26 per cent retail and 22 per cent wholesale. With such handsome margins, it is not surprising that the banks have prospered. The growth of the sector as a whole is captured in the extraordinary story of Banco Comercial Portugues. When the bank started in 1986, it had 205 shareholders, capital of Esc 3.5bn and 255 employees. Now it has nearly 25,000 shareholders, capital of Esc 66bn and it employs 2,500 people. There is more turnover in BCP shares on the Lisbon stock exchange than in any other company's shares. Coming from nowhere five years ago, BCP is now one of Europe's top 100 banks in terms of capital strength and one of the 60 largest in terms of market capitalisation. The banking industry today cannot be understood without remembering that in 1975 all Portuguese banks were nationalised. It was not until ten years later that the government promoted legislation allowing private banks to be set up. The first stage of deregulation drew six foreign banks into Portugal within 18 months, and local entrepreneurs founded four banks, of which BCP is the best-known. This sudden influx of competition had a profound effect on the sleepy public sector banks. They were exposed as not merely grossly inefficient by European standards - they had more employees per branch than any other European country and fell behind by all other yardsticks  - but downright insolvent. 'Throughout the 1970s and early '80s, we had a social role and we were not driven by normal financial and economic goals,' reflects Mr Pedro Rebelo de Sousa, president of the Banco Fonsecas &amp; Burnay, a state-owned bank which is hoping to be privatised later this year. By the mid-1980s, the consequences of this uncommercial approach were clear: the average percentage of bad credit to total loan portfolios among the state-owned banks had climbed to 20 per cent. 'Many of the borrowers simply didn't exist,' quips one banker. Add-in unfunded pension liabilities and dubious accounting policies and the result was most of the state-owned banks were insolvent. The reaction of Fonsecas to the new environment is typical of that of the whole state-owned sector. It shrunk its staff by 25 per cent. It shored up its balance sheet by selling off properties amid a bull market for real estate. It sorted out its provisions for bad debts and unfunded pension liabilities. It has invested heavily in information technology. Fonsecas now considers that it is virtually indistinguishable from Portugal's private-sector banks. a feeling shared by the large state sector banks such as Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa, which is also hoping to be privatised later this year. The tidying up process completed, these banks like to think of the state as just another shareholder. In this vein, Mr Alipio Dias, president of the Banco Totta &amp; Acores, in which the government retains a residual 15 per cent holding, says 'the treasury is a shareholder like any other.' According to Mr Alexandre Vaz Pinto, president of the Banco Espirito Santo e Comercial de Lisboa and the chairman of the Portuguese Bankers' Association, the average percentage of bad debts to loan portfolio is down to 14 per cent across the state-owned sector. More recently, the public and partially-public banks have shared in the general prosperity of the sector. For example, the 85 per cent privatised Banco Totta reported a 76 per cent increase in cash flow last and assets were up 33 per cent, with profits rising from Esc 73m in 1985 to 3.26bn in 1989. This year the rise in cash flows will be less, but lower provisions will mean that net profits rise by as much as 50 per cent. The pattern is repeated at Caixa Geral de Depositos, the gargantuan state-sector bank which on its own has 25-30 per cent of the Portuguese banking market, a fact easy to understand when one considers that it has 8.5m customers out of a population of 10.5bn. Here, profits have risen from Esc 8.9bn in 1984 to Esc 29.9bn in 1989, with cash flows rising from Esc 15.5bn to Esc 82.2bn. Caixa, which will never leave the public sector, is planning an aggressive branch-opening programme, and aims to increase its branches from 420 to 500 by the end of next year. Caixa is not alone in expanding its branch network  -all the other banks are doing it too. This is but one symptom of increasing competition in the banking sector. The government has yet to deregulate its rules forbidding banks to offer interest-bearing current accounts at anything paying anything other than nominal rates. But relaxation of this rule is expected sooner or later. Another factor behind the increasing competition is the presence of foreign banks - in particular Spanish banks eager to repeat in Portugal the success they have had on domestic territory. More significant, though, is the recent abolition of the credit ceiling. This frees the banks' lending capacity. Combined with increased competition in the market for retail deposits, it is inevitable that banks' spreads and profit margins will narrow. 'When we were founded we realised we only had a limited time to reach a certain dimension,' reflects Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, President of BCP. 'In 1985, we calculated that we wouldn't face intense competition for 5-7 years and that we could reach a certain market share by launching innovative products and introducing new technology. We were were always clear that in 1992 and afterwards there would be intense competition from foreign and domestic private banks.' Competition from foreign banks will be restrained for as long as the government keep in place its restrictions on short term capital flows. Looking ahead, one banker reflects that the days of easy money are over  - 'it's going to be war out there,' he said, 'and it's going to be bloody.'</p>

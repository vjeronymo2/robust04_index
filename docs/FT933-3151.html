			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Taylor Woodrow in the black - Refocusing and cost cutting help put constructor back on track TAYLOR WOODROW, the restructured construction group, returned to the black in the first half, posting pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.1m against a restated Pounds 16.9m loss last time. Turnover in the six months to June 30 increased to Pounds 622.6m (Pounds 594.4m) despite a reduction in contracting turnover which slipped to Pounds 418.8m, against Pounds 435.1m in the 1992 first half. Earnings per share of 1.3p compared with losses of 3.7p in the comparable period and the group, which cut the interim dividend to 0.5p last year, is maintaining it at the reduced rate. Commenting on the turnaround Mr Colin Parsons, chairman, said the structural changes - including refocusing the group on its four core businesses and cutting back on overheads - have put Taylor Woodrow 'back on the track towards the level of performance which our shareholders expect'. Overall the group reported operating profits, excluding a Pounds 5.3m gain resulting from the implementation of the FRS 3 accounting rules, of Pounds 16.4m compared with a Pounds 10.7m loss a year earlier. Despite the reduction in turnover in the core contracting business losses were reduced from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds 3.4m in the latest period. Mr Parsons expressed confidence that although conditions remain highly competitive, the contracting losses should be eliminated this year. The group's property business performed 'reasonably' in the first half, although net rental income fell by about 9 per cent following disposals. Overall the division posted a Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 4.2m) profit on turnover of Pounds 57m (Pounds 43m). In the housing division profits of Pounds 3.9m compared with a Pounds 16.4m loss last time and came on turnover up at Pounds 91.3m (Pounds 65.6m). Mr Parsons said the group's worldwide housing operations, including those in Australia, Florida and Canada, continued to make progress with sales of houses and plots increasing by 34 per cent to 1,095. In the UK house sales grew by 35 per cent to just over 300, but the average price fell by 3 per cent to Pounds 71,000 and the land bank fell slightly to 2,200 plots. The group's net borrowings fell by Pounds 87.3m from the year-end to Pounds 141.3m at June 30, equivalent to gearing of 27 per cent against 44 per cent at the end of December. COMMENT Taylor Woodrow's management team deserves credit for strengthening the balance sheet and improving performance despite the continuing dire problems of the construction sector. The turnaround has been achieved mainly by selling off non-core operations and reducing overheads by some Pounds 20m. However, only about Pounds 18m of pre-tax profits are expected this year, equivalent to earnings per share of about 4.4p. At current prices the shares are trading on a prospective p/e of 27, which looks unjustified.</p>

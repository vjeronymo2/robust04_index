			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Kutenkikh, VLADIVOSTOK: "Miners in Artem </F> Go on Strike"]    [Text] On 13 April employees of the Artemugol  Enterprise began a strike of indefinite duration.    The situation of coal industry workers is critical. The  people have not been paid for January, February, and March, and  the money for December has not been paid either to 15 percent of  workers. There is nothing with which to buy foodstuffs or  clothing, nothing with which to pay for housing and day care  centers (in some day care centers they are already turning  children away).    According to Boris Lesovskiy, deputy general director of the  Primorskugol Production Association, the debt to the association  comes to 62.162 million rubles [R]. The government of the  country is not keeping its end of the rate agreement. At present  the cost of solid fuel in the Maritime area is the lowest in the  country; its price has stayed at the level of the beginning of  1993. Moscow must cover the difference, but it is not doing  this. Even now, the debt comes to R26 billion. Money is not  being allocated for current expenditures. Arrears for the  development of production and razing dilapidated housing already  come to R20.5 billion (miners still live in huts, but funds to  build new housing are simply not available). The list could be  continued.    It has been learned from unofficial sources that Moscow  began  to transfer money towards its arrears the day before yesterday.  However, it was too late. Miners from Artem had stopped working.  Yesterday they discussed the possibility of expressing their  lack of confidence in the government and its prime minister.</p>

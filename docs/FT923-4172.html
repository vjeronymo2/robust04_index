			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UN nuclear inspectors leave Iraq A UNITED NATIONS nuclear inspection team left Iraq yesterday without laying to rest the ghost of a secret underground plant but having agreed a plan to keep an eye on whether Baghdad is reviving its nuclear programme, Reuter reports from Baghdad. Mr Maurizio Zifferero said Iraq's rivers, lakes and canals would be monitored for radioactivity levels, making possible the detection of any resumption of nuclear activities. Mr Zifferero, head of the 14th mission charged with destroying Iraq's nuclear weapons capability, told reporters that Baghdad had to do more to satisfy the Security Council it was complying with the terms of the Gulf War ceasefire. But Mr Zifferero, whose visit followed a period of strained relations between Iraq and the UN, praised the co-operation he received, and said he had laid the groundwork for long-term monitoring. Mr Zifferero, whose 15-member team spent a week travelling round Iraq, said the question would remain unanswered if more detailed information were not forthcoming. Mr Zifferero is a deputy head of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is conducting the nuclear inspectors for the Security Council. The Security Council ceasefire resolution called for the elimination of all Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. President Saddam Hussein's eldest son was yesterday quoted as saying it was time democratic reforms were introduced in Iraq to thwart western attempts to dismember the country, Reuter reports from Baghdad.</p>

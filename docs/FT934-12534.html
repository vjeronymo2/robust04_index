			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Credit Suisse expects increase in profit CREDIT SUISSE, flagship bank of the CS Holding financial services group, said its consolidated pre-tax profit in the third quarter 'showed a marked increase' over last year. It expected a 'good performance' for the full year. No earnings figures were given. The bank earlier reported half-year pre-tax profit of SFr2.4bn (Dollars 1.6bn), 67 per cent higher than in the first half of 1992. Credit Suisse said its investment and trading business continued to benefit from favourable market conditions in the third quarter. The Credit Suisse Financial Products derivatives subsidiary was an important source of income. Progress in merging Swiss Volksbank, acquired last spring for SFr1.6bn, was bringing the expected cost savings. However, the bank warned that loan-loss provisions remained high because of the recession, especially in Switzerland. Consolidated total assets stood at SFr228.4bn at the end of September, 32 per cent above a year earlier. Three-quarters of the growth came from the Volksbank takeover.</p>

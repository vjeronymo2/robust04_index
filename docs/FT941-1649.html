			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Monetarily ad hoc Since the US Federal Reserve first raised short-term interest rates by a quarter of a point early in February, analysts have struggled to make sense of the shell-shocked behaviour of world bond markets. Yet the Fed's decision on Monday to signal a further quarter-point increase, together with the subsequent marginal reduction in the Bundesbank's repurchase rate, are arguably no easier to rationalise than the related market movements. In both the US and Germany ad hoc gradualism appears to have taken the place of a more orthodox framework for policy. The declared intention of the Fed's Mr Alan Greenspan has been to return monetary policy to a neutral stance after the period in which low short-term interest rates were needed to help recapitalise the banking system. More than three years into an increasingly robust recovery, short-term rates of 3 1/2 per cent look more like laxity than neutrality. Nor is it clear why small incremental increases are the appropriate way to contain latent inflationary pressure in an economy where the underlying rate of growth in demand may be running at 3-4 per cent. If Mr Greenspan believes that the pressure is real, it would make more sense - and help stabilise the bond markets - to get the full adjustment out of the way. Similar questions could be raised about the Bundesbank's salami-slicing tactics. The lags in monetary policy are long: it can take up to two years for a given change in short-term rates to have its full impact on real output and inflation. It follows that monetary policy cannot sensibly be fine-tuned from week to week in response to subtle and often contradictory clues as to the state of the domestic economy. As with the Fed, the absolute level of interest rates appears to be behind events, although the bias in this case is on the side of tightness. The Bundesbank could, in mitigation, plead that a strong element of discretion is essential when the money supply figures are overshooting wildly in an economy where recovery is perceptible, but only just. Even so, small incremental rate reductions have failed to prevent the sell-off in the bond markets that has always worried the Bundesbank in view of the funding strains from unification. Perhaps gradualist cuts have the merit of reconciling the wider public to the short-run costs of meeting a historically demanding inflation target of less than 2 per cent. Yet the fact remains that the Bundesbank is in a box; and it is far from clear that the alternative policy to gradual cuts would be any more credible. Comparing the activity of the monetary authorities with the behaviour of US Treasury bonds suggests that the finesse is all on the side of the markets. US bond yields started to rise last October. That looks a more timely - though admittedly politically unrestrained - pre-emptive strike than the Fed's. For the Bundesbank, the dilemma is more complicated. But a policy of frequent, modest cuts remains an unsatisfactory answer.</p>

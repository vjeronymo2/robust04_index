He said:    The U.S. Senate passed the bill of "Radio Free Asia" on  January 25. This is an interference in the internal affairs of  the DPRK and other Asian countries and a criminal act against  them.    What the United States really seeks in setting up the radio  is to imbue the DPRK and other Asian countries with the "view of  the value of American-style democracy" and the poison of  bourgeois ideology, thus stifling socialism in this region and  destroying the independent governments from within.    The United States could profit by such false propaganda in  disintegrating socialist countries in other regions from within  and bringing them back to capitalism. But such a propaganda  cannot work on the DPRK.    We have the chuche idea, the great guiding idea of the era  of  independence, the independent spirit and our-style way of life.  The Korean people regard as their life and blood socialism of  chuche in which the leader, the party and the masses are united  in one mind.    The United States must promptly renounce the plan to set up  "Radio Free Asia," a tool of vile propaganda against the DPRK  and other Asian countries.    Even if the United States started the broadcast in defiance  of the unanimous opposition of the Asian people, it would get  nothing from it.    The Asian people including the Korean people will  determinedly meet the U.S. "cold war" in Asia with the steadfast  independent policy of rejecting "Yankee culture" and defending  Asian traditions, culture and consciousness.</p>

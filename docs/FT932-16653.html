			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Bomb forces market into the 21st century / A look at the Baltic Exchange's future as its HQ reopens today THE BALTIC Exchange, the world's largest shipping market, returns today to its historic City of London headquarters less than a year after the premises were wrecked by an IRA bomb. Trading, which has taken place in the nearby Lloyd's insurance market building, will resume in the Baltic's St Mary's Axe building. Traders will work in the Queen's Room, an austere underground banqueting hall built in the 1950s - the 1903 neo-classical trading floor is not yet rebuilt. The Baltic Exchange accounts for more than half the world's bulk cargo chartering business - buying and selling space in oil tankers and in dry-cargo vessels carrying commodities - and an even larger share of ship sale and purchase contracts. Rebuilding the trading floor and the rest of the headquarters building will take another two to three years - hundreds of numbered blocks of marble and stone are resting in a stonemason's field in Dorset awaiting return to the exchange. The shipping brokers who rented offices in the building have found alternative accommodation. But the Baltic hopes to make up lost rental revenues by careful investment of its Pounds 27.6m insurance settlement. For all the effects of the bombing, which demolished the exchange's marble-clad pillars, glass-domed roof and granite and Portland stone facade, the real threat to the exchange's traditions remains the spread of electronic communications and the growing use of dealing terminals. Heir to the coffee house traditions of the 1740s, when tallow from the Baltic was an important commodity, the Baltic Exchange has clung to the club atmosphere of its chandelier-hung exchange building while many other 'open outcry' markets around the world, including the London Stock Exchange, have closed their trading floors. On the Baltic's busiest days, Mondays and Tuesdays, up to 500 members meet for an hour or so around lunchtime to discuss deals and market trends. Few transactions are concluded on the exchange but the face-to-face contact and the conversation give the impetus to deals. The Baltic's 1,700 individual members, representing 600 companies, earn Pounds 800m of commission income a year on deals worth tens of billions. Although trading was only halted for two days after the bomb, the upheaval prompted a fundamental rethink of the Baltic's role and its future. Mr Jim Buckley, chief executive, said: 'The market was changing anyway. This gave us an opportunity to stand back and ask our members what they wanted in the 21st century.' The overwhelming response from members was that the exchange should maintain and, where possible, expand its trading role. Mr David McNally, chairman of L. Dens, a shipbroker, said that for all its 19th century flavour, a daily market place did provide important advantages. Traders say the complexity of the dry cargo market requires face-to-face discussions, unlike the relatively straightforward tanker market, where cargoes, vessels and routes are more standardised. As well as the position and cost of a vessel, the broker will need to take into account whether it has the right handling equipment for a particular cargo and whether, for example, it is free from infestation from a previous shipment. Even so, members are aware of the threat to the traditional market. The numbers attending the daily market sessions and the length of the sessions have declined over the years. Most tanker contracts are now negotiated on computer screens. Mr David Giles, managing director of Simpson, Spence &amp; Young Shipbrokers, said: 'We cannot deceive ourselves that we can go back to leisurely ways of doing business.' Mr Buckley believes the future for the exchange lies in upgrading communications links so that brokers need not feel cut off from head office while they are on the trading floor. Improved computer links and connections with international messaging networks have been installed in the Queen's Room. Other facilities must also be improved and one plan is for an upmarket restaurant where brokers can take their wealthy overseas customers. Beyond technical improvements to the trading room, the Baltic is seeking a higher profile. It is lobbying for a London shipping register designed to attract Far Eastern and other shipowners while allowing their overseas earnings to be taxed in their home country. London has retained its role as the centre of the shipping world in spite of the dramatic decline in the size of the British merchant fleet. This is because, alongside the Baltic Exchange, it has the Lloyds shipping insurance market and the commercial courts, which play an important role in international shipping disputes. So far this combination has proved attractive to the international shipping community. Greek shipowners, who control the world's largest shipping fleet, make up one third of the Baltic's membership and made generous contributions to help rebuild the exchange. But the physical reconstruction which is going on pales in comparison with the rebuilding of its influence on which the Baltic is now engaged.</p>

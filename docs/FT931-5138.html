			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Tokyo plans new trade policy approach JAPAN plans to adopt a new approach to trade policy with the US, based on the application of formal rules and procedures for settling trade disputes rather than political negotiation, according to Japan's top trade negotiator. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama said Japan wanted a rule-governed approach, to eliminate emotion and politics in settling trade disputes. 'We have given a lot of consideration to US industry; we accepted their request to come up with an import goal for semi-conductors. From now on, we want a trade policy governed by rules set by Gatt. That will eliminate the emotional aspects of the game and help to prevent trade frictions spilling over to affect other aspects of our relations.' Gatt would play a central role in setting the standards for the policy, Mr Hatakeyama added. Trade pacts would have to be Gatt-compatible and more trade complaints would be referred to Gatt for adjudication, he indicated. The policy had been developing since the decision last year to appeal to Gatt over the EC's anti-dumping action against Japanese electronics, Mr Hatakeyama went on. Japan had a strong track record of upholding Gatt accords. It had taken the lead on reducing tariffs on manufactured goods and its average import tariff was just 2.5 per cent, against 5.6 per cent for the EC and 5.5 per cent for the US. Japan had last year been repeatedly rebuffed by the EC and the US when it had tried to contribute to Gatt talks to reduce agricultural subsidies. Japan would take a more active approach to Gatt's stalled Uruguay Round. 'Many people said we were hiding behind the US and the EC, but whenever we tried to negotiate they asked us to wait until they were ready. We were too ready to accept that rejection. Next time we will be more disciplined and make sure we come first.'</p>

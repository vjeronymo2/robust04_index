			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Arts: Another crack at the 'Nutcracker' / Review of John Neumeier's version of this difficult - albeit favourite - ballet at the Opera Garnier, Paris Nutcracker has been a problem ballet ever since the premiere in St Petersburg 101 years ago. Almost every choreographer of note since Petipa's day has had a go and none has been 100 per cent successful. Petipa himself fell ill and handed over to Ivanov - Hawksmoor to Petipa's Christopher Wren. The ballet's popularity has been due mainly to Tchaikovsky's music. The difficulty has always been the scenario, drawn from a tale by Hoffmann with results inept, ill-structured and largely senseless. For its end of the year show, the Opera Garnier presented for the first time in Paris John Neumeier's version, under the old name Casse-Noisette. First seen at Frankfurt in 1971, this version makes a serious effort to put things right. The first part is the best. The child Clara becomes the slightly older Marie, celebrating her 12th birthday at home with a party to which her envied older ballerina sister, Louise, has brought some of her friends from the theatre. Among these are young Gunther, to whom Marie takes a fancy, and also her ballet-master Drosselmeier. There are children, but they are kept in the background. The main dancing is done by the teenagers and principals with a bunch of strapping cadets - chums of Marie's brother Franz. All this is greatly to the advantage of the homely, domestic romps. Everything is clear. One does not feel like Ethel Smyth, lured to Sadler's Wells in the early days to see Casse- Noisette and overheard asking her companion, 'what are they doing and why are they doing it?'. When Marie steals back after the guests have gone to retrieve the nutcracker she has been given, falls sleep and starts to dream, things do not go so well. At this point in the score there begins a long, through-composed sequence embodying at least three embryonic Lisztian symphonic poems, culminating in the impressionist Snowflakes Waltz. Neumeier leaves out the battle of toy-soldier and mice (difficult to set but a necessary musical contrast). The marvellous slow three-four section, richly harmonised and sumptuously scored, perfect evocation of a child's mounting wonderment, is no longer a transition to the snow forest but a pas-de-deux for Marie and Gunther, now revealed as a principal dancer. Neumeier then borrows an interlude from The Sleeping Beauty as another pas de deux - for Louise and Drosselmeier. No snow-forest, but an off-white dance studio where Drosselmeier teaches while the music skirls and eddies snowily - and where are the off-stage chorus? Alexandre Benois (who at the end of his career designed a much-liked Nutcracker for Festival Ballet) described the St Petersburg original staging as 'hideous' in his diary. Some surviving photographs bear him out. The final scene in the Land of Sweets is a designer-trap. What could be more visually unappetising than enlarged confectionery? Jurgen Rose, who has adapted his designs for the Opera stage, avoids the trap with a handsome but restrained baroque-style background. The famous character dances performed in front of it are perfect examples of Tchaikovsky the melodist and colourist: no-one except Bizet and, to a lesser extent, Delibes could approach him here. Neumeier treats them as vignettes based on the titles of long-forgotten Petipa ballets - a little solemn and, in the Chinese Dance so much admired by Stravinsky, a little slow. The Valse des Fleurs is played before the divertissement, which brings it too near the other waltz scene. As for the Grand Pas de Deux, the ultimate expression in music and movement of the turned-out upward-thrusting, imperious classical style, it suffers from there being too many pas-de-deux in a ballet where one usually feels there are too few. Marie, coyly simpering like Mother Simone in La Fille mal gardee, is persuaded to dance the celesta variation while Louise is given an extra solo from The Sleeping Beauty. Should not the whole, climactic sequence be danced exultantly in the presence of the whole company, not as here for the sole benefit of Marie and Drosselmeier? The performance by the soloists - when I saw them, Elisabeth Maurin (Marie), Elisabeth Platel (Louise), Patrick Dupond (Drosselmeier), Manuel Legris (Gunther) - and by the corps was admirable. The music with Jonathan Dorlington conducting the Orchestre Symphonique Francais, was given full justice. For once the first-act dances were played with as much care as the better-known ones in the second. The sound had a warmth and clarity which were a joy to hear. There is a further series of performances from January 19 to 28</p>

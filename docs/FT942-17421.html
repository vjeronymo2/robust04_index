			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / People: Gaviria courts OAS scepticism It is usual in Washington to scoff at the Organisation of American States, the western hemisphere's private and generally ineffectual United Nations, writes George Graham. It is also, however, polite to greet new arrivals with enthusiasm, so Cesar Gaviria, who will take over as OAS secretary general when he steps down as president of Colombia in August, can expect messages of support. US politicians have tended to treat the OAS with the same kind of scepticism they shower on the UN. 'The Organisation of American States is a kind of mini-United Nations where we can be voted down in only three languages, thereby saving translators' fees,' says Irving Kristol, the conservative commentator. Latin American members, on the other hand, have seen the OAS as rarely able to extricate itself from the dilemma that if it acts the way the US wants, it is accused of kowtowing, while if it doesn't, it is simply ignored. They have increasingly taken their problems directly to the UN in New York. Gaviria should get a warm welcome from President Clinton, who has shown his interest in Latin America by calling a summit meeting of the region's heads of state - even if his choice of Miami for the gathering is not universally acclaimed. Now 47 - the same age as Clinton - Gaviria was elected to parliament at the age of 27 and became finance minister before he turned 40. His presidency has been an uphill struggle, but despite widespread drug violence, Gaviria has made headway in opening up the Colombian economy through free trade and privatisation. Free trade will also be his priority at OAS, he says, with an ambitious goal of linking the hemisphere's trading blocs into a single free trade zone.</p>

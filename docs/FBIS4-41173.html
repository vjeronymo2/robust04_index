			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 22 Jun -- With presidential elections in  Belarus being just a day away, one of the leading candidates  Vyacheslav Kebich, chairman of republican council of ministers,  has arrived in Moscow. A meeting between Vyacheslav Kebich and  First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets is on the list of  today's activities for Russia's top government officials.    The Russian government office is not saying much about the  content of the meeting which took place behind closed doors.  One can assert that the Russian Cabinet of Ministers likes one  of the election promises of the Belarusian prime minister,  namely his intention to introduce "tax holidays" for Russian  goods which are not going to be taxed.    It is thought that Vyacheslav Kebich will be received in the  Kremlin since Boris Yeltsin made it clear at a press conference  on 10 June that Russia is "very much" interested in the Belarus  election results. It is obvious who Russia would like to see as  the head of Belarus.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- A Labor Ministry panel  proposed Monday [6 June] that Japan's traditional lifelong  employment system be revised to meet the changing industrial  structure and the fast growing aging population, officials said.    The officials said the proposal was made in a report worked  out by the Labor Ministry's Employment Policy Research Group.    The officials said the report urged the government to map  out  a new employment policy that would include revising the  seniority-based, lifetime employment system, long hailed as  contributing to Japan's economic growth.    In view of the changing industrial structure and graying  society, new labor problems are expected to arise that the  traditional employment system will not be able to overcome, the  report said.    To promote structural change through deregulation and  maintain the labor supply-demand balance, it is necessary for  the government to implement appropriate macroeconomic policies  and investment expansion designed to achieve annual economic  growth of about 3.0 percent, the report said.    While basically maintaining the long-term employment system,  new steps must be taken by enterprises to develop human  resources and secure part-time workers, the report said.    The officials said the report also stressed the need for the  government to systematically foster workers engaged in public  welfare-related fields to cope with the aging society.    It urged the government to consolidate the environment in  which middle-aged and senior workers are allowed to work to the  age of 65.    The report also called on the government to take positive  steps to promote employment of female workers.    The officials said the report will be reflected in a new  employment policy to be worked out by the ministry.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksey Tarasov: "Leaders with Access to </F> Secrets"]    [Text] Krasnoyarsk -- Since the soviets of people's  deputies have departed this life, the kray administration has  been interested in lawmaking in Krasnoyarsk. But despite the  passion with which officials have given themselves over to this  task, they have not crowned themselves with laurels. The  statute on elections to the kray legislative assembly scheduled  for 27 March forbids the publication in the 10 days prior to the  voting of the results of public opinion polls connected with the  forthcoming elections.    We recall that this ban was in operation on the eve of the  12  December all-Russian parliamentary elections but led to nothing  good. And now it is happening again.    Why the kray administration needed this is in general  understandable: By receiving punctually sociological  information which is closed to the press it will receive an  opportunity to control the course of the election campaign where  the rest of the public is assigned the role of extras.  Officials will find it easier to make operational conclusions  and to manipulate public consciousness.    The kray referendum is scheduled for 27 March: The  population is to express its attitude toward the local law "on  the foundations of direct power of the people and the  organization of state power in Krasnoyarsk Kray." The  interpretation of the power of the people and of democracy in  this document gives rise to a mass of questions.    But let us return to the elections ceremony. Seven days  before them the governor has also banned "the dissemination of  materials detrimental to the honor and dignity of candidate  deputies." What, in the remaining days -- before and after --  is it possible to cause harm? And what about the honor and  dignity of other citizens who are not contenders for seats?    The local administration separately approved inter alia a  statute on the procedure for the use of the mass media by  candidate deputies which includes the following point for one:  "Journalists, creative workers, and officials who commit  violations may at the suggestion of the relevant electoral  commission be removed for the period through the end of the  election campaign from work connected with its coverage by the  leaders of the mass media.... The electoral commission, in  cases where mass media editorial offices violate the procedure  for conducting election campaigning more than once, have the  right to raise the question of the dismissal of leaders of mass  media editorial offices...."    Under the law "on the mass media" this is called  interference  in the activity of editorial offices and violation of their  professional independence (and the 10-day moratorium on the  publication of sociological reports is forcing the journalists  to renounce the dissemination of information).    It seems there is one thing left for the local press: not to  fulfill illegal bans. Incidentally, KRASNOYARSKIY KOMSOMOLETS  had the day before, 12 December, familiarized its readers with  the data of sociological polls so the outcome of the elections  was no sensation for them.    Incidentally, KRASNOYARSKIY KOMSOMOLETS because of financial  difficulties was recently obliged to take on as a co-founder the  kray administration's press and information department. But the  new owner does not even have enough money for those who do not  contradict it.    So far no demonstration against the restriction of freedom  of  speech in Krasnoyarsk has been observed. On the other hand, the  triumphal procession of bureaucrats is continuing to talk of the  establishment of a civil society and the separation of powers.</p>

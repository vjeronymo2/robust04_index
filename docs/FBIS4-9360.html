			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["rueb." report: "Romania Warns Against `Disastrous Logic </F> of Violence'"]    [Text] Bucharest, 24 April -- Foreign Minister Melescanu  has commented reservedly on NATO's threats against the Bosnian  Serbs that are connected with the ultimatum. It is still too  early to assess this step, he said in an interview with this  newspaper. He sees the possibility that an acceleration of the  peace process might follow from the threat. However, it is also  conceivable that a disastrous logic of violence will be started.  It might become very difficult to break it again, he said.    Melescanu took the view that, after the agreement between  the  Muslims and Croats on the formation of a joint state in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the attempt has to be made now to again  involve the Bosnian Serbs in the negotiations. A comprehensive  peace plan that starts from the German-French peace initiative  is necessary. In return for concessions of the Bosnian Serbs in  the peace negotiations, this plan, which was proposed by  [German] Foreign Minister Kinkel and [French] Foreign Minister  Juppe and later adopted by the European Union (EU), provides for  the gradual loosening of the sanctions against Serbia and  Montenegro. In addition to the European Union, the United  States, Russia, and the United Nations have to be involved in  the talks of the warring parties, Melescanu said.    Nastase, president of the Chamber of Deputies of the  Romanian  Parliament and chairman of the biggest partner in the government  coalition, the Social Democracy Party of Romania (PDSR),  expressed the view that, with NATO's latest threats, the peace  process has reached a decisive point. Nastase, who is expected  for a five-day visit to Germany this Monday [25 April], told  this newspaper that the shelling of Muslim enclaves by the  Serbian besiegers has to be stopped immediately. At the same  time, however, he also warned against a possible escalation of  violence. All political means have to be used to accelerate the  peace process again. Here a gradual loosening of the sanctions  against Serbia and Montenegro is also to be considered. So many  attempts have been made to achieve peace in the former  Yugoslavia. "We should also try to loosen the sanctions,"  Nastase said.    According to Nastase, Romania has suffered an economic  damage  of more than 11 billion German marks [DM] as a consequence of  the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. In order to  compensate the neighboring countries of "Yugoslavia" -- Serbia  and Montenegro -- at least for part of the damage, Nastase  proposed the establishment of a UN fund. Romania, which has  traditionally good relations with all successor states of the  former Yugoslavia, is offering its services as a further  mediator in the Balkan war, if this is desired. Bucharest is  also conceivable as a possible place for new peace negotiations.    "Yugoslav" Prime Minister Jovanovic said in Bucharest that  NATO's threats are an "unfortunate development" and a further  proof of the continuous application of different standards in  the Balkan war by the West. The "negative developments" in  Gorazde were caused by a Muslim offensive, to which the Bosnian  Serbs had only reacted with a counteroffensive. The "Muslim  offensive," however, was not noticed in the West, but it reacted  with punitive actions to the Serbian counteroffensive.  Jovanovic expressed the fear that the "important results" of  the meeting of Akashi, UN envoy for the former Yugoslavia, with  Serbian President Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic in  Belgrade last Saturday, might be thwarted by NATO's "pressure  from the outside." Morizet, French diplomat in Bucharest, felt  called upon to warn that one must not counter "the terror on the  ground with (NATO) terror from the air" in Bosnia.</p>

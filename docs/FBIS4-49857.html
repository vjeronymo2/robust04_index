			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Antoine So: "Vice Premier Warns Against Squeeze on </F> Export Prices"]    [Text] The vice premier has warned of a possible weakness  in the reform of China's foreign trade policy that might allow  foreign investors and suppliers to squeeze China's export prices.    State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing told officials of the  Foreign Trade Ministry that in the process of reforming China's  foreign trade policy, care must be taken against foreign  corporations squeezing the prices of Chinese exports. He was  speaking at the 57th anniversary of Guangzhou Stock Exchange.    Mr Li said that as China reformed its economy and become  more  open, exporters' profit margins might be squeezed as their  suppliers took advantage of the booming export levels and  charged unreasonably high prices.    He also said exporters should guard against foreign  investors  reducing the prices of China's exports.    Without commenting on the current situation, Mr Li said that  price squeezing could adversely affect the country's balance of  payments and thus the foreign exchange system.    Mr Li called on the Ministry of Foreign Trade to guard  against any price squeezing by foreign investors.    He said privatization of state-owned enterprises, which  would  improve their efficiency, needed to continue as a way of  preventing such price squeezing.    He said China had been very successful in attracting foreign  investment in the 10 years since it started its open-door  economic policy. Many former trade restrictions had been lifted  and foreign investment has soared rapidly in recent years.    The foreign trade policy reform, in which international  corporations were invited into the China market, had brought the  country wealth and improvements, Mr Li said.    The State Statistics Bureau said foreign investment in the  first quarter of the year alone had increased to U.S.$5.4  billion (HK$42.1 billion), spread among 11,800 projects. In the  past 10 years, China had approved 186,062 foreign investment  projects with total contractual investment of U.S.$241.5  billion, of which U.S.$67.2 billion had been put to use.    But state-owned corporations also needed to pay attention to  improving product quality and to human resources in order to  better compete in the market, Mr Li said.    As a first step to improving export quality, he urged a  faster introduction of the International Standards Organizations  ISO9000 product certification system.</p>

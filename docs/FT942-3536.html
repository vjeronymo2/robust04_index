			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: The most beautiful factory in all the land  -British Steel's biggest Turkish project since the Bosporus Bridge About 100 miles east of Istanbul is a group of new buildings which Mr William Boyd thinks is the most beautiful factory in Turkey. 'I hope lots of Turkish industrialists drive past and say, 'I want one like that,'' he says. Mr Boyd is general manager for central and eastern Europe at British Steel, which has just completed producing Pounds 3m of structural steel and cladding for the factory at Adapazari. From September it is due to be producing Toyota Corollas in a Pounds 325m joint venture, called Toyotasa, between Turkey's Sabanci group, Toyota itself and Mitsui, the Japanese trading house. The contract is very important for British Steel's business strategy in Turkey. The Toyotasa plant is highly visible, not only as a striking building in a mainly agricultural region but also as the first Japanese passenger car plant in Turkey. Mr Boyd hopes it will begin a trend for steel to be used in industrial and other buildings instead of the traditional concrete. But there is another reason why Mr Boyd - who took over at the Istanbul office eight months ago - is happy. British Steel is also supplying Toyotasa with at least 45 per cent of the steel for the Corollas' body panels, exporting up to 4,500 tonnes of blanks a year from the UK. That lifts the total value of British Steel's involvement with Toyotasa to Pounds 10m, making it the steelmaker's biggest project in Turkey since the Bosporus Bridge in 1973. To show how significant British Steel believes the deals are, Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive, was personally responsible for the inaugural tree planting ceremony. British Steel's trading company in Turkey, British Steel Celik Ticaret, was set up in 1987, with the UK company holding a 50 per cent stake and Turkish interests, including the family company Ege Metal, holding the rest. 'Because of Turkey's location it is a natural place for countries from the Ukraine to Italy to sell steel, and very competitive,' says Mr Boyd. So, unwilling to compete with the prices offered by subsidised competitors, British Steel has concentrated on high value added products. The Toyotasa contract was a classic example. The venture could not get the quality of galvanised steel it wanted for the cars from local suppliers and is instead buying two grades from British Steel and Sollac, part of Usinor Sacilor, and a third grade from Nippon Steel. British Steel won the order on technical performance and price. It was also helped by being a supplier of steel coil for Toyota's UK plant near Derby. The steel for the Toyotasa car bodies is to be processed into blanks by British Steel Distribution at Warley in the West Midlands, and shipped by Mitsui to Turkey. Steel for the factory's pre-coated cladding was shipped from Shotton, north Wales, and profiled into polyurethane-filled roof and wall panels at British Steel Yasan in Istanbul, another joint venture in which British Steel has a 25 per cent stake. The Yasan joint venture has won 10 other small contracts and was profitable in its first year of operation. It is now bidding to be subcontractor for whichever of six construction companies builds a proposed Honda car plant in Turkey. Next door to the venture, on a dusty industrial estate, a steel service centre owned by Yasan, 50 per cent shareholder in BSY, is being converted into a showpiece for steel cladding. The Toyotasa plant was designed by Ove Arup, but persuading Turkish architects to specify more steel for factories, offices and even high-rise apartment blocks may not be easy. 'It's just that we have been slow to change from concrete,' said Mr Sarik Tara, chairman of Enka, Turkey's largest construction company and builder of the Toyotasa plant. Mr Boyd is betting that where Enka goes, other Turkish construction companies will surely follow. He also hopes British Steel can benefit indirectly from the push by the Turkish construction sector into eastern Europe and neighbouring CIS republics. The immediate prospects of further work in Turkey for BSY are not that bright because of Turkey's austerity package announced in April and uncertainty over the future of the economy and the Turkish lira. Industrialists are holding back from building new factories, but Mr Boyd says the long-term future is quite good, with a lot of infrastructural work needed in Turkey. The trading company is also likely to see volumes fall this year, after rising steadily to 110,000 tonnes last year. But Mr Boyd has high hopes of developing the market for more specialised UK flat-rolled steel. He is currently trying to persuade Arcelik, the fast-growing Turkish white goods producer, to buy white pre-painted steel, rather than set up a paint shop at a proposed new fridge factory. At Toyotasa, meanwhile, Mr Ozdemir Sabanci, president, admits he is relieved the plant is opening in September rather than now, when car sales in Turkey have virtually ground to a halt. But although he is less optimistic than some about the Turkish car market, he still believes it will rise from a record 440,000 units last year to 600,000 by the end of the decade. Toyotasa is due to produce about 2,000 cars this year and 30,000 in 1995. It has promised the Turkish government it will have capacity of 100,000 by May 1997. The venture is also studying whether to add further Toyota models, said Mr Sabanci. On current forecasts of demand, British Steel's supply of blanks would last about four years, and while there are no guarantees, the UK company should be in a good position to supply for longer. Toyotasa has promised Ankara that cars from the plant will have 70 per cent local content after five years of production. But if Turkey is in the European Union by then, the UK steel - and engines being supplied by Toyota's Deeside plant - would count as local content. Also, while Mr Sabanci believes component suppliers may set up around the car plant as demand grows, steel for the car bodies will not be available in Turkey 'for the foreseeable future,' he says. It may be going a bit far to bracket Adapazari with Coventry or Luton, but at least parts of the plant's new cars will be British.</p>

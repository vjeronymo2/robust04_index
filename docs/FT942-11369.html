			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Nationwide to form its own life and unit trust subsidiaries Nationwide Building Society is to set up wholly owned life insurance and unit trust subsidiaries, weakening its links with Guardian Royal Exchange, the composite insurance group. The move, due to take effect in mid-1995, marks a further unravelling of the links between life insurance companies and building societies. In taking this step, Nationwide is joining most of the larger societies. Halifax, the UK's largest society, announced last autumn that it was severing its link with Standard Life. Nationwide, the UK's second largest society, currently acts as a 'tied agent', selling only GRE insurance products through its branches, for which it receives a commission. Nationwide Life will sell a range of products from term assurance to unit trusts and personal equity plans, which it claims will be tailored more closely to customers' needs. The new arrangement should also be more profitable to the society than merely taking commission from a life company. GRE has been retained on a contract for the first five years of the new operation, to provide Nationwide with technical and administrative support. The society has yet to select its fund manager. Though the announcement yesterday had been expected, it is still a blow to GRE. In 1993, 30 per cent of its new life business came through Nationwide. GRE said the end of the 'tie' had been expected and it would be looking to build up the business sold through independent financial advisers to fill the gap. Some industry analysts were sceptical, however, that this would prove immediately successful, with one describing the company as having 'a credibility problem' because of the previously poor performance of some of its products. Mr Brian Davis, due to become Nationwide's chief executive in August, said there was scope for increasing sales of insurance and investment products to the society's 8m customers. Of the 10 largest societies, only Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth largest, and Bristol &amp; West, ranking tenth, will have ties - to Scottish Amicable and Eagle Star respectively. A further change could occur this autumn when Woolwich, the third largest society, reviews the arrangements for its life subsidiary.</p>

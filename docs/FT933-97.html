			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Mercedes opts for Alabama as plant site MERCEDES-BENZ, the German luxury car company, will today announce a decision to locate its first US car manufacturing plant, costing Dollars 300m, in the state of Alabama. The decision ends the most heated competition in the past year between US states over the site of a greenfield manufacturing investment by a foreign company. It is a coup for Alabama, which has a cluster of high-technology industries in the north, but has been slower than other south-eastern rivals to attract high-profile new investment. Mercedes announced last April it planned to build a new four-wheel-drive sports utility vehicle in the US, but left open the location of the plant. Although more than 30 states offered sites, the company came down to a short list in the south-eastern US, which apparently included North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama. North Carolina had been widely rumoured to be the front-runner. The company, which has called a news conference for this morning in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, will name a site at nearby Vance, on a 1,000-acre site set amid rolling forest and parkland. Mercedes is already an important manufacturer of heavy trucks in the US, through its Freightliner subsidiary. This, however, will be its first car manufacturing operation on any scale outside Germany. The plant, due to start production in 1997, will employ 1,500 people by the end of the decade and make up to 60,000 vehicles a year, with as much as 40,000 of them for export. Mercedes is following a lead set by BMW, the rival German luxury car company, which is building a Dollars 350m plant in another south-eastern state, South Carolina, where it will manufacture a new car for the US and export markets.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / China likely to be given HK deadline CHINA IS likely to be given until the beginning of October to reach agreement with Britain about Hong Kong's political development or face a termination of the talks. Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, flies to London next week for a meeting of the British cabinet's Hong Kong committee on Wednesday which will discuss a range of policy options, including the immediate cessation of talks. The cabinet is, however, expected to allow them to continue until the autumn. Mr Patten will address the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's law-making body, on October 5. At this time he wants either to unveil a Sino-British agreement, or in the absence of an agreement, announce that LegCo will be given the task of debating his proposals for wider democracy. The tougher British stance comes amid a marked deterioration in bilateral relations. Talks with the Chinese over the past three days in the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), which is charged with negotiating the fine detail of Hong Kong's reversion to China, were yesterday described by Mr Anthony Galsworthy, Britain's chief JLG representative, as 'dismal'. Mr Galsworthy said the Chinese may have thought that by 'going slow they can put pressure on the UK in the wider context'. This would be a 'miscalculation,' he said. He warned that China was damaging Hong Kong's future prosperity by its refusal to take the JLG seriously. Britain had hoped China would approve the expansion of the colony's container port, but China said it needed more time to study the project and criticised Britain for not providing enough information. Negotiations in Beijing about the arrangements for Hong Kong's 1994-95 elections also appear to be getting nowhere. In these talks, the sixth round of which began yesterday, Britain has made a number of proposals which the pro-Beijing press in Hong Kong has described as 'deceitful demands'. Britain has sought Hong Kong government participation in a 1996 committee China plans to establish to prepare for Hong Kong's first post-colonial government and legislature. This committee will vet the fitness for office of senior Hong Kong government officials and those elected to LegCo in 1995. Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador at Beijing and the head of the negotiating team, has told the Chinese that if Beijing is serious about the compatibility of the colony's pre-1997 political system with its post-1997 system then it has to discuss its plans for Hong Kong with the UK. Meanwhile, in a move which indicates Beijing's pessimism about the talks, China has announced the creation of a panel which will consider preliminary preparations for China's resumption of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997. The panel, headed by Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, consists of 27 mainland officials and 30 Hong Kong citizens, including property tycoon Mr Li Ka-shing and Mr David Li, head of Bank of East Asia. It was widely criticised by pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong yesterday as being unrepresentative of opinion in the colony.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 5 BAY LAWMAKERS SPENT $2 MILLION ON '88 RACES  </P> <P> Five South Bay legislators spent more than $2 million last year to win  reelection to legislative positions that pay $40,816 a year.  </P> <P> Final year-end campaign finance statements filed last week with the secretary  of state show that the four local Assembly members and one senator up for  reelection last November raised $1.85 million in campaign contributions in  1988.  </P> <P> The gap between the amount raised and the amount spent was closed by tapping  campaign reserves or by borrowing from other legislators or outside sources.  </P> <P> In addition to a salary, lawmakers receive $88 a day in tax-free expense  payments during the legislative session, plus such perks as office expense  allowances, auto lease payments and state gasoline credit cards.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) spent $649,703, more than any other  South Bay lawmaker, to win reelection from his heavily Republican 51st Assembly  District. The veteran had to fight off a bitter and expensive Republican  primary challenge last spring from Deane Dana III, son of Los Angeles County  Supervisor Deane Dana, before coasting to victory last November.  </P> <P> Felando raised $589,493 in contributions and made up the difference by  borrowing from some of his Assembly Republican colleagues. He listed debts of  $53,500 at the end of December, all but $10,000 of which was owed to the  campaigns of fellow Republican lawmakers.  </P> <P> During the latest filing period from Oct. 23 to Dec. 31, Felando also received  direct contributions from some of his legislative colleagues, including $5,000  checks from Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and Assemblyman Stan  Statham (R-Oak Run). Felando also collected contributions from commercial  fishing interests in his native San Pedro and from special interest groups in  Sacramento. The California Assn. of Realtors political committee gave $450  during the reporting period, boosting its total contribution for the year to  $4,600. The Insurance Men's political committee gave $300 during the period and  $2,650 for the year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Father's Loans  </P> <P> In an unusual twist, incumbent Felando was outspent by GOP challenger Dana, a  former official in Gov. George Deukmejian's Administration, who spent $777,106.  The younger Dana's insurgent campaign was almost totally financed by his  father, the supervisor, who resented Felando's successful effort in 1986 to  oust Dana allies on the Republican county committee. He loaned his son $712,500  in an unsuccessful effort to break the assemblyman's lock on the district,  which runs from the beach cities to San Pedro, including Torrance and Lomita.  The loans were forgiven.  </P> <P> Running a close third in spending was Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson),  the only other South Bay legislator to face a well-financed challenger last  year.  </P> <P> Floyd, a Hawthorne city councilman, raised $616,994 and spent $581,081 to  assure his victory in the 53rd Assembly District against Republican challenger  Charles Bookhammer.  </P> <P> As chairman of the powerful Assembly Governmental Organization Committee, which  handles all legislation dealing with alcoholic beverages, horse racing, the  lottery and gambling, Floyd received large contributions from card clubs and  horse-racing interests.  </P> <P> Card clubs, including the Normandie Club of Gardena, gave $6,000 and the  Commerce Club of Commerce gave $5,500. The Pacific Racing Assn. of Albany gave  $3,700.  </P> <P> Shortly before the November election, Floyd received a $20,000 no-interest loan  from Sacramento developer and horse-racing figure Christo D. Bardis. The  assemblyman later repaid $5,000, leaving a $15,000 balance.  </P> <P> Floyd also owes $15,000 to the campaign committee of his former boss, Sen.  Ralph Dills (D-Gardena), and $2,000 apiece to Assemblyman Dave Elder (D-Long  Beach) and Rep. Marty Martinez (D-Monterey Park). All the loans date back to  Floyd's first race for the Legislature in 1980.  </P> <P> Floyd, a member of the leadership of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San  Francisco), received $36,580 in cash contributions from Brown's political  committee. He also received $48,345 in campaign postage from the Democratic  State Central Committee, which can send campaign mailers at a lower postal rate  than candidates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Donations to Floyd  </P> <P> Labor unions and trial lawyers also continued their historic practice of making  large donations to Floyd. The California Applicants Attorneys Assn. gave $5,750  during the latest reporting period and a total of $17,750 for the year. The  California Trial Lawyers Assn. gave $2,000 during the reporting period and  $17,000 for the year.  </P> <P> The State Building and Construction Trades Council gave $3,000 in the last  reporting period and $6,500 for the year, the same amount as the United Auto  Workers.  </P> <P> In the final days before the November election, Floyd gave $19,520 to John  Vollbrecht, the Democratic challenger to Assemblyman Pat Nolan of Glendale, who  was then Republican leader in the Assembly. Floyd and Nolan have been bitter  adversaries for years.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Curtis R. Tucker (D-Inglewood), who died of cancer last October,  raised $302,938 and spent a total of $327,593 on his primary and general  election campaigns in 1988. Tucker easily defeated Inglewood City Councilman  Daniel Tabor in a Democratic primary contest last June and made history in  November by being reelected after his death.  </P> <P> Shortly before he died, Tucker transferred $28,000 from his campaign treasury  reserves to that of his son, Curtis Tucker Jr., a candidate in Tuesday's  special election for the open 50th Assembly District seat.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Tucker's year-end campaign statement shows a final payment of $234  for the lease on his state car, a 1986 Cadillac, that was later purchased by  his widow, according to Bob Connelly, chief administrative officer for the  Assembly Rules Committee.  </P> <P> Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) spent $210,185 to win a fourth term  against token opposition in the 29th Senate District. He raised $141,832 in  contributions and covered the difference by reducing a massive campaign  surplus. Even so, Beverly still had $339,275 left in his treasury at year's  end.  </P> <P> His largest contribution during the reporting period came from the California  Medical Assn., which gave $3,000, boosting its total for the year to $7,000.  The California Optometric Assn.'s political committee donated $1,500 during the  period.  </P> <P> A political committee of California Retailers gave Beverly $1,200 just before  Christmas, boosting its total contributions for the year to $3,200.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reimbursement for Gifts  </P> <P> Assemblyman Elder, who faced only minor opposition in the 57th Assembly  District, raised $208,163 and spent $287,645 on his reelection campaign. The  difference came from a reduction in his campaign reserve to just under $15,000  at year's end.  </P> <P> His largest contributions during the reporting period came from the California  State Council of Service Employees, which donated $1,500, and IDM Corp., a Long  Beach developer, which gave $1,000.  </P> <P> Among the more unusual expenses that Elder reported was $4,460 to repay himself  for Thanksgiving and Christmas gifts to his staff, for Christmas cards and  child-care costs for a Sacramento campaign worker.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In Rwanda, fresh fighting broke out today in  Kigali. [passage omitted] Philippe Gaillard, the ICRC  representative in the Rwandan capital, spoke to us on the  telephone about an hour ago:    [Begin Gaillard recording] The situation in Kigali is  extremely tense. Only 15 minutes ago -- it is now exactly 1850  hours in Kigali -- we had to rush to the ground floor of this  building because of an exchange of heavy weapons fire between  the RPF and government troops. Rebero hill was under fire for  most of the day, and the hotel on top of that hill, occupied by  the RPF, is now ablaze.    The situation in Kigali, as elsewhere in Rwanda, is  despairing and desperate. This is dialogue by the gun and the  machete -- nothing else. [passage omitted] I take this  opportunity to appeal to the international community, and  especially to the Rwandans listening to RFI, to stop this  suicide. All are losers in this war. All are losers. [end  recording]</p>

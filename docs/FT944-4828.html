			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Russia and Chechnya in deal Russia and its breakaway republic of Chechnya have agreed to settle their differences without force following last-ditch peace talks held yesterday in the neighbouring region of Ingushetia. Both President Dzhokhar Dudayev of Chechnya and General Pavel Grachev, Russia's defence minister, emerged from more than an hour of talks to declare: 'There will not be a military solution to the question.' President Boris Yeltsin also urged the Russian parliament to declare an amnesty for those involved in the recent fighting. The terms of the agreement were not immediately known but Russian military sources suggested Gen Grachev would insist on three conditions being met: an early meeting between Mr Dudayev and the opposition forces; the disarming of illegal military units in Chechnya; and the immediate release of all Russian servicemen captured in the recent fighting. Gen Grachev had earlier met Chechen opposition leaders and promised them he would insist on free parliamentary elections being held. According to the Interfax news agency, Mr Dudayev's intentions in the talks were to ensure that Russia would stop supporting Chechen opposition attacks and would withdraw its regular armed forces, which have been massing on the border.</p>

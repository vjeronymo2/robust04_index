			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of </F> the Presidential Council in the "Democratic Republic of Yemen,"  by Muhammad 'Allam in Cairo; date not given: "Salih Tells  AL-HAYAH: We Will Resist the Fundamentalist State in Sanaa"]    [Text] Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Presidential  Council of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" [DRY], has  confirmed that the Cairo meetings which began the day before  yesterday between Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary  general, and delegations from north and south Yemen to find a  mechanism for the promotion and consolidation of a cease-fire,  have failed.. He attributed this to many reasons including the  level of the northern delegation and the other side's insistence  on fighting and failure to honor Security Council resolution  924. Salim Salih, who is also the assistant secretary general  of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], ruled out intervention by  the Arab League to bring these talks under its supervision.    In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Salih accused the Security  Council of being slow. He praised the U.S. position because "it  is balanced and views the issue as something which concerns not  only Yemen but also the Gulf region and the entire Arabian  Peninsula." He urged the Security Council and the international  community to "pass deterrent resolutions against the Sanaa  government," and he emphasized that "Democratic Yemen will on  its own resist the threat of the fundamentalist state in Sanaa  until the brothers and friends understand the situation." He  pointed out that "the Sanaa government is at present carrying  out imamite practices (reference to the imams reign) in the  villages."    He spoke of the "existence of Egyptian and Arab recognition  of Democratic Yemen and said that such recognition exists and is  implied."    He expressed "pessimism" about the Brahimi initiative's  chances of success. He said: "The composition of the northern  delegation and the reports from Aden about the other side's  movements and concentrations around Aden and its criticism of  the Gulf states all reflect the Sanaa government's determination  to escalate and not to comply with the cease-fire resolutions."  He added that "the northern delegation has no authorization to  order a cease-fire or consolidate a cease-fire. To them it is a  question of circumventing these efforts and continuing to try to  gain time in order to continue the war. The northern  delegation's level of representation reflected Sanaa's lack of  credibility as far as a positive response to UN resolution 924  was concerned. It also showed that they were playing games with  the fate and blood of the people, with no indication of a desire  to spare blood or respond to the appeals for an end to the war."  He added that "the composition of the delegation of Democratic  Yemen under the leadership of Deputy Prime Minister and Planning  Minister Muhsin Abu-Bakr Bin-Farid demonstrated our welcome and  positive response to the international efforts and Lakhdar  Brahimi's initiative."    Asked why were the Cairo meetings not held at Arab League  headquarters and under Arab League auspices, Salim Salih said:  "We are now working for the implementation of Security Council  Resolution 924, disengagement of forces, and the start of  negotiations. We welcomed Lakhdar Brahimi's initiative but the  other side refuses to comply with that resolution and is still  shelling Aden and sending military reinforcements from the north  to the battlefields in defiance of the Arab and international  will."    He accused the Security Council of "being slow" and added:  "Developments in terms of the fighting make it necessary for  the Security Council and the international community to act and  adopt deterrent resolutions against the aggressor party, which  continues to violate the cease-fire while the whole world looks  on without appropriate reaction." He said: "What matters to us  now is that immediate and practical measures should be taken to  deter the occupation forces and the invaders and prevent the  extermination of the citizens in the south."    He described the U.S. position as "balanced and interested  in  security and stability because it views what is taking place in  Yemen as something which concerns not only Yemen but also the  situation in the Gulf states and the entire Arabian Peninsula."  He said that the U.S. government's warning to the Sanaa  government regarding the shelling of Aden "reflects a political  position."    Asked if during his meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister  'Amr Musa the day before yesterday they discussed the question  of Egyptian and Arab recognition of Democratic Yemen, he  replied: "Egyptian and Arab recognition of Democratic Yemen  exists and is implicit." He stressed that "the world now  actually recognizes Democratic Yemen as an existing entity on  the grounds that there was no progress at the level of the unity  merger between the Yemeni Republic in the north and the DRY in  the south."    He added: "At any rate, recognition is not the urgent issue  now. What is required is a cease-fire and the preservation of  what is left of Yemen after the attacks on economic, vital, and  civilian establishments and the destruction of the country's  resources."    On the turn the war has taken and the fact that some  northern  leaderships see this war as a "holy and religious" war, he  affirmed that "the Arab brothers and friends should understand  the danger of the mentality, dream, and ambition of controlling  Yemen with a view to building a fundamentalist state." He  warned that "the danger of such a state would be a threat not  only to Yemen but also to all states in the Arab region." He  also said: "Democratic Yemen is not facing an internal  situation. There is a fundamentalist movement with clear trends  and affiliations with certain parties who interfere in our  affairs, especially Iran, Sudan, and Iraq." He added: "We had  warned against that danger and now we are resisting it alone.  The brothers and friends should understand that."</p>

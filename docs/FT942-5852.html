			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Chesterton sees 34% rise Chesterton International, the property consultancy, is predicting a 34 per cent increase to Pounds 5.1m in profits before tax for the year to end-June, helped by a strong increase in property activity in southern England. Chesterton issued its pathfinder prospectus yesterday for a flotation which will value the group at more than Pounds 50m and offer about 40 per cent of its enlarged share capital through a placing. About 25 per cent of the offer will comprise new shares, raising Pounds 5m for the group to lower debt and fund future expansion. Two thirds of the old shares being placed will come from former employees and 'near-term retirees'. The remainder, amounting to approximately Pounds 5m of shares, will be be sold by current employees, who will retain more than 50 per cent of the company's shares. At the current minimum issue price of 100p, the shares would be issued on a p/e of about 14. Chesterton, like most consultancy businesses, has few assets, and post flotation, shareholders funds will amount to some Pounds 10m. Employees are its key asset, and a costly one to maintain. Staff costs amounted to Pounds 25.8m in the year to June 1993, up from Pounds 21.7m. The company has already seen significant improvement in profit margins from its core consultancy businesses. Advisory fees accounted for 72 per cent of last year's revenue, and Chesterton intends to build up further its consultancy business to maintain a more consistent earnings base in a business renowned for volatility. The flotation is sponsored by Robert Fleming; pricing will be announced on June 15.</p>

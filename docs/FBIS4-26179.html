			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing  today stressed that the only way to solve the educational  problems in China is to continue with reforms.    Li made his remarks at the closing session of a national  education conference.    On behalf of the Communist Party Central Committee and the  State Council, Li called on the whole party and the people to  contribute to the flourishing of China's educational sector.    He said that General Secretary Jiang Zemin's important  speech  and Premier Li Peng's keynote report to the conference contain  the major strategy, policies and measures for the development of  China's education, which show the party Central Committee and  the State Council's determination to fight for and expectations  for the progress of education.    China, with a large population and as an economically  underdeveloped country, conducts the world's largest-scale  education program, the vice-premier said. Its investment in  education cannot meet actual demands. "That will be a long-term  contradiction," he said.    Li said that China must start from its actual conditions and  explore suitable ways to develop its education in a more  effective way.    The conference reaffirmed the objective that by the end of  this century, China should realize universal nine-year  compulsory education and elimination of illiteracy among the  young and middle-aged.    The vice-premier noted that the objective agrees with  China's  reality and he is confident at realizing the goal.    He said that the work set by the objective constitutes the  basis for improvement of the quality of the Chinese nation and  one of the foundations of socialist modernization.    He said that economic development in the 1990s will lay a  better foundation for the development of education.    At present, there are about 36 million illiterates among the  young and middle-aged population in China. In recent years,  about five million of illiterates have annually shaken off  illiteracy.    Li said that at this rate, it is possible that the  illiterate  population will disappear by the end of this century.    He noted that difficulties in popularizing nine-year  compulsory education lie in the rural areas, especially  poverty-stricken regions.    He called for efforts to cultivate qualified teachers and  run  normal schools well.    He stressed special aid for the education of ethnic minority  people.    Li also said that China must promote vocational and adult  education so as to provide opportunities for most young people  to receive technical and professional training and to improve  their cultural and professional capabilities.    On the reform of the system of higher education, Li said  that  the universities administered by ministries and central  departments should expand their services and increase majors.    He called on adopting diversified forms in the management of  universities, rational readjustment of the structure of the  universities and raising of economic and social results.    He also talked about ethnic education, increases in  education  funds and improvement of teachers' treatment.    Today's conference was presided over by Ding Guangen, member  of the party's Politburo.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Mustafa </F> Mashhur by Khalid Sayyid Ahmad; place and date not given]    [Text] [Ahmad] Is the Muslim Brotherhood a lawful group?    [Mashhur] The Muslim Brotherhood group has been in existence  and operating since 1928. A decision dissolving the group was  issued in 1948, but was revoked in 1951. In January 1954, a new  decision dissolving the group was issued and most of its members  were arrested. Later, we got out of prison and resumed our  activity, which was tantamount of a revocation of that decision.  Since then, no decision has been made to dissolve the group.  Now the government claims that the group has been dissolved,  and a lawsuit on the matter is still pending before an Egyptian  court. Despite all this, we are a lawful group that promotes  God's words by reason, not violence.    [Ahmad] How do you view the issue of violence and extremism?    [Mashhur] We do not believe in violence, because it distorts  Islam's image. We have emphasized this position several times.  Violence is a disease that can afflict a society. I can confirm  that none of the Muslim Brotherhood members have taken part in  any acts of violence. We did not even try to seek retaliation  or vengeance against those who practiced violence against us  while in detention. Although we reject the use of violence, we  must not hold the youth who use violence fully responsible. The  state shares in a major part of the responsibility. It has  permitted a group of communists to distort the image of Islam.  It also did not try to solve many of the economic and social  problems, not to mention the way it is handling the issue of  violence, which depends on the policy of physical liquidation.  All this forces the youngsters to use violence.    [Ahmad] Is the idea of mediation [between government and  Islamists] still on the table?    [Mashhur] We did not interfere in the issue of mediation and  we did not impose ourselves on the government, because it did  not ask us to. We are just trying to express our opinion in  this problem, because the matter requires more dialogue, an end  to repression, unleashing of freedoms, and the application of  ordinary laws so that this predicament could be overcome.    [Ahmad] What is your opinion on the issue of national  dialogue?    [Mashhur] The subject was raised eight months ago. Despite  this, the government excluded some political forces that are  active in the Egyptian society and relied on parties that have  no presence in the society. The matter needs dialogue,  understanding, and individuals freely elected by the people so  they can represent them and express their views and needs.    [Ahmad] Who will represent the Islamists at the national  dialogue table?    [Mashhur] The Muslim Brotherhood has been excluded so far,  but we could say that some writers who belong to the Islamic  current could represent the Islamists. As for the Labor Party,  it represents itself and does not represent the Muslim  Brotherhood. The same goes for the Muslim Brotherhood, which  cannot represent the Labor Party.    [Ahmad] Is reaching power one of your goals?    [Mashhur] We are always accused of attempting to reach for  power, but power does not interest us. All we want is the  application of the Islamic shari'ah, which comes from God. If  someone applies and rules under the Islamic shari'ah, we will  stand behind and support him.    [Ahmad] Do you believe in dialogue with the other side  [secularists]?    [Mashhur] There is no direct contacts or dialogue with them.  We say what we believe and they say what they believe. But many  of the National Progressive Unionist Grouping Party's members  abuse us, because the Islamic line bothers them. Despite this,  whenever there is a public issue that relates to freedoms in  Egypt and requires dialogue, there is no reason why such  dialogue cannot be held, because it serves the common good.</p>

Revenue rose 5% to  $1.9 billion. The firm said the results reflected a $6.5-million operating loss  for its trucking segment and an $8.4-million increase in interest and debt  expense "largely due to our emphasis on capital expansion and other investments  that will contribute to future profits."  </P></p>

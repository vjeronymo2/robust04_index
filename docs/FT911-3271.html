			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Hungarians pass law on compensation HUNGARY yesterday passed legislation compensating people whose property was confiscated by the communist regime. The compensation act will give about Ft100bn (Dollars 1.35bn) in bonds and land to the estimated 1.5m families who had property nationalised after June 1949. The decision was greeted with relief that the uncertainty over ownership had been reduced. But few are entirely satisfied by the act's unwieldy compromise between righting the past and encouraging new investment. Former owners and their direct descendants will have 90 days to make a claim. Then they can get up to Ft5m in financial restitution: bonds which can used to buy into privatisations. Parliament yesterday rejected giving former owners of shops and flats an automatic first option on their old property. But peasants will be able to physically take back land whether or not they intend to cultivate it, reflecting the conservative government's dependence on the Smallholder's Party for its parliamentary majority. The settlement is much narrower than that envisaged in recent Czechoslovak legislation. The cost of Hungarian compensation is a small part of total state property, which was worth Ft6,000bn in 1988.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Sport: Sobers swaps his bat for a club - Golf NO MATTER what sport he tries, Sir Garfield St Auburn Sobers always looks as though he is playing cricket. The golf course is no exception. If he were only wearing his cricketing whites, the illusion would be complete. He even plays golf sporting two gloves, batsman style. 'I just couldn't get used to the feeling of only wearing one,' he grins, wielding his golf club with the expertise and panache of a batsman. Sobers is a golf addict. He took up the sport 30 years ago when some Australian test rivals invited him to play. Now, at 56, he has finally abandoned cricket - a decision helped by a detached retina in his left eye which is still troubling him. 'I can see well enough to play golf for the rest of my life. I've done most of the things that I wanted to do. It would be nice to earn enough to retire completely and just play golf and travel.' He also grew fed up with having to produce match-saving feats to order. 'People always expected me to produce a brilliant innings or take a few wickets even when I was only playing once or twice a year. So I've decided to quit - I won't even play friendlies. I don't enjoy the game any more.' Sobers has had arthritis for years, too, but says: 'I don't feel the pain. I don't even notice that I walk with a limp except when I see myself on TV.' Although Sobers still haunts the Cricketers Pub which he opened at the Coconut Creek Hotel in Barbados, he now hits balls at his local golf course in Sandy Lane, where he has the unofficial freedom of the course. 'Golf is good for your cricket, but cricket doesn't help your golf,' he explains. 'Golf teaches you patience, which I need, because I'm no good at waiting for people in front of me - I get so cold and stiff that my golf suffers. It stops being so fluid if I have to wait. Golf makes you keep your head down and your upper body still both of which are good for cricket. If you don't keep your head down at cricket, you can sometimes get away with it; but if you do that playing golf, you normally hit a bad shot.' We take shelter during a heavy shower. When it abates, Sobers finds his young caddy - a novice called Jason Skinner - has allowed the club handles to get soaked while keeping the blades dry. Wrong way round. He berates the lad gently, then says: 'He's learning the hard way. So am I]' Because of the rain, golf carts are not allowed on the course. 'I don't like this rain,' Sobers says. 'I'm not playing through this, that's for sure]' When I told Sobers that as long as I hit one good drive every game, I was happy, he said: 'Don't be so negative. Don't just try for one good drive. Try for two or three - or four. 'When you start playing golf the most important thing is to hit the ball as naturally as you can - it doesn't matter where it goes as long as you hit it. Then, when you know with reasonable certainly that you're going to hit it, you can start worrying about where you're going to hit it. 'If you start out worrying about where you're going to hit it, you're never going to hit it well. That's the trouble with most beginners. People have been playing golf for years who still can't hit it straight. If they could every golfer would be a pro.' Easy to say, you might think, for a man virtually born with a cricket bat in his hands. 'People always say that,' says Sobers. 'It isn't like that at all really. 'I don't remember when I first picked up a cricket bat, but it was probably when my father showed me how to. I couldn't bat before I started batting, you know.' We are not far from the 4th tee - or is it the 10th? Sandy Lane is two nine-hole courses welded together. Golfers who just play nine holes do not simply play the first nine on the 18-hole course. Sobers explains: 'For example, you might say I only took five at the fourth and someone would say, but that's a par three. Well, the old four was but the new one - which is also the 10th - is a par four. Simple, really.' Simple as the mud on the bunker in front of the third green, which is full of rainwater. Plop - in goes Sobers' ball, with an answering plop from mine. Scooping the balls out to the damp sand nearby, both our sand wedge shots fail. 'We both made the same mistake then,' he says. 'We didn't follow through properly. Anyway, the course shouldn't really be open in weather like this.' He grabs a drink. 'I don't normally bother,' he adds. 'I'm like a camel.' Halfway round the course we meet Ehrlich Horst, a Kitzbuhel hotelier enjoying the proceeds of a good skiing winter by spending three weeks in Barbados. 'Kitzbuhel has a nice course' he volunteers. 'You mean it has mountains?' asks Sobers. 'That's not a nice course. That's a scenic course. A nice course is a flat course - at least, as far as I'm concerned without a golf cart]' In that case, Sobers is unlikely to be enthralled with a new nine-hole course which will soon be groomed from hundreds of acres of unwanted sugar cane on a hillside overlooking the present course. The new one has some wonderful views but, no doubt, Sobers will be less keen to walk up there unless he is guaranteed a ride. The sun is going down and the whistling frogs are beginning their dusk chorus. Sobers has a flight to catch. He is representing the Barbados Tourist Board in London, and then going on to play some golf. He cannot leave the game alone. He even writes about golf. 'Golf is the easiest game in the world - to get hooked on. I guarantee that if you play for a year - not every few weeks, but two or three times a week  -you'll be hooked. That's the kind of game golf is.'</p>

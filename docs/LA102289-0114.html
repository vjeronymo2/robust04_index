			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PARANOIA AND SOVIETS  </P> <P> I was so proud of San Diego and our mayor for organizing the Russian festival  of arts. To me it was an opportunity to experience the culture of the U.S.S.R.  and to get to know its people. A step toward the ending of the cold war and  madness of the arms race.  </P> <P> However, what I didn't realize, until the FBI warning, was that I have  information Russian tourists are after. Could it be that my daily activities  (shopping, cooking, cleaning and watching TV) make me a vessel for espionage?  Maybe it's the gardening, reading or the movies. The FBI warning is an example  of the paranoia that exists in this country about the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> It serves no useful purpose to sabotage all efforts toward achieving peace and  understanding.  </P> <P> MARGARET JULIANO  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

Lambeck report: "Rexrodt Becoming Target of FDP </F> Criticism"]    [Text] Bonn -- After the lost Lower Saxony elections,  criticism of Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt is increasing  within the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. The party's  leading circles complain that Rexrodt has not done enough to  improve the FDP's profile in his department. They say that the  words that FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel said after the election  defeat, "We simply have to get better," were directed at him.    The FDP management says: "Rexrodt should finally show that  he is not only a minister in the federal government, but also an  FDP politician." The economics minister was criticized by  Honorary Chairman Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Deputy Chairwoman  Irmgard Schwaetzer, and former Interior Minister Gerhart Rudolf  Baum. After all, the economy is a central issue in the 1994  super election year. Rexrodt has given in to the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU] in the back room of the coalition too  often. It has to become obvious that the FDP stands for more  jobs in the coalition. According to information available to  DIE WELT, Kinkel personally demanded: "We need a more  aggressive economic policy."    On the FDP's reliability as coalition partner, leadership  circles say: "We are not a party of people wanting to commit  political suicide." A shift of the Liberals is practically  impossible at this point. In Monday's [14 March] management  meeting, FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer said: "A coalition  decision is not a single decision, but a process."    What is striking in this context is the restraint shown by  North Rhine-Westphalian FDP chairman and Kinkel opponent Juergen  Moellemann. In the 23 May Federal Assembly, Moellemann wants to  vote for Social Democrat Johannes Rau. Moellemann does not want  to use the crushing defeat in the Lower Saxony elections against  Kinkel. The reason: At the Rostock party conference in June,  Moellemann wants to take the place of Carola von Braun, who  retired from the presidium.    The FDP is concerned about its weak position in the laender  organizations. The Liberals must be prevented from becoming a  mere federal party. They say: "The Liberals must not become a  woman without reproductive organs."</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London's robusta COFFEE market came under further pressure from hedge selling and profit taking after the recent climb to nine-month highs. There are signs of light origin sales beginning to emerge, with Uganda and Indonesia seen as possibly taking advantage of the recent rise in prices. New York arabicas were also lower at midday. Analysts said trade talk in Colombia that Marxist guerrillas had shot dead a partner in a leading coffee transportation firm had little impact on dealings. One trader said that rebel actions would have to be prolonged for exports to be strongly affected. BASE METAL prices continued to move higher on the LME, with ALUMINIUM particularly firm. Dealers said the overall trend reflected another technical reaction, with prices largely holding above downside support levels last week. Aluminium was again underpinned by nervousness over the possibility of stoppages at Pechiney and production cuts of around 100,000 tonnes. Compiled from Reuters</p>

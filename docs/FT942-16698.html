			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Canadian group to set up company in Sri Lanka Ondaatje Corp, a Canadian investment group with interests in Sri Lanka, has formed a new company which plans to list on the Colombo stock exchange and raise CDollars 66m (USDollars 47.8m) in equity, mostly from international institu-tions. The new company, to be known as Forbes Ceylon, will take over a number of businesses from Forbes &amp; Walker, a diversified Sri Lankan trading company which Ondaatje bought last October. Forbes &amp; Walker will retain its core tea, commodity and stock brokerage businesses. Forbes Ceylon aims to raise CDollars 50m from international investors, with the remainder of the equity issue to be underwritten in Sri Lanka. Forbes Ceylon's prospectus is expected to be cleared within about a month, but more time will be needed to comply with Sri Lankan regulatory requirements. All funds received will be held in escrow until Forbes Ceylon has been accepted for trading on the Colombo Stock Exchange.</p>

Future of  Economic Reform Is Very Hazy"]    [Text] The week of the president's absence on vacation has  seen the return to use in Russia of a word that is politically  not in the first flush of youth, a word well and truly worn with  futile overuse -- "accord." Boris Yeltsin put it into  circulation by organizing the formulation of the Memorandum on  Civil Accord.    But accord between and with whom? If it is accord between  Russian citizens (why else should it be called "civil" accord?),  the bulk of these citizens do not seem overly worried about  putting up barricades. There are no signs of any intense  emotion anywhere, no apparent upheaval -- which does credit to  not only the people's tremendous long-suffering but also their  common sense.    We are of course talking about accord among political  forces.  As predicted, the opposing parties and movements have their own  ideas of this accord and their own means of achieving it. While  a working group comprising representatives of the presidential  administration, the government, the Moscow Patriarchate, the  leadership of the State Duma, the Federation Council, and the  Constitutional Court is preparing a draft memorandum, opposition  leaders have already presented theirs. And they have founded  without lengthy disputes the "Accord for Russia" movement, which  observers have viewed as the opening of a second National  Salvation Front.    Rutskoy, Lukyanov, Prokhanov, Zyuganov, Zorkin, Chikin,  Tuleyev, Baburin, and Govorukhin (the declaration carries 14  signatures in all) are proposing a "social contract among all  patriotic forces and movements that deny violence, racism, and  nationalism."    This retaliatory "peace initiative" is reminiscent of a  counterclaim. The Communists and the patriots are prepared to  seek accord solely on their own political territory, as Gennadiy  Zyuganov said with party-minded bluntness at the 15 March  Communist Party of the Russian Federation Central Executive  Committee plenum: "During the voting in the Duma in favor of  the Memorandum of Accord the Communist faction also came up with  further conditions that are essential for national  reconciliation." Namely, a change in the socioeconomic course, a  socialist path of development, the restoration of the union  state, etc.    Opposition leaders are hardly giving way to illusions: No  accord other than accord between Prokhanov and Zyuganov, Rutskoy  and Lukyanov, Baburin and Govorukhin can be secured on these  terms. However, it is easy to ensure that the party economic  nomenklatura returns to power at local level on these terms, as  the provincial election campaign reminded us this week. The  idea of electing the president not by national ballot but by a  kind of new Zemskiy Sobor [ancient council of nobles] comprising  members of the Federation Council and representatives of the  territories can be developed on these terms -- an idea that has  been abandoned like a trial balloon. In these areas the  president's opponents have been extremely successful over the  last few days and have effectively encountered no resistance  from the president's supporters.    The four-day Duma discussion of the president's message also  provided a reminder of the agglomerations and obstacles in the  way of political accord. Finally, after two meetings, the  conciliation commission comprising members of various factions  and deputies' groups formulated a document which has won the  approval of a Duma majority. Deputies in the Federation Council  were meanwhile fighting an exhausting campaign for their powers,  saying that they alone had the right to dismiss the general  prosecutor and not the president -- and there were no signs of  accord with the latter here.    Last, there was also a street gathering of dissenters -- a  17  March rally on Moscow's Theater Square organized by the National  Salvation Front and the "Revival" and "Working Moscow" movements  to mark the third anniversary of the all-Union referendum on the  future of the USSR.    However, virtually everything that happened in the  parliamentary chambers, on the square, everywhere that saw  political rallies this week was accompanied by calls for civil  peace.    The political result of the past week must be deemed to be  the appreciable consolidation of antireform forces rejecting  broad civil accord or prepared to secure it only on their own  terms, which they know to be unacceptable to democratic parties  and movements. The latter's equally obvious passivity at this  time is enabling "Accord for Russia" to form an organization  that can pool its efforts in the fight for power.</p>

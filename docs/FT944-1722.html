			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / People (Names in the News): Musical chairs - Swiss style In Japan, the transfer of ageing bureaucrats to the private sector is so common that there is a term for it, amakudari, descent from heaven, writes Ian Rodger. In Switzerland, it is less frequent, but it is becoming fashionable among diplomats, for whom there is less call than in cold war days when the services of a trustworthy neutral country were in great demand. Last week, Erwin Schurtenberger, 55, the current ambassador to China, jumped to Ciba-Geigy as head of the pharmaceuticals and chemicals group's year-old Chinese subsidiary. Schurtenberger follows the example set by David de Pury, the country's former official responsible for world trade matters, who moved to ABB Asea Brown Boveri in 1991; he is now co-chairman. Bernhard Stettler, former counsellor at the Swiss mission to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, has become spokesman for Swiss Bank Corporation, and Philippe Levy, a former trade official with ambassador status, who ran the Basle International Fair for a few years until last December, has now become an adviser to the Geneva-based international inspection and product testing group, Societe Generale de Surveillance. Switzerland has no tradition of a reverse movement so eyebrows have been raised over the nomination of Ueli Sigg, 48, a former executive and member of one of the controlling families of the Schindler elevators group, as Schurtenberger's successor in Peking. But at least Sigg has undisputed qualifications for the job. In 1980, on behalf of Schindler, he negotiated the first ever joint venture in China for a western company. Old diplomatic hands are less amused by the appointment of Gret Haller, speaker of the lower house of the federal parliament, as ambassador to the council of Europe in Strasbourg. They call her derisively a 'quer einsteiger', someone who climbs aboard crosswise.</p>

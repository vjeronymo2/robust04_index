			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / How To Spend It: With pots of confidence - A set of pans that made him feel like a real cook AS A restaurateur, I used to watch every service in the kitchen with mixed emotions. I felt anxiety because I was the proprietor. Would the food reach the right tables, in the right sequence, to the right standard? Nowadays, I feel relief and gratitude at nothaving to earn my livelihood on my feet in front of hot stoves for eight hours a day. But just how do professional chefs cook well and always manage to have the right equipment on hand at the right time? It is possible to equip yourself with most of the accoutrements of a professional chef by visiting one of the shops in London's Soho which cater for the professional chef - for example Leon Jaeggi - or by taking advantage, as many restaurants do, of the mail order catalogue of A B E Nisbet in Bristol. Recently, though, my culinary skills were enhanced by a new range of cooking pans which fulfilled two essential roles. The first was to instil confidence: to give me, at least, the impression that I was cooking like a professional; and, second, to stack conveniently so that they did not take up valuable shelf space. The pans are part of a gourmet cookset called The Compatibles from Amway - there is also a matching set of cooking knives and cleavers - in two lots of 11 pieces. The basic set comprises four saucepans with capacities from 1 litre to 4 litres; an all-purpose skillet; and a double boiler. The accessory set adds, usefully, a 6-litre pan called a Dutch Oven; a 6-litre steamer; and an accessory rack for those still devoted to poached eggs. The pans are not sold individually; the basic set costs Pounds 439.95 and the accessory set Pounds 222.95. The complete set, of 22 pieces, is Pounds 595.95. The full set would make an excellent investment for any keen cook. Made from special, heavy-gauge steel (minimum 18 per cent chromium for hardness and 8 per cent nickel to resist corrosion), they look impressive and are easy to clean, inside and out. Most important, they transmit heat evenly and felt comfortable as soon as they were put on the stove - either gas or electricity. The set scored well on fine details, too. The lids fitted tightly and the handles never became too hot. The booklet that accompanies the set offers useful advice on how to put the set to its fullest use. I would add only that you should follow carefully the concise guidelines for cleaning the pans before using them - otherwise, their coating can be distinctly malodorous. These pans, and a whole range of other domestic appliances and personal care products, are distributed by Amway, a direct sales organisation with a worldwide turnover of Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.90bn).

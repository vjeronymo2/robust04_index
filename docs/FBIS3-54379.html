Prayers and peace be upon the noblest of  messengers.    Ladies and gentlemen: We are meeting here today at the  national consensus conference to continue the dialogue which we  started in September 1992. We are hoping that dialogue at this  conference will reach its desired goal; that is, the removal of  the country from the current crisis in order that normal life,  tranquillity, and peace may return to Algeria, which will then  be able to continue its development process in an atmosphere of  security. My Lord, make this land secure [Koranic verse].    I am sure that this is the expectation and the yearning of  all Algerians who are placing their hopes in our conference.  Hence, it is our duty to rise to our responsibility and deliver  what is required.    Ladies and gentlemen, the Higher State Council [HCE] has  shouldered its responsibilities during a very difficult stage.  [Words indistinct] it has to face up to a complicated and  critical situation which resulted from the poor management of  the transition to democracy brought about by the Constitution of  February 1989. This laid down a new political system for  building the state, for the management of the country, and for  the organization of the political society. This was in addition  to the roots of the crisis which led to the tragic October  events and the elements of which continued in existence. The  absence of control over the new political system led to the  haphazard application of the Constitution, which made the  situation more critical. The organization of the election  contest, whether at the local or the national level, showed the  fragility of the administration and the state structures,  leading us to chaos. The logic of the street overcame the logic  of the state and opened the way to all possible pitfalls. All  this led to the crisis of the establishments resulting from the  resignation of the head of state by the end of the term of  office of the People's National Council. This required the  setting up of the HCE with the aim of guaranteeing the  continuation of the state and completing the remaining  legislative term. The urgent and circumstantial conditions that  the HCE faced and the critical situation that existed then did  not make the HCE cut short its task by merely covering the  constitutional vacuum. It had to address the real problems of  the country, clarify views with the political, economic, and  social partners as well as the national cadres, search for ways  of liquidating the crisis at its roots, and prepare the  conditions for the creation of a qualitative transformation in  the country's march.    We found ourselves facing a political crisis which had  resulted from a lack of control over the transition process, the  strong and active presence of elements and practices of the  previous regime, as well as the ossified mentalities which fear  and reject change. We were also facing an economic crisis, the  main features of which were heavy debts, stagnant economic  growth, and inefficient enterprises in addition to smuggling and  speculation which are bidding to dominate the markets. We were  also facing an acute social crisis represented in the great  delay in any response to the needs of the population,  particularly in the spheres of employment and housing; this has  been a cause of concern to young people and has led to a loss of  confidence in the future.    While we were facing this multifaceted crisis, the tragic  assassination of the martyr Mohamed Boudiaf, may God bless his  soul, took place. He was one of the prominent leaders of the 1  November revolution who gave his life for the sake of our dear  homeland's advancement. [passage omitted]    With that tragedy there was an escalation of savage  terrorism, destructive to the country's material, human, and  moral resources and aimed at blocking the path to any real  effort to find effective solutions to the complex problems we  are facing. Terrorism has created a security situation that is  threatening the nation's unity and destiny.    This tragic situation did not discourage the HCE from going  ahead with dealing with the crisis at its roots. The HCE  initiated a wide and comprehensive dialogue with political  parties, popular organizations, associations, and national  figures. The option was neither circumstantial nor tactical; it  was a strategic option and a cautious attitude toward political  practice, running the government, and organizing social  relations.    We were aware from the outset that dialogue was the more  difficult path to take, but it was the right path to deal with  the roots of the crisis and prevent its repetition. Serious and  difficult dialogue requires patience and stamina, enabling us to  instill the concepts and culture of dialogue and overcome  violent methods in every field of social and political activity.    Dialogue was very difficult in an atmosphere of violence and  terror, which was destructive, and in a difficult security  situation. It required us to leave the concept of a single  party and monopoly behind and enter the era of pluralism which  dictates, by its very nature, the acceptance of conflicting and  contradicting ideas and proposals.    Despite the will and the determination of the HCE to make  the  national dialogue successful and allow it to attain its sought  after aims, however, some parties, with much regret, have taken  a negative attitude toward the dialogue; they have even  boycotted the conference. By such a stance, they are trying to  make the nation miss a golden opportunity. They have put their  narrow partisan calculations, even personal ones, before the  interests of the nation. Such a stance runs counter to the  concept of democracy we have been trying to implement.    In these decisive circumstances in the history of the  nation,  we place the responsibility before national public opinion,  which is aspiring to security and stability. Despite all of  this we continued the dialogue with insistence and methodology.  And here we are meeting today, thanks to that conduct, in a  national conference for reconciliation. This in itself is a  great acheivement we should cherish and take care of.    In the midst of the economic crisis and its pressing  elements, while the critical economic situation was imposing  itself forcefully and urgently, and after extensive studies and  wide consultations, the HCE had furnished the tools that enable  our economy to rise again on modern bases and criteria. It  passed the new investment law which is characterised by  flexibility, encouragement, and adequate guarantees for national  and foreign investment.    In response to economic and social partners, the HCE issued  a  law on the setting up of a national economic and social council  as an extensive and appropriate framework for consultations on  and dealing with various issues posed by national development  during a phase of transition to a new economic system, taking  into consideration the principle of social justice and the state  of the underprivileged groups in society. It made the  appropriate decisions regarding the management of debts with  international financial institutions and the provision of fresh  possibilities to stimulate the national economy. [passage  omitted]    In the international domain, and proceeding from this  promising starting point, we have taken part in all important  regional and international meetings. We have resisted the  attempts to isolate our country which were made by some parties  who exploited the temporary crisis through which the country is  passing.    The pressure of events and the impetuous reactions and  passions which they generate have not diverted the HCE from  exerting the efforts necessary to overcome the present  difficulties and from searching for a new proposal for running  the country on scientific, technological, rational, and modern  foundations.    The transition to this new proposal makes it necessary for  sincere patriots to face up to the basic challenges and all the  exertions, patience, courage, creative thought, and working  methods that they demand. We have been able to face up to the  situation by mobilizing the dynamic forces of the country and  sincere citizens.    On this occasion, we pay our respects to the martyrs of  violence and terrorism and we praise the Armed Forces, the  security services, the cadres, the workers, and the citizens who  are determined that the state will continue and that  institutions and the country's affairs will go on as normal.    Ladies and gentlemen: Regardless of what is being said about  the present situation and notwithstanding the difficulties  facing us, the current problems are more than just problems of  the power struggle; they are in reality problems of a society in  transformation, a society that greatly aspires to qualitative  changes and to a comprehensive development -- a society which  ought to reconsider itself in order to find the best means for  organizing its life and bring about progress and prosperity to  its members.    This shows that the crisis is not an easy one; it also shows  the enormity of the efforts which have to be exerted in order to  resolve it. However, such a solution will not be found through  a decree, through some improvised measures, or during a short  period, nor will it be within the power of a single group or  bloc; it should be carried out by the nation as a whole. It  will not be attained through a comprehensive and long-term  strategy.    It is, however, obvious that such a solution will,  inevitably, only take place once institutional problems have  been resolved through the holding of multiparty presidential and  legislative elections within the framework of the new political  framework which we have been trying to establish upon the  principles of republicanism. These principles which have  unanimously been agreed upon, and stipulate pluralism, freedom  of the press, individual and collective freedoms, human rights,  and the alternatn of the principle of power by holding general  elections.    The organizing of the election contest on these bases and  principles is the method which leads to the solving of the  institutional problem, and this is the target of the  transitional phase which has become acceptable by way of  dialogue as means for reaching a national consensus. In order  to succeed in this experiment and build the new political system  it is inevitable that we should confront the following  challenges:    1. Our capability to overcome the security challenge, as  without the liquidation of violence, the restoration of  security, and the country's stability, it is impossible to  realize democracy no matter what efforts we make, irrespective  of our intentions.    2. As for the building of a modern strong state, how can we  build the state and give it its status and at the same time  consolidate democracy? The state is a system and a collection  of behavior patterns and values. Also democracy, the building  of a democratic system cannot be done in a fragile state, nor  the building of a strong developed state without a democratic  system.    3. How can we build democracy and realize the development  project? There can be no development without democracy which  permits the full usage of the nation's energies and  capabilities. There can be no democracy in deteriorating  economic and social situations.    4. Our initiative in building a democratic system and a  developed generation deeply rooted in the nation, and  infiltrating the values and identity of our people, is a system  which will not be isolated from positive international  experiments. This means that we create the change which is  imposed by the transformation currently taking place at the  national and international levels, boycott the past methods and  practices, and at the same time maintain our foundations,  experience, and historic origin.    5. Define, establish and consolidate Algeria's position in  the new world order which is about to take shape amid the  ongoing stormy changes and ways of enabling it to assume its  normal role as an active and effective state at the  international level. This requires response to all the  challenges. It would be possible to build our own special and  creative experience through these challenges in the framework of  the development of modern human experiences. Success will not  be a gain only for Algerians; the same as the great 1 November  revolution, it will be a gain for all the peoples aspiring to  freedom. It is neither our right nor anyone else's right to be  the reason for depriving the Algerian people of achieving this  pioneering experience.    Ladies and gentlemen, the building of the political system  which we are endeavoring to construct and the overcoming of the  challenges we are facing constitute a basis for the evolving  national project [mashru'] to the building of which all  Algerians are contributing. The national project draws its  strength and its principles from the spirit of the evolving 1  November revolution.    It is certain that our success in moving to the new  political  system and in establishing a successful democracy in security,  prosperity, and stability is a fresh rebirth or a rebirth and a  renewal of the 1 November eternal revolution.    Ladies and gentlemen, all the difficulties not withstanding,  the Algerians are against adventurism and violence. They are  capable of conducting dialogue and living in security in the  shadow of national unity. They are committed to their faith and  tradition, and are open to the outside world. They are heading  with confidence towards the future.    Today at this conference we all have to rise to the level of  our historic responsibility and leave behind personal and  temporary accounts regardless of their justifications. We have  to work with a unified and profound will to get the country out  of the current situation and take it to the land of safety. All  of us bear full responsibility in that respect.    The conference is not the end of dialogue. The dialogue will  continue in all forms and with the spirit of honesty,  credibility, and responsibility. We have to firmly establish  the principles of dialogue, consultation, and solidarity and to  eliminate once and for all all manifestations of violence which  are alien to our society, religion, and homeland and sow the  seeds of hope. We have no right to deny the Algerians males and  females this hope.    May God guide us toward the good of our nation and the unity  and safety of our homeland and may peace and God's compassion  and blessings be upon you.</p>

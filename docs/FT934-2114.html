			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: BNP chairman warns of big first-half provisions Mr Michel Pebereau, chairman of Banque Nationale de Paris, the recently-privatised French banking group, yesterday warned the company may need to make heavy provisions in the first half of next year. BNP, like other French banks, has already been forced to make steep write-downs for 1993 because of the sluggish domestic economy. Mr Pebereau, speaking at a shareholders' meeting in Paris, said BNP was still under pressure. He forecast another round of high provisions for 1994, mainly due to the problems of its small corporate clients. 'The first half of 1994 will be another period of heavy provisions for small and medium-sized firms,' he warned. Mr Pebereau said it was too soon to estimate the level of provisions for the second half of next year. It was unlikely to be good news, he said. Mr Pebereau secured shareholders' consent at the meeting for the BNP board to take action against hostile takeovers. The board will be empowered to issue shares with or without voting rights, enabling it to stave off predators. The chairman said BNP 'wouldn't hesitate to use' its poison pill if necessary. BNP, which was privatised in October in a highly successful issue, had previously predicted a poor performance for 1993, with net profits of around FFr1bn (Dollars 172m), against FFr2.17bn in 1992. It has already reported a sharp slide in interim net profits to FFr522m in the first half from FFr1.33bn in the same period last year. Although the main problem facing BNP has been the financial strains on small French companies, it has also been affected by the precarious state of the property market, and by the need to raise provisions on its loans to developing countries. Mr Stephane Arrouays, banking analyst at BZW Securities, said he expected further problems from all three areas in 1994. He expected net profits of FFr2.2bn for the group in 1994, although he might slightly downgrade his forecast following Mr Pebereau's remarks. However, Mr Pebereau yesterday sought to quash concern about the fate of BNP's loans to Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group now trying to restructure its finances to avoid bankruptcy. BNP is one of the largest banks in the Euro Disney syndicates and, together with Banque Indosuez, heads the steering committee representing the banks in the restructuring talks. Mr Pebereau said he was 'convinced' that Walt Disney, its US parent company, had 'the capacity to find a solution'.</p>

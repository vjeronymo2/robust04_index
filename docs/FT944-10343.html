			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / S Korea to apply to OECD South Korea expects to apply to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development next month, the finance ministry said yesterday. An application would follow Seoul's acceptance - expected by the end of the month - as an observer on the OECD's financial market committee. Negotiations are planned to start in the second half of 1995, with a goal of membership approval by June 1996. However, they are expected to be contentious, since the OECD is demanding that plans for financial liberalisation be accelerated, while Korea argues that this would harm the economy. Seoul is planning to phase out state-supported industrial loans and deregulate interest rates, while opening financial markets gradually to foreign investors and cutting curbs on capital flows. North Korea yesterday gave a cool response to South Korea's recent move to resume economic co-operation. A commentary by Pyongyang's central news agency demanded that Seoul apologise for suspending economic ties over the nuclear dispute and repeal its national security law before co-operation could begin.</p>

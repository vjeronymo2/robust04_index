			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: COLD WAR'S END MAY OPEN DOORS FOR DEFENSE WORKERS  </P> <P> The U.S. Armed Services employ 2.1 million people in uniform and an additional  1 million civilians. In addition, more than 2 million people work for  aerospace-defense companies and thus stand to be affected by cuts in the  defense budget.  </P> <P> And there is a multiplier effect among the millions more who work for the  non-defense firms that supply those aerospace companies with everything from  paper clips to gasoline. Add them all up, and it's understandable that  communities in practically every state are apprehensive about cuts in the  defense budget, even as they hail the end of the Cold War and tell pollster  Louis Harris that they favor reduced military spending. Fear of unemployment  clouds even a hope as bright as peace.  </P> <P> The record is not reassuring: The end of World War I in November, 1918, led to  a severe economic downturn in 1920. The economy did better in the transition to  peace after World War II, but it had help from the buildup of peacetime defense  industry -- the advanced aircraft and high-tech weaponry programs that are now  faced with winding down.  </P> <P> So what's likely to happen to the economy this time? Things will be better than  communities fear today -- maybe far better. Two things to keep in mind are that  simple inertia will ease the economy's transition and that people don't stop  thinking just because defense money stops pumping -- hosts of skilled workers  in defense may find great opportunities in commercial projects.  </P> <P> First inertia. Cutbacks won't happen as swiftly as feared. "Politics won't  allow dramatic cuts to happen," says analyst Michael Lauer of Kidder, Peabody  &amp; Co., who notes that the New York congressional delegation's lobbying has  kept production of the Navy F-14D fighter plane going at Long Island's Grumman  Aircraft. Similar politicking will at least extend the transition from growing  to shrinking defense budgets.  </P> <P> Then, too, the amount of the $286-billion budget's ultimate shrinkage is a good  question. Reports are that $180 billion will be cut from defense budgets during  fiscal years 1992 to 1994 and that defense spending will be reduced from 6% of  the U.S. gross national product -- now $5.13 trillion -- to 4% by 1994. But by  that time the GNP will have grown to nearly $6 trillion -- which indicates an  annual defense budget roughly $40 billion less than today's.  </P> <P> Translation: There will be cuts in defense spending, but not enough to cause an  economic depression. In a nutshell, the defense industry is entering a long  period of no-growth. "It will just be a tougher business for aerospace-defense  companies," says analyst Wolfgang Demisch of UBS Securities. "They'll have to  keep their eye on the ball."  </P> <P> Some programs will be canceled: Analysts suggest the B-2 bomber will be a  sacrificial pawn in negotiations to get the Soviets to give up mobile missiles.  Some programs will be expanded: Surveillance satellites will continue to be  built, perhaps even more so in an era when disarmament agreements need  verification.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, expect some troops to come home from Europe and expect the armed  forces to be reduced by 500,000 or so -- but not to swell the ranks of the  unemployed. "Most military people are confident they'll find jobs," says a  military analyst. "They're trained people, who have proved themselves in the  military, and we have a labor-short economy."  </P> <P> Even more positive are the possibilities that await the thousands of engineers  working in defense firms. If their projects get canceled or their departments  are cut back, they could find a welcome in commercial industry, even the chance  to found their own business, with the aid of venture capital. "We're eager to  listen and talk to people in aerospace about ideas, or even better about  setting up a business," says Michael Moritz, a partner in Sequoia Capital, a  venture capital firm in Menlo Park.  </P> <P> Other venture capital firms, such as Sevin-Rosen Management in Dallas and New  York and Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers of San Francisco and Palo Alto,  hope to see a new breed of entrepreneurs come out of defense work -- although  they admit that the idea is new and unfamiliar. The conventional thinking is  that there is no connection between commercial industry and what one does in  defense work -- or as one analyst puts it, "You can't easily sell knowledge of  wing-based gun systems."  </P> <P> Perhaps not, concedes Sequoia Capital's Moritz, "but there's certainly a call  for advanced semiconductor skills and skills in telecommunications and  imaging."  </P> <P> "A lot of good optics work is done in the military -- space lasers, pop-up  computer displays -- while the commercial field is crying out for optical  engineers," says Floyd Kwamme, a partner in the Kleiner, Perkins firm. "I see  engineering talent from the defense field taking jobs in commercial start-up  firms and then perhaps founding their own company when the next product comes  along."  </P> <P> A heady vision. "It won't take many guys coming out of Rockwell or McDonnell or  the other dinosaurs to give their colleagues ideas," says a venture capital  type. The message: The economy's need for weapons may diminish but not its need  for brains.  </P></p>

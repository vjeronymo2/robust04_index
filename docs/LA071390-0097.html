			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DEAL, WILLIAMS, STEELY SET TRACK AND FIELD MARKS  </P> <P> A lack of marquee names didn't keep three U.S. Olympic Festival track and field  records from being broken Thursday, the first day of competition.  </P> <P> Lance Deal of Casper, Wyo., threw the hammer farther than any American this  year, while Schowanda Williams of Baton Rouge, La., set a festival record in  the 400-meter hurdles and Shelly Steely of Eugene, Ore., broke the 10,000-meter  record.  </P> <P> Skies around the Twin Cities cleared Thursday, allowing the baseball medal  games to be played one day late. Aaron Knieper of Saginaw, Mich., pitched 6 2/3  innings, had two hits and drove in four runs as the North beat the West, 7-4,  for the gold medal. The East beat the South, 7-3, for the bronze.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-2, 256-pound Deal threw the hammer 254 feet 9 inches, bettering the  festival record of 242-5 by Jud Logan of North Canton, Ohio, in 1985.  </P> <P> The previous best throw this year had been 254-4 by Ken Flax of the New York  Athletic Club.  </P> <P> Deal, 28, a member of the 1988 Olympic team, finished third in The Athletics  Congress championships this year after having won the title in 1989.  </P> <P> Williams arrived in Minneapolis at 1 p.m. CDT, about 3 1/2 hours before her  race. Even so, she finished in 55.57 seconds, breaking the record of 55.63 by  LaTanya Sheffield of El Cajon in 1987.  </P> <P> Steely lapped all but two runners on her way to a time of 32:41.14. The  festival record was 33:28.21, set last year by Colette Murphy of Indianapolis.  </P> <P> In men's gymnastics, UCLA junior Chainey Umphrey scored a 9.85 on the  horizontal bar -- his final event of the night -- to edge Bill Roth of Temple  for the all-around gold medal.  </P> <P> Umphrey won the gold with 57.50 points, beating Roth's 57.45. Mark Warburton of  Nebraska finished third with 56.80.  </P> <P> The festival's defending three-meter diving champion, Kent Ferguson of Boca  Raton, Fla., took the lead in Thursday night's preliminary round.  </P> <P> Ferguson had a score of 634.77 for his 11 dives. Pat Jeffery of Madison, N.J.,  who was third last year, finished second with 621.63, and Mark Bradshaw of  Columbus, Ohio., was third.  </P> <P> In the women's three-meter springboard, Krista Wilson of Laguna Hills, moved  past 1988 Olympian Wendy Lucero in the seventh round to win the preliminaries.  </P> <P> Wilson is one of the nation's hottest three-meter divers, coming off victories  in the U.S. championships and NCAA meet.  </P> <P> Lucero, the 1987 and 1989 festival champion from Aurora, Colo., led until the  seventh round, when she dove poorly on a back 2 1/2 somersault tuck. Wilson  responded with a solid effort on her most difficult dive -- a back 1 1/2  somersault, 2 1/2 twist free -- and took the lead. She finished with 463.59  points to Lucero's 453.90.  </P> <P> The top 12 divers advanced to Saturday's finals.  </P></p>

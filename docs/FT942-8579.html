			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oils pressured Oil shares met increasing pressure as the session wore on, hit by a further decline in crude oil prices, which stayed firmly below the Dollars 16 a barrel level, and following persistent selling pressure by US investors. The US selling was thought to have been triggered by a shift of stance on Chevron by Dean Witter Reynolds, one of the influential US broking houses. British Petroleum shares were badly affected by the US selling, sliding 8 to 394p amid heavy turnover of 14m. Shell Transport lost 5 1/2 at 736 1/2 p on relatively high volume of 7.6m. The Enterprise/Lasmo bid battle rumbled on, with the former easing 2 to 425p on minimal turnover ahead of this morning's annual meeting. Lasmo was unmoved at 153p. Hopes of good news from Argentina continued to drive Monument Oil &amp; Gas, which edged ahead  1/2 to 73 1/2 p. British Gas's move to sell its stake in Bow Valley had little effect on the share price, which softened 2 to 279 1/2 p, but pleased sector analysts, who expect the group to report first-quarter net income little changed at Pounds 650m this morning. Brewing, betting and hotel group Bass unveiled figures ahead of market expectations, but the shares were pulled back by profit-taking as well as by continuing concerns over the brewing operations. The stock fell 8 to 535p in turnover of 3.9m. There were good performances from the hotels division and the pub retailing side. NatWest Securities lifted its figures for the full year by Pounds 14m to Pounds 549m, while Kleinwort Benson increased its forecast by a similar number to Pounds 534m. Both houses have the stock as a hold. The weak brewing figures hit Whitbread, off 11 at 548p, although a switcher into Scottish &amp; Newcastle helped the shares recover slightly to finish a net 3 down at 550p. Guinness firmed 1 1/2 to 493 1/2 p ahead of today's annual meeting. Across the board demand for the UK clearing banks helped Barclays move up 6 to 543p and National Westminster firm 4 to 458p. Standard Chartered failed to maintain good early progress, which followed a profits upgrade by Cazenove, and settled 3 lighter at 258p, with the stock hit during the afternoon by selling carried out by Hoare Govett. Strong support for the Hong Kong stocks by NatWest Securities helped HSBC move ahead 11 to 732p. General Accident was the pick of the composites, the shares climbing 12 to 583p after a bear squeeze and strong support from Hoare Govett. Lombard Insurance made a satisfactory debut, with the stock holding rock steady at the placing price of 161p. There were no real surprises for the market in National Power's preliminary results, which came out at the very top end of market estimates. The 18 per cent increase in the dividend was well received by the market, where NatPower shares touched 442p before closing a net 2 firmer at 439p. Turnover was a hefty 7.5m, the highest single day's business in the stock this year. PowerGen rose 11 to 495p, while Scottish Hydro added 8 at 347p and Scottish Power 3 at 362p. In the 'recs', East Midland appreciated 18 to 582p and Southern 5 to 594p. Further acquisition talk buoyed Airtours shares, which added 15 1/2 at 490 1/2 p. The tour group, which recently bought a Scandinavian travel outfit, is said to be eyeing another European purchase. A gloomy trading statement from Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the discount food retailer, contributed to a general retreat across the sector. Nurdin shares finished 9 cheaper at 200p. Among stores stocks, Kingfisher's good run continued, underpinned by strong buy notes from UBS and Robert Fleming on Monday. Dealers said that Gerrard Vivian Gray had also been positive. The shares jumped 18 to 582p. Turnover in freight group NFC stood at 31m shares by the close and the stock was a penny firmer at 220p. An integrated broking division of one of the large UK clearing banks was believed to have attempted a placing of around 15m shares. The move was thought to have been only partially successful. News that USAir is delaying the delivery of 40 aircraft weakened sentiment in 25 per cent stakeholder British Airways, which retreated 6 to 379p in volume of 4.4m shares. British Aerospace receded 9 to 475p, with overseas investors said to have led the selling. The company announced for the second time this week that holdings by overseas investors had exceeded the 29.5 per cent level, the maximum allowed under its articles of association. Turnover in Lucas Industries rose to 11m and the shares shed a penny to 188p. The Seaq screen indicated that a single block of 9m shares was dealt at 190p.</p>

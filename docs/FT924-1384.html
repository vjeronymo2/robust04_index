			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Technology: Japanese in your stocking - Worth Watching THE perfect gift for the international business person who has everything could be the latest English-to-Japanese and Japanese-to-English translation system. On sale in Japan from December 2, the Duet Qt notebook computer from electronics group Sharp is no larger than an A4 file folder yet has a basic dictionary of 79,000 Japanese words and 70,000 English ones. The machine uses a translation algorithm known as the parallel sentence structure system, which analyses the structure of the sentence rather than just translating individual words. Translations performed on the machine, which runs under the Unix operating system, can be fed into most office computer systems for further editing. At Y3,280,000 (Pounds 17,354) for a basic model, however, the Duet is only likely to appear in the most exclusive of stockings. Sharp: Japan, 06 625 3007.</p>

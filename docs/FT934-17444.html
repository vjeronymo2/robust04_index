			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / LDP haggles over policy in unfamiliar opposition JAPAN'S Liberal Democratic party, which ruled for 38 years until this summer, spent its first national convention as an opposition party haggling over what policies should be opposed and angering its elders by proposing that a mandatory retirement age be introduced. The LDP has yet to come to terms with life in opposition, and the party's confidence has been eroded by fears that public prosecutors will soon arrest a few of its MPs for funding offences committed while in government. Prosecutors yesterday arrested a fourth executive at Shimizu, a leading contractor, for his role in the alleged bribery of a prefectural governor, who has been charged with accepting Y55m (Pounds 344,000) in bribes from another construction company, Hazama. During the convention, Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, an LDP faction head, was questioned by delegates over his links to a separate incident, the arrest this week of Mr Shuntaro Honma, governor of Miyagi, north of Tokyo, for allegedly accepting bribes from construction companies. Mr Mitsuzuka said he was surprised that Mr Honma allegedly collected Y20m from a construction company for a recent election, as his advice to the governor was 'wage a clean campaign'. He now believes the party 'should carry out a sweeping political reform'. But one of the reforms discussed at the convention was the abolition of factions, such as that presided over by Mr Mitsuzuka, which have traditionally been used to raise funds for candidates and ensure that there is an orderly queue for ministerial appointments. Mr Yohei Kono, the party's leader, said factions would be made redundant by the passage of political reform bills, though he is the member of a faction himself and owes his appointment to bloc voting by factions. The party could not agree on whether an age limit should be set for its candidates, and Mr Kono was uncertain whether he would punish senior MPs implicated in corruption scandals. He said the party must restore its scandal-tainted image, but then would not commit himself to a policy to expel members linked to scandals.</p>

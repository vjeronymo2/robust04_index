			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BABY BOOMERS' NEXT STEP' ELICITS MIXED RESPONSES  </P> <P> Linda Roach Monroe's article gives a good description of what women in their  40s have to look forward to.  </P> <P> I wish that Monroe had done more investigating into the hormone replacement  therapy available to menopausal women. The source of estrogen, which the  pharmaceutical community calls "natural," is pregnant mares' urine. While this  is fine for horses, it does very little for human females.  </P> <P> I am one of these unlucky women who was placed on replacement estrogen as a  result of a hysterectomy. This surgery, which turned out to be without basis,  has ruined my life forever. My gynecologist did not tell me that some women  cannot tolerate hormone replacement therapy. In any dosage, I experience  hypertension, edema, nausea, rapid heartbeat and lethargy. I never had these  symptoms before.  </P> <P> In the Monroe article, it states that, "Fortunately, estrogen replacement  therapy can relieve many problems associated with these forms of early  menopause. . . ." I'm afraid that this does not apply to post-hysterectomy  patients.  </P> <P> JENNIFER C. COCHRAN  </P> <P> Newberry Park  </P></p>

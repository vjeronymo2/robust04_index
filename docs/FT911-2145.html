			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Mellor believes recovery is near - Finance Bill A FURTHER claim that Britain was emerging from the economic recession was made by Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, in the Commons last night. He interpreted findings of a CBI survey published earlier in the day as a clear signal of a 'recovery of confidence'. Mr Mellor accused Labour MPs of 'talking the economy down' when they cast doubt on the assertion by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in Washington on Monday that recovery was 'round the corner'. MPs gave a second reading to the Finance Bill - giving effect to the March Budget - by a majority of 101 (310-209). Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's shadow chief secretary, acknowledged that the CBI survey showed that some businesses were 'not quite so pessimistic' as they had been in January. She argued that the desperate attempts by ministers to obscure their responsibility for the recession 'fuels the optimism to which they lay claim'. Mr Mellor forecast that the recovery of confidence would lead to an increase in economic activity. He was adamant that the British economy was far better equipped to get out of the current recession than it was from the recession in the early 1980s. The government's optimism was also challenged by Mr Pat Duffy (Lab Sheffield Attercliffe) who said a survey showed that there had not been a recovery of confidence among manufacturing employers in South Yorkshire. expressed by Mr David Winnick (Lab Walsall North) who said the West Midlands was going through a repeat of the 1980s recession. Undeterred, Mr Mellor suggested that part of the problem faced by the manufacturing sector was that 'perception lagged behind reality'. He received support from Mr Roger King (C Northfield) who stressed that in terms of exports the British motor car industry was 'doing better than ever before'. Mr Mellor praised the export achievements of the car industry which, he said, reflected the transformation which had taken place in the British economy in the 1980s. Mrs Beckett maintained that the government discounted 'alarming evidence' about the depth of the recession in order to promote its claims that recovery was at hand. She said there was a danger that when the recovery did take place it would prove to be 'shallow and short lived' as the balance of payments constraints re-emerged. Mr Ian Taylor (C Esher) criticised the high street banks for imposing a 'higher than necessary' premium when setting interest rates on loans to their smaller corporate clients. He referred to reports that some banks were charging more than 2 to 2 1/2 percentage points above base rates. Mr Taylor also expressed concern that the Lloyds insurance market might be 'at the beginning of a crisis' and urged the Government to consider permitting 'names' to claim tax relief on current year cash calls. A warning that the bloodstock industry would be 'greatly disadvantaged' by the new VAT regime due to come into operation in 1993 was given by Mr William Powell (C Corby). He urged Treasury minister Mrs Gillian Shephard, who is to meet industry representatives next week, to try to remedy the situation. Mr Francis Maude, financial secretary to the Treasury, defended the new impost on mobile telephones, insisting that 'a straight forward and modest scale charge' would reduce the burden on small businesses. Mr Mellor rejected protests from Conservative backbenchers that the Bill subjected building societies to double taxation. He insisted that if clause 50 were to be deleted, a number of building societies would make 'windfall profits' from Pounds 250m tax paid on money from depositors.</p>

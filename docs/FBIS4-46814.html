			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kestutis Jauniskis: "Two Opposition Parties Do </F> Not Want the Present Government To Be Swept Away by Force"]    [Text] On May 2, the Nationalist Association and the  Democratic Party registered an initiative group, which began to  collect signatures for a referendum on the scheduling of  elections to the Seimas ahead of schedule. The initiative group  adopted an "Appeal to the Nation," which states that during the  Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party's (LDDP) one and a half years  in power, production has experienced a catastrophic decline and  privatization has satisfied only the interests of the former  nomenklatura and of the criminal structures.    The document also says that "the hopes for a spiritual  rebirth of the nation are being frustrated, the society is  drowning in alcohol, morals are declining, science, culture and  education are being ignored." In the opinion of the authors of  the appeal, "the only way to stop the disastrous LDDP rule is by  holding the elections to the Seimas ahead of schedule. Such  elections would establish a new relationship of political forces  in the Lithuanian government and would invite conscientious,  competent and determined representatives of the nation to the  rudder of state."    At a press conference that was held in the Seimas palace  yesterday, the chairman of the Nationalist Association, R.  Smetona, said that the other parties of the opposition are also  talking about the harm caused by the LDDP administration, but  until now nobody had decided to start a signature gathering  action.    In R. Smetona's opinion, it was possible to start collecting  signatures on premature elections to the Seimas together with  the action to collect signatures on the compensation of the  people for their deposits, which was initiated by the Fatherland  Association. According to the leader of the Nationalist  Association, premature elections to the Seimas could take place  simultaneously with the elections to the local administrative  organs -- in February-March 1995.    One of the participants at the press conference, the deputy  chairman of the Democratic Party and member of Seimas, J.  Tartilas, said that one hears representatives of the other  opposition parties expressing their views that the Nationalist  Association and the Democratic Party would allegedly lose the  referendum, but, in his opinion, "when you are trying to save a  drowning person, you cannot be guided by cheap considerations."    When asked by LIETUVOS RYTAS to comment on the position of  the Christian Democratic Party and of the Fatherland Association  on the early elections (the KDP leaders having stated that they  would not launch any action to collect signatures on the  introduction of a referendum concerning the premature elections  to the Seimas; and the Fatherland Association having made no  such statement, but also making no plans so far to gather  signatures), J. Tartilas said that "some imagine that one can be  merely an observer, others are trying to latch on to something,  are preparing programs." "However, I don't think that the cold  status of an observer for the United Nations Organization is the  best solution in this case," asserted the deputy chairman of the  Democratic Party, J. Tartilas.    R. Smetona said he did not think that one should comment on  the principles of the other opposition parties. He expressed his  conviction that the active part of the society would actively  join in the signature collection action.    Speaking about the results of the sociological polls, the  leader of the Nationalist Association said that they did not  predispose one for passivity or doing nothing. "The greatest  crime and stupidity in this case is to do nothing, and such a  position is absolutely unacceptable to us. The saying that 'we  should wait until the idea of the early elections will ripen in  the nation's depths and then we, politicians, will do  something,' seems to lack seriousness for us. What will be the  indication that the society has sufficiently matured already? We  don't want this government to be swept away by force," R.  Smetona said.    In J. Tartilas' opinion, the structure of the electorate has  not changed: 40 percent have supported the rightist opposition,  and the same percentage --the LDDP. The outcome of the election  was decided by the remaining 20 percent. We are hopeful that  those 20 percent -- they are mostly from the rural areas, and I  would call them soviet kolkhoz serfs, have regained some of  their eyesight and have started thinking.    A reminder: a proposal on early elections to the Seimas by  26  members of the Seimas representing the parliamentary opposition  of the right was registered at the Seimas secretariat on April  15 (meanwhile, there are 6 members of the Seimas in the  Democratic Party and the Fatherland Association factions). But  so far nobody has suggested that this proposal be put on the  agenda of the Seimas sessions.    When asked to comment on this new initiative of the  Democratic Party and the Nationalist Association, the chairman  of the LDDP faction at the Seimas, Justinas Karosas, said that  these parties are thus trying to draw attention to themselves,  but that will help neither the state nor themselves. "I don't  see what's so bad to require an early election," Justinas  Karosas said.</p>

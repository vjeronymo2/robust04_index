			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / VW chief may sue over 'concealed' losses at Seat Mr Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, has threatened possible legal action against former managers of Seat, VW's Spanish subsidiary, for allegedly concealing immense losses that drove the whole group into a DM2.3bn (Pounds 890m) deficit last year. A meeting on June 23 of Seat's supervisory board, which includes VW executives, was told the subsidiary would make a DM150m loss, Mr Piech said in an interview with El Pas, the Spanish daily newspaper, yesterday. Since then, group auditors had discovered that Seat's management had been presented one day earlier with a report from Mr Eberhardt Muller, then finance director, warning that the company was technically bankrupt because its 1993 losses would exceed its capital of Pta80bn, about DM1bn. Mr Piech indirectly accused Mr Juan Antonio Daz Alvarez, former Seat chairman, of concealing the truth: 'Personally, and this has to be proven, I believe at least three people on the management board of Seat must have known about the report.' Mr Daz was dismissed last September. Since then, VW has confirmed Seat lost DM1.4bn in 1993. Restructuring costs, including closure of a Barcelona factory, are estimated at a further DM800m. From a German point of view, the DM150m loss estimate issued on June 23 was deliberate misinformation. For Mr Piech, that was 'an action that could have penal consequences'. VW said independent auditors had been appointed to investigate, and that decisions on possible consequences, including legal action, would have to wait until they had reported. Mr Piech, whose career so far as VW chairman has been blighted by the criminal investigation of his new production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and the Seat crisis, also forecast further losses in the first quarter of the current year. But he told a German newspaper the deficit would be a fraction of the DM1.25m loss booked in the same period of 1993, and that the group would return to profit by the year's end. Seat was the only subsidiary expected to remain in loss, with a deficit of DM200m, he said. The group's forecasts of a return to health are based partly on the planned introduction of shorter working time at its six German factories. VW has claimed the so-called 'four-day week' scheme would save it DM1.8bn a year in labour costs. However, details of the controversial plan are yet to be agreed with social security officials and trade unions. US carmakers see off foreign competitors, Page 3</p>

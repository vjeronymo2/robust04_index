			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: BASSETT;  </P> <P> SCHOOL BUS ROUTES RESTORED  </P> <P> Responding to parental protests, the Bassett Unified School District will  reinstate several school bus routes it eliminated last summer to cut costs.  </P> <P> The board said it will spend an additional $150,000 per year to lease or buy  two more buses. In June, the district consolidated bus stops and eliminated  several routes to trim its $450,000 transportation budget.  </P> <P> Parents complained that the action endangered their children by forcing them to  walk along busy streets and through unsafe neighborhoods. School officials said  they did not eliminate any bus lines where students would have been forced to  walk across major streets or railway tracks.  </P> <P> About 5,100 students attend the Bassett Unified School District, which serves  western La Puente and Valinda. The district has an annual budget of about $20  million.  </P></p>

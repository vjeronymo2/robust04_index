			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / World Trade News: US acts on China 'piracy' The US yesterday said it would take new action against China in protest at 'rampant' piracy of computer software, compact discs and books, in a move that could lead to the imposition of economic sanctions on Chinese exports to the US. Mr Mickey Kantor, trade representative, said he was formally designating China as a 'priority foreign country' under the 'special 301' clause of US trade law. This designation launches an investigation that could last six months and bring retaliatory duties on around Dollars 800m (Pounds 526m) a year of Chinese exports - the amount of damage the US estimates is being done to US companies by Chinese copyright and trademark breaches. Even before the announcement China had reacted angrily to the move. The Foreign Ministry said Beijing had 'done its utmost' to protect intellectual property rights, and called the US measures 'irrational and unacceptable'. The rift appears likely to remain confined to the trade area. President Bill Clinton said in May, when he decided to renew China's most favoured nation trading privileges, that he was 'delinking' trade from human rights issues. Nevertheless, the intellectual property dispute could bedevil talks under way in Geneva on China's accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which includes rules on intellectual property protection. 'We will staunchly support China's accession when they meet the standard,' Mr Kantor said. Mr Kantor said China had greatly improved intellectual property laws and regulations since it signed a memorandum of understanding with the US 2 1/2 years ago, but enforcement of the rules was 'sporadic at best and virtually non-existent for copyrighted works'. 'Piracy is rampant in the audio-visual, computer software and publishing sectors, as well as in trademarks,' he said. US officials say there are 26 compact and laser disc factories in central and southern China with a capacity to produce 75m CDs a year. China's domestic market is only around 5m CDs a year. During recent negotiations in China, US delegates were told by their Chinese counterparts that piracy of computer software had been stopped, but immediately went out and bought in a local store illicit copies of Microsoft operating software and Wordperfect word-processing software with government approval stamps. In a related step Mr Kantor moved India from the list of priority foreign countries to the less urgent 'priority watch list'. Argentina was also kept on the priority watch list rather than raised to full priority status, because it had moved to enact new patent legislation.</p>

[passage omitted]    [Rabin] Syria could influence Hizballah and prevent it from  continuing its activities. Syria does not control Hizballah; it  is commanded by Iran and Lebanon. Nevertheless, Syria could use  its influence to curb its activities. Syria could give its  backing to the Lebanese Government by allowing it to deploy more  troops in south Lebanon, as it wanted to do after Operation  Accountability, thereby creating the conditions for tranquility  with a view to reaching a peace treaty with Lebanon, which  entails certain arrangements concerning security and some  guarantees concerning the Lebanese who have been operating  alongside us. Syria has not done that, and I am afraid that in  this respect, it has not shown by word or deed what we would  expect of it if the idea is to establish confidence-building  measures with a view to continuing the peace talks with us.</p>

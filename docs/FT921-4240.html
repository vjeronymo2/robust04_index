			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The UK Budget: Doubts cast on interest rate cut as sterling loses value THE LONDON financial markets accorded the Budget speech a somewhat cautious response which was reflected in a downturn in government bonds as early gains in sterling were trimmed sharply during the progress of Mr Lamont's speech in the House of Commons. Sterling's reaction appeared to cast serious doubts over the prospects for the pre-election base rate cut on which the financial markets have been counting. A government official said: 'It would not be wise to hold out much hope of a cut in the next few days'. Several analysts pointed out that it could now prove very difficult to cut rates ahead of the announcement of the election date which is expected before the end of the week. In addition, market strategists expressed doubts on the political impact of the budget which had been widely regarded as a curtain raiser to the Conservative government's campaign for re-election. 'This is not a budget for voters,' commented Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull. The stock market held on to gains which had been largely achieved early in the session and the FT-SE Index closed 24.1 points up at 2,574.8. But traders sounded increasingly nervous after equity trading closed, and a fall in the March future contract on the FT-SE Index appeared to be signalling a weak opening today. The currency markets were generally unimpressed by the Budget, and saw it doing little to strengthen sterling in the short term. Sterling immediately fell around  1/2 pfennig to wipe out most of its earlier gains. Dealers said this was because of the lack of a firm commitment to move the currency into the narrow band of the ERM, and Mr Lamont's forecast of a Pounds 28bn PSBR - towards the upper end of expectations. 'The Budget was not a clear-cut vote winner and in the meantime it merely prolongs the uncertainty in the markets,' said Mr Nick Parsons, treasury adviser at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. 'The commitment to the narrow ERM band was vague, and the chancellor also seemed to be backtracking slightly on his commitment to a single European currency, and this was not welcomed by the market.' Mr Michael Feeny, senior dealer at Sumitomo Bank, said however that while the Budget was 'not tremendously dramatic', it could add a few per cent to Conservative support in the opinion polls.

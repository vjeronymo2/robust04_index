			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Amsterdam ready to plan curbs on cars AMSTERDAM'S city council voted last night by a large majority to begin drawing up a plan to reduce car traffic gradually in the city centre, bowing to pressure generated by a controversial referendum held last month. The 45-member council approved a motion calling for action that will go some way towards satisfying voters who, by a slim majority, supported a radical cut in the volume of traffic. Opponents of deep cuts had argued against heeding the results of the non-binding referendum, saying the low voter turnout of just 27 per cent had nullified the results, which showed 52.9 per cent in favour of a drastic curtailment. The traffic proposals, to be drawn up over the next few months, are likely to fall well short of the referendum's call for a halving of the 23,000 available parking spaces in the long term and introduction of a system of regulating car access to the congested centre. Proposals are expected to include the introduction of 'ride-sharing' taxis, the allocation of sites for new parking garages, and a greater emphasis on bicycle paths and pedestrian zones, as well as reductions in parking spaces. Mr Roel van Duijn, a member of the 'Green Amsterdam' environmentalist party and a prime force behind the the referendum, called for further measures, including 'banning cars from streets wherever there are primary schools so children can play outside'.</p>

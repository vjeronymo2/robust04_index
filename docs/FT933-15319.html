			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / City institutions defiant over IRA letter OVERSEAS financial institu-tions in the City of London reacted defiantly to yesterday's warning from the IRA of more bombing campaigns in spite of the creation of the new security zone designed to deter such attacks. In a letter sent by the IRA to some foreign-owned financial institutions in the City and published in Republican News, the IRA leadership says: 'No one should be misled into under-estimating the seriousness of the IRA's intention to mount future planned attacks in the political and financial heart of the British state.' Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank, which confirmed that a copy of the letter was sent to its Bishopsgate offices, which were devastated by a terrorist bomb earlier this year, said: 'Our record shows we will not be influenced by this sort of propaganda. We've been in Lebanon since 1982 - something like this will not make us move out of London.' Mr Paul Hofer, regional head of Credit Suisse's northern Europe operations, said: 'We have total trust in the UK authorities. We were back one day after the last bomb.' Deutsche Bank yesterday confirmed it had received a letter but declined to comment. City of London Police, which confirmed that a number of overseas banks had received the letters, urged institutions to hand them over for forensic examination. Police experts are now studying the copies of the letter sent to Deutsche Bank and Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank. The Foreign Banks and Securities Houses Association said its members were putting more emphasis on security and welcomed tougher anti-terrorist measures such as the road checkpoints. Mr Ian Mckay, secretary of the association, which represents 150 overseas institutions, added: 'Our members will not be swayed by this attempt to destabilise London.' However, concern at the threat of a City bombing campaign yesterday prompted a Scandinavian securities house, which asked not to be named, to draw up contingency plans to leave the Square Mile. A senior official at the institution said it planned to install dealing room facilities in a building outside the City. The IRA's letter says: 'In the context of present political realities, further attacks on the City of London and elsewhere are inevitable. This we feel we are bound to convey to you directly, to allow you to make fully informed decisions.' No copies of the letter are thought to have been sent to US-owned institutions as the IRA is anxious not to alienate any republican sympathy in North America.</p>

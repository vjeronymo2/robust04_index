			<p>BFN     [Text] The participation of the family and the school in  attending to today's social problems and to the education of  young people needs to be more profound, and more systematic  action needs to be taken, said Politburo member Maria de los  Angeles Garcia at the eighth plenum of the National Social  Prevention and Attention Commission. The participants at this  meeting said that now is the time to confront, rather than  discuss, problems and to take cooperative action to solve them.    The newspaper GRANMA's report on this matter adds that the  meeting also assessed the work of its institutions in 1993;  employment of leisure time; and, especially, social phenomena  associated with tourism, and the family and social complacency  that sometimes accompanies the manifestations of such phenomena.  The plenum also analyzed elderly care. It is studying a  specialized program at the polyclinics that aims to benefit the  elderly.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / The Lex Column: French equities The 3.5 per cent fall in French equities this week - despite two interest rate cuts - was more than a display of Gallic indifference. The last day of the trading account contributed to yesterday's slide, so the new account may begin on a firmer note on Monday. But the downbeat tone this month suggests wider disillusionment. International funds in particular bought French equities earlier this year, expecting at least modest economic growth. Despite the easing of interest rates, that now looks optimistic. An outflow of foreign money would not matter if some of the FFr1,100bn savings invested in money market funds at home shifted into shares. A similar flow of retail money supported Wall Street through periods of economic doubt. But with real interest rates in France still over 6 per cent, the avalanche of retail cash looks some way off, especially since the Bundesbank's cut this week confirmed the slow pace of German rate reductions. The market may be entering an uncomfortable period of poor company results, worsening growth prospects and no obvious constituency of buyers. The government's enthusiasm for reducing the budget deficit is a wild card. Although flotations of state-owned companies could be a drag on the equity market, privatisation might also include tax incentives for equity investors. If the government is serious about fiscal discipline, though, Mr Balladur's threat of higher taxes this week must also be taken seriously. With economic confidence so fragile, such measures will do equities no good at all.</p>

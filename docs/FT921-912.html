			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Observer: Futuristic The New York Commodity Exchange, with a reputation more for slumped volumes than for innovation, has elected a woman as its new chairman, the first to head a US futures market. Donna Redel, no back-office type, apparently more than holds her own in the rough and tumble of the pits - earning a rebuke from the exchange some years ago for duffing up a man trader who shoved her the wrong way. She also has connections. Executive vice-president of family firm Redel Trading, she is the daughter of Comex ex-chairman Irving Redel. Her affinities are more akin to the large brokerage houses, and she won yesterday against Sidney Rothberg who reflects the interests of the independent traders. She will be hard put to win new business for the fading exchange. Its volume as the main US metals-trading market has been falling. Nor has Comex been able to develop new attractive products. Plenty of politicking is assured with yet another attempt at rapprochement between rival exchanges. Four out of five New York futures markets plan a costly move to a new trading floor and pos-sible merger. For her efforts, she will be Comex's first paid chairman at Dollars 125,000 a year.</p>

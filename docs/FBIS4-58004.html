			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alfredo Villareal; from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] Jose Maria Monterrey, director of the National  Civilian Police [PNC], reported that a special PNC brigade  protects FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]  leaders to prevent any attack on their personal safety. He also  disclosed that he may possibly retire at the end of this month.    The various threats to well-known FMLN political leaders,  including attacks in certain cases, such as the Nidia Diaz case,  has forced the PNC to give 24-hour protection. A special police  squad has been trained to protect FMLN personalities, Jose Maria  Monterrey stated.    [Begin recording] [Monterrey] We give the so-called top FMLN  leadership security protection with approximately 400 of our  people who work in our personality protection division.    [Villareal] How is the investigation advancing into the  death  of this young bodyguard of a FMLN leader? Where is it headed?    [Monterrey] The investigation continues; I believe we will  soon have results. I cannot say yet because the investigation  is still incomplete. [end recording]    The police chief added that he has tendered an open  resignation to the new government that will be sworn-in on 1  July.    [Begin recording] [Monterrey] If the president-elect wants  to, my post will go to someone else.    [Villareal] Would you be willing to remain in the post?    [Monterrey] Yes, if the president requested me to.    [Villareal] But what about you, personally?    [Monterrey] I have already made an effort for nearly two  years, with only one year to go, and would like to make this  contribution with all the personnel who began this job. [end  recording]    Jose Maria Monterrey, who made his resignation available  from  May, met this morning with judges and coroners representatives,  in order to coordinate protection of these officials when they  appear on death scenes at night in risky areas.</p>

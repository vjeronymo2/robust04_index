			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOBALL '89;  </P> <P> COACHES, PLAYERS, TEAMS AND TRENDS TO WATCH;  </P> <P> ON THE LINE;  </P> <P> MICHIGAN SEEKS FIRST TITLE FOR BIG TEN SINCE '68  </P> <P> Bo is back and in a big way.  </P> <P> Not Bo Jackson, the super athlete, but Bo Schembechler, the coach.  </P> <P> Schembechler's 224 victories are the most among active Division 1-A football  coaches. But his image has suffered because of Michigan's miserable bowl  record.  </P> <P> Until Michigan beat USC, 22-14, last January in the Rose Bowl,  Schembechler-coached teams had won only four of 15 bowl games.  </P> <P> National championships are often won, or higher rankings attained, in the major  bowl games, and Bo's boys usually haven't been up to the task.  </P> <P> Moreover, Big Ten Conference teams haven't finished No. 1 in the final  Associated Press or United Press International rankings since Ohio State was  acclaimed by both polls in 1968.  </P> <P> Michigan came close, though, in 1988, losing to eventual champion Notre Dame  and No. 2 Miami by a total of only three points. The Wolverines were fourth  ranked in the final polls.  </P> <P> "That wasn't even supposed to be their year," said Iowa Coach Hayden Fry of  Michigan's 9-2-1 record. "This was supposed to be their year. But at the end of  last season they were the best team in the country."  </P> <P> This season, Schembechler's team is ranked No. 1 by Associated Press.  </P> <P> The crusty coach, who is also the school's athletic director, says jokingly  that there is internal pressure on him because Michigan won the National  Collegiate Athletic Assn. basketball championship last season.  </P> <P> "In one year I turned this into a basketball school," Schembechler said. "This  is a difficult year for the football coach at a school predominately known for  basketball, but we will try to live up to our basketball team."  </P> <P> Although Schembechler has never won a national championship, he says it's not  his primary goal.  </P> <P> "We're not like Notre Dame or Penn State that have nothing to play for except  the national championship," he said. "Our goal is the Big Ten championship. If  there are any Big Ten teams that shoot for a national championship, they're  damn fools."  </P> <P> Schembechler might redefine his goals, however, if Michigan beats Notre Dame  and UCLA on successive Saturdays in September.  </P> <P> National championships aren't necessarily won in September, but they can be  lost.  </P> <P> Schembechler's reasoning that independent teams are more focused on the  national championship than teams with conference commitments has some merit.  </P> <P> Five of the last seven national champions have come from the independent ranks,  with Miami and Penn State each winning two titles.  </P> <P> Even with a new coach, Dennis Erickson, and a new quarterback, Craig Erickson  (no relation), the Hurricanes are a factor again.  </P> <P> So are Notre Dame, Nebraska, Louisiana State, USC, UCLA, Florida State, and  Auburn, according to preseason magazines and polls.  </P> <P> The Irish will be trying to become the first school to win consecutive national  championships since AP ranked Alabama No. 1 in 1978 and 1979.  </P> <P> However, Coach Lou Holtz will have to cope with the loss of two key players  because of disciplinary action, and another who transferred to UCLA.  </P> <P> The university's Office of Student Affairs, which operates independently of the  athletic department, has suspended All-American linebacker Michael Stonebreaker  for his senior year and refused to allow running back Tony Brooks to re-enter  school.  </P> <P> The dismissals were prompted by separate traffic accidents last February in  which Stonebreaker was charged with driving under the influence and Brooks with  leaving the scene of an accident that involved no injuries.  </P> <P> Commenting on the university's action, Holtz said: "Do I feel remorse? Yes. Am  I bitter at the university? No. The university has done so many great things  and turned around so many great people. I know they have a philosophy here in  how they operate. I trust that philosophy."  </P> <P> Sophomore Arnold Ale, the former Carson High School defensive end, became  homesick. Tackle George Williams was ruled academically ineligible and fullback  Braxton Banks probably is out for the season because of knee surgery.  </P> <P> These are setbacks, to be sure, along with a schedule that has the Irish on the  road for five of its first six games.  </P> <P> So much for negative aspects. On the positive side is the return of quarterback  Tony Rice, whose passing skill might not be comparable to his running ability  in Holtz's wishbone portion of the offense, but it's not a drawback, either.  </P> <P> He has matured as a passer and has capable receivers in Raghib (Rocket) Ismael,  who caught a 55-yarder from Rice against USC last year, and Derek Brown.  </P> <P> Ricky Watters, the team's leading receiver last year, has been switched to  tailback, a position he played in 1987. With Brooks' departure, Watters will be  a key player while Anthony Johnson will be used more extensively at fullback.  </P> <P> Holtz also has a veteran offensive line and defensive standouts such as nose  tackle Chris Zorich and linebacker Ned Bolcar, along with an experienced,  talented secondary.  </P> <P> Michigan is amply stocked with proven players.  </P> <P> However, Michigan has only one experienced quarterback, Michael Taylor.  Demetrius Brown, who started the final three games last season after Taylor  suffered a broken collarbone, has dropped out of school. Brown proved himself  by completing 11 of 24 passes for 144 yards in the Rose Bowl game.  </P> <P> Schembechler doesn't have the insurance of having two proven quarterbacks, but  he has one of the nation's best running-back tandems in tailback Tony Boles and  fullback Leroy Hoard. Hoard was the most valuable player of the Rose Bowl with  142 yards rushing, including a 61-yard run on Michigan's game-clinching, final  scoring drive.  </P> <P> The Wolverines also have a strong receiving corps, a huge offensive line and  nine defensive starters returning, although Schembechler must replace  All-American tackle Mark Messner.  </P> <P> Some of the other top teams:  </P> <P> MIAMI  </P> <P> A new coach, Dennis Erickson and a new quarterback, Craig Erickson, would  usually indicate a team is rebuilding.  </P> <P> Not at Miami, which has won two national championships in the past six seasons  and will contend for another this year.  </P> <P> "I call Miami 'Re-load U.,' " said Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden.  </P> <P> Coach Erickson will implement a one-back offense with a short passing game that  worked for him at Washington State last year when Timm Rosenbach led the nation  in passing.  </P> <P> NEBRASKA  </P> <P> Talent aside, the most favorable aspect for the Cornhuskers is their schedule  -- non-conference games against over-matched Northern Illinois, Utah, Minnesota  and Oregon State.  </P> <P> Only Colorado and Oklahoma should challenge Nebraska in the the Big Eight and  the Sooners, on NCAA probation, don't appear as formidable as they once were.  </P> <P> "We have a chance to be decent, but we won't be overwhelming," Nebraska Coach  Tom Osborne said.  </P> <P> Osborne noted that Nebraska has lost 11 all-conference selections, including  quarterback Steve Taylor and All-American linebacker Broderick Thomas.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Nebraska has its usual quota of talented players, most notably  tailback Ken Clark and Doug Glaser, a 6-foot-7, 295-pound offensive tackle. The  schedule should make up for any shortcomings Nebraska has in experience.  </P> <P> LOUISIANA STATE  </P> <P> In Tommy Hodson, the Tigers have, arguably, the nation's best quarterback. His  statistics were down slightly last year, but he led LSU on late scoring drives  to beat Auburn and Alabama.  </P> <P> Coach Mike Archer has eight returning starters to support Hodson on offense,  but there are some gaps to be filled on defense.  </P> <P> LSU shared the Southeastern Conference championship with Auburn in 1988, its  second co-championship in three years.  </P> <P> AUBURN  </P> <P> Even though Coach Pat Dye has lost eight starters from the nation's No. 1  defense, it's difficult to dismiss the Tigers.  </P> <P> Auburn is the team of the 1980s in the SEC, with three appearances in the Sugar  Bowl in the last seven years.  </P> <P> Dye's defense needs some mending, but the offense is solid, featuring All-SEC  quarterback Reggie Slack and running backs Stacy Danley and James Joseph.  </P> <P> Auburn lost Outland Trophy winner Tracy Rocker, but his younger brother, David,  will be trying to carry on the family tradition at defensive tackle.  </P> <P> FLORIDA STATE  </P> <P> The Seminoles are in a rut with consecutive 11-1 seasons, losing only to rival  Miami.  </P> <P> Even though Bowden has lost such outstanding players as running back Sammie  Smith and cornerback Deion Sanders, he says his program has progressed to the  point where he has capable backups for most of his departed players.  </P> <P> For example, fifth-year senior Peter Tom Willis threw four touchdown passes  against South Carolina in his only start last season while standing in for  quarterback Chip Ferguson. Another backup last year, tailback Dexter Carter,  gained 330 yards as a replacement for Smith.  </P> <P> The schedule, as usual, is brutal.  </P> <P> "We play eight teams that were in bowls last year," Bowden said, "and that  might be too much for us."  </P> <P> Some things remain the same. Joe Paterno returns for his 24th season at Penn  State, but four other schools with big-time programs have new coaches.  </P> <P> Jimmy Johnson went from Miami to the Dallas Cowboys with Erickson as his  replacement. Oklahoma's Barry Switzer and Texas A&amp;M's Jackie Sherrill left  schools after allegations of infractions, and Georgia's Vince Dooley retired  after 25 years of coaching.  </P> <P> Switzer, Sherrill and Dooley were each replaced by an assistant: Gary Gibbs at  Oklahoma, R.C. Slocum at Texas A&amp;M and Ray Goff at Georgia. Slocum was an  assistant at USC in 1981.  </P> <P> And, of course, there are the inevitable rules changes.  </P> <P> Alarmed over the increase in scoring because of field goals, the NCAA Rules  Committee banned the use of tees on field goals and point-after-touchdown  attempts.  </P> <P> In other rules changes, the ball will be blown dead if a player pretends to  drop his knee near to the ground and then stands up running or throwing.  </P> <P> Players who point fingers, arms, or hands at an opponent will be charged with  unsportsmanlike conduct.  </P> <P> Nothing was clarified as to sticking out one's tongue.  </P></p>

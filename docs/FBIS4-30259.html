			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- Japan's ruling coalition  parties resumed talks Friday with the Social Democratic Party  (SDP) in an attempt to woo the second largest opposition force  back into the fold in the face of a no-confidence vote being  sought by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    "Who is going to resign en masse? Nothing has been decided  yet," Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Friday morning in  response to reporters' questions about the SDP's demand for the  voluntary dissolution of his cabinet.    Hata on Thursday indicated he is ready to resign with his  ministers if it is necessary to bring the SDP back. The SDP  left the coalition in April, giving rise to the nation's first  minority government in four decades.    Earlier the same day, the main opposition LDP, ousted from  power last August by a reformist coalition after 38 years of  rule, submitted the no-confidence motion against the Hata  government.    The SDP, which has the swinging vote, has said it may join  in  the motion if the realliance talks collapse.    The fresh round of talks between coalition partners, led by  Hata's Shinseito, and the SDP was focused on plans to raise the  3 percent consumption tax to cover income tax cuts, welfare  funding and other key financial needs.    The SDP, which opposed the consumption tax when it was  introduced in 1989, is demanding it be replaced with other forms  of indirect taxation.    Hata met with SDP head Tomiichi Murayama for less than half  an hour Thursday night in an unsuccessful attempt to tide over  the political crisis, leaving the fate of the government to  further talks between their top aides.    Whether the two leaders will have another meeting Friday  "will depend on progress on various things," Hata said as he  headed for the day's cabinet meeting.    Murayama told a meeting Friday morning of the party's  central  executive committee that he will seek to settle the stalemate  within the day.    Referring to the no-confidence motion, Murayama said a  plenary session of the House of Representatives, if convened,  must give priority to a vote on the motion but that the steering  committee's decision to call a full-house session depends on the  day's developments on the political front.    In a related development, the SDP rejected the LDP's offer  Thursday to hold coalition talks, saying the socialists are  consulting the governing parties on their possible return to the  coalition camp.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, April 6 (AFP) -- Both Ukraine and Crimea on  Wednesday played down a visit by senior Ukrainian military  officers to Crimea while its separatist leader Yuryy Meshkov was  abroad, with Meshkov's spokesman stating "no coup d'etat" was  underway.    The visit Tuesday had sparked speculation in the Russian  press about a possible challenge by Kiev to Crimea's Russian  nationalist leader, who defied Ukraine with a referendum on the  peninsula last month that won overwhelming backing for closer  ties with Russia.    But Viacheslav Lebedev, the head of Mechkov's press service,  said Wednesday that "nothing extraordinary was happening in  Crimea and that there was no coup d'etat underway."    Vladimir Petenko, an aide to Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk, said the visit Tuesday had been "planned" beforehand.    He also said a report by Russian central television saying  it  was an unexpected visit by some 30 special forces and several  generals "did not correspond to reality."    The chief spokesman for the Ukrainian Defense Ministry,  Aleksandr Kluban, meanwhile said eight officers of the Ukrainian  chief of staff were sent to Sebastopol with "a single general"  and that "no member of the special forces" had taken part in the  trip.    He said the officers had met with the commander of the Black  Sea Fleet, Admiral Eduard Baltin, who he said had accidentally  wounded himself a few days ago with his own service weapon.    Some Russian press reports had announced Tuesday that  Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitalyy Radetsky himself had gone to  Crimea, but the Defense Ministry spokesman said Radetsky and his  chief aids had been in meetings all day Tuesday in Kiev.    ITAR-TASS news agency was among those that had said about 30  special interior ministry forces had taken up station on a  warship after arriving in the Ukraine on Tuesday. It said top  generals from army intelligence, the air force,  counter-espionage and the national guard had also come.    The return of Meshkov from a visit to Cyprus had been  delayed  for eight hours because Turkey had closed its airspace, the  agency said, quoting a member of the crew on Meshkov's plane.    Russians comprise 67 percent of the population in Crimea,  which the then Soviet leadership transferred to Ukraine in 1954.</p>

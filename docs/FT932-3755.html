			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Muck, brass and plain talking: Kenneth Clarke must back up tough words with decisive action We have a politician at the Treasury. Emerging this week from the briefest of silences after his elevation to the chancellorship, Mr Kenneth Clarke had a simple message for those seeking to second-guess his economic strategy: they should look at where he came from. For those unfamiliar with his background, he filled in the details. His convictions and opinions had been shaped in Nottingham - a place where people got their hands dirty, where the priority was to get a job, to earn a living. And the new chancellor had not torn up his roots: 'I hardly know the City . . . I only come to London because I have to come here to do the particular work I have to do.' Unintentionally, Mr Clarke told us something else. As his demoralised backbench colleagues roared with approval during his first House of Commons performance as chancellor, he confirmed his status as the most powerful force in the cabinet. Mr John Major has pinned on his new chancellor his remaining hopes of survival in 10 Downing Street. But Mr Clarke has been annointed heir apparent, should the Conservative party fail to recover its collective nerve. His first outing as chancellor could not have been more successful. At lunchtime on Wednesday he charmed the parliamentary press gallery with his witty but serious insight into the politics which will drive his economics. By 9.30 that night he was restoring hope to the Tory MPs who had been left stunned by Mr Lamont's blistering attack on the prime minister. Those waiting for what he termed the 'odd quip about the monetary aggregates' had to be satisfied with an assurance that as a former lawyer Mr Clarke had 'handled money'. He also had friends who worked in the City. He was 'not bad' on the geography of the Square Mile. There was, however, a short, sharp description of the framework in which his economic strategy would be shaped. Introducing a new label into the political vocabulary, he put himself in the 'hard centre' of Conservatism - pro-Europe, pro-free market economics and pro-enlightened social reform. Combine that with his personal background and it produced a chancellor who was committed to industrial and economic expansion, and to providing opportunities for people to improve their living standards. After all, as he put it, 'that's the point of the whole thing - growth and employment'. But for so consummate a politician as Mr Clarke, this week was the easy part. Anyone can change the rhetoric of policymaking. There are many in the Treasury who have been worried for some time that the uncompromising language in which the government has framed its anti-inflation commitment had begun to distort the basic objective of economic policy. Mr Clarke has restored the balance, reminding people that the containment of inflation and a modicum of fiscal prudence are means to an end rather than ends in themselves. But the chancellor - who next week will follow his message to the politicians with his first attempt to win the confidence of the financiers - faces hard decisions. His inheritance does not live up to the unalloyed optimism of his predecessor. True, Britain is one of few western industrial economies showing real signs of growth. The headline inflation figure is the lowest for 30 years. A sharp fall in wage settlements and depressed international prices are reassuring. So there is little debate in the Treasury about the stance of monetary policy. Some believe that interest rates at 6 per cent are fractionally too high; others might like to see them move up slightly. Any argument though is at the margin. But the recovery is still fragile, vulnerable to the slide into recession of most of Britain's principal export markets. Inflation will soon begin to creep up in response to the delayed impact of devaluation. And then there is the 'iceberg' - Mr Clarke's word - upon which it might all founder: a Pounds 1bn a week borrowing requirement equivalent to 8 per cent of national income. Those who have spoken to the chancellor about his priorities since his appointment detect no great difference with Mr Lamont in the substance of his attitude to inflation. His presentation is different - relative price stability is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for economic growth. But there has been no hint that he wants to relax the aim of monetary policy. In next week's speech at the Mansion House he will reaffirm the 1 to 4 per cent inflation target set after sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism. As Mr Clarke commented: 'I have no intention of putting a sponge right across Norman Lamont's economic slate'. But his approach to the public borrowing requirement is more opaque. He said several things this week. The first was that the deficit must be reduced if recovery was to be sustained. The second, that in sticking to the Treasury's spending targets, he had no interest in dismantling the welfare state - suggestions of hotel charges in hospitals and prescription charges for the elderly were given short shrift. The third was that his political instincts did not incline him  -as some reports had suggested - towards increasing income tax in his November budget. On one level he was simply recognising political realities. The more draconian proposals thrown up by the Treasury's review of welfare spending would never muster a majority in the House of Commons. Why not discount them now? Nor in the present state of the Tory party is it sensible to start talking even about the possibility of raising income tax. But observers both inside and outside government were left wondering how, if spending was not to be cut and taxes raised no further, Mr Clarke planned to square the circle. (One of the striking things about the new chancellor is that he tends to say the same things in public as in private). There was one clue to his thinking. In his references to the cause of the deficit Mr Clarke suggested that the causes were 'mostly' cyclical. The implication is that a resumption of growth will solve most of the problem. Restraining increases in public spending to below the rate of growth of the economy - and the delayed tax increases already announced by Mr Lamont could deal with the remainder over time. It is a plausible strategy, but one fraught with risk. Nobody in the Treasury is sure just how much of the deficit can be attributed to the recession. No one can confidently predict the lags between the economic upswing and a commensurate adjustment in revenues and expenditure. It may be that the uncertainties will demand a political as much as an economic judgment. All the choices - cutting rather than containing spending, raising taxes, and waiting for economic recovery - pose a formidable test of nerve. A mistake might well be fatal. In two weeks at the Treasury Mr Clarke has exhibited effortlessly all of the political skills his predecessor lacked. He is confident, combative. He might yet spend as short a period in his present office as did Mr Major. But the politician at the Treasury will soon have to follow words with actions. It takes more than an empathy with the real world of the industrial Midlands to run the economy.</p>

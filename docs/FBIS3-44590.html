			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Liangjun: "Hong Kong Power Transition Accelerated"] </F>   [Text] A specialized preparatory group began meeting in  Beijing yesterday in a move to accelerate preparations for the  1997 transition of power in Hong Kong.    Specialized panels from the Preliminary Work Committee for  the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region (SAR) will address political, economic,  legal, cultural, social and security issues.    The first meeting opened yesterday when some 20 members of  the Economic Group began closed-door discussions at Beijing's  Hong Kong and Macao Centre.    The other specialized panels are expected to begin meeting  in  the following days.    The series of parleys come nearly month after the cessation  of marathon talks between China and Britain over Hong Kong's  electoral arrangement in 1994 and 1995, and at a time when top  Chinese authorities have called for intensified preparations for  the 1997 transition.    Present at yesterday's Economic Group meeting was Lu Ping,  Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State  Council and Secretary-General of the Preliminary Work Committee.    The two-day Economic Group meeting will cover problems  related to construction of the new Hong Kong airport and the  development of large capital-construction projects in Hong Kong  and on the mainland.    No details were given about yesterday's meeting.    In line with the Hong Kong Basic Law, the Preparatory  Committee of the Hong Kong SAR will be established in 1996.</p>

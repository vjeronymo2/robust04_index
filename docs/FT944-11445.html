			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Outdoors: Trees that make winter bearable - Gardening / Ignore the part-timers The tree season is ending in most people's gardens but not in mine, where my favourites are at their best. They suit small or large gardens, they grow anywhere and, apart from owner apathy or a rare attack of honey fungus, nothing seems to bother them. And my top three have long seasons - they are not limited to a fortnight's flower or only five months' leaf. Those choosing trees need to know that they can be miserable part-timers. Yes, mulberries are romantic, ash trees have been turning a seductive shade of yellow and robinias are exciting because they flower. As a garden's main trees, however, I disqualify all of them. They are so late into leaf that they miss the main thrust of spring entirely. I do not want to look on the bare branches of a mulberry as the garden's main focus in mid-May. In smaller gardens, I would much rather look out on to sorbus Vilmorinii. Never believe that sorbusses are nothing more than mountain ashes which can be seen in any old garden. Vilmorinii has leaves which are cut prettily and, in spring, open punctually to a fine greyish-green, while the main stem stands up straight. It belongs in a front garden, beside a small lawn, or on the edge of an urban boundary. You can plant round and under it and you know it will not grow much more than 10-12ft with a modest, open spread of branches. It flowers late in May without being special but, just now, it is ending six weeks of distinction. In autumn, Vilmorinii turns a bright reddish-purple and covers itself with clusters of pink-white berries. In a bigger garden, I would have to have the robust sorbus hupehensis, too, for its bigger, greyer leaves and taller shape. Vilmorinii, however, seems to be a better fruiter: its one fault this year is that young trees have cropped so heavily that their upper stems have bent over and snapped. While Vilmorinii's shape is upright and lightly branched, my second favourite bends over and develops a rounded head. The malus family contains dozens of good garden trees besides cultivated apples but, to my eye, malus Red Sentinel is simply the best in a modest space. Like all the family, it flowers freely in spring and fruits heavily in autumn. The flowers, however, are not too harshly white, a failing which afflicts several recent forms (including Everest, which I have just banished from the main garden). With time, other excellent maluses, especially the prolific Florabunda, become upright and rather untidy. In its early years, Red Sentinel will seem to droop, as if hit by a strong wind. Be patient, because it will broaden out into a loosely-rounded head on a standard stem. It has pretty leaves which do not become drab as summer advances and it has particularly pretty scarlet fruits. So do some of the others, but Red Sentinel is the one which will last in fruit from October right on into March, trebling the interest in these difficult months. By the end, the fruits are slightly battered, but I would much rather see them than not. It is an excellent grower and, if you allow enough width for its head, it would look charming anywhere. My companion for it is taller but is about to enter its unsurpassed season of duty. Last year, the winter cherries were amazingly beautiful in a winter that never really brought a sharp frost to turn them brown. This year, the omens look promising and, in three weeks, prunus subhirtella autumnalias will be at its best. In older age, the trees can become quite wide and tall; but you can always prune them lightly and encourage them upwards, not outwards, if you are worried they will overshadow too much of their surrounds. I would not be deterred by lack of space from trying them at the edge of a front yard which could stand a height up to 25ft after 12 years or so. Clipping can take care of the sideways shading. This wonderful tree remains my first choice and should not be excluded because of its possible span when older. It is controllable. And nothing else will give you such clouds of white flower waiting to be picked and brought indoors (where they will last quite well), to be replaced by yet more buds in intervals between the winter frosts. There are other winter cherries, but only this variety has the ability to send out yet more buds beyond the first flowers when they happen to be caught in cold weather. Anyone can grow it and nurseries will supply it as a bush, rather than a tree, if the dimensions bother you. There is, however, one important bit of knowledge. This winter cherry also has a pink form but, for some reason, it does not flower so promptly in the winter and often refuses to open until early March. By then, it is only one among many. So, be sure to insist on the white-flowered form so that you do not lose the five-month season of flower which puts this tree above any easily-grown rival.</p>

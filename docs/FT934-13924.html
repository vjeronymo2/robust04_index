			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Aluminium (6): Money-go-round - Recycling has come to stay FOR THE first time last year more aluminium was produced in the UK from recycled metal than the country's smelters produced from bauxite, the raw material for aluminium - 251.800 tonnes from recycled material and 244,200 tonnes of primary aluminium. So the industry was begining to feel the full benefit of the Pounds 28m spent by Alcan of Canada on a dedicated aluminium can recycling facility at Warrington, in the north of England. The plant started operating two years ago with the ability to process 50,000 tonnes of used beverage cans a year. Yet only about 70,000 tonnes of aluminium beverage cans are sold in the UK and most of them are thrown away. So used beverage cans (UBCs in the industry jargon) are being imported, mainly from the US, to feed the Warrington plant. This is not commercial madness but an example of the aluminium industry's commitment to recycling and its determination to put the infrastructure in place to make recycling work. Even though Alcan won a low-cost Pounds 24m loan from the European Investment Bank towards the Warrington project, the investment makes sense only because of the peculiarities of aluminium production. For, while manufacturing new aluminium takes a great deal of energy - typically 15 MegaWatt hours of electricity a tonne - the metal 'stores' that energy. It can take as little as 5 per cent of the original energy to make used can sheet as good as new. The relatively high value of aluminium - aluminium cans are worth six to 20 times more than any other used packaging material and are the most valueable used package found in household waste - enables the industry to promote can recycling as a way for collecters to have a decent income. These efforts resulted in aluminium can recycling rates in Europe and the US reaching record levels last year. In Europe the rate rose from 21 per cent in 1991 to 25 per cent while the US rate jumped from 62.5 per cent to 67.9 per cent. Big money was involved. The US Aluminum Association estimates that the industry paid out Dollars 968m for used cans, money that went back into local economies to benefit individuals, schools, churches, scout troops and so on. However, the industry also benefits - and not only from giving itself a green image. Cans provide cheaper metal because they can be recycled on a closed loop system (from cans to scrap and back to cans again), because they save as much as 95 per cent of the energy needed to produce new aluminium and because the capital cost of a recycling plant is only one-tenth of a smelter. According to Aluminium Can Recycling Europe (Acre), at least 39,595 tonnes of aluminium cans were recycled in Europe last year, up from 32,350 tonnes. The European industry has set itself a target of recycling 50 per cent of all aluminium cans by the mid-1990s at a time when aluminium's share of the beverage can market is also growing rapidly - it reached 51 per cent in 1992. Sweden, with its mandatory deposit scheme, had the highest recycling rate last year, 86 per cent, followed by Iceland, 75 per cent, and Switzerland, 68 per cent. Mr Alexander Wirtz of Acre, says that 'cash for aluminium cans' machines in Switzerland today are even found high up in the Alps next to ski huts. The recycling rate in Austria jumped from 25 per cent to 40 per cent last year and there were steady increases in Ireland (11 to 16 per cent), Italy (15 to 18 per cent), Greece (26 to 29 per cent) and the UK (11 to 16 per cent.) Efforts to promote further growth and to provide the necessary collection infrastructure are being co-ordinated by Acre, which was formed in 1984 by Alcan of Canada, Pechiney of France and VAW of Germany. Alcoa and Reynolds of the US, joined in 1988, and Alusuisse-Lonza (Switzerland), Hydro Aluminium (Norway) and Elval (Greece) agreed to provide support in their domestic markets. But can recycling has a great deal further to go before it catches up with some other sectors. Already as much as 70 per cent of the aluminium used in electrical engineering, building and transport is re-used. Aluminium automotive castings are almost entirely made from scrap metal. The industry is now belatedly turning its attention to recyling aluminium foil, a tricky business because a great deal of bulk has to be collected to get any reasonable weight and 90 per cent of foil is meant to be in contact with food which creates hygeine problems in handling and storage. In the US, Reynolds Metals, the second-largest aluminium group, began testing foil recycling in 1991. Mr Jeremiah Sheehan, Reynolds' executive vice president, consumer and packaging products, admits that it is not as commercially necessary for the industry to recycle foil as beverage cans - in the US only 200m lbs of aluminium is used annually for consumer foil, plus a similar quantity for food and other containers, compared with 4bn lbs used for cans. 'But recycling helps to identify foil as a green product,' he points out. It gives foil an edge over plastics. In the UK nearly 40 per cent of aluminium used in packaging (including beverage cans) goes into foil and about 50,000 tonnes of aluminium foil packaging, worth roughly Pounds 15m, is thrown away every year. To recapture at least some of this, an Aluminium Foil Recycling Campaign (AFRC) was started by foil converters Alcan Ekco Packaging, Bowater Foil and Paper Products and William Garfield, all members of the Aluminium Foil Container Manufacturers Association, with British Alcan Consumer Products. AFRC spent Pounds 200,000 over two years on five pilot schemes from which it became obvious that foil would not be collected successfully by local authorities working alone, without help from the industry. So the industry has drawn up a 10-year plan which will establish national infrastructure and work towards a 30 per cent recycling target. Typically, schemes will provide local authority 'foil bank' systems serviced by a single local charity or group of charities. Banks will be located on supermarket or other prime sites. AFRC says the involvement of a local charity provides motivation for the public to give for their own community - clean foil can fetch Pounds 350 a tonne. Schools will also be involved in the collection schemes. The scheme is funded by a voluntary levy of Pounds 10 a tonne from the rolling mills. Meanwhile, the European Community seems likely to set a 60 per cent target for the recovery and handling of all used packaging materials - and the responsibility for achieving this level falls largely on the producer industries.</p>

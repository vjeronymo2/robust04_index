			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GOSSEN COOKS IN WASHINGTON STATE WIN  </P> <P> Junior Brad Gossen completed 17 of 22 passes for 288 yards and three touchdowns  in his first start, and Washington State held Idaho scoreless after the first  quarter as the Cougars defeated the Vandals, 41-7, Saturday.  </P> <P> The left-handed Gossen directed the Cougars on four scoring drives that covered  at least 80 yards and took less than three minutes each.  </P> <P> The Cougars, leading, 17-7, midway through the third quarter, were backed up  inside their own one-yard line by a punt and an illegal motion penalty. But  Gossen passed to tight end Doug Wellsandt for a 28-yard gain to get out of the  hole, then threw over the middle to senior flanker Tim Stallworth, who  completed a 62-yard touchdown play.  </P> <P> The Cougars' Steve Broussard was bottled up by Idaho's defense most of the  first half but finished with 115 yards in 23 carries and also had a four-yard  scoring run.  </P> <P> Idaho's John Friesz completed 19 of 32 passes for 225 yards and threw two  interceptions.  </P></p>

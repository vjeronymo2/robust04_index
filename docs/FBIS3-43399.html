			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] leadership has categorically denied allegations  reported by the Luanda regime's press that Armed Forces for the  Liberation of Angola [FALA] troops bombed Malanje yesterday when  the aircraft carrying U.S. congressmen was about to land. A  source close to the FALA General Staff has said that such  statements are a pretext by the Luanda regime to cover  offensives launched by its forces in the area. Our source said  there is no reason to investigate who, in fact, is responsible  for what happened because this is part of a powerful propaganda  campaign by the Eduardo dos Santos regime, which is searching  for approval in the eyes of the U.S. Government. The same  source said this is the second attack of this kind since the  failed attempt to incriminate UNITA as responsible for the  attack on Malongo in Cabinda Province. Our source concluded by  appealing to the international community not to be taken in by  the fallacious propaganda of the Luanda regime, since they are  bent on boycotting the round of talks.</p>

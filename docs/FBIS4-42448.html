			<p>BFN     [Text] The Council of Ministers issued a written statement  noting that the report UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali  submitted to the Security Council makes it harder for an  agreement to be reached regarding the confidence-building  measures [CBM's] and in establishing an atmosphere of trust  between the two communities. The Council of Ministers assessed  Butrus-Ghali's report during its meeting today.    The statement issued after the meeting states that the  Council of Ministers share President Rauf Denktas' views  concerning the report and sincerely hopes a realistic and viable  solution acceptable to both sides will be reached in Cyprus.    Noting that the secretary general's Cyprus report makes it  harder to reach an agreement on the CBM's as well as making it  harder for an atmosphere of trust to be established between the  two communities, the statement points out that the Greek Cypriot  position is presented as that of the United Nations. The  statement further remarks that the report is written in a manner  which condemns the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' [TRNC]  position inspite of the TRNC's show of goodwill and constructive  stand.    The statement notes that the Council of Ministers believes  that approaches of this kind -- be it in the form of CBM's or be  it in the form of a comprehensive agreement -- will not achieve  a solution and continues: Undoubtedly, no solutions can be  reached when views, acceptable to one side on condition and not  even approved by the other side, are coerced to one of the sides.    It was also stressed in the statement that Denktas supports  and endorses the favorable and constructive views he  communicated to Gustave Feissel, UN secretary general's deputy  special envoy in Cyprus, yesterday.</p>

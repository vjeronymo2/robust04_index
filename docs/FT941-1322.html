			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: National Grid in Indian link National Grid, operator of the England and Wales power transmission system, is in talks with Power Grid of India to set up a joint venture to undertake transmission projects in the sub-continent. A deal is thought to be close for a venture which would build, operate and maintain systems. National Grid, which is owned by the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales, is believed to be considering an investment of up to Pounds 25m. The Indian venture would be the second significant equity deal overseas. The first was in Argentina. Last year National Grid said it planned to invest Pounds 370m overseas over the next five years. The expansion abroad reflects the limited opportunities UK electrictiy comapneis have in the relatively mature UK power market. Power Grid is examining several projects in India which will require significant investment including the linking of separate zones of the country. National Grid could not confirm yesterday the details of its negotiations.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> A group of 100 signed photographs by Ansel Adams will receive their first  public exhibition at UC Irvine, beginning Jan. 6. The prints -- of UC campuses,  research stations and agricultural units -- were commissioned in 1963 by  then-UC President Clark Kerr to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the UC  system.  </P> <P> During a four-year period, Adams took more than 6,000 photos for the project.  The works in the exhibition were chosen from the final 605 images Adams  selected for the celebration. Although the campus political scene of the  mid-'60s precluded most centennial fanfare, the photographs were published in a  1967 book, "Fiat Lux: The University of California."  </P> <P> "The Museum Set," a group of 75 photographs by Adams, also will be shown in the  exhibit. The portfolio is owned by Pacific Telesis Group.  </P></p>

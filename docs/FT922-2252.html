			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Technology: Wellcome's cures for despair - In the run-up to the drug company's share offer, FT writers look at its Aids and herpes treatments FEW drugs have aroused more passionate feelings, for and against, than Wellcome's AZT - launched five years ago and still the only licensed treatment for HIV and Aids in most parts of the world. A wave of enthusiasm carried AZT (also known by the trade name of Retrovir) through the development process at record speed. Less than three years passed between the discovery of its antiviral activity in November 1984 and regulatory approval in March 1987. Instead of gratitude, Wellcome received an onslaught from US Aids activists who thought the UK company was profiting unreasonably from their suffering, by making patients pay several thousand dollars a year for AZT. The furore over pricing died away after Wellcome cut recommended prices and doses of AZT. But the drug remains controversial, as critics draw attention to its side-effects and cast doubt on its effectiveness. At one extreme are Peter Duesberg of the University of California, Berkeley, and his small but well-publicised band of followers. They attack the conventional medical view that Aids is a viral disease caused by HIV and they say AZT is a dangerous drug which can harm the patients and even cause Aids-like symptoms. Such arguments outrage the medical establishment. The evidence for Duesberg's claim that AZT is 'Aids by prescription' is 'about as strong as saying that since many people with a toothache also take aspirin, aspirin causes toothaches', says Dai Rees, secretary of the UK Medical Research Council. 'A number of careful clinical studies have shown that AZT can be beneficial to patients with Aids.' Tony Pinching, an Aids specialist at St Bartholemew's Hospital, London, says hostility to AZT is partly a reaction against 'over-enthusiastic extrapolations' from some incomplete clinical trials, which exaggerated the benefits of the drug for Aids patients and particularly for people infected with HIV but not showing Aids symptoms. 'A lot reflects differences between people's dreams and aspirations and what they can actually prove from the data,' Pinching says. Like most European doctors, he believes the clinical evidence that AZT prolongs the life of Aids patients is overwhelming, but he is less convinced by the evidence that early treatment of asymptomatic HIV carriers will help them in the long run. AZT is a 'nucleoside analogue' drug. It works by mimicking thymidine, one of the building blocks of genetic material. When HIV incorporates an AZT molecule instead of thymidine into its growing DNA chain, it jams the mechanism by which the virus replicates. AZT slows down the rate at which HIV infects cells of the human immune system but it cannot eliminate the virus, let alone 'cure' Aids. Scores of competing drugs are at various stages of development. Furthest advanced are two other nucleoside analogues: DDI (marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb as Videx) and DDC (Roche's Hivid). DDI is approved in the US as a second-line therapy for Aids patients who are not responding well to AZT and similar approval is expected soon for DDC. Both drugs have side effects, though these do not include bone marrow suppression, which is the most serious problem caused by AZT. Behind them are more nucleoside analogues - including the promising 3TC licensed by Glaxo from Biochem Pharma of Canada - and others which claim to work through a bewildering array of mechanisms. They include protease inhibitors, therapeutic vaccines (which aim to stimulate the immune response of people already infected with HIV) and even gene therapy. In the short term, the newcomers will not necessarily threaten AZT's sales, because many specialists believe the best approach to Aids therapy is to use a combination of drugs including AZT. The main reason for this is that viruses are much less likely to develop resistance when two or more drugs are taken together. Sales of AZT levelled off at about Pounds 170m a year during 1990 and 1991 but they are now growing again. London pharmaceutical analysts, who have studied Wellcome in preparation for this summer's share offer, predict growth of around 25 per cent a year up to 1994. Progress after that will depend on whether the company can persuade large numbers of asymptomatic HIV carriers to take AZT in an effort to ward off Aids symptoms. And that will require clinical evidence good enough to overcome the widespread antagonism to AZT.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / De Klerk to visit Russia and Japan PRESIDENT FW de Klerk leaves tomorrow on a week-long visit to Russia, Japan and Singapore which marks a further important step in South Africa's diplomatic rehabilitation. The trip begins in Russia where Mr de Klerk will be Mr Yeltsin's first official visitor since he took over as Russian President. South Africa and Moscow established full diplomatic relations in February and consulates will soon be established in Cape Town and St Petersburg. Mr Neil van Heerden, director-general of the Department of Foreign Affairs, said there had been 'quite furious contact' at commercial level between South African business organisations and their Russian counterparts. He said the current trip, however, would be mostly of symbolic importance. 'Two years ago if I said we were going to Moscow you would have not believed it.' A small group of communists in Moscow opposes the trip, arguing that Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, should have been received before Mr de Klerk. A formal trade agreement between the two countries will probably be signed later this year. Aerospace technology has been mentioned as a possible area of trade, with the Russians apparently keen to sell aircraft and space launches. Of potentially greater commercial importance will be Mr de Klerk's visit to Japan with whom diplomatic relations were normalised earlier this year. Japan was South Africa's leading trading partner in 1987 before it froze trade at those levels as a sanctions measure. Trade between the two countries was Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 1.88bn) in 1991, but there is very little Japanese investment in South Africa, following a 20-year investment ban. Singapore is seen as an entry point for trade into East and Central Asia.</p>

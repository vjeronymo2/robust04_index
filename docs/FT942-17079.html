			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / South African Elections April 26-28: South Africa to go to mobile stations to vote On April 26-28, 22.7m South African voters will be eligible to vote at any one of 9,000 polling stations. Some of them will be mobile stations, to be moved in and out of areas where violence could interfere. There are no constituencies. Representatives are chosen from national party lists, so voters can attend any polling station. Some 80m ballot papers are being printed by De La Rue, the UK security printer, and can be placed in 126,000 ballot boxes. Some 193,706 voting officers will staff the polling stations; 90,838 enumerators will count votes. The Independent Electoral Commission plans to deploy 10,000 monitors by mid-April; the UN says it expects 5,000 foreign observers. The commission (11 eminent South Africans and five international commissioners under the chairmanship of Judge Johann Kriegler) will conduct the poll and decide whether it is free and fair. There is no appeal against its decision.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Tory Euro-debate echoed on Continent: Other parties have doubts but none flirt with ideas of a withdrawal from European Union The ruling British Conservative party's dance of death over Europe is being watched with a mixture of bemusement and trepidation inside the European Union. Experienced diplomats in Brussels find it hard to fathom the self-destructive streak inside the Tory party; but there is a grudging admission that, however distorted the British debate on the pace of European integration, there are echoes on the Continent. Whether these echoes portend a profound constitutional debate on the future of Europe remains an open question; but the evidence suggests that the UK Euro-sceptics are far from isolated. In Italy, the new Berlusconi government unveiled last night included Mr Antonio Martino, a Chicago school economist and prominent opponent of a single European currency, as foreign minister. In France, the Balladur government has bashed 'Brussels' ever since it came to power last year. Mr Jacques Delors, President of the European Commission, complained this week that his fellow Socialists were deliberately ignoring Europe's successes in the Euro-parliamentary election campaign. In Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has chosen to fight an election campaign on a theme of more, not less Europe; but the jury is out on whether this pro-European message will deliver a winning hand. Yet it is important to stress that none of the mainstream parties or political figures in Europe have veered so far as the Tory Euro-sceptics in flirting with withdrawal from the European Union. Nor has there been a call for a referendum on a single European currency, or a plebiscite on the outcome of the 1996 inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty. Reluctance to embrace the idea of a referendum is linked to the painful process of securing ratification of the Maastricht treaty. When the Danes rejected Maastricht two years ago, the crisis was compounded by the wafer-thin support in the French referendum three months later. 'The lesson from France and Denmark is that people do not vote on the question of a complicated international treaty, they vote on something else.' In Brussels, the right-wing Tory campaign for a referendum on a single currency looks like tilting at windmills. Even ardent supporters of European monetary union concede that the prospects for EMU being achieved by the first target date of 1997 look remote - though that does not mean that the goal has been abandoned. Similarly, British calls for a referendum on the results of the 1996 intergovernmental conference reviewing the Maastricht treaty look premature  -the result of factional party infighting rather than a calculation of vital British national interest. 'How can you support a referendum on a conference where the outcome is completely unknown?' said one senior Eurocrat in Brussels yesterday. A senior German official warned, however, that if Tory Euro-sceptics continue to drive British policy on Europe, the 1996 conference would be a write-off. That would upset plans to deepen co-operation on immigration, crime and justice affairs, and it would make it much more difficult to plan for the admission of the central and East Europeans - both of which are Anglo-German priorities. Moreover, debate in the UK appears to assume that 1996 will be a 'Big Bang' conference which will deepen integration. Yet in Europe, senior French and German diplomats make no such assumption. 'The public is simply not ready,' said a French official. Lastly, neither the pro- nor anti-Europeans appear to have taken sufficient note of US views on the desirability of European integration. These were expounded by Mr Raymond Seitz, outgoing US ambassador to the Court of St James. Mr Seitz, a noted Anglophile, made clear that the US wants the UK fully involved in Europe. He offered little hope of Britain standing on the margins dreaming about a special relationship with the US or even membership of the Nafta free trade accord. Characteristically, his farewell speech received little attention in the British media.</p>

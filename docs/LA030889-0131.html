			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAD ABOUT MADONNA;  </P> <P> 'LIKE A PRAYER' MORE LOVE SONG THAN BLASPHEMY;  </P> <P> VIDEO REVIEW  </P> <P> Madonna is frequently in the tabloids. Stigmata sightings are frequently in the  tabloids. So the purportedly shocking imagery of the pop singer's controversial  new video clip "Like a Prayer" could be Weekly World News' dream come true:  Madonna Bears Stigmata.  </P> <P> Contrary to early reports, however, Madonna does not make love to a Christ  figure in thevideo. Wrong dream sequence. (Where was she when Marty Scorsese  needed her?)  </P> <P> Whatever is or isn't in this highly stylized clip -- which is currently airing  exclusively on MTV -- the key question in the wake of the uproars over "The  Last Temptation of Christ" and "The Satanic Verses" will no doubt be: Is the  video blasphemous?  </P> <P> It doesn't even come close. It's a secular love song that has no more to do  with religion than "Like a Virgin" had to do with virginity.  </P> <P> Not that the imagery in the video isn't very much designed to be provocative  and irreverent.  </P> <P> So far as it's possible to tell amid all the symbolism and jump-editing, the  racism-related story line goes something like this: Clad in revealing lingerie,  Madonna enters an empty church where she is drawn to a statue of a young black  man robed in white -- a saint or a martyr, perhaps? -- behind bars. She lies  down on a pew and is apparently overcome by a vision, while the statue comes to  life.  </P> <P> In this vision, the scenario of a recent crime is unveiled before her: A group  of white thugs attacks and stabs a white woman, but a black man who comes to  her aid is arrested. Madonna is then awakened from her vision by a raucous  black choir marching through the church. She trots down to the local jail,  where she vouches for the jailed man's innocence before the police -- who  presumably believe the fever dream of a woman who is standing at the sergeant's  desk wearing only a brassiere and a slip.  </P> <P> That's the story line, but there's more -- much more -- that could conceivably  shock or offend.  </P> <P> Madonna sings in front of a field of burning crosses. Madonna handles the  murder weapon, a knife, and suddenly is supernaturally afflicted with bleeding  nail wounds in her palms. Madonna does an uninhibited, giddy little dance with  a gospel troupe, and at one point gets down on her knees while a choir member  puts a hand on Madonna's forehead, faith healer-style. Rather than fall  backward from the healing touch, Madonna appears as if she might be about to  fall out of her bra.  </P> <P> Are the protesters lined up yet?  </P> <P> Madonna would no doubt argue that her detractors exaggerate the video's sexual  content, which is minimal if you don't count immodesty of dress.  </P> <P> She wants to show that she can amply display her hourglass figure and still be  a complete innocent, guiltlessly joining a choir in a place of worship at the  happy finale with a childlike glee. Indeed, she even dances with a little boy  -- a scene reminiscent of her superior video a few years back for "Open Your  Heart," in which, playing a stripper, she danced off into the sunset with a  young boy.  </P> <P> For video aficionados, "Like a Prayer" is heartening for its bold use of a  narrative approach -- something seen less and less of late. At its best, the  conceptual pop video can serve as a resurrection of the silent film, telling  stories without dialogue, as here.  </P> <P> But how clever is the story being told? At its core, "Like a Prayer" is a  rather basic redemptive tale, one perhaps bogged down more than buoyed by its  weighty and often gratuitous symbolism. It's an attention-grabber with some  nice cinematic touches, but the only viewers it's likely to truly move are  those whose hands reflexively jerk toward phones or picket signs at the  slightest provocation.  </P> <P> Which may be part of the idea.  </P></p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Company 'green' reports criticised FEWER THAN half the companies mentioning environmental issues in their annual reports are providing information of much value, according to Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monthly monitoring service. In a sample of 570 company reports 23 per cent address environmental matters, compared with 10 per cent in a survey in July last year. But 12 per cent of the sample contained statements which are 'usually vague or meaningless, lacking any real information content', Company Reporting says. Nine per cent of companies disclosed specific details on their environmental policies, compared with 5 per cent in the previous survey. Even among those providing this information, there was wide variation in the level of detail. Only three companies - Imperial Chemical Industries, RTZ and Thames Water - disclosed the costs of environmental protection measures adopted. An environmental audit - in which the company's performance was independently scrutinised - was mentioned by 3 per cent of companies, but none gave details of the results or measures taken to address issues raised by the audits. Company Reporting says Ford and Grand Metropolitan are among the better examples of reports giving information on 'green' issues. It highlights statements by BAT, British Airways, Hanson and Allied Lyons as 'of little value'. In a separate analysis, Company Reporting notes that 19 per cent of companies publish a statement of corporate objectives. Company Reporting. 68 Dundas Street, Edinburgh EH3 6QZ.

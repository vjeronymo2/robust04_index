Reauthorization of those portions of the Act provides an opportunity to consider improvements to the entire IDEA, including other portions of the Act, that would strengthen the Federal effort to give every child a world-class education based on high standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Description of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part A of the IDEA includes the findings and purpose of the Act; definitions; authority for the Office of Special Education Programs; provisions regarding State sovereign immunity; authority for the acquisition of equipment and construction of facilities; requirements relating to the employment of individuals with disabilities; grants for the removal of architectural barriers; regulatory provisions; and eligibility and administrative provisions applicable to the discretionary programs authorized in section 618 of Part B and Parts C through G.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part B authorizes two formula grant programs:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Assistance to States for Education of Individuals with Disabilities program, which assists States in providing special education and related services to children, aged 3 through 21 years, with disabilities; and (2) the Preschool Grants for Children with Disabilities program, which provides additional funds to help States provide services to children, aged 3 through 5 years, with disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), the Administration proposed that the Chapter 1 Handicapped program currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized under Title I of the ESEA be eliminated and all children with disabilities be served under the IDEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 618 of Part B includes requirements for the collection of data; requirements for an annual report on the progress being made under the Act and the publication of proposed priorities; and authority for other activities relating to implementation of the Act and national program information needs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parts C though G authorize a variety of discretionary research, demonstration, training, technical assistance, and dissemination activities.

States must serve all children aged birth through two years who: (1) Are experiencing developmental delays as measured by appropriate diagnostic instruments and procedures in one or more of the following areas: cognitive, physical, communication, social, emotional, or adaptive development; or (2) have a diagnosed physical or mental condition that has a high probability of resulting in developmental delay. ``Developmental delay'' is defined by each State. At their discretion, States may also serve infants and toddlers who are at risk of having substantial developmental delays if early intervention services are not provided. To be eligible for funding, the statewide system must include the 13 minimum components required by the statute and must be fully implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

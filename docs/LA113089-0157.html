			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS' ALLEN RETURNS TO PRACTICE  </P> <P> Marcus Allen returned to practice Wednesday, which means that the Raiders will  activate him this week against the Denver Broncos or next week against the St.  Louis Cardinals.  </P> <P> At what position?  </P> <P> "Marcus is a halfback," Coach Art Shell said, smiling.  </P> <P> Allen has said he doesn't want to play fullback alongside Bo Jackson any  longer. The question is, how much will Allen play after partially tearing a  ligament in his right knee and sitting out the last seven games?  </P> <P> And at 29, his $1.1-million contract expiring, will Al Davis sign him again?  </P> <P> Significantly, Jackson, who has been increasingly banged up the last two weeks,  went on the injury list. He is listed as probable with a bruised knee. Jackson  has been held to 54 and 64 yards the last two games.  </P> <P> Also returning to practice was receiver Sam Graddy. To make room, the Raiders  waived running back Derrick Gainer and safety Derrick Crudup off their  developmental squad. MARK HEISLER  </P></p>

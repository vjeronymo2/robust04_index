			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MOBILE HOMES FOR HOMELESS GET A SITE  </P> <P> The latest chapter in an effort to temporarily house homeless families in  city-owned trailers was unveiled Monday at a former airport shuttle bus  terminal in Westwood.  </P> <P> Fourteen mobile homes -- part of 102 trailers bought by the city for $500,000  two years ago -- sit on the parking lot of the former Flyaway bus terminal on a  strip of federal land across the San Diego Freeway from the Veterans  Administration Hospital and one-half mile from upscale Westwood Village.  </P> <P> Families of veterans will be given priority for the two- and three-bedroom  mobile homes, said Harry Pregerson, a judge on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of  Appeals who negotiated with the General Services Administration for the land.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley, acknowledging "we haven't begun to scratch the surface" of  the homeless problem, called it "a step in the right direction."  </P> <P> Appearing with Bradley and Pregerson at a news conference were two of the  families who will begin moving in Wednesday. During their maximum six-month  free stay, residents will be offered job counseling and training. The city will  pay for utilities on the furnished, carpeted trailers.  </P></p>

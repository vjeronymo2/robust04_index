			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MESSAGE OF 'DO THE RIGHT THING'  </P> <P> The Jewish Defense Organization is wrong to call for a boycott against "Do the  Right Thing" (as reported in Steve Hochman's July 16 article, "The Aftermath of  Public Enemy's Collapse").  </P> <P> Spike Lee's movie has a powerful message for all of society -- that all  Americans should strive to understand one another in order to live together  without hatred and violence.  </P> <P> Maybe the JDO should encourage viewing of the film in an effort to combat  anti-Semitic prejudice such as that expressed by Prof. Griff of Public Enemy,  the rap group that Hochman wrote about.  </P> <P> ELIZABETH ANNE  </P> <P> BAGASAO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

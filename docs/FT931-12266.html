			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / US keen to avoid UN action against Israel THE US government said last night it opposed any early moves against Israel at the United Nations following the approval by the Israeli High Court of the expulsion of more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon. The US called for more time to resolve the issue diplomatically. The unanimous decision by the court's seven judges prompted a call by the Palestine Liberation Organisation for the urgent imposition of sanctions to force Israel to abide by UN Security Council resolution 799, which demanded expulsions be reversed. But Washington, despite backing resolution 799, is anxious to avoid any further deepening of a crisis which threatens the future of Middle East peace talks. 'We're in the process of consulting with the Israeli government on next steps, which can resolve the issue,' said Mr Richard Boucher, State Department spokesman. 'Those diplomatic efforts have to be given a chance to succeed. We don't think it's time for a debate in the Security Council on sanctions.' Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli Prime Minister, said the cases of all the deportees would be reviewed by the authorities, but otherwise gave little sign of compromise. He said he looked to the US to protect Israel at the UN. 'This has been the policy of all presidents and all administrations of the US. Certainly that is what I expect.' Mr Rabin said he believed peace negotiations would resume and succeed. But Palestinian leaders and Arab governments said the high court ruling damaged peace efforts. The PLO repeated it would not return to talks until the deportees went home. The court said the expulsion of the 415 alleged Islamic fundamentalist militants was legal under an emergency regulation promulgated in 1945 under the British mandate. Although annulled by Britain, Israel continues to recognise mandate orders. The high court rejects the UN insistence that the fourth Geneva convention, which bars expulsions, applies to the occupied territories. It said a new expulsion order issued when the Palestinians were banished in December was illegal. But it nevertheless upheld the individual orders against the men as legal under the 1945 regulation. The court insisted that those expelled be able to appeal personally against their removal. But it accepted the government's submission that it could expel them without the right to prior appeal under the prevailing circumstances. The expulsions followed a spate of killings of Israeli soldiers by Islamic militants. The army said it would provide facilities for appeals in Lebanese territory it occupies close to where the deportees have been camped for six weeks. The deportees say they will refuse to appeal. Some Israeli lawyers said the rulings opened the way to further mass expulsions. Palestinians said they showed that the Israeli legal system was a sham when it came to Palestinian rights. Mr Rabin said he hoped the international community would take note of the high court's reference to examples in US and British law where the right to prior appeal was waived.</p>

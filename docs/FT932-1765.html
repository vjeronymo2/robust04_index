			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Giving African farm aid a feminine touch - In Tanzania the women till the soil while the men concentrate on weightier matters MAMA FLORA Yrafay is one of the leaders of her community. She lives in a mud hut in the village of Dareda in the district of Babati in Tanzania. Her age, I estimate, is about 25 and she has five children under seven years of age. The aid worker who introduced this lady to me last week described her as a 'mover and shaker' and influential in persuading her neighbours to adopt new farming ideas. For women, I was told, were the real farmers in this part of Africa. The men tend to sit around most of the time discussing great issues and drinking locally distilled gin. Their wives till the soil, plant and harvest the crops and milk the goats, as well as cooking meals and rearing a large brood of children. That is why Farm Africa, a British-based charity is targeting women in this densely populated area. If they can persuade them to adopt more efficient methods of food production, the charity reasons, their activities will have the greatest overall effect on the well-being of children and the whole community. The methods used by Farm Africa are basic. Firstly it tries to establish what the women themselves need, which sounds obvious but is radically different from the approach of some other aid agencies. Many major charities have the reputation of imposing on poor communities massive 'improvement' schemes that may be alien to local culture and therefore destined for failure. Farm Africa starts at grassroots. In Dareda it has been established that the small herds of goats owned by most families are not only grossly inefficient for both milk and meat production but, as they roam the village, usually tended by children, are also denuding the area of vegetation and trees. Goats are widely recognised as destructive animals because of their indiscriminate grazing habits. Farm Africa is therefore recommending to the women that they erect small huts for their goats and keep them confined all the time. The feed is then cut and carried to them by a system called, in more advanced agricultural societies, zero grazing. The paradox is that animal welfarists in the west condemn such systems for limiting the movement of the animals. In Tanzania, however, the priorities are different and damage to the environment leading to lack of food for the future together with associated erosion of the soil are seen as the most important considerations. Alongside this changed system of goat keeping Farm Africa has introduced British-bred female goats which give five to six pints of milk a day, three to four times as much as the native nannies. This is a quantum leap in production and although the number of British Toggenbergs in Dareda is so far only about 30 females and one male the effect on those who have them has been dramatic. Children are better nourished by the larger quantities of rich milk and the superior goats give the families a feeling of greater wealth. But Farm Africa is anxious to spread these benefits as widely as possible and insist that after one lactation each Toggenberg female is passed on to another family leaving the first owner with the young goat it has just produced. In addition the billy goat is made available for a fee of about Pounds 2 to mate with the local village females. A service fee for goats was unheard of until Farm Africa arrived but such is the perceived improvement in potential production from the cross breeding that the billy is kept very busy. The initiative also advocates a programme of tree planting and has developed a simple but more efficient stove for cooking. In the past this has been done on open fires, which burn a great deal of wood. This too has led to the cutting of large areas of trees and there has previously been little attempt to replant. All over Tanzania the heavy downfalls of the rainy season has gouged great channels through the unprotected red soils and washed the aluvium down the rivers. So the combination of the fuel-efficient clay stoves, moulded and made by women like Mama Flora Yrafay and sold to others for a little over Pounds 1 each and the tree planting programme will in time help to control the erosion. Another aspect of Farm Africa's initiative is to encourage farmers, in other words the women of the community, to use oxen to relieve some of their burdens. At present most land work and water carrying is done by hand or head and on foot. Tractors are far too expensive and hi-tech, so oxen are the appropriate compromise. Groups of co-operating women are being encouraged to take out interest-free loans from Farm Africa with which to purchase two or four oxen together with basic equipment like a plough, a weeder and a cart. All these improvements are also being disseminated through the local government-employed extension service - one man who, lacking any other means of transport, has to walk from farm to farm over a vast area - and through the schools. As would be expected in a country where it is normal for families to have between five and ten children the schools are teeming with pupils. But they too have few resources and it is not unusual to find a ratio of one teacher to 90 or a 100 children. The schools do, however, usually have a few acres of land - as food production is the most crucial subject children can study. Time spent at this level, says Farm Africa, is a vital investment in the future. But the scale of the problem of rural poverty in Tanzania is immense. Of its 23m people it is estimated that 90 per cent are involved in agriculture - usually at subsistence level or worse. The population of the country is increasing at about 3 per cent each year and 50 per cent of Tanzanians are under 14 years of age. The socialist government, which has owned all the land since nationalisation in 1974 but is just beginning a modest programme of privatisation, claims there is plenty of land for the next generation. But there certainly is not enough in districts such as Babati and villages like Dareda. Each family has just 2 acres allocated by the government and to split these tiny holdings among the next generation would make subsistence for a family impossible. The answer, says the Tanzanian government, is to relocate to other areas of the country where the population is less dense. But the reasons so many are concentrated around Dareda is because it is a good farming area with relatively reliable rainfall. Conversely, the reason other areas are under-populated is because the land is poor and the rain unreliable. Clearly population control is an urgent priority. But the culture of the people is such that large families are seen as security for old age and there appears little inclination to tackle such a delicate subject. My farmers' assessment of the food supply situation in Tanzania is that it is a disaster waiting to happen. Poverty breeds population and wealth is denied to all but those who exploit the system. Corruption is admitted to be rife at all levels of government and business. Given the size of the problem Farm Africa's efforts seem puny. But at least it is starting at the right level and the tiny area in which it operates is already beginning to benefit from its efforts.</p>

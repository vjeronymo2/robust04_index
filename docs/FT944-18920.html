			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / RR ponders Korean ventures Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine and industrial power group, yesterday signed an agreement with the Korea Aerospace Research Institute to study possible joint collaboration in aero-engine programmes. The move coincides with a fierce competition between Rolls-Royce and its US rivals, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, to win a significant order to supply engines to power the new twin engine wide-body aircraft fleet of Korean Air Lines. The Korean flag carrier is expected to decide by early next year its choice of engines to equip the 30 Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 twin-engine airliners it has on firm order and option. Korea is also interested in developing with other Asian partners a new 100-seat regional jet.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / National strike over Portuguese pay award A NATIONAL one-day pay strike by Portugal's public-sector workers caused widespread disruption yesterday, although support was patchy, writes Patrick Blum in Lisbon. The strike appears to have been strongest in Lisbon, with public transport, schools and hospitals most affected. International air travellers faced cancellations and delays as ground staff walked out. Unions called the strike in protest at the government's imposition of an 8 per cent pay rise on more than 300,000 public administration employees, in line with its inflation forecast for the year. The strike went ahead despite an agreement last weekend with the moderate UGT union, raising its basic offer to about 10 per cent.</p>

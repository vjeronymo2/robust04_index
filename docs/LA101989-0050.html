			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> BOND RATING ON TROUBLED TRASH BURNER LOWERED  </P> <P> The feud surrounding Long Beach's troubled trash-to-energy incinerator this  week caught the attention of a prestigious New York financial institution which  downgraded the $170-million bond that funded the facility.  </P> <P> Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., which publishes financial data and rates bonds  according to their investment risks, demoted the bond one step -- from an A  rating to a BBB in its Oct. 16 publication.  </P> <P> The new rating marks the bond as a slightly more risky investment. A Standard  &amp; Poor's rating can substantially affect the value of a bond, investment  officials say.  </P> <P> The Terminal Island plant is embroiled in a controversy between its  Pittsburgh-based builder, Dravo Corp., and the city of Long Beach. The builder  contends that the facility is finished, but the city says it is full of flaws  and has refused to sign it off as complete. The builder last month expressed  his intention to sue the city as a result.  </P> <P> Standard &amp; Poor's cited the dispute as reason to believe the city is less  likely to pay off the bond debt on the Southeast Resource Recovery Facility,  known as SERRF.  </P> <P> But city officials expect the problems to be resolved within 30 days without  harm to the plant or the investors who funded its design and construction, said  Bill Davis, solid waste bureau manager.  </P> <P> "I think we have things well in hand to fix the plant and get on with our  lives," Davis said.  </P></p>

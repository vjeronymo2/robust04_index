			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ACCUSATION SPARKS RESIGNATION  </P> <P> Bob Heddleston, a University of Pittsburgh assistant athletic director and the  school's top athletic fund-raiser, resigned today after being accused of  forging a $300 check made out to a part-time cheerleading coach.  </P> <P> Heddleston's resignation came after an internal audit was initiated "following  a review of circumstances surrounding an alleged check forgery," Pitt Executive  Vice President Jack Freeman said.  </P> <P> An assistant director of athletics for development, Heddleston ran the Golden  Panthers, the athletic department's fund-raising arm, since 1976. He was  credited with raising about $15 million for athletic scholarships.  </P> <P> Freeman said today in a statement that on Nov. 9, Pitt Athletic Director Edward  Bozik learned that a check made out to Mike Nuzzo, the school's assistant  cheerleading coach, "might have been improperly endorsed and cashed through a  third party by Heddleston."  </P> <P> The check was reimbursement for a personal appearance, arranged by Heddleston,  that the cheerleaders made at Chauncy's, a Pittsburgh bar. It has not been  determined why the check was made out to Nuzzo rather than the cheerleaders.  </P></p>

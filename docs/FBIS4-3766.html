			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 25 (CNA)--Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang  [KMT] approved a package of ground-breaking constitution reform  proposals Sunday [24 April], paving the way for some key changes  in Taiwan politics.    One of the major reforms was a measure which allows direct  presidential and vice presidential elections in 1996.  Previously, Taiwan voters elected National Assembly members,  who in turn voted for the president.    The package was approved by an overwhelming majority during  a  special plenary session of the KMT's 214-member central  committee.    The central committee passed all proposals drafted by the  party's constitutional reform research task force except one  that would have restricted parliamentary speech by subjecting  legislators to libel laws.    The central committee also added another provision to the  reform proposals: that Republic of China [ROC] passport holders  living abroad would have the right to vote in future direct  elections for the president and vice president. The provision,  which was not in the party's original reform proposals, was  proposed by former Premier Li Huan during the session and put to  a vote.    Li's proposal garnered 108 votes, one vote more than the  minimum required for it to be incorporated into the party's  final amendment proposals.    The KMT reform package will be further discussed by the  National Assembly when it begins a three-month constitutional  reform session later this week.    The approved package also extends the terms of legislators  from three to four years, allows the president to appoint and  dismiss senior government officials without the approval of the  premier, and creates the post of speaker and vice speaker in the  National Assembly.</p>

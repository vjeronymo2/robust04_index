			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Canadian bank chief warns on rates rise The head of Canada's central bank told the Senate banking committee in Ottawa yesterday he had no target level for the Canadian dollar but that interest rates could rise again, following Tuesday's increase, if there were signs of a loss of confidence, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The Canadian dollar has been under pressure since recent rises in US short-term interest rates. On Tuesday the Bank of Canada lifted the bank rate by 78 basis points to 5 per cent after the US Federal Reserve tightened US rates by a further quarter point. The Canadian dollar dropped from about 74 US cents to 73.03 cents on Monday. It firmed to 73.16 cents after the interest rate increase, but yesterday it slipped back to below 73 cents. Mr Gordon Thiessen said the Canadian economy's fundamentals pointed to strengthening recovery. But it was too early to predict how long market volatility would last.</p>

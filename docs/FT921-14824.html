			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Appointments: The power to attract expats SCOTTISHPOWER, the electricity company privatised in June, has made Murray Stuart its non-executive deputy chairman. Stuart, 58, recently resigned as chief executive of Berisford, the food, commodities and property group, having brought it back from the brink of liquidation in 18 months. Stuart, who became a director of ScottishPower in 1990, was formerly chairman of MB Group, previously known as Metal Box. He is to work closely with Sir Donald Miller, chairman, and Ian Preston, chief executive, on developing ScottishPower's corporate strategy. This will mean spending two days a week in Scotland and Stuart, who lives in Surrey, says he will soon be buying a property there. Although he says he is soon to take up another appointment in England he indicates that he could eventually follow the path of many an expatriate Scot (he was born in Glasgow, educated at Glasgow Academy and Glasgow University and is an accountant by training) and return to his native land. Neither he nor ScottishPower has anything to say on suggestions that he might be groomed to succeed Miller, 64.</p>

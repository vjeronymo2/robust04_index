			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CZECH COMMUNISTS REGROUP FOR ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> PRAGUE: POLITICAL PARTIES MUSHROOM AS CIVIC FORUM WRITES ELECTION LAWS. THE KEY  WILL BE WHICH ONE WINS PARLIAMENT IN JUNE BALLOTING.  </P> <P> In the second month of what has been dubbed Czechoslovakia's "velvet  revolution," the action, though off the streets, is no less contentious. Civic  Forum has won several important battles. But the Communists have not  surrendered. In various mutations, they are regrouping to mount an electoral  challenge that could frustrate the plans of the country's new leaders.  </P> <P> The People's Militia, the Communist Party's private security force since 1948,  has been disarmed and disbanded. But when its armory was cracked open in a  munitions plant at Vlasim, a small town 25 miles south of Prague, its 98  registered submachine guns were missing.  </P> <P> Such episodes keep people in Prague on edge, especially after the slaughter in  Romania. Civic Forum unquestionably controls the high grounds of power,  including the presidency and the government, which has a non-Communist  majority. More important, non-Communists control such key ministries as Foreign  Affairs and the Interior.  </P> <P> During round-table discussions on the composition of the current government,  the Interior Ministry was the chief bone of contention. Civic Forum insisted  that it be headed by a non-Communist, a demand unacceptable to the Communists.  The ministry was eventually put under the joint supervision of Prime Minister  Marian Calfa (a Communist), Deputy Prime Minister Valtr Komarek (a Communist  supported by Civic Forum) and Jan Carnogursky (a non-Communist).  </P> <P> But as soon as Vaclav Havel became president, he went one step further by  appointing Richard Sacher, leader of the non-Communist People's Party and  minister without portfolio, to do the job. For the first time in Eastern  Europe's leapfrogging revolutions, the Interior Ministry fell into  non-Communist hands.  </P> <P> Sacher will be looking for more than 98 missing submachine guns. Three of the  ministry's security units, totaling about 6,000 troops, have also disappeared.  During the Prague Spring of 1968, no trace of a similar security force could be  found. It emerged only after the Warsaw Pact invaded Czechoslovakia, having  "wintered" in Poland. Preliminary reports suggest that at least one of the  missing units has surfaced in Romania.  </P> <P> The Defense Ministry is run by the Communist general Miroslav Vacek. He is  seriously committed to depoliticizing the army and is already cleaning up his  top command. Even before Havel was elected president by Parliament, Premier  Calfa, exercising his powers as acting president, dismissed four generals from  the army's top command, no doubt on Vacek's recommendation.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, political parties are mushrooming. About a dozen have announced  formation in the press, or at least on the walls of Prague's study hall of  democracy -- the subway stations. The conservative Christian Democrats are the  first to have won parliamentary representation. But the fragmentation of the  non-Communist vote could potentially lead to brittle coalition governments.  This represents an electoral danger for the non-Communists.  </P> <P> Another danger is the Communist Party in its several new guises. Its  politicians are rudderless, but the party's provincial apparatus is virtually  intact.  </P> <P> The bosses in Vlasim represent the main body of the party, halfheartedly  struggling with its Stalinist legacy. They still argue that demonstrating  students were insufficiently beaten on Nov. 17 and encourage each other to hang  in there for another month, when the tide may turn in their favor.  </P> <P> Then there is the Democratic Communist Forum, a "liberal" faction that might  spin off as a separate, second Communist Party, possibly linking up with the  Obroda ("Rebirth") club, a political home for liberal Communists expelled after  1969.  </P> <P> There may even be a third Communist Party in the form of the Czechoslovak  Agricultural Party. It is wooing the farm vote, roughly 15% of the electorate.  Its sponsor is the behemoth agro-industrial complex of Slusovice, South  Moravia, and its chairman is Frantisek Cuba. The Slusovice company was the  darling of the ancien regime, managing to grow to a size unheard of in  Czechoslovak agriculture, with assets of about $200 million.  </P> <P> Ladislav Adamec, the former Czechoslovak premier and now chairman of the  Communist Party, views the Agricultural Party as his natural ally: "The fate of  the Communist Party is not hopeless," he said recently on TV, referring to the  possibility of a post-election coalition with what, in effect, would be  "agro-Communists."  </P> <P> Even such a coalition would probably not give the Communists control over  Parliament, but it could make trouble. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the  countryside is more conservative than the cities. Rural chapters of Civic Forum  face tough going. Keeping the pig in the sty is frequently more important than  challenging the local party boss -- whether clad in red or in green. The role  of the agro-Communists will become much clearer in the wake of their first  congress, held Saturday.  </P> <P> Parliamentary elections may be held on June 8, and enactment of an electoral  law is expected before the end of this month. Civic Forum is unlikely to go  into the elections as a political party, but the sitting Parliament will pass  any electoral law that Civic Forum drafts. The conservativism of the  countryside might be addressed by creating only two electoral districts for the  entire country -- the Czech lands and Slovakia. Civic Forum will probably wind  up backing a slate of people but each candidate will appear under the name of  his or her respective party.  </P> <P> Having won the first battle for power-sharing and the second for control of the  government and the presidency, the non-Communists are unlikely to lose the  third -- Parliament. Then they will face the toughest battle of all: reviving  the economy.  </P></p>

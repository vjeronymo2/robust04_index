			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Volatile trade in Reckitt CONSUMER products and healthcare group Reckitt &amp; Colman was down after a volatile trading session as analysts cut current-year earnings forecasts. The shares opened lower after Reckitt announced 1991 profits of Pounds 252.3m against Pounds 235.17m previously, but at the bottom end of predictions. They then appeared oversold and climbed as high as 660p as buyers moved in. However, at the post-results meeting the company signalled growth of about 10 per cent in 1992 compared with the expectations of between 12 and 13 per cent. Analysts left the meeting to adjust their 1992 forecasts and the share price dropped to end the session a net 6 off at 640p after 2.7m shares traded, a heavy turnover for the stock. Smith New Court trimmed its estimate by Pounds 5m to Pounds 275m and Nomura Research came back by Pounds 20m to the same figure. Smith New Court expects less acquisition-led growth for Reckitt, and Mr Didier Cowling of Nomura is basing his forecast reduction on the slow economic recovery. However, he added that the company's strategy was sound and he expected to become a buyer of the stock. Kingfisher rises Better than expected profits and an upgrading of 1993 forecasts by analysts boosted Kingfisher, the holding company of several leading high street chains. The shares rose 7 to 487p on profits before exceptional items of Pounds 221.8m, against Pounds 215.3m previously. The market was looking for a figure of around Pounds 210m, and Goldman Sachs has now revised its estimate for next year to Pounds 246m from Pounds 232m, while Nomura has upgraded to Pounds 240m from Pounds 235m. Mr Ian Macdougall at Nomura said B &amp; Q remains the key to the group's immediate future and that the effect of price cutting in the DIY sector remains an open issue. Mr Geoffrey Mulcahy, Kingfisher's chairman and chief executive, admitted that there was fierce competition in the DIY market, and speaking of recent price promotions said 'we did not make money out of them'. Wellcome strong Buying continued in Wellcome ahead of the interim results, due today. Analysts believe that the figures will be encouraging, particularly prior to the planned release of shares by majority owner Wellcome Trust. Financial observers are also advising clients to buy in case shareholders are given preferential rights to the placing. Nomura Research is preparing a hefty research document, which is expected to raise estimates for long-term growth prospects. The shares ended 21 stronger at 799p. Initial disappointment with Lasmo's end-of-year results was dispelled after post-figures meetings with analysts and institutions and the shares recovered from a fall of 15 to close only a penny easier on the day at 203p. The results were expected to be poor and were not helped by accounting changes. Mr Peter Hitchens of Lehman Brothers summed up the feeling of many when he said: 'There is plenty of upside potential in the shares.' Mr Keith Morris at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken said the bits of Ultramar that Lasmo was going to retain are 'first class'. Cable and Wireless recovered 11 to 543p as Hoare Govett put the case that they had been oversold. The shares fell sharply late last week after C and W announced a provision of Pounds 50m for restructuring. C and W is to discuss the fall in the share price with financial observers tomorrow. Ahead of today's announcement on bid acceptances, Redland rose 10 to 445p, while Steetley, its takeover target, gained 6 to 372p in volume of 1.7m. Dealers said they expected Redland to emerge triumphant from the bid battle, but the result would be closer than many had been predicting. Leading property shares bounced after a recent bout of weakness. British Land improved 7 to 194p, Great Portland Estates 8 to 151p, Hammerson ordinary 15 to 464p and MEPC 12 to 329p. Barratt Development's return to profitability pushed the stock 8 higher to 65p. Tarmac and Lonrho eased as the takeover speculation that lifted them sharply last week began to fade. Tarmac, which rose sharply on talk that Luxembourg-based Minorco would make a bid, slipped 6 to 131p. Lonrho, up recently on talk that Hanson was interested in a friendly deal, fell 4 to 103p. Following its recent results and Volvo franchise loss, Lex Service has been touted as a possible bid candidate, and further speculation yesterday saw the shares climb 8 to 194p. British Aerospace advanced 7 to 298p on talk that Saudi Arabia may buy Tornado aircraft in preference to American F-15s. Poor US car figures depressed TI Group, down 9 at 645p. Weir Group put on 5 to 509p ahead of today's figures. The fall in Harland Simon continued, the shares losing 15 to 83p as investors again deserted the troubled group. Best performers among the brewing giants were Guinness, up 17 at 580p on 4m shares traded, and Allied-Lyons, 12 ahead at 620p on turnover of 1.1m. The former was boosted by confirmation that Mr Warren Buffett, of Salomon Brothers and also chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has taken a stake in the company. In a letter to shareholders Mr Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway had bought Dollars 264.8m worth of Guinness shares in 1991, representing our 'first significant investment in a company outside the US'. Analysts said Allied was marked up in sympathy with Guinness. Medeva jumped 18 to 288p after the pharmaceuticals group announced 1991 profits at the top end of expectations and doubled the dividend to 1.5p. The shares were also helped by enthusiastic buying from the US. An old rumour that Eurotunnel would join Euro Disney as the latest recruit to the CAC 40 index in Paris lifted the former 8 to 430p. Following Tuesday's downgrade by Goldman Sachs, Euro Disney slipped a further 50 to 1540p. Shipping and property group P &amp; O's shares continued to respond strongly to Tuesday's preliminary statement, adding 25 at 441p for a two-day jump of 57. A positive note from County NatWest helped Midland Bank, which recently announced that it is merging with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, to buck early weakness in the market and close 3 higher at 346p. Mr John Aitken, County's banks specialist, argued that Midland shareholders 'should get a full price for their shares; we feel that would be in excess of 400p'.

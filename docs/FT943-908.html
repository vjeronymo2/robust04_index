			<p>940927 FT  27 SEP 94 / Observer: Token tip How nice of Hodder Headline to cut the price of its hardbacks by pulling out of the net book agreement. What a pity the price-slashing will happen from Boxing Day - ie, well after the biggest annual spend on books. Observer's tip: give everyone book tokens this Christmas. And what was the book Tim Hely Hutchinson, Hodder Headline's chief executive, chose to help publicise his decision to withdraw from the price-rigging? Lilley &amp; Chase, a novel set against the background of publishing, by Tim Waterstone, founder of the Waterstone bookshop chain  - and a noted supporter of the net book agreement. And who illustrated the jacket cover? T'other Tim's brother - Nicholas Hely Hutchinson. Incestuous business, the book trade.</p>

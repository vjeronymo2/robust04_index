			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEMPORARY CURBS SET ON HILLSIDE HOMES  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday imposed temporary restrictions on  single-family home construction in an eight-mile stretch of the Santa Monica  Mountains where city officials say building on narrow roads has created safety  problems.  </P> <P> The restrictions, proposed by Councilmen Michael Woo and Zev Yaroslavsky, are  expected to severely limit home construction on the hillsides south of  Mulholland Drive between the San Diego Freeway and Outpost Drive, covering an  area from Bel-Air to the Hollywood Hills. They will be in place for a year  while officials draft permanent controls for the area.  </P> <P> The restrictions, which affect projects submitted to the Department of Building  and Safety since Dec. 1, 1988, do not apply to renovations of existing homes.  Projects are also exempt if they meet various setback, parking, fire safety and  street access requirements, and if the owner agrees to join any future benefit  assessment district set up to improve roads.  </P> <P> Fire officials say the restrictions are necessary because building on remote  and unwieldy hillside lots has made it difficult for fire trucks and ambulances  to reach some victims.  </P></p>

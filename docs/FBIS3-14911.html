Kondratyev assessed the talks: I faced no problems in  Armenia. The Armenian side, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, agrees  to fully implement the Moscow agreement and cease fire as of 1  March. I am leaving for Baku today. I hope to receive a  similar reply there. It could be stated that a first step  leading to peace is being taken. Russia, Kondratyev noted, will  terminate its mediatory mission if Azerbaijan refuses to  implement or disagrees with any of the provisions of the  agreement. After all, both the Armenians and the Azerbaijanis  are longing for the war to end.    He also noted that the planned visit to Stepanakert was not  possible due to weather conditions. But the deputy defense  minister assured that he will be there at the first opportunity.</p>

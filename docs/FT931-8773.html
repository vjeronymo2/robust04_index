			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Cigna records fourth-quarter earnings fall CIGNA, one of the largest composite insurance companies in the US, yesterday announced a sharp drop in fourth quarter earnings to Dollars 50m, down from Dollars 108m a year earlier, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. Full year 1992 profits of Dollars 311m were also well down on the previous year, when the company earned Dollars 449m, although the latest results were depressed by a Dollars 26m charge to cover the adoption of new accounting standards. Cigna's earnings would have been considerably worse but for realised investment gains, which brought in Dollars 19m in the fourth quarter and Dollars 192m in the year. Investment gains in 1991 netted only Dollars 52m. The company said its property and casualty operations incurred a loss of Dollars 374m last year, despite investment gains of Dollars 111m.</p>

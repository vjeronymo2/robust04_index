			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall as focus returns to inflation fears US Treasury prices weakened at the long end of the maturity range yesterday in the wake of higher oil prices and bearish comments from a Federal Reserve governor. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/16 at 95 25/32 , yielding 7.862 per cent. Prices at the short end fell slightly, with the two-year note off  1/16 at 99 13/16 , to yield 6.584 per cent. In the absence of fresh economic statistics, attention was focused primarily on inflation fears and US monetary policy. Prices firmed slightly in early trading amid rumours that the Fed's vice-chairman had told a Japanese newspaper there would be no more tightening of US policy this year. The rumours, however, proved unfounded, and prices later retreated after Ms Susan Phillips, a Fed governor, said the US economy was growing at a 'surprising' pace. This was bearish for the bond market, which remains fearful the Fed will soon raise interest rates again to restrain economic growth. Investor concerns about another rate rise have also been exacerbated by the recent weakness in the dollar, which remained in a sickly condition. Another factor depressing bonds was the price of oil, which climbed for the second consecutive day amid what appeared to be a wider, general trend toward firmer commodity prices. European government bonds eased on profit-taking after Monday's rally, and some traders said the markets were set for a period of consolidation. In Germany, which led Monday's gains, the 10-year sector weakened by around  1/4 point. The December bund futures contract on Liffe was quoted at around 90.75 in late trading, down 0.29 point on the day. Having rallied substantially before Sunday's elections, and then continuing their gains on Monday, bunds ran out of steam yesterday in the absence of news or capital flows. 'Bunds have had a very good run and are in for a period of consolidation or even a slight correction,' said a trader in London. However, dealers said bunds were underpinned by technical factors in the futures market, where many see 90.50 as strong support. Moreover, dealers hope that money supply data, expected in the next few days or early next week, may show a further deceleration in M3 growth, lifting hopes of another easing in monetary policy. French bonds again did worse than their German counterparts, as investors continued switching out of France into Germany, traders said. The French market remains dogged by political uncertainty ahead of next year's presidential elections. The yield spread on French 10-year bonds over bunds widened by another two basis points to 70 basis points. UK gilts followed the rest of Europe, with the December long gilt future ending down  13/32 at 102. The Bank of England announced the terms of next Wednesday's gilt auction for Pounds 2.5bn of a new 8 per cent gilt due 2000. The terms were largely in line with market expectations, although some dealers said they had anticipated a slightly higher coupon. Although sentiment has not turned negative, some observers expect the market to consolidate in the near future. 'In the run-up to the auction the market may come under a bit of downward pressure,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. Shrugging off weakness in most markets, Swedish government bonds posted small gains on a hawkish inflation report by the Riksbank. They were also encouraged by comments from the new finance minister, Mr Goran Persson indicating that, in addition to the SKr61bn savings plan announced before the elections, the government aimed to undertake further fiscal tightening in January through further spending cuts. Dealers also welcomed the make-up of the central bank's new policy board, which was seen likely to urge the government to maintain its course of fiscal tightening.</p>

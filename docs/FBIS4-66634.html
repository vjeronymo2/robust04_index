			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Arms for Pakistan"] </F>   [Text] The Clinton administration's proposal to resume the  supply of arms to Pakistan threatens not just the military  balance in the south Asian region, but also India's move towards  economic liberalisation and reform. While the reports on the  U.S. government's thinking on providing a "one-time" waiver to  the Pressler amendment, which bars military sales to Islamabad,  have focussed on the nuclear-capable F-16 aircraft, the effect  of the exemption will have a wider and more drastic impact. This  is because, in addition to the 71 F-16s already paid for, there  are three Harpoon-armed P3C Orion maritime surveillance  aircraft, along with a variety of electronic warfare equipment,  that could also become eligible for shipment. Adding 71  fourth-generation fighters like the F-16s to the 37 that  Islamabad already has will tilt the balance of air power against  India since it has at present only some 45 aircraft of  equivalent capability in the form of Mirage 2000s.    Perhaps the most questionable aspect of the Clinton  administration's proposal is that, notwithstanding the failure  that necessitated the 1990 application of the Pressler amendment  in the first place, it is once again being projected as a means  of curbing Pakistan's nuclear ambitions. The F-16s are capable  of delivering nuclear weapons; in effect what the U.S. is  proposing to do is to provide Islamabad with 71 aircraft  equipped with a variety of electronic means to penetrate the  adversaries' air space and deliver nuclear weapons on target  with great accuracy. This makes a mockery of Washington's claim  that it is seeking to freeze and "roll back" nuclear weapons'  programmes in the region, and indeed the world. It also scoffs  at the U.S. law which in 1990 barred arms sales to Pakistan when  the White House found itself unable to certify that Islamabad  did not possess a nuclear explosive device. Another factor which  merits consideration is that the American move will seriously  jeopardise the economic reform process in India. In the early  1980s when it had to counterbalance the U.S. arms package to  Pakistan, India exercised the option of acquiring high-quality  equipment at threshold prices from the erstwhile Soviet Union.  Though the purchase was made in favourable deferred rupee terms,  it took India's defence expenditures to new highs, peaking at  some four per cent of the GDP in 1986-87. Following the  dissolution of its ally, India has faced great difficulty in  maintaining the equipment, but it could take a relatively  relaxed stance knowing that, with the Pressler amendment in  force, Pakistan, too, was similarly handicapped. As a result,  defence expenditures declined, and from 1990 onwards have been  dipping below the figure of three per cent of the GDP. This  helped India to implement its programme of economic  restructuring and liberalisation, which is beginning to show  results. Earlier this year, the finance minister was able to  announce that the country would repay its IMF loan ahead of  schedule. Recently the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao,  noted that the new American arms package to Pakistan could cause  India to re-think its defence policy. If India is forced on this  path, not only will it not be able to repay the IMF loan, but  perhaps be compelled to incur more debts.</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Gardening: Overcome by enemy action - How Robin Lane Fox's vegetables succumbed to stealthy invaders THE LITTLE man is always supposed to be the loser and, this summer, I see why. After a long absence, vegetables have returned to my garden in a new mood of self-supply. Like all beginnings, it has been a small one: a few bushes of currants, patterns of salad plants and herbs, a few unusual desirables, and some of the good old friends which English kitchens have used for years. The beginning began two months ago and it ought to be harvested by now. Unfortunately, the enemy have seen a small man coming and beaten me to my output. They have savaged, bitten and generally behaved in ways which defy my university's code of non-harassing conduct. Worse, these harassers are unwanted guests. At present, I suspect hedgehogs, because they are the most visible presence, moving to and fro from the swimming pool to the lower garden. You might wonder if a hedgehog could ever be so beastly as to eat another person's young spinach. I think I have evidence of their malice: from time to time one of their relations turns up, prickles down, in the swimming pool, and I suspect that it is one of their less popular kin which they have pushed into the chlorine. I am pretty sure the squirrels have been involved somehow, possibly because they have intercepted the latest sound waves from the kitchen. I have re-discovered a promising recipe for squirrel baked in cider. It sounds wonderfully cheap, and they are not going to escape by this pre-emptive strike against my winter greenery. Into the pastry, you can prop a bushy squirrel tail for decoration, like Squirrel Nutkin's rear view on his raft across to the island. Lentil-eating urban visitors believe that foxes are behind the trouble, financed by well-wishers from a non-hunting co-operative. Recently, something has started to go to ground beside my retired timber-framed Morris, but the only sighting by daylight in the area has been a friendly badger. Naturally, pigeons are in the vanguard because they can be seen, practising spot landing in the purple sprouting. One of the garden's functions is to serve as a safe haven for refugees under gunfire from the nearby estates. Pheasants may have roughed up the courgettes but I have yet to see French partridges among the haricots verts. The possible enemies are, simply, too many to control. The Guides to Green Gardening know best, as always, and one of them has told me to solve the problem by putting out saucers of milk at nightfall because the visitors will surely prefer milk to mixed greens. Actually, they prefer cabbage au lait. I suppose I could start shooting, and I would like to know if the back legs of a grey squirrel can be punctured by pellets from an air gun. Meanwhile, I have a protest and a helpful observation. The protest is a small man's lament. Why do birds eat gardener's fruits, slugs eat their young cauliflowers and rabbits polish off the transplants whereas you can see whole fields of raspberries all over Kent with no nets in sight, covered in fruit and open for picking your own? Slugs never bother big fields of kale and you never see snail holes in those gleaming fields of cabbage on the dark earth round Biggleswade. Faced with abundance, animal pests behave like humans and go for smallness, not because small is beautiful but because they must be absolute swine at heart. They are much less of a bother in big kitchen gardens. One reason might be that they, too, are brought up on the story of Peter Rabbit and are scared of Mr MacGregor's cat: my view, simply, is that pests pick on the small man because they feel at ease with the scale. There could, however, be a way out which, in turn, might be exacerbating the problem. When last I grew vegetables, early in the 1970s, people were telling us to store turnips against the imminent takeover by the Trades Union Congress; brassicas were thought to be a safer investment than Glaxo in the gloom of the three-day week; and financial advisers were even more vegetable than usual. Since the 1970s, the vegetable portfolio has changed. In the 1990s, everyone wants basil, not beetroot; pak choi, not parsnips; and Raymond Blanc now spells rocket with a q. Supermarkets will sell almost anything exotic at any time of year, but few of them stock asparagus peas. And if you want your own roquette, you have to look in the Vegetable Finder and send away for seed. Taste and defence, I now notice, are coinciding. Birds eat the small man's cherries and slugs spoil his spring cabbage but, so far, the sorrel for his designer soup is more or less safe. I have concluded that animal harassers do not like designer vegetables: whoever saw a rabbit eating okra in the wild? On a kinder view, human fashion could explain my predicament. Frustrated by all that basil in the suburbs, the vissiting harassers can hardly have been expected to behave themselves when a small man returned to production, growing old-fashioned lettuces in country lines. After all that Lollo Rosso in north Oxford, can I really blame them if they go straight for a good old English salad and beat me to the first of my Little Gem?</p>

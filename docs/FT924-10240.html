			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Lufthansa pulls out of race for Continental Airlines LUFTHANSA, the German state airline, yesterday pulled out of the race to buy Continental Airlines just days before the November 9 deadline for final bids. Lufthansa said it had not been able to clarify all the 'open issues' concerning the bid for the US carrier, which has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since 1990. The withdrawal is a blow to Lufthansa's strategy to forge international links in response to alliances in recent years by British Airways, Air France and KLM, the Dutch carrier. It said it would renew efforts to seek a partner to improve its share of the North Atlantic market. The big three US carriers - American, United and Delta - have also been aggressively expanding their European operations. Lufthansa's biggest threat has come from Atlanta-based Delta, which last year acquired Pan Am's European routes and Frankfurt hub. It also has to see through a restructuring proposed in September to cut operating losses expected to rise to DM1.2bn (Pounds 480m) this year from DM800m. The airline and Mr Marvin Davis, a Los Angeles-based billionaire, offered to buy Continental in September for Dollars 100m in cash and Dollars 300m of corporate bonds. Their departure from the bidding comes less than three weeks after the withdrawal of another group, Benefit Concepts, of New York which was designing a Dollars 425m offer based on employee share ownership schemes. The bids by Benefit Concepts and Lufthansa were the highest and the second highest respectively of offers on the table. Three bidders remain: an investor group headed by Mr Charles Hurwitz, a Texas-based businessman, an offer from Mr Alfredo Bresner, whose family owns a large stake in Mexicana Airlines, and an offer from Air Canada with another Texan investment group. All three proposals are similar in design and to Lufthansa's defunct bid. The investors would put up cash in return for a majority equity stake in the carrier once it emerged from bankruptcy, with creditors being offered a minority interest. This would be done in conjunction with the airline's reorganisation plan.</p>

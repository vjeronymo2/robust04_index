			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Guidelines on arms 'pushed' says Hurd Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday invoked British trade interests to justify the government's decision to approve the export of machine tools less than two weeks before the invasion of Kuwait, in spite of intelligence warnings that they could be used in weapons making. Mr Hurd, giving evidence to the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry, said a ministerial meeting he chaired on June 19 1990 had taken into account the potential competition from other European countries. The decision also followed the relaxation of international regulations on the sale of western technology to former Communist countries. 'We felt the time had come to change our policy, that the the circumstances had changed and we should stir ourselves to pursue one of our objectives, which was to promote trade,' Mr Hurd said. Challenged by Lord Justice Scott on whether the decision amounted to the government breaching its own guidelines, Mr Hurd said: 'It was certainly pushing them to the limit.' Mr Hurd unflinchingly defended the government's position. 'I would not accept there was a deliberate bending of the rules or that there was a conniving (by ministers and officials) in undermining a publicly stated policy,' he said. He argued that while shortcomings may have been identified by the inquiry, the evidence was still 'light years from the suggestion made by the media that ministers were secretly arming Iraq or indulging in some wicked conspiracy'. Mr Hurd also backed the decision of his junior minister, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, to sign a public interest immunity certificate seeking to prevent the disclosure of government documents during the Matrix Churchill trial. He said the decision had been wrongly interpreted by the media as an attempt to save the government from embarrassment and deliberately designed to 'result in the conviction of people who were known to be innocent'. The hearing continues today.</p>

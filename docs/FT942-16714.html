			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Ransomes to pay overdue preference Ransomes yesterday decided to pay its long overdue convertible preference share dividend and also launched an attack on Steinhardt Partners, the US hedge fund manager which has bought 30 per cent of the engineering company's preference shares. Mr Peter Wilson, Ransomes' chief executive, said proposals it had received from Steinhardt for a recapitalisation of the company, involving conversion of the preference shares into ordinary shares, were 'totally unacceptable'. He said the terms proposed by Steinhardt were too favourable to the US hedge fund and damaged the interests of holders of the ordinary shares. Mr Wilson said he had no doubt he had the backing of shareholders and the group's main bank lenders, led by Barclays, for his rejection of the Steinhardt approach. If Ransomes had failed to pay the preference share dividend by the end of the month, the preference shares would have become voting securities, giving Steinhardt 15 per cent of votes in the company. However, Mr Wilson denied that the decision to pay the dividend of 4.125p per share, at a total cost of Pounds 2.3m, was in any way related to Steinhardt's acquisition of the stake over the past two months. He said payment had been made because the company's trading performance had improved in the first quarter of the year and the order book was strong. Ransomes had got the approval of its banks, which include National Westminster Bank and France's Societe Generale, before paying the dividend, he said. The group, a leader in the manufacture of grass-cutting equipment, had borrowings of Pounds 75m at the end of last year and made pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.9m in 1993. Mr Wilson said the group was working on its own proposals to reduce the excessive burden of its debts, but had not yet decided a strategy. The convertible preference share price yesterday rose from 65.5p to 76p, compared with the average price paid by Steinhardt for its stake of 55p.</p>

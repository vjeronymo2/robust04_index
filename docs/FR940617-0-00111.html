Legal Authority and Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Authority for the actions in this notice is granted to EPA by sections 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 213, 215, 216, and 301 of the Clean Air Act as amended (42 U.S.C. 7521, 7522, 7523, 7524, 7525, 7541, 7542, 7543, 7547, 7549, 7550, 7601(a)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) were enacted in order to broaden and strengthen the CAA. While the CAA had long specifically authorized EPA regulation of on-highway vehicle and engine emissions, the 1990 amendments extended EPA's authority to regulate nonroad vehicles and engines. Specifically, revised section 213 directs EPA to: (1) Conduct a study of emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles; (2) determine whether emissions of CO, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from nonroad engines and vehicles are significant contributors to ozone or CO in more than one area which has failed to attain the NAAQS for ozone or CO; and (3) regulate those categories or classes of new nonroad engines and vehicles that contribute to such air pollution if nonroad emissions are determined to be significant. EPA may also regulate other emissions from new nonroad engines or vehicles if the Agency determines that they contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Finally, EPA is to regulate emissions from new locomotives by 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Nonroad Engine and Vehicle Emission Study required by section 213(a)(1) was completed in November 1991. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The purpose of this final rule is to implement section 213(a) (2), (3), (4), and (5) by determining that emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles are significant contributors to ozone and CO nonattainment and by promulgating regulations containing standards applicable to emissions from certain nonroad engines and vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Nonroad Study is available in the docket for this rulemaking. It is also available through the National Technical Information Service, referenced as document PB 92&hyph;126960.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Determination of Significance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 213(a)(2) of the CAA provides that after notice and public comment, EPA is to determine, based on the Nonroad Engine and Vehicle Emission Study (hereafter called the Nonroad Study), whether nonroad emissions are significant contributors to ozone or CO in more than one nonattainment area. Based on the results of the Nonroad Study and consideration of the public comments discussed below, EPA is finalizing its proposed affirmative significance determination in today's rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of commenters did not address EPA's proposed determination of significance. Of those who did, most were in opposition, including organizations representing equipment manufacturers and users. Expressing support for the determination were some engine manufacturers, state and local organizations and environmental groups. A summary of comments is found in the Response to Comments document contained in the docket for this rule. Major comments are discussed below, accompanied by EPA's response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Use of the EKMA Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters stated that EPA had not adequately demonstrated a significant contribution to ozone or CO nonattainment from nonroad engines or vehicles, as directed by the Act. These commenters argued that EPA had shown only the nonroad contribution to ozone precursor and CO emission inventories, and not the nonroad contribution to ozone formation or ozone and CO nonattainment. Some commenters questioned EPA's use of the Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach (EKMA model) as the basis for its air quality analysis, and they suggested that EPA should have used a grid-based air quality model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Japanese bank raises DM600m with 10-year issue Export-Import Bank of Japan made its first appearance in the D-Mark sector of the international bond market yesterday when it raised DM600m through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds. The proceeds of the offering were swapped into dollars and the borrower was thought to have achieved its ambitious funding target of 10 to 15 basis points below Libor. Exim's bonds were priced to yield 18 basis points over German government bonds (bunds), reflecting the borrower's triple-A rating and its rarity value in the market. Lead manager IBJ said the bonds sold quickly in spite of the weakness in the bund market. Demand from investors in south-east Asia and in continental Europe, excluding Germany, was particularly strong, IBJ said. When the bonds were freed to trade, they eased to 98.80 bid from a re-offer price of 99.035 but the fall was far smaller than the half-point drop in bunds. The spread on the bonds tightened to 16 basis points at one stage in the afternoon. The weakness in the German government bond market is unlikely to dissuade more borrowers from launching D-Mark Eurobond issues. Depfa, the German mortgage bank, plans to make its large big Eurobond offering of the year, a DM1bn issue of 10-year Eurobonds, within the next two weeks. The mandate is likely to be awarded jointly to a German bank and an American bank. Depfa is aiming for a yield spread on the bonds of 25-26 basis points over the 6 per cent bund due 2003. Cable &amp; Wireless's well-flagged Dollars 400m offering of 10-year Eurobonds is due to be launched today and could well be the last big corporate Eurodollar offering of the year. The bonds, via JP Morgan, are likely to be priced to yield between 70 and 75 basis points over US Treasuries.</p>

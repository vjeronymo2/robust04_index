			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 25 (XINHUA) -- The two-month-old  minority cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata resigned en  masse today in a bid to break the current impasse in the  volatile, unpredicatable Japanese politics.    At a hastily-called press conference, the 58-year-old prime  minister said that he would quit together with his ministers.    Hata announced the cabinet resignation just hours before the  House of Representatives was to convene a plenary session to  vote on a no-confidence motion tabled by the leading opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The Hata administration was  believed almost certain to lose the vote.    He said the decision aims to avoid a "political vacuum" at a  time when Japan faces a host of domestic and international  challenges.    "It is an urgent task to form a stable government. We will  entrust the formation of a new government to the will of the  Diet (parliament)," Hata told the press conference.    "If the House of Representatives is dissolved, there will be  a political vacuum in the nation and therefore dealing with the  yen's rise and other issues will become impossible," he said.  "I want to avoid a political vacuum by every means."    Ruling coalition leaders, in making the decision to disband  the cabinet at a meeting earlier in the day, agreed to allow the  two largest parties, the LDP and the Social Democratic Party  (SDP), to create a new coalition government.    Coalition and SDP leaders failed to iron out their  differences in the past two days of on-and-off talks on the  socialists' rejoining the governing bloc.    Coalition leaders rejected the SDP's demand that the Hata  cabinet voluntarily resign, and instead opted to face the  no-confidence motion.    Last night, sentiment emerged within the ruling camp that  Hata should dissolve the lower house if the motion was passed,  and Hata himself reportedly hinted at his readiness to do so.    Under Japan's constitutional rules, the prime minister  should  either disband his cabinet or dissolve the lower house for a  snap election within 10 days after a no-confidence motion  against him clears the Diet.    But the situation changed overnight when the ruling  coalition  decided to meet the SDP's demand. The development left Japan  watchers here with feelings that Japanese politics is really a  changeable, unpredictable, and sometimes mysterious world.    The Hata government was formed on April 28 after its  predecessor, headed by Japan New Party leader Morihiro Hosokawa,  collapsed in a protracted row over Hosokawa's alleged financial  improprieties.    The SDP was the largest contingent in the Hosokawa coalition  which was formed after last July's general election that toppled  the LDP after its 38 years of uninterrupted rule.    But the socialists walked out of the ruling bloc after the  formation within the coalition of the parliamentary group,  Kaishin, which excluded the SDP.</p>

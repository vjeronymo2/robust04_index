Fishermen must complete an entry on the report/log form each day they fish. Marine mammal report/log forms require information on: The fishery, fishing effort, gear type and fish species involved; the marine mammal species (or description of the animal(s), if species is not known), number, date, and location of marine mammal incidental takes; type of interaction and any injury to the marine mammal; a description of any intentional takes (i.e., efforts to deter animals to protect gear, catch, or human life by non-lethal or lethal means); and any loss of fish or gear caused by marine mammals. With prior approval by the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries Service, alternate report/log forms, such as forms issued by individual states, Fishery Management Councils, or Indian Governments, which collect the same information required by the National Marine Fisheries Service, are acceptable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A current report/log must be kept on board and must be made available for inspection upon request by any state or Federal enforcement agent authorized to enforce the Act or any designated agent of the National Marine Fisheries Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) An annual report, consisting of a copy of the required log, must be submitted to the National Marine Fisheries Service no later than December 31 of each year covering all Categories I and II fisheries for which the Exemption Certificate holder is registered.

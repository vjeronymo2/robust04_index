			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Letter: Work is one thing, but productivity is another Sir, It seems that the meaning of the term work ethic has become the subject of political controversy. The Japanese prime minister is reported ('Miyazawa queries US work ethic', February 4) to have accused the Americans of lacking the work ethic, while the American president ('Bush responds to Japanese work ethic jibe', February 5) is reported to have defended the American approach to work. Your readers may be interested to know that there has been some cross-national research on this topic. Although the results are fairly clear, their interpretation is not easy. When an international research group asked large samples of people how central work was in their lives, the Japanese scored the highest, but Yugoslavia came second and the US fourth, after Israel. Work proved least central among those in the UK and (west) Germany. It seems that the importance of work in one's life is not the same as effective productive, or even hard, work. It appears to have more to do with what alternative activities are highly regarded. The older advanced industrial countries: Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the US have reached a different value hierarchy than the countries that started industrialisation more recently. A more policy-relevant finding from the same research shows that, irrespective of nationality, the self-employed and people who enjoy a measure of autonomy in their work have a significantly higher attachment to work than other groups.

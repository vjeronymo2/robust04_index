			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] At the provincial meeting on help-the-poor work  and development, which was held yesterday [27 April], Liu  Fangren, secretary of the provincial party committee, urged all  sides concerned at various levels to emancipate their minds,  seize opportunities, and make concerted herculean efforts to do  a good job in work to help the poor.    In his speech, Li Fangren expounded in detail on the  objective and significance of the province's work to help the  poor and carry out development, approaching the subject through  many methods and angles. He set clear and definite demands,  remarking: Marked results have been achieved in our province's  work to help the poor and carry out development, but compared  with other parts of the country, our task remains a very arduous  one of steadily solving the problem of sufficient food and  clothing and of achieving a well-to- do standard of living. In  terms of the overall situation, the country's rural economy at  present has developed to the stage of moving from having  sufficient food and clothing to striving for a well-to-do  standard of living. Many areas in our province are still very  poor, so the task of helping the poor remains very arduous.  Therefore we must make great efforts to carry out our duties so  as to enable all members of society to do a good job in work to  help the poor. In accordance with the requirements of the  state's program to help the poor, which requires that the  problem of sufficient food and clothing for 80 million people be  solved within seven years, and in light of the realities in our  province, the overall goal of the work to help the poor,  beginning in 1994 and continuing to the year 2000, is to help 10  million people basically shake off absolute poverty. Focusing  on this goal, the basic line of thinking in the work to help the  poor and carry out development, both at present and for a  continuing period of time, is to uphold as the guide Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, to emancipate our  minds, to seek truth from facts, to deepen reform, to explore  new paths in the work to help the poor and carry out  development, to develop the spirit of self-reliance and hard  work, to adhere to the development-oriented principle guiding  work to help the poor, and to accelerate the pace of economic  development and the construction of infrastructures. We should  strive to improve the efficiency of the work to help the poor  and carry out development by orienting our efforts toward market  needs, exploiting natural resources, and relying on scientific  and technological advances. Energetically developing the  productive forces, continuously increasing poor peasants'  household incomes, steadily solving the problem of sufficient  food and clothing, and eliminating absolute poverty should be  taken as the basic starting points and goals of the work to help  the poor.    Liu Fangren said: By carrying out the development-oriented  work to help the poor, we mean encouraging the broad masses of  cadres and people in poverty-stricken areas to maintain the  spirit of self-reliance and hard work, exploit and utilize local  natural resources, and develop the production of commodities  with state support and by gearing themselves to market needs and  relying on scientific and technological advances. [passage  omitted]    Liu Fangren stated: To do a good job in the work to help the  poor, we should foster the ideas of the market economy,  development-oriented work to help the poor, comprehensive  development, and efficiency. [passage omitted]    All units and departments, as well as trades and  professions,  must work out their own plans for work to help the poor and  carry out development, based on the Help-the-Poor Program.  [passage omitted]    Liu Fangren urged: Party committees and governments at all  levels should genuinely put the work to help the poor and carry  out development in a position of importance and place this work  at the top of their agendas. All poverty-stricken counties  should regard it as a central task to help the poor through  development and solve the problem of sufficient food and  clothing for the masses of people. Principal leaders of party  committees and governments at all levels must take up the work  personally, and must pursue not only a system under which the  governor or magistrates of poverty-stricken counties is or are  responsible for the work, but also a system under which party  committee secretaries are responsible for the job. [passage  omitted]    The meeting was presided over by Wang Siqi, deputy secretary  of the provincial party committee. Vice Governor Yuan Ronggui,  member of the provincial party committee's standing committee,  conveyed the spirit of the national conference on work to help  the poor and carry out development. The other party,  government, and Army leaders attending the meeting were Long  Zhiyi, Liang Mingde, (Wang Guangxun), Li Wanlu, Wang Shouting,  Xia Guohua, (Huang Yao), (Hu Jiansheng), (Wang Anze), (Zhang  Weiqing), (Meng Shusheng), and Deng Guoyong.</p>

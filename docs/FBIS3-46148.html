			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Chaowen (1728 6389 2429)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 15 Jan (XINHUA) -- Speaking at an informal  meeting with persons in charge of provincial coal  administrations and major mining bureaus in the country  yesterday evening, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua urged them that,  after the nation has decontroled coal prices, they should strive  to adapt themselves to the new situation and push the nation's  coal industry to operate according to market needs.    Zou Jiahua began his speech by relaying the cordial regards  of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to the  country's coal workers who have contributed significantly to the  national economic development. After hearing reports of the  Datong Mining Bureau, the Jixi Mining Bureau, the Chongqing Coal  Company, and the Capital Coal Construction Company, Zou Jiahua  said that, after coal prices have been decontroled, the  country's coal industry will confront a new situation where  production decisions have to be made according to market supply  and demand. In view of this the nation's coal industry must come  up with new measures adaptable to the new situation. He said:  After several decades, Chinese coal enterprises have become  used to the planned economic management, and the traditions that  the state was responsible for drawing up production plans,  supplying equipment, alloting production capital, and buying up  products are deep rooted. Under the market economic system,  coal enterprises not only must study how much coal they should  produce, but also how much they can sell; and not only must they  study the domestic market, they must also study the world  market. The decontroling of coal prices does not mean that coal  enterprises can set prices themselves. It means market prices  must be determined by buyers and sellers according to market  needs. From now on the state will draw up coal production plans  according to market needs.    Zou Jiahua pointed out: After they enter the market, coal  enterprises must lower their production cost and increase their  productivity, otherwise they cannot possibly compete there.  Overstaffing has been one longstanding problem plaguing China's  coal industry. Coal miners from now on must foster their  militancy and hardworking spirit and make great efforts to  diversify operations.    Zou Jiahua concluded by saying that coal mines must  intensify  their production safety after entering the market. He said:  Leaders of coal enterprises in the country not only must pay  attention to returns, but also safety, which is even more  important. Efforts must be made so that, under the new situation  marked by market economy, the production will be safer each year  and the mortality rate of coal miners will continue to drop for  the output of 1 million tonnes of coal.</p>

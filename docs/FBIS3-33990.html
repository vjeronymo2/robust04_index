			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "ABRAR To Join International Media </F> Network"]    [Text] As a result of efforts by the Ministry of Post,  Telegraph, and Telephones, a general information network will be  inaugurated in our country during the Ten Days of Dawn [1-10  February] celebrations.    Subscribers to this network will be able to connect to it  from anywhere inside the country and from abroad by dialing a  number.    Initially, newspaper reports, information on train and  flight  schedules, and a telephone directory will be entered in the  database.    The ABRAR newspaper will soon join this network. An informed  source in the Ministry of Post, Telegraph, and Telephones told  our correspondent that once this network is operational,  subscribers will be able to obtain their required information  within seconds.    For example, if a subscriber on the other side of the world  requires a particular newspaper, he can contact the network and  obtain the required information within seconds.    One of the evening newspapers that is scheduled to join the  network will be disseminated simultaneously in Tehran and in a  European country. The informed source said most of the Western  and some Asian countries have such networks.    As for the costs of subscribing to this network, he said  they  would be announced later but that they would in any case be low  and result in a savings of time.    The network center will be located in the Shahed  telecommunications complex, which is at the end of the Kordestan  Autobahn.  <H5>  Technical Information </H5>   IRANPAC: This is a general information network being planned  for communications among computers and terminals in the country  and with other networks in the world. The IRANPAC packet  switching network will be capable of providing reliable,  precise, effective, and economical connections among the  information centers.  <H5>  Different Transmission Speeds </H5>   By using Random Access Memory processes in the network and  logical channels, IRANPAC will be capable of a simultaneous  two-way exchange of information between two subscribers at  different speeds.    How do we gain access to IRANPAC?    The following measures should be taken to gain access to  IRANPAC:    Set up a communications line between the network center and  the subscriber's DTE [Data Terminal Equipment] to obtain data by  the following means:    1. [no subsequent numbers below as published] Private  communications: The subscriber is linked through a permanent  line to the nearest packet switching network center via the  IRANPAC network so that he can be linked to the network without  any loss of time whenever he likes. Under this arrangement, the  asynchronous DTE speed of his private line can be 300-1,200 bits  per second and the synchronous DTE speed can be 4,800-9,600 bits  per second.    To gain access by dialing: Under this method, the subscriber  uses a preassigned telephone number and calls from any of the  ports in the network that are closest to the IRANPAC switching  center and offered to the subscribers.    The subscribers can in this manner obtain a Network User  Identification so that when they call up the IRANPAC network,  their identification is verified; if they are bona fide  subscribers, they are connected to the desired address. The  speed in this case is 1,300 or 1,200-2,400 bits per second.</p>

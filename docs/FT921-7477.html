			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Irish Workers' Party faces break-up THE Irish Workers' Party is expected to split today over deep ideological differences and allegations that a military wing, the official IRA, continues to operate in Northern Ireland independently of the party leadership. Mr Proinsias de Rossa, the party leader, has threatened to resign today if hardliners led by Mr Sean Garland, a former general secretary, do not quit. He said he would set up a new 'democratic and socialist' party which would seek to replace Ireland's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland 'with an aspiration for unity of people, rather than states'. Mr de Rossa will be joined by five other MPs, leaving the Worker's Party with only one seat. The Worker's Party split from Sinn Fein in the early 70s to pursue parliamentary politics rather than armed struggle.</p>

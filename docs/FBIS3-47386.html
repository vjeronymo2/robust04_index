Enrile issued this appeal following the arrest of communist  leader Arturo Tabara and seven others in the town of Murcia near  Bacolod City. Tabara and his group earlier had broken away from  the group of communist leader Jose Maria Sison. Enrile said the  arrest of Tabara will certainly have an effect on the ongoing  peace process.    [Begin Enrile recording, in English] Hopefully it will  create some kind of a bandwagon effect, so that the other  commands in other areas of the country, hopefully, instead of  allowing themselves to be captured considering, any way, they  are really having a difficult time. We are inviting them to  join the bandwagon already. [end recording].</p>

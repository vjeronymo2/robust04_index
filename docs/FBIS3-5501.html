"Carrying out the role expected of Japan in an  extremely important body such as the Security Council is  important, and a large number of countries expect this (of  Japan)," said the former vice foreign minister in an interview  with KYODO NEWS SERVICE.    Owada, 61, who is the father of Princess Masako, wife of  Crown Prince Naruhito, also said trade friction with the United  States should not be allowed to cause a deterioration in the  bilateral relationship. He said that in the relationship with  the U.S., "there are many areas where security, the economy and  society overlap."    "Becoming antagonists is out of the question," Owada said.  "It is dangerous to surmise that friction will occur  periodically."    Owada said the achievement of an early resolution of  economic  problems between the U.S. and Japan is vital. "Restructuring  the economic relationship with Japan is an important mission of  the administration of President Bill Clinton," he said.    Owada, who resigned as the Foreign Ministry's top bureaucrat  last August, replaced Yoshio Hatano in the New York posting  earlier this week.</p>

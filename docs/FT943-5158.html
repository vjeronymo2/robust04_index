			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Cresson bound for Brussels: Commissioners nominated in France and Germany France's new European commissioners are to be Mrs Edith Cresson, a former Socialist premier, and Mr Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the top official in charge of trade and European policy in the office of Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. The contrasting couple starkly illustrate changing attitudes in Paris to the European executive. France's outgoing Socialist president, Mr Francois Mitterrand, has nominated an ex-premier. Mr Balladur, the Gaullist premier, in naming a bureaucrat, has chosen to underline the new French conservative desire to see commissioners as technocrats under the political thumb of European Union ministers. Mr Balladur yesterday invited Mr Jacques Santer, Luxembourg's premier and Commission president-elect, to lunch to inform him of the nominations. Sometime this autumn, Mr Santer will preside over a carving up of portfolios among the new commissioners taking office next January. The issue of precedence between France's two commissioners has been made less acute by the Maastricht treaty which limits the number of Commission vice-presidents to one or two, at the president's choice. In a college of commissioners which, with Nordic and Austrian enlargement, could top 20, it is not clear that either of the French appointees would make vice-president. Mr de Silguy served in the Brussels office of French commissioner Francois-Xavier Ortoli in the early 1980s, and spent 1990-93 with the state-owned Usinor-Sacilor steel company. He is known to be interested in the competition or external trade dossiers held by Mr Karel Van Miert of Belgium and Sir Leon Brittan of the UK respectively. Some other commissioners - and governments - will be wary, however, of seeing such sensitive portfolios pass into French hands. Mr de Silguy played the key role in orchestrating France's Gatt negotiations, and some of the toes he trod on in Brussels remain bruised. Mrs Cresson is most remembered in France for her unpopular stint as prime minster in 1991-92, and abroad for her comments about the homosexual tendencies of British men and of the ant-like characteristics of Japan's workforce. But she remains close to Mr Mitterrand, whose desire to grant her wish to go to Brussels posed Mr Balladur a problem of political imbalance with his choice. In the end, Mr Balladur decided that the choice of Mr de Silguy, who has also worked for Mr Jacques Chirac, would be impossible for his presidential rival to oppose. Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, leader of Germany's OTV public sector union, looks set to become one of her country's two European commissioners after she was proposed by the opposition Social Democratic party, writes Michael Lindemann in Bonn. Chancellor Helmut Kohl met Mrs Wulf-Mathies, 52, just as the SPD released news of her nomination. Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said Mr Kohl respected Mrs Wulf-Mathies's 'ability and hard work', suggesting that she has his backing. However, her formal nomination will depend on cabinet approval. The Free Democratic party, junior partner in the governing coalition, has said it wants Mr Martin Bangemann, the present industry commissioner, to remain in Brussels but much will depend on how well the party performs in next month's general election. All present commissioners, including Mr Peter Schmidhuber, the other German one, end their five-year terms at the end of this year, although some will be renominated. A new Commission formally begins work on January 7 but not before the European parliament has approved all 17 members. For 12 years Mrs Wulf-Mathies has lead the 1.9m-strong OTV and would be the first woman to represent Germany on the Commission.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, 24 May, BNS -- Estonian Foreign Minister  Juri Luik will at 6 p.m. today declare open the third session of  the Council of Baltic Sea Countries foreign ministers.    On the agenda are cooperation between Baltic Sea countries  and the European Union, the work of the council, establishment  of a secretariat at the council, environmental issues, nuclear  safety, illegal migration, and organized crime.    The session is also expected to approve the mandate of a  Baltic Sea countries commissioner for national minorities and  fill the post. The only candidate so far is former Danish  Justice Minister Ole Espersen.    The session ends with the election of the council's new  president to replace Estonia, who currently holds the body's  rotating presidency, and adoption of a joint communique.    Luik said at a press conference yesterday that the general  opinion of the Baltic Sea Council member states is the council  has over the last 14 months "made big strides forward." Luik  cited as the body's successes the opening of Eurofaculties at  the Vilnius, Riga, and Tartu universities, the work of the  council's economics group on the Via Baltica project, and  achievements in the sphere of nuclear safety. He said the  implementation of the Via Baltica plan is one of the top  priorities of the council.    Commenting on the mandate of the Baltic Sea countries  commissioner for human rights and ethnic minorities, the  Estonian foreign minister emphasized that its primary objective  is to defend democratic institutions and the rights of  individuals.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev has previously  announced Russia intends to raise at the meeting the question of  the Baltic states' territorial claims on Russia. Luik said at  the press conference yesterday the issue hasn't as yet been put  on the agenda.    Luik will have during the session private meetings with his  Russian, Swedish, German and Norwegian counterparts. The  meeting between Luik and Kozyrev today is regarded as a  historical event.    Luik told reporters the meeting will probably focus on the  withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia. The Russian foreign  minister plans also to return to the issuance of residence and  work permits to Russian military retirees. Moscow insists that  Estonia should give permanent residence permits to all retired  officers living here, whereas the Estonian Government and  delegation for talks with Russia haven't to date acceded to  Russia's demand.    Russia's chief negotiator, Ambassador Vasily Svirin, in an  interview with BNS yesterday declined to comment on the  importance of the meeting between Kozyrev and Luik for the  Estonian-Russian relations.    "I hope the meeting will have a positive effect on the  course  of the Estonian-Russian negotiations," Svirin told BNS.</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS HONOR GOES TO A MOST UNUSUAL 'HIGH-TECH' FIRM  </P> <P> A San Diego company that manufactures an indoor horticulture device popular  among marijuana growers has won top honors from an organization of the area's  business leaders.  </P> <P> Pyraponic Industries Inc. II, which advertises its product in pro-marijuana  magazines such as High Times, has been recognized as the Business of the Year  in Manufacturing from the Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce. The company is  scheduled to receive the award later this year at a banquet along with six  other businesses honored in other categories.  </P> <P> Despite the company's notoriety, the chamber so far is undeterred. While the  company's advertising in pro-marijuana magazines "is a surprise to us," there  are no plans to revoke the award, said chamber spokesman Pete Litrenta.  </P> <P> "Of all those that applied, this is the best manufacturing company," Litrenta  said. "This company evidently showed a lot of growth in sales and employees."  </P> <P> Pyraponic has sold more than 90,000 Phototrons since it was founded in 1982,  DeMarco said. The 65-employee company, which sells its product strictly by mail  order, reported $10 million in sales in 1989, and was recognized last year by  Inc. magazine as one of the 500 fastest-growing private corporations in the  country.  </P> <P> Jeffery DeMarco, the company's founder and president, said advertisements in  High Times, a magazine for marijuana enthusiasts, are responsible for more than  17% of sales of Phototron, the 42-inch-high indoor greenhouse he designed while  a graduate student working on a federally licensed project on marijuana  cultivation at the University of Illinois.  </P> <P> Drug Enforcement Agency spokesman Jim Mavromatis said Thursday that while local  agents have not seized any Phototron device in connection with illegal  pot-growing activity, other indoor greenhouses are frequently the subject of  DEA drug raids.  </P> <P> "All I can tell you is that the only times I have seen indoor growing  operations (they have been) for marijuana cultivation," Mavromatis said.  </P> <P> DEA agents in San Diego visited the Pyraponic Industries plant in Rancho  Bernardo, a San Diego suburb, last fall to investigate whether the company was  engaged in any illegal activity. No arrests or seizures were made.  </P> <P> DeMarco, who started but did not complete his master's degree in criminology,  said the indoor greenhouse is advertised in more than 50 publications including  Playboy, Penthouse, Better Homes &amp; Gardens and Field &amp; Stream. The  device, which sells for $390, can be used to grow a wide variety of plants  including fruits, vegetables, flowers and herbs, he said.  </P> <P> Despite the company's reliance on pro-marijuana magazines including High Times  and Magical Blend, Pyraponic Industries does not condone marijuana cultivation  and, in fact, revokes its service guarantee to anyone who employs the device to  grow marijuana, DeMarco said.  </P> <P> "I'm not a policeman, I'm an entrepreneur," the 38-year-old DeMarco said.  </P></p>

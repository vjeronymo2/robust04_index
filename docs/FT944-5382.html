			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: If you must buy shirts, at least buy silk - Carefully chosen gifts mean men will not have to feign surprise and joy on Christmas morning Let us call it the Thyssen Principle. At the end of a television film on the luxurious life of Heini Thyssen-Bornemisza and his then wife Fiona Campbell Walter, the Baron let slip that he was thinking of giving his wife a gift. What sort of a gift? A bauble from Cartier perhaps? Or a sable coat? No. He had his eye on a Monet. In this, Heini showed he truly understood the art of giving: the best presents are what one would not buy for oneself, prove delightful and appeal to the imagination. However, even for a man whose art collection was said to rival that of the Queen of England, a Monet is pretty steep. The rest of us must apply the Thyssen Principle in more modest ways. Yet in buying Christmas presents for men, it is well to keep the Baron's approach in mind. It can become wearing for a man to have to pretend spontaneous joy while tearing the wrapping paper off yet another blue shirt, especially when you stipulated the maker, collar size and sleeve length. Nor do most men want anything 'useful'. Those men longing to own a Bosch hammer drill will already have bought one. No, it is far better to mix a hint of luxury with a little imagination and a dash of surprise. If you must buy handkerchiefs, at least make them Hermes pochettes and combine them with a velvet smoking waistcoat, complete with frogging and braid, at Pounds 175 from Hackett. Instead of the year-long practicality of the power tool, why not opt instead for the one-off hedonism of a large tin of caviar? A 500g tin of Beluga at Pounds 600 should make a good impression. And for a shade over 10 per cent of that price, it is possible to pick up a perfectly respectable 125g tin of Sevruga. Iranian caviar is this season's favourite. It is also a good Christmas to buy cashmere, as prices are set to climb in the new year. For cardigans try Hackett where they cost about Pounds 290. Pringle has chunky cashmere sweaters starting at Pounds 265, while Herbert Johnson has a cashmere dressing gown for Pounds 950.00. And, although it is hardly an economy, the Sulka shawl collar, eight-ply cashmere cardigan at Pounds 1,050 makes a memorable gift. Sulka also has some rather ingenious spectacle cases in silk that can be placed in the top pocket where they resemble a handkerchief. The non-myopic can use them for sunglasses, and non-millionaires can afford the Pounds 25 price tag. Just as vain men hate people to see their reading glasses, real men hate to wear pyjamas. But few could resist, for example, the Batiste cotton pyjamas from Budd on London's Piccadilly Arcade, in striking coral or 'men's pink', with mother of pearl buttons and a button under the revers to fasten against the cold. At Pounds 95, these pyjamas are a very covetable gift. If you must buy a man a shirt, make it a silk one. Silk prices are coming down and there are big reductions on last year's prices: at Budd, the king of dress shirts - silk, pleated and able to take studs - is Pounds 145, Pounds 20 less than last year. Socks, like shirts can be a monotonous choice, but Budd have unearthed some rather fancy two tone ones in fine French cotton Lisle from Boileau at Pounds 13.50. At the other end of the scale the thickest socks you are ever likely to wear can be found on the shores of Loch Fyne at Alexander MacIntyre in Inverary. Hand-knitted on the Western Isles they cost Pounds 7.75. Writing instruments tend to feature as Christmas presents but if you cannot afford to give a vintage Parker Duofold, why not think about a pen case. Penfriend has smart pen cases in calf starting at Pounds 18, rising through Buffalo to the highly desirable crocodile at Pounds 55. It might also be an idea to choose a notebook from Smythson in a matching or contrasting shade, from Pounds 5.95. Another accessory holder to look out for is the leather watch case. Made in Italy and available at the Watch Gallery, this is the ultimate riposte to the female's jewellery case. However the prices (from Pounds 175 to almost Pounds 4,000) are only worth paying if the man you are buying for can afford to collect marques such as Breitling, Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet and Vacheron Constantin. The action man might appreciate the Land Rover Experience, a day course in how to handle Range Rover, Defender and Discovery vehicles, for Pounds 152.75. Alternatively, send him out on the information superhighway by putting him on the Internet. The Internet starter kit is Pounds 27.98 from Micro Anvika, while the service is available from such organisations as Demon (081-349 0063) for a Pounds 12.50 joining fee and Pounds 10 a month thereafter (both prices exclude VAT). Those in search of something a little less tangible might enjoy a Feng Shui consultation. This practice is incredibly popular in Hong Kong and benefits are believed to include enhanced career prospects, greater wealth and improved relationships. For Pounds 100 an hour, Jan Cisek (tel: 0956-288574), a Feng Shui consultant, will reorganise an office, drawing-room, bedroom or study according to ancient principles which should produce a more harmonious environment. But a boy's Christmas just would not be festive without a gadget and the oenophile on the run will certainly want the collapsible pocket corkscrew from Swaine Adeney Brigg (Pounds 45, plus Pounds 2 p+p), which resembles a bulky silver bullet when not in use. There will, however, be those for whom a corkscrew is simply not complex enough. A catalogue published by 'Q, Purveyors of International Gadgetry' includes everything from a pair of 'maritime glasses' for yachting at Pounds 27.50, through a solid gold miniature camera - which can, of course, be crested - and a selection of night scopes to the personal submarine.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Senior official  of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Hu Jintao held talks here  today with high-ranking officials of Argentina's ruling  Justicialista Party on ways of promoting bilateral relations.    In the talks the two sides briefed each other of the  performance of the two parties and the situation of the two  countries.    Both sides held that contacts between the two parties over  the past many years have played a positive role in promoting  friendly relations between the two countries, hoping that  bilateral ties will be further strengthened in the future.    Hu, Standing Committee member of the Politburo of the CPC  Central Committee, said China and Argentina, though far apart  and having different social systems, have similar experiences in  history and common tasks at present, which will help bring them  into reliable partnership.    The head of the Chinese party delegation expressed his  confidence that there are broad prospects for closer cooperation  between the two parties.    Hu conveyed greetings from Chinese leader Jiang Zemin to  Argentine president and leader of the Justicialista Party Carlos  Menem.    Meanwhile, the senior officials of the Justicialista Party  welcomed the Chinese delegation and said Hu's visit will further  strengthen the cooperation between the two parties.    On the same day, President of the Argentine Chamber of  Deputies Alberto Pierri and former Argentine President Raul  Alfonsin met with the Chinese delegation on separate occasions.    Hu arrived here this morning from Uruguay to begin the  second  leg of his three-nation Latin American tour, which will take him  to Brazil next.</p>

In a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Ghali, Iraq noted  that from 10-20 January U.S. aircraft continued to violate Iraqi  airspace. They carried out 738 air sorties covering large areas  of northern and southern Iraq.    On 11 January, a U.S. TR-1 reconnaissance plane violated  Iraqi airspace. Afterward, it flew in the direction of Saudi  airspace. On 3 January [as heard], the same plane violated Iraqi  airspace. It mainly overflew the al-Basrah, al-Nasiriyah,  al-'Amarah, southern al-Diwaniyah, and southern al-Najaf areas.  Afterward, it flew in the direction of Saudi airspace.    The letter indicates that on 18 January, two U.S. aircraft  dropped two flares 10 km south of Alqosh in Ninawa governorate.    An enemy air formation dropped a flare south of Alqosh  hamlet  in Ninawa governorate. Another formation dropped a flare 10 km  south of the Alqosh area in Ninawa governorate.</p>

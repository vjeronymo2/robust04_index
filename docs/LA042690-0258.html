			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SHADES OF GRAY / AGNES HERMAN: KEEPING ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE DINOSAURS  </P> <P> "Mommy, long, long ago, when you were a little girl, were there dinosaurs  around?" Judi was 5 and I was 33. In her eyes, I was old. Her question was not  meant to be sharp, but it impaled me.  </P> <P> Today, young Americans have a similarly distorted perception of those of us who  see ourselves as "aging gracefully." They look upon us as the homogenized  elderly: stoop-shouldered and slow-moving, sitting idly on benches, watching  time go by. In our own mirrors, however, we see a different reflection:  changing times and attitudes allow us to wash out some gray, straighten the  shoulders and soften the lines.  </P> <P> I retired as director of volunteer services for Family Service of Los Angeles  11 years ago; five years later, my husband, and I moved to San Diego's North  County. I had not yet attained chronological "senior status," but I was ready  for a change. Several years later, I reached my seniority, and, to my surprise  and delight, dinners, movies and flight tickets became quite reasonable, and a  variety of people began to open doors for me.  </P> <P> Indeed, from the moment of retirement, my life took a most comfortable turn. I  gave up early mornings, work schedules, evening appointments, boring commuting  hours on the freeways, interminable meetings with so many who had so much to  say and so little to teach.  </P> <P> I have never turned back and wished that I was once again on the job I had  genuinely enjoyed. Nor have I warmed up the rocking chair, or buried myself in  a shawl. I meet only my dentist and hairdresser at dawn: it is best to see them  at the top of their performance. I do keep a calendar of appointments, but it  is written in pencil, to be altered or canceled easily. Only those dates made  with grandson, Matthew, 2, are immutable.  </P> <P> Returning from a trip, I no longer find a stack of unfinished business  requiring my "immediate attention," only the usual catalogues and bills. Some  things never change.  </P> <P> We live at the southwest corner of the Lake San Marcos community, which is, by  and large, a society of seniors. I do not know the statistics, but I do know  what I see: couples in the grocery store doing the week's shopping, often  holding hands, taking their time to read labels and compare prices. Living in a  community of younger people, I rarely saw a couple shopping; one of the two  usually was at work. Only newlyweds and the elderly go shopping in pairs.  </P> <P> At the golf course and in the tennis areas, many of us take advantage of the  greens and the courts. We are active; our games are competitive. In the  twilight hours of the day, some young people appear, after work. We seniors  always speculate, "Wonder where they come from, whose grandchildren are they?"  </P> <P> But is that all there is to retirement/senior status: shop and play?  </P> <P> Indeed not! In between the leisure hours, I, for one, sit at this word  processor and try to justify this new career, chosen for my later years. I  struggle with words and concepts as hard as I ever fought my way through a  staff conference at Family Service.  </P> <P> And then there are volunteer responsibilities. My husband and I manage a  national association of retired rabbis, a time-consuming, satisfying task.  Working together is an added bonus; our professional paths have intersected in  retirement as they could not when we were both wage-earners. In addition, each  of us is called upon for informal counseling and consulting, using skills for  which we were trained long, long ago when the "dinosaurs were around."  </P> <P> Drawing upon old skills and discovering new ones are our keys to fulfillment  during these special years. We are not alone. Recently, in the office of the  North County Interfaith Council, I met a retired gentleman who has been  counseling the homeless and the poor weekly for the past six years, as a  volunteer. The professional staff noted that many of their counselors are  retired doctors, psychiatrists, social workers, each of whom is a volunteer.  </P> <P> Here at the Lake, many of us have continuing careers, as well as new ones, but  now we work at our own speed, at our own convenience, at projects we select.  </P> <P> My husband, retired from his former responsibilities as a rabbi, gains  tremendous satisfaction when invited to substitute for colleagues. A neighbor,  a retired Navy officer and department store trouble-shooter, is now launching a  writing career. A former public schoolteacher is busy teaching English to  recently arrived Mexicans. A retired Marine is succeeding in the real estate  business. A pharmacist is coaching kids and involving himself in the political  life of the lake.  </P> <P> Not everyone shapes a new and different "job." Some neighbors are dedicated  gardeners, working among the flowers, a joy for which they never before found  time; others read voraciously, without guilt. Many are deeply involved in  church work. One neighbor took his hobby seriously and opened a local fishing  tackle store.  </P> <P> I have not yet rapped on doors to learn the details of my neighbors'  preoccupations, but when, each week, I see the pretty widow standing in high  heels on the front sill, 3 feet off the ground, washing her windows and  chatting amiably with passers-by, I know that I must speak with her to discover  what keeps her 80-plus years young.  </P> <P> Staying young during retirement and/or the loss of a spouse is a challenge.  Many cope successfully, in a variety of ways. Some become volunteers: teaching  literacy, grandparenting someone else's isolated grandkids, helping the poor  file income tax returns or counseling the hungry and the homeless; others have  opted for second careers.  </P> <P> Staying healthy is no less a challenge. Is there something special about health  care for silver-haired citizens? I intend to share with you creative ways some  have chosen to stay well and cope with everyday living. We can learn and  benefit from each other.  </P> <P> </P> <P> EDITOR'S NOTE: At 68, Agnes Herman may be retired, but she's not retiring.  Besides many volunteer activities, she has been a frequent contributor to the  San Diego County Opinion Page. In Shades of Gray, a column for and about North  County's older residents, she will blend practical information with insight and  humor -- and a measure of her personal philosophy of getting the most out of  life and every situation. Look for Shades of Gray on the fourth Thursday of the  month in North County Focus.  </P></p>

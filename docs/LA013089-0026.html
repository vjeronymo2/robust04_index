			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ABORTION AND THE COURT'  </P> <P> I was astonished by the content of an interview with Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh  on Jan. 22 when he was asked why, when a majority of Americans support the  right of women to terminate pregnancy, the government is recommending  overturning Roe vs. Wade. He responded that ordinarily the government would be  responsive to a majority, but this was "a matter of principle."  </P> <P> Whose principle, pray? And what has become of government of the people, by the  people?  </P> <P> While most of us deplore abortion, the problem is not amenable to solution by  repression. Let the government take a serious hand in the question of  population control. We have the scientific know-how!  </P> <P> ALICE CARY THOMPSON  </P> <P> Dana Point  </P></p>

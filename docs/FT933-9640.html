			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Company profits 'shielded from impact of downturn' COMPANIES performed more robustly in the recent recession than they did in the downturn of the early 1980s, with profitability and investment remaining at comparatively high levels, the Bank of England says. A report to be published tomorrow in the Bank's Quarterly Bulletin says UK companies took earlier and more active steps to adjust to the recent recession than they did a decade ago, and therefore retained a large proportion of the gains in profitability made in the 1980s. The report says the return on capital in the non-North Sea sector was some 3 percentage points higher in the recent recession than it was in the previous one. Business investment as a share of gross domestic product was also nearly 3 percentage points higher in the early 1990s than it was in the early 1980s. However, the report says British companies entered the recent recession with a much higher level of indebtedness than they had in the previous downturn. Their borrowing requirement averaged 7.4 per cent of GDP in the five years to 1992 compared with 2.2 per cent in the five years to 1982 - and the effects of large financial deficits and borrowing requirements may continue to affect company behaviour for some time. The Bank gives three main reasons why company profitability was higher in the early 1990s than in the early 1980s: Productivity levels were much higher at the start of the last recession, up by 60 per cent in the 1980s compared with only 18 per cent in the 1970s. Manufacturers have also been more able to contain labour costs because of the greater flexibility of the labour market in recent years. British industry has been far more competitive in the 1990s than in the 1980s, when profit margins had to be severely squeezed. The real exchange rate appreciated by more than 20 per cent in 1980 compared with 1989, undermining the outlook for exports in the earlier recession. There was far greater capacity utilisation in the last recession, helped by stronger UK export markets and a slightly less severe cumulative fall in domestic demand. The number of companies reporting under-utilised capacity to the Confederation of British Industry reached an average annual peak of 69 per cent in 1992 compared with 80 per cent in 1981.

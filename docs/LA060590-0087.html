			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LABOR: SCRIMMAGE ON NFL FREE AGENCY  </P> <P> It may be hard for some to understand how such angry arguments can arise  between 1,500 rich, young professional football players and a few dozen richer,  older club owners -- six of whom are billionaires -- when the clubs' revenue  from television alone will soar 85% this year.  </P> <P> It would seem they would be laughing all the way to the bank, or wherever they  stash their money, since their TV income will be a record $3.6 billion over the  next four years.  </P> <P> Their arguments may seem to be energy misspent, but they are not unusual. Other  wealthy people fight over money too.  </P> <P> It is harder, though, to understand the ludicrous way that players and owners  have reversed roles as they battle in and out of the courts.  </P> <P> A look at the topsy-turvy world of professional football shows how this mess  developed.  </P> <P> It is quite a twist for the National Football League to be pressing hard for a  court order to make the NFL Players Assn. admit that it is a real union and  that it acts like one by demanding that the owners pay players more money.  </P> <P> The other day, Jack Donlan, chief negotiator for the owners, tried in vain to  tempt the players with this extraordinary observation:  </P> <P> "Let's face it. We (management) have a lot of money. We have had a lot of  committee meetings to discuss how far we can go. A ballpark figure is, we could  double the benefits."  </P> <P> Equally unprecedented in the world of labor-management relations is the odd  posture of the players association. Although the association never before  objected to being called a union, it is now fighting in court to prove that it  is not legally a union and therefore cannot be forced to demand anything from  the owners.  </P> <P> Gene Upshaw, head of the players association, wasn't kidding a while back when  he left a luncheon with this startling remark: "Well, I've got a union to  break." He was referring to his own.  </P> <P> The strange behavior by both sides stems from the impact of federal antitrust  laws on the real issue in dispute: the seemingly perpetual argument over the  free-agency question.  </P> <P> The players want to be free agents, which means that they want to be allowed to  sell their talents to the highest bidder in the league. That isn't asking too  much in our free market system. They also want a union to negotiate their  minimum salaries and other benefits.  </P> <P> For more than 20 years, the association and management fought constantly.  Contract negotiations ended in strikes or lockouts five times without resolving  the free-agency issue.  </P> <P> Under the current system, the owners have agreed to let each team "protect" 37  players -- generally their best ones -- from free-agency status. The remaining  players have limited freedom to put their talents up for competitive bidding.  The "protected" players remain captives of their team unless the owner chooses  to trade or release them.  </P> <P> The owners still act as though they own the players, who, after some strikes,  won only limited freedom to put their services up for competitive bidding among  the 28 teams. To resolve the dispute without more picket lines, the association  went to court asking that its members be allowed to sue the owners under  federal antitrust laws.  </P> <P> The association contends that the owners are violating antitrust laws by  conspiring among themselves to refuse to bid against one another for the  talents of individual players, except when the owners agree that they are ready  to bid. That amounts to an illegal attempt by the owners to fix wages, the  association argues.  </P> <P> In the early part of this century, workers and their unions were dragged to  court when they collectively demanded pay raises. They were accused of  violating antitrust laws by "conspiring" among themselves to try to fix their  wages.  </P> <P> But in the 1930s under new antitrust laws, the Supreme Court decided that  workers have a right to try to "fix" their wages -- if they do it collectively  through a union.  </P> <P> Now NFL owners say players cannot sue under antitrust laws to become free  agents because the law says players and owners are exempt from those laws as  long as they have a collective bargaining relationship. In other words, the  owners are trying to restrain players' salaries by using the law that was  developed to protect workers' rights to raise their wages.  </P> <P> To defeat the owners' slick legal trick, the union tried one of its own. It  declared that it is not a union and no longer has any collective bargaining  relationship with the owners. Since it has no union contract, the association  says, players can sue the owners, who refuse to bid competitively for the  players' services.  </P> <P> There are three cases before the courts, including one before the Supreme  Court, that might untangle the legal mix-up that many people see as a rich  men's squabble in which both sides are at fault. But it is a mistake to  denounce both sides equally in their strange labor war.  </P> <P> Remember, while the players are paid well -- the average annual salary is  $301,000 -- so are other popular entertainers whose careers can go on for  years. The average professional life of the players is 3.2 years, and they are  frequently injured.  </P> <P> The owners' careers, by contrast, are measured in decades, and the physical  risk is mainly to their nervous systems as they fret over money.  </P> <P> The owners don't fret, though, about competition from rival football leagues.  There is none in what has been accurately called their corporate socialist  monopoly: The 28 teams in the country's only league divide 95% of all their  income equally.  </P> <P> The players, while handsomely rewarded as entertainers, are in competition with  one another for their handsome salaries.  </P> <P> The good news for the fans in all this is that the squabbling over money is now  in the courts, not on picket lines, and training camps will open next month in  time to begin the regular football season.  </P></p>

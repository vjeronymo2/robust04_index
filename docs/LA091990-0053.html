			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 MEN LOSE PART OF FEET IN CABLE ACCIDENT  </P> <P> Two workers each had part of a foot severed when a steel cable came loose in a  Lancaster construction accident Tuesday, the Los Angeles County Fire Department  reported.  </P> <P> The 8:10 a.m. accident occurred at Avenue E and 20th Street West as a work crew  for Western Utility Contractors used machinery to pull a quarter-inch-thick  steel cable down the street next to a construction site where a sewer main was  to be placed, officials said.  </P> <P> It was unclear whether the cable snapped or came loose and entangled two men on  the crew, officials said. One victim's right foot was severed at the ankle by  the cable; the other man lost about one-third of his left foot, firefighters  said.  </P> <P> The victims, both about 45 and from Lancaster, were taken to the Antelope  Valley Medical Center, where both were in serious condition, officials said.  Hospital officials, firefighters and accident investigators declined to  identify the men.  </P> <P> Rick Rice, a spokesman for Cal/OSHA, said an investigation of the accident was  begun Tuesday, but the cause was not known.  </P> <P> After the victims were taken to the hospital, paramedics Fred Carter and Jim  Larue returned to the accident site to thank other members of the work crew for  their efforts to calm and help the injured men.  </P></p>

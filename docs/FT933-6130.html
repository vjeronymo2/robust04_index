			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / The Middle East: Details of draft Israeli-PLO accord Self-rule will begin first in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho, where Palestinians will have what Israel describes as full autonomy. They will take over most functions of the Israeli military government including internal security and policing. The principle of 'early empowerment' will apply to the rest of the West Bank. Palestinians will take control of five spheres of daily life - health, education, welfare, tourism and culture - and perhaps others, depending on the outcome of negotiations. The Israeli army will redeploy to agreed areas, withdrawing from all Palestinian population centres but remaining to protect Jewish settlements on the outskirts of Gaza and Jericho. Israel will keep control of the border crossing from Gaza to Egypt and the Allenby bridge near Jericho, which links the occupied West Bank to Jordan. The status of Jerusalem, which thwarted earlier talks on self-rule, will be left to negotiations on the permanent arrangement for the occupied territories, which will begin two years after the signing of the joint declaration of principles. Expanded authority over Gaza and Jericho as well as early empowerment in the rest of the West Bank could be implemented within weeks of signing the document on the table at the 11th round of Middle East peace talks, starting today in Washington. Palestinians will elect a council to administer self-rule at least nine months after the declaration of principles is implemented. The seat of the administrative council will be in the West Bank town of Bethlehem.</p>

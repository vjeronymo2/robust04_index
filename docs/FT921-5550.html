			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Reliance Industries in merger with associate RELIANCE Industries, the Indian textile and petrochemicals group controlled by Mr Dhirubhai Ambani, and Reliance Petrochemicals (RPL), its associate, have merged, creating the largest private sector corporation in India. The merger, which took effect from March 1, is intended to give Reliance more leverage to raise funds from the capital markets and to create a group to rank in the world's top 500 companies. In deciding to merge the two companies, the Ambani family which controls both, have taken advantage of the recent lifting of controls that put limits on the size of Indian companies - and hence their ability to compete internationally. Under agreed merger terms, 10 RPL shares are to be exchanged for one Reliance Industries share. Reliance Industries holds 21 per cent of RPL. Reliance Industries reported Rs20.9bn (Dollars 798m) sales last year and Rs1.2bn of pre-tax profits. RPL, a new company established as greenfield downstream petrochemicals company, is to report sales and profit figures for the first time this year. Kleinwort Benson estimates that consolidated sales of Reliance could leap to Rs42bn in financial 1993 and pre-tax profits climb to Rs4.7bn (Dollars 179m) as major new investments come onstream. In combining the two companies, Reliance believes it will be in a stronger position to raise further funds from the capital markets. RPL's petrochemical complex at Hazira is costing Rs15bn - almost double original estimates. Reliance says a gas cracker due to be completed at Hazira will cost Rs12bn - though outside estimates put it much higher.</p>

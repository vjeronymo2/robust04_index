			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / The Markets: Welfare and the family - Economic Eye In 1991 there were some 1.3m one-parent families in the UK, containing 2.2m dependent children. In that same year, according to the Department of Social Security, around a million of these parents (overwhelmingly women) were in receipt of income support. Thus, more than three-quarters of single-parent households depend on benefits, which supports the proposition advanced two weeks ago ('Marital economics', September 12 1994), that 'most women cannot bring up their children unaided'. In the absence of a specific man, the main body of citizens must take up the burden. By partially socialising the costs of child-rearing, the welfare state has made the rapid growth of single-parent families and unstable couples feasible. This does not mean, as crude conservatives are prone to argue, that women have children just to obtain benefits, such as housing. Nevertheless, where once economic realities would have forced an unmarried girl to give up a child for adoption, now she can try to raise her child on her own. Strikingly, the rate of teenage conception in England and Wales has increased, from 57.1 per thousand girls in 1981 to 65.3 per thousand in 1991, notwithstanding provision of contraception and sex education. This is an example of incentives at work. Similarly, where once a man who abandoned his family knew they would starve, now he knows they will survive, if miserably. Insurance changes behaviour. That is what the phrase 'moral hazard' means. Men with relatively poor earnings opportunities (of whom there are more now than 20 years ago) are competing with the state as providers of resources to the mothers of their children. Many of them come out a poor second. Equally, the welfare state subsidises serial polygyny. Well-earning men have been able to leave much of the burden of supporting their first families to the state, while women also find it easier to dump men who fall short of their desires. These developments are not without drawbacks. One is the effect on children, particularly boys deprived of any model of masculine responsibility. The feminist view that women can bring children up better on their own seems peculiarly self-defeating. For what role in life are these mothers preparing their sons? Another drawback is the effects on the public budget. In 1992-93 support for lone parents amounted to Pounds 6.6bn, an increase of 170 per cent in real terms since 1978-79. At 1 per cent of gross domestic product, this is not a budget-breaking sum. But it is increasing rapidly. It is also far from trivial, being as much as the Department for Education spends on higher and further education in England. There is also substantial pressure to spend more, largely because the lot of welfare-supported single-parent households is a decidedly poor one. One such demand is for 'affordable child-care'. But the provision of subsidised childcare merely changes the form of the subsidy to lone parents. By tying the subsidy to work outside the home, it also skews the mother's choice in that direction. The state would then provide the childcare, which is what women offered within traditional families, while the working mother would play the traditional male role. Greater state support for single-parent families can be encapsulated as a move towards socialising traditional male roles. But there is an alternative, embodied in the 1991 Child Support Act. This is to re-privatise that role, but without the father's presence in the family. 'The assumption that, in broken marriages or partnerships, taxpayers should assume the financial responsibility for the family is, at long last, challenged,' wrote the House of Commons Social Security Committee in a report on the Child Support Agency published at the end of last year. 'In making this change a second fundamental reform is brought about. The essence of the change was to move from a legal system dealing with child maintenance on a case by case, discretionary basis to an administrative system which assesses all maintenance according to the same criteria, with the aim of achieving higher levels of maintenance.' It all sounds very sensible. But, in practice, the Child Support Agency has tripped over three main obstacles: first, men have found to their horror that the basis on which they had planned their lives has been overturned; second, subsequent families have found themselves deprived in the interests of first ones; third, first families benefit only if the increased support does not substitute for the Treasury's funds, whereupon the latter loses out. The underlying problem, however, is that there is simply insufficient money to go around. The novel patterns of child-rearing would be impossible without substantial support from taxpayers. Furthermore, since more state support is the only demand on which those directly affected are bound to agree, that is also what is likely to happen. The CSA will probably prove a blip on a curve showing a progressive rise in the socialisation of the costs of child-rearing. There will also be a corresponding increase in the net burden on those who stick to traditional mono-gamy, as the fiscal benefits of marriage decline and the scale of support for lone parenthood increases. Even if the CSA were to succeed, it would merely make second families less viable, so increasing the number of mothers forced to look to the state for their main support. The long-term social consequences of all this I leave to the reader's imagination.</p>

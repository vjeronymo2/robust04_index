			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: BA places Pounds 15m Satcom order Racal, the data communications group, and Honeywell, the US electronic control systems company, have won a Pounds 15m order from British Airways for their 'Satcom' satellite communications system. The contract is the largest Satcom order to date, and establishes Racal/Honeywell as a strong leader in the rapidly growing market for airborne digital communications. British Airways said the new system would 'revolutionise the quality of communication from the flight deck', with higher quality voice communications and automatic monitoring for engineering purposes. Satcom also has the potential to provide a telephone at every seat in the aeroplane and enhanced passenger entertainment and interactive facilities. British Airways sees the new system as as an important competitive asset. Most big airlines have experimented with satellite telephones, but previous analogue systems have been at best a partial success because of the variability of sound quality and the cost of the equipment and satellite time. British Airways will test the first multi-channel systems this year, and intends to install them in 90 long-haul aircraft from next year. These will include Boeing 747s, long-range 767s and McDonnell Douglas DC10s. The Concorde fleet may also be equipped. The Racal/Honeywell team has won orders for more than 500 satellite-based airborne systems from 30 air transport customers, and claims to have certification on 10 aircraft types.</p>

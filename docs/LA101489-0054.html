			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DEDICATED DIGGERS AND PLANTERS: GARDENING  </P> <P> For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of  Nurserymen:  </P> <P> * Check bottlebrush, azaleas, gardenias and citrus for chlorosis; use  fertilizers with chelating materials or iron chelates to bring foliage back to  normal.  </P> <P> * To "harden off" subtropical and tropical plants that are subject to frost  damage, cut back on watering; hold off pruning until new growth starts next  spring.  </P> <P> * Prepare for spring right now by planting bulbs, shrubs, trees, perennials and  more.  </P> <P> * Many begonias will hang on through October if you remember to feed and water  them.  </P> <P> * Because most camellias set too many buds, thin them out now so you'll have  bigger and better blooms later on; leave no more than one bud on a tip.  </P> <P> * Cool season color can be planted now in the form of delphiniums, primroses  and columbine.  </P></p>

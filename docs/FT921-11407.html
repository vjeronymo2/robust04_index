			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Councils back wider pension scheme MORE THAN 200,000 part-time workers in local government are likely to win the right to join a pension scheme after local-authority associations agreed to back a union claim that they should be admitted. The decision by the associations representing county, metropolitan and district authorities follows years of argument by the unions that the Local Government Superannuation Scheme is discriminatory because it is not open to council staff who work fewer than 15 hours a week. Most part-time workers in local government are women. The council associations are to write to the Department of the Environment advising that the rules should be changed. Approval is expected to be given because a similar change was made recently in health service pension schemes. Separately, local-government unions claimed a breakthrough in their campaign for shorter hours when Kirkcaldy council, in east Scotland, agreed to a 36-hour week for 880 manual workers. The agreement to reduce hours from 39 a week is one of the first to be negotiated at a UK local authority since employers agreed as part of last year's national pay deal that they would negotiate to introduce a 37-hour week by January 1994. Measures to make it self-financing might include the introduction of monthly rather than weekly pay. The council associations' move on pensions was welcomed by Mr Donald Macgregor, national officer at the GMB general union. He said it would benefit thousands of council employees. 'It means that our members are on the road to being treated with the respect they deserve.' Local authorities have resisted the inclusion of part-timers in the pension scheme partly because of cost implications. However, many councils believe that maintaining the status quo is unfair. Some are also doubtful whether it will increase costs because they believe many part-timers will choose not to join the pension scheme. One reason is that any pension could affect social security benefits after retirement. The Tate Gallery, the British Museum and the main part of the British Library will be closed to the public today as London civil servants stage a one-day strike over pay. Jobcentres, unemployment benefit offices, the passport office and ministries will also be affected by the strike called by the CPSA and NUCPS Civil Service unions in protest against the government's refusal to raise London weighting. Union members will also picket the entrance to Downing Street, which includes the home of the chancellor of the exchequer, who is responsible for Civil Service pay.</p>

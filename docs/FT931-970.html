			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: VNU hit by provision on printing unit VNU, the Dutch publisher, said a large provision needed for its printing division caused 1992 net profit to tumble by nearly 60 per cent to Fl 47.9m (Dollars 26.2m). The company, which is engaged in talks on trying to sell part of its printing operations, said it planned to maintain its dividend at Fl 3.60 because the Fl 80m printing provision was a one-off item and also because most of its businesses saw improved performances last year. If it had not been for the provision, VNU's net profit would have risen by just under 10 per cent to Fl 127.9m. VNU, which released its figures after the close of bourse trading, said the value of its printing operations had had to be 'substantially adjusted' to reflect changed prospects. It cited in particular the series of currency devaluations elsewhere in Europe which have affected export markets. Operating profit rose by 18.2 per cent to Fl 241.2m, on turnover that was steady at Fl 2.74bn. VNU attributed the profit rise to reorganisations and cost-cutting measures as well as to lower paper prices and profits contributed by acquisitions.</p>

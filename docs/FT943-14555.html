			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Knapp ready to escalate strikes The RMT transport union's executive is expected to announce details today of an escalation of the railway signalling dispute with a move to two strike-days a week from July 24. With no sign of an early return to negotiations with Railtrack at Acas, the conciliation service, the union's leaders are becoming reconciled to a drawn-out conflict. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT general secretary, said that yesterday's strike had been solidly supported by signal workers. 'Even on Railtrack's dubious figures, four-fifths of trains were not running,' he said. 'Services that were running were little more than cosmetic in some parts of the country, with services starting late and finishing early.' Mr Knapp said managers and supervisors had been dragooned into signalboxes. He suggested that safety guidelines were being stretched to breaking point as Railtrack tried to defeat the strike by using staff with no previous knowledge of signalbox working. He said the RMT was pursuing ways of using the law, including injunctions, to block 'unsafe' working practices by Railtrack. Railtrack and British Rail said they had achieved their target of running about 3,000 trains, one-fifth of the usual number. InterCity expresses ran through to Birmingham New Street instead of stopping at Birmingham International. Great Western said more travellers were using its trains than on previous Wednesdays. The rail stoppage is producing benefits for some airlines. British Midland has gained 1,000 to 1,500 passengers on each strike day as travellers unable to get to Gatwick and Stansted airports by train have switched to Heathrow, which can be reached by Underground. But the Freight Transport Association, whose members generate 90 per cent of rail freight traffic, said that the strikes were damaging the image of the railway just when the opening of the Channel tunnel was making rail shipments more attractive.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Steel plant closure cuts 200 jobs UES STEELS, part of the UES Holdings joint venture between British Steel and GKN, plans to close its steelmaking plant at Rotherham, with the loss of at least 200 jobs. The company yesterday blamed continuing European overcapacity in recent years for the shutdown. It also said scrap and electricity prices had risen much faster than inflation, and it was unable to recover the extra costs by raising prices because of market conditions. The Templeborough plant, which employs 260 people, produces continuously cast steel billets for re-rolling within UES Steels and by outside customers. It will close at the end of this year and production will be transferred to UES Steels' two larger plants at Aldwarke, also in Rotherham, and Stocksbridge, near Sheffield. Depending on market conditions, the transfer might create between 40 and 50 jobs, UES said. 'This necessary step is being taken in order that UES Steels can retain its present position as a leading European producer and as a competitive source of engineering steels for UK manufacturing industry,' the company added. The engineering steels produced by UES are used in the automotive industry as forgings for crankshafts and gears. The steel is also re-rolled into bars that are machined to make other automotive parts. Although car sales in the UK are rising, the continental European market remains depressed. UES said about 45 per cent of its steel sales went to the Continent. The closure at Templeborough will reduce employment in UES Steels to about 4,000 by the end of this year, compared with about 6,700 four years ago.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Late Thursday evening French Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe summed up the results of three-hour talks with his Russian  counterpart Andrey Kozyrev by saying Paris is in favor of Moscow  enjoying a special status in relations with NATO.    Kozyrev, in turn, described cooperation between Moscow and  Paris as a mainstay for new Europe. He hoped Juppe's official  visit to Moscow would contribute to the cordial understanding  between the two countries and would help remove objections to  the conclusion of a formal agreement between Russia and the  European Union. France opposed, among other things, the export  of nuclear materials.    Juppe hoped he would be able to convince the other  member-nations of the European Union to voice their own view of  the problem, with the result that the European Union and Russia  would, after all, sign an agreement. He said France favors an  agreement between Russia and the European Union.    Juppe thanked the Russian leaders for help in the efforts to  release eleven French nationals in Bosnia. The French were  taken hostage on a humanitarian mission near Sarajevo.    Kozyrev thanked France for help in the evacuation of Russian  citizens from Yemen.    Kozyrev said that in addition to bilateral relations he and  Juppe discussed some international issues, including the Bosnian  developments. Both felt that more pressure must be exerted on  the conflicting communities for the sake of a cease-fire.    In response to a question from Interfax, Kozyrev said that  Moscow assigned priority to relations with France. He described  his French counterpart as a good friend and a remarkably  cultured and intelligent person.    It would be premature, Kozyrev said in response to another  question from Interfax, to try to prognosticate the impact of  Kiev-Crimea relations on relations between Kiev and Moscow.    Kozyrev declined comment on the recent killing of three  Russian citizens in Algeria. He told a French newsman that the  situation in Algeria was very complicated.    Kozyrev and Juppe agreed to have a hotline between the  Moscow  Kremlin and the French Elysee. The two Foreign Ministers  exchanged also exchanged [as received] archive materials.  France received part of the French archives which, due to a  variety of reasons, fell into Moscow's hands, and Russia  received some Russian archives which had been in France.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 19 (XINHUA) -- China onshore oil  production this year is projected to be 140 million tons and  that of natural gas 16 billion cubic meters, China's top oil  official said today.    These figures, released by Wang Tao, president of the China  National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), at a national oil work  conference here today, are both higher than the government-set  output targets.    This is an effort to match the development of the oil  industry to the demand of the country's rapid economic growth,  Wang told the conference.    He described the situation of the oil industry as "good",  although it falls short of demand and has become one of the  bottlenecks of the national economy.    China produced 139 million tons of crude and 15.9 billion  cubic meters of natural gas, thanks to strengthened exploration  and development of oil fields. However, the ever-expanding  demand has pushed China onto the verge of becoming a "net oil  importer."    Wang called for intensive exploration for additional  resources to prepare China for the next century. China expects  to extract 200 million tons of oil and gas in oil equivalent by  the year 2000, according to an ambitious plan.    To this end, China has embarked on a strategy of stabilizing  the production in the eastern part of China and developing  reserves in the western part.    The eastern part of China, which includes such important oil  fields as Daqing, Shengli and Liaohe, is China's main oil  producer.    CNPC will invest billions of yuan in a bid to maintain the  production level in the eastern part of the country. New  technology and management will be adopted in the Daqing oilfield  in order to keep its annual oil output well above 55 million  tons up to the turn of the century.    The western part of China, especially the Xinjiang Uygur  Autonomous Region, is regarded as a key alternative. Its crude  output for the first time topped 10 million tons for the first  time [as received] in 1993.    This year the figure is expected to rise to 11.9 million  tons, Wang said. Exploration will be carried out both  intensively and extensively, he added.    CNPC is striving to strike a balance between oil output and  new recoverable reserves and between capital input and output,  according to Wang. As the government eases off restrictions on  oil prices, the industry has wiped out red inks. However, Wang  warned against high cost and low efficiency in oil production.    Wang welcomed the participation in oil exploration and  development by other sectors, enterprises, localities, people  from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, overseas Chinese and foreign  investors.    CNPC has announced the second round of international bidding  for risk exploration in 26 blocks and 11 projects to enhance oil  recovery in the existing oilfields.    Preparatory work for the third round bidding is to start  soon  and more blocks in southwestern and western China are expected  to open to foreign bidders.    Wang admitted that China's oil will not be able to meet the  demand by the year 2000. He said crude import will depend on  economic growth but China still needs to sell some oil abroad  for foreign currency, technology and equipment.</p>

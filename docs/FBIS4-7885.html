			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ekaterina Kazasova] </F>   [Text] Sofia, April 5 (BTA) -- The National Council for  Tripartite Cooperation (of the government, labour organizations  and employers) today adopted a draft decree pertaining to the  control on the prices of prime necessities. The social partners  approved a proposal of Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov  envisaging to add another 12 items in the list of  government-monitored goods. The goods to be enlisted are all  foods, including sunflower oil, cow's butter, yellow cheese,  eggs, sugar, sausages, baby foods and legumens. The draft  amendment was adopted in connection with the April 1 entry into  effect of the value-added tax (VAT).    The persistent upward trend of the US dollar and the entry  into force of the VAT pushed the prices markedly up. "We  believe the current price rise to be the last one this year,"  Deputy Prime Minister and acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev  told journalists. He also said that this was part of the  cabinet's strategy for the budget's utilization and introduction  of VAT. Today, however, he denied that there was any price shock  whatsoever, citing figures of the Committee on Prices, according  to which the price growth was only negligible. The prices of  goods monitored by the cabinet went up by less than 6 percent  over the last two weeks of March, according to data of the  National Statistical Institute. Anyway, the consumer is free to  choose what to believe: the figures or what he sees with his  own eyes when shopping.    The social partners turned down a proposal made by the  Confederation of the Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria to  declare a moratorium on the rise of the maximum prices set by  the government on electricity, heating, fuels, postal services  and telecommunications. Freezing prices could only make some  goods vanish from the market, according to Mr. Mincho Koralski,  representative of the Union for Private Economic Enterprise at  the Tripartite Council. Enterprises will either stop making  them or will make them for export only, he said.    Widening the range of government-monitored goods to include  goods whose prices had been deregulated is accepted as a  temporary measure by the social partners. According to them, it  will help curb inflation and will be effective only until prices  and the market stabilize. All council members backed the  decision, though some expressed reservations.    Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev believes the measures  approved by the Tripartite Council would allow to tighten price  control by the local authorities. So far it has been exercised  chiefly by the Finance Ministry and the Pricing Committee. The  latter, however, has not enough people on its staff to exercise  effective control. The draft decree envisages that the  municipalities' rights will be expanded, allowing them to use  fines paid by violators to hire more full-time and part-time  employees and exercise stricter price control.    Today's decision of the Tripartite Council is years late,  said Mincho Koralski. In his view, the decree will not solve  all problems. Its potential is very limited and it will have a  minimal effect, Mr. Koralski said. That is why the social  partners insist that the government ask parliament to put on its  priority list the Price Bill approved by the Tripartite Council  and the government a year ago. The social partners also call on  the government to come up with a pricing policy concept for  1994. The government is expected to adopt the decree at its  next meeting.</p>

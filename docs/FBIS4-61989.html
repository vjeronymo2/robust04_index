			<p>BFN     [Text] The process of forming a national army is going on  at a fast pace, Georgian Defence Minister Vardiko Nadibaidze  told INTERFAX on Wednesday [11 May]. He said the main focus was  on discipline and arms procurement rather than show.    The minister went on to say that until recently, there was  no  regular army as such and the notions such as "brigade, corps or  regiment" were used in a loose way leading to Georgia's defeat  in the Abkhazian war.    "Without a single command center, it is impossible to  achieve  any success," Nadibaidze said. And he added that to the best of  his knowledge, as many as three Georgian commanders were in  charge of military operations in Abkhazia.    He thinks the national army formed by conscription must  consist of six or eight separate contingents (armor, motor  rifle, artillery, air, and naval units), 1,000 to 1,500-strong  each. "More importantly, they must be mobile and well-trained",  said the minister.    On the Abkhaz conflict, Nadibaidze said he was in favor of a  political rather than military solution with Russian troops  playing a major role, especially in providing security  guarantees to returning refugees.    On the relationship between the Georgian and Russian armies,  Nadibaidze said questions of military cooperation were outlined  in the appropriate bilateral accords. Initially, this includes  the training of Georgian military experts in Russia and supply  of weapons and hardware to the national army. "Parts of those  joint plants are being implemented," he said.    Formerly deputy commander of Russian troops in  Transcaucasia,  Nadibaidze was nominated by Eduard Shevardnadze and appointed by  parliament as the country's new defense minister on 26 April.    He was sworn in as minister after a farewell ceremony by  Russian troops in Tbilisi on 9 May.</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / US says raid serves as warning to terrorists: Iraqi intelligence capacity 'crippled' in Baghdad strike PRESIDENT Bill Clinton said yesterday that the weekend US missile strike on Baghdad was intended as a warning, not only to Iraq but to all governments which fostered terrorism. Mr Clinton said he had been advised that Iraqi intelligence capacity in Baghdad, target of the raid, had been crippled. The US claims that a plan to assassinate former President George Bush in Kuwait in April had been drawn up in the Iraqi intelligence headquarters. One side of the main 10-storey block has virtually collapsed and the adjoining six-storey building had most of its roof blown away. But the nearby communications tower was unscathed. Foreign diplomats in Baghdad said yesterday there was deepening despair in the population, who had hoped that Mr Clinton's arrival in the White House might bring a change in US attitudes and an easing of sanctions. They said the missile strike had come as a shock to most Iraqis, though some retaliation had been expected by the Baghdad regime following allegations of Iraqi complicity in the plot to kill Mr Bush. US reconnaissance aircraft had been seen over the capital for the two days preceding the attack. Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, in a television interview amplifying Mr Clinton's warning, said any country contemplating a terrorist action against the US 'now know that if they do that they're going to get a response'. Apart from Iraq, US concerns are mostly directed at Iran and Sudan. Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, complained on Sunday that too many US allies are 'doing too much trading' with Iran, thereby assisting the build-up of its military capability, possibly including nuclear ambitions. The Sudanese connection has been highlighted by last week's arrest in New Jersey of an alleged terrorist cell numbering several Sudanese nationals and linked to the outspoken cleric, Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman, who arrived in the US in 1991 from Khartoum. The New York Times reported yesterday senior administration officials, including Ms Janet Reno, the attorney-general, had intervened with the FBI not to arrest the sheikh, partly on the grounds of questionable evidence against him and partly because he was felt to be more useful at liberty as a source of information on Islamic terrorism. One official was quoted as saying that if it could be proved that Iran and/or Sudan was behind the New Jersey group then the US response would be put in the hands of the Pentagon. Mr Clinton's decision to launch missiles against Iraq has continued to win general approval, with one instant poll recording support of two-thirds of the public. In his brief comments promising that there would be an 'aggressive' response to terrorism, the president also said he wanted 'to move on to other matters,' specifically his domestic economic agenda and preparation for next week's summit in Tokyo of the Group of Seven leading economic nations. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, was forced to defend the government's support for the attack on Baghdad, insisting that it was a 'justified and proportionate' response. In an emergency statement to the House of Commons, he came under fire from opposition MPs who declared that the action should not have had the backing of the UK. Spokesmen for both the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties warned of its damaging impact on the role of the United Nations. Other MPs, including some Conservative backbenchers, voiced concern about the effect of the attack on relations between western powers and the more moderate Arab regimes.

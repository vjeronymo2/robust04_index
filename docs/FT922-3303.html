			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / The Ferranti Saga: Group sells its soul to save a shadow FERRANTI International is a shadow of its former self. It has struggled on since 1989 by selling bits of itself - including parts that were its pride and soul. Disposals, together with cuts in its remaining activities, have reduced it to about 5,000 employees, less than a quarter of the workforce when the International Signal and Control scandal broke. Turnover, which was then about Pounds 1bn, is expected to have dropped to below Pounds 400m for the year ended March 31. Ferranti shares, which in 1989 reached 113 1/2 p, have traded this year in a range between 3 1/2 p and 13p. Mr Eugene Anderson, the former Johnson Matthey chief executive who took over as chairman in February 1990, is still trying to turn the company around. It continues to make losses, although analysts expect 1991-1992 figures to improve on the previous year's operating loss of Pounds 84m. The company's debt, which in 1990-1991 was cut by almost two-thirds to less than Pounds 100m, is also expected to show a reduction. Two years ago Ferranti obtained Pounds 47m from shareholders in an underwritten rights issue. The next year it won Pounds 40m from auditors Peat Marwick in settlement of a legal action arising out of its merger, in 1987, with ISC. But principally it has had to resort to selling its assets - including, in March 1990, its Edinburgh-based defence systems division, to its arch-rival GEC. In the division were Ferranti's airborne radar operations, dating back to the Second World War and now including the project leadership for the radar to equip the European Fighter Aircraft, along with other top Ferranti defence products, from inertial navigation systems to night-vision goggles. After contesting the Pounds 270m it paid in the deal, GEC has since also taken over the missile-making activity which was a focus of Ferranti's recent ambitions - based on one large and secretive contract, inherited from ISC, to develop a sophisticated range of air-launched weapons for the United Arab Emirates. Other disposals include Ferranti's Italian offshoot and a half-share in its naval sonar business, now a joint venture with Thomson-CSF. This has since suffered a further setback with cancellation of one of its main projects for Royal Navy diesel-electric submarines. Ferranti's civil side - including industrial control systems for clients such as oil companies and power generators and computer-based systems for airports and emergency services - has increased proportionately, from about 25 per cent to 40 per cent of sales. The Ferranti name also lives on in GEC Ferranti Defence Systems in Edinburgh, although it is wholly owned by GEC. It remains the area's largest manufacturing employer, but numbers have shrunk 30 per cent since Ferranti's time to 4,800. A more rigorous regime is now in place. 'People still look at it as the old Ferranti firm,' says one senior manager. 'But it isn't any more.'</p>

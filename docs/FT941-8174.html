			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Observer: Celtic manoeuvres BAT Industries doesn't seem to be having much luck hanging on to the investment chieftains of its Allied Dunbar insurance operations. First Hugh Jenkins (a Welshman) jumps ship to run the investment side of the Prudential. Now Ken Inglis (a Scot) is off to rejoin his old countrymen at Flemings, despite being offered the prize of running the much bigger combined Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar fund management business. Surely, a politically incorrect company like BAT can tell its headhunters that only English fund managers will be considered for the vacant post of its investment supremo.</p>

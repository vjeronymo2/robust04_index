			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CENSORING SCHOOLBOOKS  </P> <P> As a sixth-grade teacher who has taught some of the "detestable" stories and  poems in the "Impressions" literature series, I find the recent reactionary ban  sweeping across our state and country to be quite hypocritical ("Are Kids Ready  for Literature?" Part A, Dec. 13).  </P> <P> Considering that 50 million illiterate adults inhabit our country, the  publishers of the "Impressions" series should not be vilified but praised for  trying to get reluctant readers interested and/or hooked on reading. The  purpose of any anthology is to expose its reader to different types of  literature. Students in my classes sample different authors and genres from  Shel Silverstein to Shakespeare. And although their responses range from "Can  we read some more?" to "Can we read something else?" I feel that I have  succeeded as long as the habit of reading becomes a part of a daily routine.  </P> <P> And frankly speaking, a 5-minute poem on "excreta eating pigs" or carnivorous  witches doing damage to the children of these "concerned" parents pales in  comparison to some of the real dangers of our educational system and society,  such as these "involved" guardians owning televisions, cable and VCRs who will  expose their children to more than 13,000 murders and other acts of violence by  the time they are 12, or sending them off to school with lunch money to buy  cafeteria food saturated in fats and carcinogens, or allowing them to live in  an environment where breathing the air limits their lung capacity 25%.  </P> <P> It is my most sincere wish that the next time these indignant parents get  together to rally around something it will be about an issue more compelling  than a few innocuous poems and stories.  </P> <P> ALFEE ENCISO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

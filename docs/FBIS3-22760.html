			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Defense Research and Development Organization  has described yesterday's successful test firing of the Agni  missile as a technology achievement. It said the indigenously  developed surface-to-surface intermediate-range missile, which  was launched from Chandipur in Orissa yesterday evening, met all  the test objectives. A report issued on the flight today said  the third flight of the Agni validated the innovative indigenous  design feature aimed at testing the longer range and advanced  maneuverability during the reentry phase. The flight tested the  high thermal and structural capability of the vehicle which  undergoes great stress at the reentry stage while moving at a  hypersonic speed. The reentry stage takes place at about 30 km  above the earth surface and the outside of the vehicle gets  heated to about 3,000 degree Celsius. However, the inside  temperature of the vehicle is maintained at 40 degree Celsius.  The Defense Ministry release said that the Agni payload  performed to the design specifications with great accuracy. It  was a fiery spectacle as it hit the target. The successful test  reaffirmed the country's capability in advanced technology.</p>

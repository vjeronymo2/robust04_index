			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi 31 May -- It has become known to IBERIA NEWS  AGENCY that the Helsinki Union of Georgia [political  organization created by late president Zviad Gamsakhurdia] has  addressed a statement to ethnic Georgians exiled from the  Abkhazian and Samachablo regions. The statement says:    "Regarded from the current historic point, it can be  confidently said that devastating developments in the Abkhazian  region in 1992-93 have been the largest tragedy for 200 years of  Georgia's slavery under the Russian yoke of oppression. Every  one of us can clearly understand that the effect of the tragedy  is disastrous for the Georgian state and the Georgian nation.    We have to make a final inference: Who is our real enemy,  who is hiding beyond Abkhaz and Ossetian militants armed with  the newest military equipment and who is actually governing  Georgia's policy?    There is only one answer: The Russian empire, which managed  to occupy and annex not only Abkhazia and Samachablo, but the  whole Georgia as well, and which, by means of puppet regimes in  Tbilisi, Tskhinvali, and Gudauta-Sukhumi, carries out the  genocide of Georgians, tears a united body of the Georgian state  and encroaches upon the state independence achieved by peaceful  means. Every agreement concluded with the alleged mediation of  Russia has served this aim and created a foundation for the  estrangement of the Samachablo and Abkhazian regions.    It may be assumed that a list of anti-Georgian wrecking  activities of the puppet regime has not been exhausted. The  policy presently conducted in Samegrelo [Russian: Mingreliya]  creates grounds for bloody provocation at the Enguri river and  augurs the continuation of the genocide of Georgians and  disastrous effect for the whole Georgia."</p>

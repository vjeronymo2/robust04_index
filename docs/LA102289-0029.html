			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCK 'N' ROIL: DEBATES ON WHO'S NO. 1, RACISM, SEXISM AND CRITICISM  </P> <P> Robert Hilburn hit it right on the nose when referring to the Stones of the  1970s, saying that other bands made better albums and or exerted more influence  but couldn't overcome the Stones' dominance in terms of historical importance  and fame.  </P> <P> All politicians, fighters and rock bands have high and low periods, and that is  to be expected. But very few can stand the test of time.  </P> <P> Guns N' Roses may be considered the best rock 'n' roll band around today, but  it's the Rolling Stones who still are called the greatest rock 'n' roll band in  the world.  </P> <P> ERIK HOFFMANN  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

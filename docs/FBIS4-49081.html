			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Tao (0719 3447): "At Political Work </F> Meeting Held by PLA General Logistics Department, Director Fu  Quanyou Stresses Need To Strengthen Ideological and Political  Work"]    [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--The ideological  and political work on the logistics front must be closely linked  with professional work in all aspects with the aims of providing  "effective guarantees and support," fully arousing the  initiative and creativity of all quarters, and ensuring the  smooth fulfillment of the Army's tasks. This point was stressed  by Fu Quanyou, member of the Central Military Commission and  director of the General Logistics Department, at today's  political work meeting of the General Logistics Department.    Fu Quanyou pointed out: The in-depth development of reform  and opening requires us to do ideological and political work  more effectively; improve education in socialism, patriotism,  revolutionary heroism, and fine tradition; strive to enhance the  ideological and moral quality of the troops; and to guide  officers and servicemen to establish a correct outlook on life  and a set of correct values.    Fu Quanyou stressed: Arming the minds of officers and men  with Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and unifying the thinking and action of the  troops according to this theory, is the primary task in our  present ideological and political work. At all times and in all  circumstances, we must guarantee that the troops will resolutely  obey the orders of the party Central Committee and the Central  Military Commission, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and  must effectively guarantee the smooth implementation of the  political and military orders. For the General Logistics  Department, the results of the ideological and political work  should find expression in the fulfillment of all professional  tasks, especially in the enhancement of the support capacity and  combat effectiveness of the troops. It is necessary to  seriously implement the military strategical principles for the  new period, actively converge with the market economy, deepen  reforms in the logistics work of the armed forces, and strive to  enhance the overall level of the logistics work. The troops  should be prompted, through ideological education, to carry  forward the five types of revolutionary spirit advocated by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the "64-character" pioneering spirit  set out by Comrade Jiang Zemin. More effective work should be  done to improve the party style and to keep the troops  incorruptible. In particular, people responsible for managing  money and materials must be kept under effective supervision.  Cadres, especially leading cadres at all levels, should be  prompted through ideological education to maintain the style of  hard work, to take pride in working honestly and incorruptibly,  not to seek personal gain and fame, to live plainly and work  diligently, and to make selfless dedications. At the same  meeting, Zhou Keyu, political commissar of the General Logistics  Department, made a speech on striving for solid results in  ideological education and on prompting political cadres to keep  a good image. Wang Tailai, deputy director of the General  Logistics Department, and Xu Sheng, deputy political commissar  of the General Logistics Department, also attended the meeting.</p>

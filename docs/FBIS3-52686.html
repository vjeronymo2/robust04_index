Tanks and aircraft will be involved in the pursuit of  fugitives whom the government believes were behind recent acts  of violence in the governorate.    Originally scheduled for last week, the campaign was  postponed--and might be deferred again--until the  end-of-the-year tourism season is over. [passage omitted]</p>

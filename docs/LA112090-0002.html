			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DOMINATOR EWING EYES ROLE OFF COURT  </P> <P> Dominating games has become second nature. Patrick Ewing does it naturally. He  scores, he rebounds, he blocks shots. He is almost unstoppable offensively and  impenetrable defensively.  </P> <P> His effect on his team's success is as great as any player's in the National  Basketball Association. In a very large way, Patrick Ewing is the New York  Knicks. And the Knicks are Patrick Ewing's.  </P> <P> The bond continues to grow, but as it does, the relationship becomes more  complicated. The Knicks have asked for big statistics from Ewing, and he has  provided them. The Knicks have asked for leadership from Ewing, and he has  begun to give it to them.  </P> <P> In return, Ewing wants respect and cash. He has demanded a huge contract and  although no dollar figures have been leaked, it is safe to assume Ewing wants  to be the highest-paid player in the game.  </P> <P> Ewing is in the sixth season of a 10-year contract that will pay him more than  $30 million, but unless he is one of the four highest-paid players in the game,  he could become a restricted free agent at the end of this season. Ewing is  earning $4.2 million, but by the end of this season, he will not be among the  top four.  </P> <P> Ewing also wants the off-court respect accorded a player of his stature. He  would like to be more involved in some of the important decisions made by the  team. He would like to be the elder statesman, the player team owners consult  when they are contemplating a significant move. Before the Los Angeles Lakers  make a big deal, Lakers owner Jerry Buss asks for input from Magic Johnson.  Before the Detroit Pistons make a big move, Pistons owner Bill Davidson  consults with Isiah Thomas.  </P> <P> Ewing said that is not the case in New York.  </P> <P> "No," he said, "unfortunately that doesn't happen here. I'd love for them to  come to me. I think they need to make the effort."  </P> <P> Knicks officials say the opposite is true. After the season ends, Ewing is not  always available. In the past, it has been difficult to get Ewing to attend  face-to-face meetings, where General Manager Al Bianchi said every player is  asked for input on the team.  </P> <P> When Coach Stu Jackson wanted to discuss Ewing asserting himself in a  leadership role, Jackson had to drive to Ewing's home in Washington, D.C.,  twice to discuss it with him. Jackson said Ewing is becoming more of a force in  the organization, but that this is only Ewing's sixth season and it is not  unusual for such a role to develop slowly.  </P> <P> "That's a new area for him," Jackson said, "and it's one that I think myself as  well as management would encourage him to do. We're a team this year, but he's  our superstar. And I think anything he says will be listened to. He's not done  it in the past. ... but with guys like Isiah and (Michael) Jordan, that's come  over time. It's something that is steadily built. In Patrick's case, it will  continue to build each year. It's not something that just happens instantly.  Even Magic had to work his way into that role. It didn't take him quite as long  as most people, but he's Magic."  </P> <P> With the Knicks, however, there are obstacles that prevent Ewing from having  the type of close relationship with the owner that Johnson or Thomas has. The  Knicks are owned by Madison Square Garden. Madison Square Garden is owned by  Paramount Communications. Each group is run by an executive. Paramount is owned  by Marvin Davis. MSG is run by Richard Evans.  </P> <P> But the Knicks are run by the MSG Sports Group, whose president is Jack Diller.  And although Diller is involved in the most important dealings by the Knicks,  he allows Bianchi to run the basketball team.  </P> <P> The corporate structure is not conducive to creating a close player-owner  relationship because the person in charge either has to report to someone  higher, or defer to someone lower. Perhaps it is that lack of closeness caused  by a corporate setup that led to a situation where Ewing said he was "insulted"  by the Knicks' most recent contract offer.  </P> <P> Yet it is the corporate setup that should make Ewing feel confident of getting  a lucrative contract. As Bianchi said of Paramount Communications and MSG,  "These people are very good business people. They are very bright, and they are  aware of Patrick's value and who he is and what he is. We have all the  expertise in the world, plus we have the means to pay him."  </P> <P> Ewing said he prefers not to talk anymore about his contract status.  </P> <P> "I don't have a lack of confidence," Ewing said. "The Knicks have been good to  me during my six years here. I said what I felt I had to say about my contract  situation, and I'm just going to leave it at that."  </P> <P> But even though he denies having a lack of confidence in the Knicks, his words  indicate otherwise. Not only did he speak out on the contract, but last week  during the Knicks' 3-1 West Coast road trip, he admitted he was frustrated with  the Knicks' inability to compete for a championship.  </P> <P> Ewing, however, has done an excellent job of playing through any disappointment  he might feel. Not only does he play hard, but every aspect of his game  continues to develop.  </P> <P> Last year he increased his scoring by more than 25 percent from the previous  season. He also averaged more than 10 rebounds for the first time in his  career. He made the All-NBA first team for the first time.  </P> <P> This season he leads the league in blocked shots with an average of 4.78. He  has made a subtle yet significant improvement in court awareness, more actively  looking for the open man when he is double-teamed.  </P> <P> But even more significant is that Ewing has asserted himself as the team leader  for the first time. In the past, club officials said they wished he would  become more of a leader, but that he was more likely to lead by actions than  words.  </P> <P> That has changed. This season Ewing constantly has pumped up his teammates and  gone out of his way to encourage and motivate them. They have noticed the  change.  </P> <P> "He has to make us feel good about ourselves," guard Trent Tucker said. "When  he comes by and says, 'Good job,' that gives us that extra confidence that we  need. In a basketball game, confidence can waver very easily. You can be very  confident in the first half, and in the second half you can lose it. So when  your best player is for you and telling you that you can get the job done, that  keeps you more confident. He's a great player, and a team player."  </P> <P> Ewing obviously has asserted himself in many areas. If he and the organization  are willing, there still is room to grow.  </P></p>

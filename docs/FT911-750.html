			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Software's test of strength ERRORS in software could be costing British companies millions of pounds a year because data processing departments fail to test applications rigorously, according to a new survey. The report carried out for the UK arm of the software testing specialist Compuware, of Michigan, surveyed more than 600 IBM mainframe sites in the UK. It revealed that while simple and routine testing was being carried out on most sites, complex software testing was being overlooked. While 86 per cent of sites routinely undertook testing of a new program in isolation and 93 per cent undertook testing to ensure the new program worked with existing software, only 32 per cent of sites tested the software when a program was adapted. Compuware: US, 313 737 7300; UK, 0582 477555.</p>

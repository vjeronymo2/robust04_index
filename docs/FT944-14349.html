			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Singapore quizzes US academic The US and Singapore are at loggerheads over the case of a Singapore-based American academic, only months after arguing over Singapore's caning of a US teenager. Mr Christopher Lingle, professor of European studies at the National University of Singapore, has been questioned by police over an article in the International Herald Tribune referring to 'intolerant regimes' in east Asia. The authorities say he is being investigated for possible contempt of court and criminal defamation. The US State Department expressed disappointment about 'this apparent attempt by Singaporean authorities to intimidate Professor Lingle'.</p>

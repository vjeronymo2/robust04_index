			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Cerus trims losses to FFr97m CERUS, the French holding company controlled by Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian industrialist, managed to trim its net losses to FFr97m (Dollars 16.7m) in the first half of 1993 from FFr377m in the same period in 1992. This was mainly due to a cut in the deficit of Banque Dumenil Leble, its banking subsidiary. The problems of Banque Dumenil, which has been affected by the difficulties of its Swiss branch and turmoil in the French money markets, have clouded Cerus for two years. However, Cerus raised FFr1.4bn during the first half by selling its 3.1 per cent stake in Suez, the French industrial and financial holding company. The proceeds of the sale were used to finance a FFr1.3bn recapitalisation of Banque Dumenil and to reduce Cerus's net debt. The recapitalisation, which resulted in Cerus taking full control of Banque Dumenil, helped the latter reduce its interim net loss to FFr39m in the first six months of this year from FFr374m at the same stage of 1992 . The other main French investment held by Cerus, which is 49 per cent owned by Mr de Benedetti through CIR, his holding company, is a 35.4 per cent stake in Valeo, the car parts group.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Thai force dissolved Mr Anand Panyarachun, Thai prime minister, yesterday relieved his top military man of the task of maintaining internal security following the army shootings of pro-democracy demonstrators in May, Reuter reports from Bangkok. Government House said Mr Anand had issued an executive order dissolving the Internal Peace-Keeping Force, a branch of the military established in 1978 to intervene in domestic crises. Units attached to the force, which was under the direct control of supreme military commander Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, were involved in the Bangkok shootings, when soldiers opened fire on unarmed protesters, killing scores and injuring hundreds. The announcement said maintaining order would now be the job of the interior ministry, which runs the police.</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> PARENTS FIGHT NEW SCHOOL BOUNDARIES  </P> <P> A plan that would change the boundaries of three elementary schools in the  Westminster School District to balance enrollments at each campus will be the  topic of a public hearing May 17.  </P> <P> The three schools are Iva Meairs, Midway City and H.B. Anderson.  </P> <P> Student populations at Meairs and Midway City are both overcrowded, while  Anderson is about 100 students below capacity, said Supt. Keith W. Lawson.  </P> <P> Sally Gilmore, principal at Meairs, said her school has added portable  classrooms but is still overcrowded by about 50 to 60 students. Midway City  Elementary is overcrowded by about 25 students, Lawson said.  </P> <P> Anderson Principal John Sessums said his school would welcome more students and  told parents at a hearing last week about the school's programs.  </P> <P> But at a public hearing last week, parents opposed the boundary changes because  they would require children to walk further and force them to cross the busy  intersection at Westminster Boulevard and Newland Street.  </P> <P> The board reached an informal consensus that the school boundaries would not be  altered without busing the students.  </P></p>

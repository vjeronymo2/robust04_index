			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS: DAMEWORTH GOES THE DISTANCE  </P> <P> When Bryan Dameworth of Agoura High School began his running career at age 12,  the first race he ran was 200 meters.  </P> <P> Fortunately, for Dameworth, he found he was not a sprinter. His performance in  that race was so disheartening that he decided to begin training as a distance  runner.  </P> <P> "I only started running distance because I wasn't successful at the shorter  distances," Dameworth said. "I started to like running distance only because I  seemed to do better."  </P> <P> Now, nearly seven years later, Dameworth has made the most of that decision. He  has become one of the best prep distance runners in the nation. His  credentials:  </P> <P>  -- Last month, he concluded an undefeated senior cross-country season with a  victory in the Kinney nationals in San Diego, after having finished fourth as a  junior.  </P> <P>  -- He finished eighth in the 1986 West regional, becoming the first freshman  male ever to qualify for the Kinney national meet, where he finished 19th.  </P> <P>  -- He has won three consecutive state Division I cross-country titles, most  recently in a state-record 14 minutes 45 seconds in November.  </P> <P>  -- He finished second in the state championship 3,200-meter run as a junior  last June.  </P> <P> Friday night, Dameworth will take his running talents inside when he competes  in the first national high school mile run at the Sunkist Invitational track  meet at the Sports Arena. "Running indoors is fun, but running on boards is  tough on your calves," Dameworth said, who last year finished third in the  Sunkist two-mile. "I am hoping that I will do well this year, but you cannot  really get ready because we do not have any access to any indoor tracks."  </P> <P> Dameworth, who will also run the mile at the Millrose Games in New York next  month, will face top competition Friday, running against Louie Quintana of  Arroyo Grande, who finished third in the Kinney national; Martin Keino of Fork  Union, Va., whose father is former Olympic medalist Kip Keino; and Danny Jordan  of Venice, who won the City mile championship last June.  </P> <P> After winning the Kinney meet Dec. 9, Dameworth took two weeks off, which  included a ski trip, before he began training again.  </P> <P> "I needed some time off after cross-country season," said Dameworth, whose  stepfather, Bill Duley, is Agoura's track coach. "It was more mental than  physical because my body is in good shape."  </P> <P> During his base training period, Dameworth runs nearly 100 miles a week, and,  once the outdoor season begins, he averages 80 miles a week and sometimes uses  Agoura dual meets as workout days.  </P> <P> "Those occasions when I run three or four races in a meet are like training  days for me," Dameworth said. "I use those days to work on my speed."  </P> <P> With his distance-running success, Dameworth is considered a top prospect for  many college track programs, and he is looking forward to running his favorite  race.  </P> <P> "They do not run the steeplechase in high school, but that is what I plan to  specialize running in college," Dameworth said, adding that he is considering  Arizona, Oregon, Colorado and UC Irvine. "I will also continue to run  cross-country, but I can't wait until I can run the steeplechase full-time."  </P> <P> Jack Dyck, boys' basketball coach at Beverly Hills High, was not happy to see  the recent rain.  </P> <P> Last Friday night, Beverly Hills was scheduled to play host to Bay League rival  Hawthorne in the "Swim Gym," which has a retractable floor over the swimming  pool. The roof is under repair and leaked in the rain, causing the game to be  moved to Hawthorne, where the Cougars handed Beverly Hills its first league  loss, 69-58.  </P> <P> "This really hurts when you have a home game moved because of rain," Dyck said.  "We now have only a tarp ceiling over the gym and whenever it rains, it leaks  on the floor."  </P> <P> Dyck and Hawthorne Coach Richard Wells agreed to move their varsity game to  Hawthorne in order to play on a regulation size floor after the freshman and  junior varsity games were played in Beverly Hills' smaller girls' gym after  rain had begun to drenched the "Swim Gym."  </P> <P> "Hawthorne's team got back on the bus and we got in some vans and we all drove  back to Hawthorne to play," Dyck said. "We were expecting a big crowd at home,  but ended up playing in front of about 50 to 75 people in their gym."  </P> <P> Beverly Hills, whose football team had to forfeit key games last fall due to a  school district teachers' strike, will travel to play Palos Verdes today and is  scheduled to play host to Torrance Friday.  </P> <P> "I can only hope that it doesn't rain for Friday," Dyck said. "I used to like  it when it rained, but now I shudder at the thought."  </P> <P> Prep Notes  </P> <P> Piper Hahn, who led Mira Costa to the girls' Division I state volleyball  championship, was named national co-player of the year by Volleyball Monthly  magazine. She shares the honor with Irene Renteria of Las Vegas Clark. Hahn, a  second-team All-American last season, was joined by three other local players  on this year's All-American team. They are Kristal Attwood of Mira Costa,  Danielle Everett of Newport Beach Corona del Mar and Taikeasha Williams of  Bellflower.  </P> <P> TIMES' BASKETBALL POLLS  </P> <P> Through Games of Jan. 14  </P> <P> BOYS  </P> <P> CITY  </P> <P> No., School, League: Record  </P> <P> 1.

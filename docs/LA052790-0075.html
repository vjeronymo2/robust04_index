			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IF CITIES CHANGE LAND-USE POLICIES, CALIFORNIANS MIGHT TAKE TO RAILS  </P> <P> On June 5, Californians will be presented with perhaps the most dramatic  opportunity ever to break their decades-long love affair with the automobile.  Two ballot measures, Propositions 108 and 116, hold out the possibility of  allocating nearly $3 billion to rail-transit projects. And Proposition 111, the  comprehensive gasoline-tax package, contains provisions likely to encourage  even more investment in rail transit.  </P> <P> If all three measures pass, the election results will be interpreted by  politicians and transportation officials as a sweeping mandate to build  rail-transit lines around the state, especially in auto-oriented Southern  California. Proposition 108 would authorize a $1-billion bond issue for  rail-transit projects; Proposition 116 would authorize another $2 billion in  rail bonds, most of it earmarked for specific projects. Proposition 111 also  contains some rail funding, and its so-called "congestion management"  provisions would require local governments to undertake traffic-reduction  efforts in order to qualify for a portion of the increased gas-tax revenue.  </P> <P> But even if all three are approved, the measures won't do much to relieve  traffic congestion and improve the quality of life in California -- unless the  vote is also interpreted as a broad mandate to change local land-use policies  so that they support transit ridership.  </P> <P> Simply approving bond issues and constructing rail lines won't guarantee people  will ride rail transit. For rail to succeed, communities must be oriented  around transit stations, with rail travel located within easy walking distance  of many jobs, stores and, especially, homes. Pedestrian-oriented communities,  with easy access between homes and rail-transit stations, are the "software"  required to make the "hardware" of rail lines succeed.  </P> <P> The reasons are obvious: Most people will ride the rails when trains are a  convenient alternative to driving. With the exception of some long-distance  commuters, virtually no one who has to get into a car to reach a rail station  is going to get out of that car and wait for a train. Most people will simply  continue driving to their destination -- and with good reason. Under such  circumstances, driving is easier, more convenient and probably faster than  taking public transit.  </P> <P> Some recent rail systems haven't come close to ridership projections. It was  projected that Miami's new rail system would carry 240,000 riders in 1988; it  drew only 35,000. Most of Miami's rail stations are accessible only by car. The  software is missing.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, California's software programmers do not appear very interested  in making the hardware work any better here. Land-use policy is a jealously  guarded prerogative of local government, and most of California's 500-plus  local governments are still pursuing land-use policies that reduce the  potential for transit ridership. Influenced by slow-growth sentiment and  frustration with traffic congestion, local politicians and planners continue to  create spread-out communities that seek to solve growth problems by minimizing  the number of new residents -- thereby maximizing dependence on the automobile.  The idea of linking new subdivisions to potential transit lines usually does  not arise.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the experience of BART in the San Francisco Bay Area suggests that  even when suburban communities do agree to create clusters of high-density  development around transit stations, they often leave out the one ingredient  that is most necessary to make a transit system work: housing. A recent study  for the Senate Office of Research found that East Bay cities, driven by fiscal  concerns, have encouraged heavy commercial development around BART stations  while discouraging housing construction. In several cities, high-density  housing projects near transit stops have been killed by neighborhood  opposition.  </P> <P> Such an approach may help maintain communities that are financially sound, but  it does nothing to alleviate traffic congestion. According to the same Senate  study, only about 10% of people who work near transit stations ride BART. By  contrast, 30%-40% of people who live near the stations use the rail system. In  terms of creating a successful transit system -- and therefore reducing traffic  congestion -- there is simply no substitute for clustering housing around  transit stops.  </P> <P> Fear of high-density housing constitutes a potent political force all over  California. Hardly a day goes by without some neighborhood group somewhere  making headlines by opposing an apartment building or condo complex, on the  ground that it threatens to undermine their current low-density way of life. In  the suburbs, all socioeconomic issues get narrowed, sooner or later, to a  debate over housing units per acre.  </P> <P> But even with opposition to high-density housing, there is still a chance for  change in local land-use policies to improve rail transit ridership -- making  rail transit work, especially in Southern California, doesn't necessarily mean  more high-density housing. In many instances it may simply mean rearranging  current land uses to encourage transit ridership.  </P> <P> Because of the high cost of land, developers and home-buyers are already being  forced to look at high-density alternatives. According to the Construction  Industry Research Board, almost 40% of all housing units built in Southern  California last year were apartments and condominiums. Most of these projects  were probably built at a density of somewhere around 20 units per acre -- not  enough to generate optimum transit ridership, but far more than the five to  seven units per acre typically found in suburban subdivisions.  </P> <P> The problem is that these apartments and condominiums, like everything else in  Southern California, are flung across the landscape on the assumption that  everyone who lives in them will drive everywhere. In urban areas as well as  distant suburbs, apartment complexes are built as walled-off fortresses  accessible only by car, even when they are built (as they often are) adjacent  to shopping centers or employment districts -- because local land-use  regulations usually require enormous parking lots, massive roads, buildings set  back from the street and all the other trappings of suburban life, even for  high-density apartments and condominiums.  </P> <P> Even if a rail-transit stop were constructed a block away from this kind of  project, only the hardiest pedestrian would brave vast parking lots and  six-lane arterial highways to get there. Some localities are beginning to  recognize the potential in combining rail transit with a more  pedestrian-oriented community life. For example, the city of Irvine plans to  convert its auto-oriented office corridor along Von Karman Avenue into a  pedestrian-oriented "Main Street." The city recently approved two new office  buildings by McDonnell Douglas Realty Co. in the Von Karman area, on the  condition that the company build a half-mile monorail from John Wayne Airport  to its buildings. The project is likely to form the basis for a countywide  monorail system.  </P> <P> But the Irvine example also reveals the shortcomings of even a farsighted local  plan. In exchange for building the monorail, McDonnell Douglas got permission  to build larger office buildings than permitted under the code. And the area  contains little housing, meaning that the McDonnell Douglas project will  probably be a duplicate of the East Bay situation: an office district clustered  around a transit stop where virtually everyone drives to work.  </P> <P> Two influential members of the state Senate -- Housing Chairman Leroy Greene  (D-Carmichael) and Transportation Chairman Quentin L. Kopp(I-San Francisco) --  are sponsoring a pilot program to encourage high-density housing around transit  stops. If the bill passes, communities that permit such housing would receive  top priority for a whole slew of state grant programs. The bill is a worthy  start toward using the state's own policies to reinforce rail-transit  ridership.  </P> <P> Potentially far more powerful are the "congestion management" provisions  contained in Proposition 111. About $6 billion in funds would become available  for local streets and roads -- but the money will be available only to local  governments that undertake traffic-reduction efforts meeting with state  approval. If it passes, Proposition 111's congestion-management provisions must  be used not only to build roads, but to encourage a shift away from  auto-oriented development.  </P> <P> California desperately needs a major commitment to rail transit, and for that  reason alone the passage of Propositions 108, 111 and 116 is imperative. But  billions of dollars will be wasted unless local land-use policies are changed  to make transit ridership easy and convenient. The mandate should not be just  to build rail lines, but also to build a different kind of California -- a  place where people who want to use rail transit don't have to get in their cars  to do so.  </P></p>

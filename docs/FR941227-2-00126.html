			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Description <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. The Policy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SROs are proposing to adopt a minimum voting rights rule that would prohibit continued listing on the NYSE or Amex, or inclusion in the Nasdaq System, of companies that disenfranchise shareholders of public common stock. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  The proposed rule states that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically: (1) the NYSE is proposing to amend its Listed Company Manual; (2) the Amex is proposing to amend its Company Guide with respect to common stock voting rights in general as well as that portion applicable to its Emerging Company Marketplace (``ECM''); and (3) the NASD is proposing to adopt a voting rights rule for the Small Cap Nasdaq segment of the Nasdaq System and to adopt an interpretive policy to be applicable to the voting rights rules in the Nasdaq National Market System (``NMS'') segment and the Small Cap Nasdaq segment of the Nasdaq System. The NMS segment currently has a voting rights rule that mirrors the language of former Rule 19c&hyph;4. By adopting the proposed Policy, the NASD will acquire more flexibility in interpreting voting rights issues for Nasdaq NMS companies and create minimum voting rights standards throughout the Nasdaq System. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Voting rights of existing shareholders of publicly traded common stock registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 cannot be disparately reduced or restricted through any corporate action or issuance of stock. Examples of such corporate action or issuance include, but are not limited to, the adoption of time-phased voting plans, the adoption of capped voting rights plans, the issuance of super voting stock, or the issuance of stock with voting rights less than the per share voting rights of the common stock through an exchange offer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Policy also contains additional guidelines as well as extensive interpretive language to supplement and clarify the application of the Policy to, among other things, (1) issuers with existing dual class structures; (2) review of past voting rights activities; and (3) foreign issuers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Policy specifies that the restriction against the issuance of super voting stock is primarily intended to apply to the issuance of a new class of super voting stock. Companies with existing dual class capital structures generally will be permitted to issue additional shares of a class of existing super voting stock consistent with the Policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, under the Policy, the SROs will continue to permit corporate actions or issuances that would have been permitted under former Rule 19c&hyph;4. In evaluating other forms of actions or issuances, the SROs will consider, among other things, the economics of the transaction and the voting rights being granted. The SROs intend to be flexible in their interpretations under the Policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the Policy encourages issuers to consult with their respective SROs prior to engaging in any action or committing to take any action that may be inconsistent with the Policy. While the Policy will continue to permit actions previously permitted under former Rule 19c&hyph;4, issuers are urged not to assume, without first discussing the matter with their respective SRO staff, that a particular issuance of common or preferred stock or the taking of some other corporate action necessarily will be consistent with the Policy. The SROs also suggest that copies of preliminary proxy or other material concerning matters subject to the Policy be furnished to the appropriate SRO for review prior to formal filing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionaly, the Policy provides for a review procedure for companies that apply to list on the NYSE or Amex, or to be included in the Nasdaq System. Under the procedure, the applicable SRO will review the issuer's past voting rights actions to determine whether another SRO has (1) found any of the issuer's actions to have been a violation or evasion of that SRO's voting rights policy, or (2) been approached by the issuer for a ruling or interpretation regarding the application of that SRO's voting rights policy with respect to a proposed transaction. Based on the above, the SRO may take any action it findings appropriate in assessing the issuer's listing application. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  Moreover, it will consider any such prior interpretations issued by other SROs in response to any request by the issuer on the same or similar transaction in making its own determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Such action includes, but is not limited to, the denial of the listing or the placing of restrictions on such listing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Proposing Release. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the Policy exempts issuances or actions by non-U.S. companies. Specifically, the SROs will accept any action or issuance relating to the voting rights structure of a foreign company that is either (1) in compliance with the SRO's requirements for domestic companies, or (2) not prohibited by the company's home country law. This is consistent with past SRO action acknowledging the need for separate treatment of foreign issuers under their qualitative listing standards. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, the NYSE and Amex waive or modify certain listing standards for foreign issuers when it can be shown that the foreign company's procedure is based on the laws, customs or practices of its home country.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24634 (June 23, 1987), 52 FR 24230.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 33611 (Feb. 23, 1993), 59 FR 10028 (March 2, 1994); and 34300 (July 1, 1994), 59 FR 35156 (July 8, 1994) (permitting foreign issuers to provide shareholders with summary annual reports in conformance with their home country practices). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

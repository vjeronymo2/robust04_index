Gdlyan, chairman of the Russian  People's Party, who is in Armenia on family business, has given  his prediction regarding the development of political events.  He put forward two possible avenues: "Zhirinovskiy may quite  possibly prefer a bloc with the Agrarians and the Communists in  order to combat the democrats. But, once it has conquered the  latter, the coalition would inevitably fall out among  themselves."    Gdlyan believes that there are definite Western forces and  mafia structures behind Zhirinovskiy. Touching on the subject  of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader's  possibly coming to Armenia, he said that he has information that  Zhirinovskiy receives financial backing from a number of  influential Armenian businessmen in Armenia as well as in Russia.</p>

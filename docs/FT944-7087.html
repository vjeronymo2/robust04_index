			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Privatisation on track - Pick of Lex / A selection of comments from this week's FT Running railways, as the US railroad barons demonstrated in the late 19th century, can prove hugely lucrative. Whether Railtrack can emulate them, or ends up a mere puffing billy, remains unclear. In theory, Railtrack should prove the former. On the cost side it can, like the utilities, make substantial post-privatisation savings. Prospects are also promising for revenues. Railtrack should significantly increase yields on its Pounds 2bn property portfolio, currently at just 7 per cent. It may also repeat BAA's trick of raising passenger spending at retail outlets at its stations. Admittedly, Railtrack's main income will initially come from fees paid by train companies for using its network, and their level will be set by a regulator. But if privatisation is successful in generating greater usage of the rail network, revenues from track fees could rise, too. With petrol prices due to increase in real terms over coming years, halting the long-term decline in rail travel may not prove the tall order that some think. If the opportunities are considerable, so also are the risks. A brake van on the company's progress will be politics. Labour, well ahead in the opinion polls, remains implacably hostile to private ownership of the railways. Although a Labour government would probably not renationalise Railtrack, it might well interfere with its regulatory framework. By contrast, while the Tories remain in power, there will be doubts about their commitment to subsidise heavily loss-making routes in the long term. Such concerns may not derail privatisation, but they could reduce the amount Railtrack fetches.</p>

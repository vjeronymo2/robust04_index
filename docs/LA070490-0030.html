			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES;  </P> <P> ABORTION GROUP BACKS 3 DEMOCRATS  </P> <P> The California Abortion Rights Action League threw its weight behind three  Democratic candidates for statewide office, but held off issuing an endorsement  in the governor's race between Republican Pete Wilson and Democrat Dianne  Feinstein. The group endorsed Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, who is seeking a third  term; San Francisco Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Arlo Smith, candidate for attorney general, and Kathleen Brown, candidate for  treasurer. The group is concerned about Wilson's support of a state law  requiring minors to receive permission for an abortion and his votes in the  U.S. Senate against government funding for abortions. Feinstein will be  questioned about her statement earlier this year that she would consider  supporting legislation outlawing abortions done for the purpose of sex  selection.  </P></p>

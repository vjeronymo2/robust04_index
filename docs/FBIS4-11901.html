			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] Recent news reports from the Korean peninsula  speak of the continuation of the American interventionist policy  in that region.    During the past few days, Washington has, once again,  brought  serious crisis to the Korean peninsula through its provocative  acts such as the announcement of stationing Patriot missiles in  South Korea and deciding to resume its joint maneuvers with  North Korea. [passage omitted]    Paying attention to the current situation in the east Asia  region and the Pacific Ocean makes it clear that the American  policy aimed at creating tension in the Korean peninsula is  intended as a long-term measure.    The east Asia region is the focus of attention of the big  powers, such as America, because it seems that that region would  play a more significant role in international developments in  the future. Particularly that the Pacific Ocean region has,  during the past few years, turned into an international focal  point, and the rate of growth in some of the countries of the  region, such as China, has reached a level that is currently  unachievable by advanced industrial countries. It is clear that  the continuation of such a trend, which is achieved through the  continuation of efforts to maintain stability in the region,  would force America to withdraw its 6,000-strong force from the  Korean peninsula, which would mean losing its economic or  military control of the region. That is an issue which,  according to the White House politicians, contradicts the  American strategy.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS: NEWPORT CITY COUNCIL RACE;  </P> <P> NOISE FROM AIRPORT STILL THE MAIN ISSUE  </P> <P> Two years ago, Councilman Clarence J. Turner, the president of the county's  Airport Working Group, passed out a memorandum to his colleagues on the City  Council who were running for reelection.  </P> <P> The memo spelled out some of the obstacles that the city faced in resolving the  issue of noise at John Wayne Airport, and Turner said he wanted his colleagues  to be sure they weren't making promises the city couldn't keep.  </P> <P> "You might think that was really presumptuous of me," Turner recalled in a  recent interview. "But I thought it was important that people know. Since then,  things haven't really changed."  </P> <P> Additional flights that increase noise at the airport is one of the issues most  often asked of candidates running for four seats on the City Council in the  Nov. 6 election. The airport issue hits close to home for residents, who are  quick to point out that noise at John Wayne Airport lowers property values and  mars the peace of their beachfront community.  </P> <P> In the race for the District 1 council seat, in which three-term incumbent  Donald A. Strauss is being challenged by political newcomer John Hedges, the  debate has been over support for an alternate airport site. Hedges argues that  his job as a pilot for Northwest Airlines gives him the technical expertise to  evaluate expansion at John Wayne Airport. He advocates a variety of alternative  sites, including George Air Force Base, in order to reduce demand at John  Wayne.  </P> <P> Strauss, however, maintains that an alternate site ought to be in Orange  County. He says that the ideal solution would be joint civilian and military  use of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, though he admits such shared usage  would be difficult to negotiate.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Evelyn R. Hart, the incumbent being challenged in the District 3  race by resident Jan Vandersloot, also says that the airport noise issue is a  top priority for the council. She says her role in various county groups, such  as the League of Cities, gives her a regional perspective on solutions.  </P> <P> "We've always said that if there is anything that could destroy the quality of  life in Newport, it is the airport," Hart said. "That's why we take it as  seriously as we do."  </P> <P> In his plan to reduce noise and restrict airport expansion, Vandersloot says he  would push for annexation of Santa Ana Heights, in order to limit the county's  eminent domain in the area. He would also work on the county level for more  transit access to Los Angeles International, and he says that both George and  Norton Air Force bases should be looked at to ease air traffic at John Wayne  Airport.  </P> <P> "The important thing is to deflect demand," Vandersloot said. "There has to be  a regional plan, and John Wayne is unfortunately going to be part of that plan.  But John Wayne should just be a regional airport and not be used as a long-haul  airport."  </P> <P> Turner, the incumbent in District 4, and Phil Sansone, the incumbent in  District 6, are both running unopposed for their seats.  </P> <P> On other issues, challengers Vandersloot and Hedges both advocate a mandatory  two-term limit for council members.  </P> <P> Hedges not only has questioned Strauss' extended tenure on the council but has  also denounced the councilman for alleged inaction on the peninsula's problem  with weekend cruisers. Traffic and weekend parking congestion continue to be  hot issues.  </P> <P> Among the solutions that Hedges advocates is an increase in the number of  officers on the city police force, creation of a bicycle patrol unit for the  peninsula, and formation of a task force to preempt problems with gangs that  visit the area.  </P> <P> Strauss maintains that the city has acted to control cruising, and that the  council continues to examine alternative solutions. The councilman says that a  two-term limit on council members is unnecessary, since voters who disagree  with the council can always vote against the incumbents.  </P> <P> In the District 3 race, Vandersloot and Hart have debated the protection of  view corridors from public parks. Hart says preservation of open space and the  quality of life has been a primary emphasis of her tenure on the council.  </P> <P> But Vandersloot, who says that he was asked to run for the council by the  leadership of the Newport Heights Community Assn., questions Hart's record on  public parks and says that with the redevelopment plans for Mariner's Mile set  to come before the council in the next year, it is important that the District  3 representative vigorously enforce height and density limitations in the area,  which runs along Coast Highway from Bayside Drive to the Arches Bridge.  </P> <P> Vandersloot has also backed a plan to resurrect the Newport Trolley, a seaside  transit system which ran from the Fashion Island areas to the more popular  tourist spots. The trolley folded in 1987 because of lack of funds. Vandersloot  has proposed that fees from encroachment permits be used to subsidize the  trolley, thus increasing public access to the beach, while cutting back on  traffic and congestion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEWPORT BEACH CITY COUNCIL  </P> <P> These are the candidates running for four seats on the Newport Beach City  Council in the Nov. 6 election.  </P> <P> </P> <P> District 1  </P> <P> Donald A.

			<p>CSO     [Text] Accion Democratica [Democratic Action] and the COPEI  [Social Christian Party] have expressed their support for state  governors who are seeking amendments to the Law on the Election  and Removal of Governors. They believe that the Supreme Court of  Justice should be the body charged with removing elected  governors for well-considered reasons.    This statement of position was made by the leaders of each  of  these political parties who met separately with the Board of  Directors of the Association of Governors of Venezuela, presided  over by Henrique Salas Romer, governor of the State of Carabobo;  Francisco Ron Sandoval, governor of the State of Tachira; Carlos  Tablante, governor of the State of Aragua; and Arnaldo Arocha,  governor of the State of Miranda.    Salas Romer indicated that the meetings were very  encouraging  and that there was substantial, mutual support by the governors  for each other. In principle, by continuing the process of  political conversations at the highest level the  irresponsibility which has been reflected in some legislative  assemblies will be discouraged as well as the pressures which  have been applied to political parties to come out against  elected, regional governors, without serious reasons for doing  that.    He said that the governors were satisfied that there is  every  intention to support a proposal for an amendment of this law as  a matter of some urgency, "which would not make it impossible  for legislative assemblies to remove a governor for serious  reasons but which would set out the conditions under which this  might be done."    He emphasized that the fundamental point of reference of any  democratic system should be maintained, that is, that only the  people can remove a person who has been elected by the people's  will, unless a sufficiently serious situation should arise and  the courts intervene to condemn a person involved in  misappropriation of funds or any other wrongful act affecting  public resources. Luis Alfaro Ucero, secretary general of  Democratic Action, indicated that his party may propose an  amendment to the Law on the Election and Removal of Governors  because he believes that this is a very serious problem. This is  a view which he shares with the national leadership of  Democratic Action.    We should consider the idea that removing a governor should  not be done for merely circumstantial reasons, or on the basis  of considerations which are political in character. Rather, a  step of this kind must be very well supported and must have been  studied and analyzed with the greatest seriousness. We must try  to think more of the national interest, rather than the private  interests of the political parties.    He pointed out that if it is constitutionally possible to  amend the law, we, for our part, will cooperate, and with  pleasure, in that sense.    At the offices of the Social Christian Party the delegation  from the Association of State Governors of Venezuela was  received by Jose Curiel, the secretary general, and by Orlando  Contreras Pulido, the deputy secretary general. Curiel indicated  that in the view of the Social Christian Party it is very  important to bring stability to the Venezuelan political system.  It is not good for the country to have a situation like the  present one in which, with a political majority and for reasons  of only secondary importance, a governor may be removed from  office.    Curiel added: "It is necessary to provide stability to the  political system and amend the Law on the Election and Removal  of Governors in a legal way in order to achieve that objective.  If there is a serious situation affecting a state governor, this  matter could be raised before the Supreme Court of Justice."</p>

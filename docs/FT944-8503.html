			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Trombone changes bid tone - David Wighton considers BAe's response in the battle for VSEL The timing and funding structure for British Aerospace's increased offer for VSEL may have taken City observers slightly by surprise. But few had doubted that BAe would respond to GEC's rival bid. And few now doubt that the battle has a long way to go. The fight over VSEL is part of a wider struggle between GEC and BAe for dominance in the UK defence business. For both companies the stakes are high. Although BAe's share price fell in response to the novel rights issue yesterday, the general City reaction was that the company had significantly strengthened its hand. Not only has it matched GEC's cash offer and topped it with its share swap terms, it has given itself the flexibility to raise the terms again if GEC continues the bidding. Mr Sandy Morris, engineering analyst at NatWest Securities, described the timing and structure of the offer as astute. 'The bid had started to look like a fait accompli but BAe has shown itself prepared to go head to head with its major competitor. At least it will emerge with its reputation enhanced.' BAe's institutional shareholders also expressed support, although some took the cynical view that the company thought it had little chance of winning and had structured the funding to guarantee itself a Pounds 178m equity injection if it failed. BAe said the novel two-stage fund raising, known in the City as a 'trombone issue', enabled it to compete with GEC on equal terms. Under the terms of the original bid BAe offered shares worth about Pounds 12.60 per VSEL share with a cash alternative of Pounds 11.40, provided by selling shares to institutions which were underwriting it for a fee. If BAe wanted to increase the terms its advisers would have to go back to the institutions to underwrite the cash alternative. 'The process makes you as visible as a herd of elephants to the opposition who can see exactly what you are going to do,' said one of BAe's advisers. But by raising money through an underwritten rights issue BAe can increase the terms without going back to the institutions. 'We can act very quickly, very simply and very secretively,' said Mr Richard Lapthorne, BAe's finance director. BAe argues the move puts it on more level terms with GEC which plans to fund its bid from its large cash pile. In effect BAe has asked its shareholders for a blank cheque. To give some comfort to the institutions it has agreed to ask for shareholders' approval before declaring a successful higher bid unconditional. BAe's chances of success are partly in the hands of the Office of Fair Trading. BAe has argued strenuously that GEC's bid should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on competition grounds. GEC already owns Yarrow, the UK's other big warship builder. Some observers have suggested that if the GEC bid alone were referred to the MMC BAe could have won control of VSEL with its original offer. However, BAe said yesterday that it believed VSEL shareholders would now not accept less than GEC's Pounds 14 a share, even if GEC was barred from bidding. 'Expectations have been raised,' said Mr Lapthorne. He denied that the improved offer reflected an assumption by BAe that GEC's bid was unlikely to be referred alone. Mr Dick Evans, BAe chief executive, even suggested that BAe's move might improve the chances of GEC being referred by demonstrating that BAe's financial position was not an issue. Another potential benefit of the improved offer is that it may allow BAe to buy VSEL shares in the market. It cannot do so at a price above the value of its share offer, which has prevented it making such purchases so far. Yesterday VSEL shares closed at Pounds 14.88, just 16p above the value of BAe's share offer. GEC already holds 15 per cent of VSEL and cannot make further purchases in the market under VSEL's articles. Thanks to its tax losses and Pounds 100m of unrelieved advance corporation tax BAe would pay no tax on VSEL's profits. It calculates that even at the higher offer a successful takeover would enhance its earnings per share by more than 10 per cent next year. NatWest Securities believes that taking over VSEL would now boost its earnings from 35.7p to 40p, compared with 42.4p under the original terms. Other analysts believe the enhancement would be slightly smaller and that the deal would actually dilute earnings thereafter. However, most believe BAe would raise the stakes again in the likely event that GEC continues the bidding.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COMEBACK TRAIL FOR POLL, GARCIA LEADS TO COUNTRY CLUB MATCH-UP  </P> <P> Both Jesus Poll and George Garcia were used to traveling the high road. Then  both found themselves faced with unexpected detours. Scrambling to get back on  the comeback trail, the two now find themselves on a collision course.  </P> <P> Poll, a super bantamweight fighting out of North Hollywood, was unbeaten until  two months ago when he was stopped in the 10th round of a World Boxing Assn.  title fight at the Forum by champion Juan Jose Estrada of Tijuana.  </P> <P> Garcia, of Westminster, once held both the state bantam and super-bantamweight  titles concurrently. But after losing to Frankie Duarte in 1986, he quit the  ring for three years before returning last month to win an eight-round decision  over Joe Orewa, the African super-bantamweight champion.  </P> <P> Poll (19-1-2, four knockouts) and Garcia (25-4-2, nine knockouts) will now face  each other Tuesday night in the 10-round main event at The Country Club in  Reseda.  </P> <P> Also on the card will be the unbeaten Ruelas brothers, both fighting  six-rounders.  </P> <P> Gabriel Ruelas, a North Hollywood featherweight, will be in the ring for the  second time in 11 days. He is coming off a first-round knockout of Antonio  Masin in Houston. Ruelas (12-0) has seven knockouts and all have come in the  first round. His opponent Tuesday will be Francisco Pascasio (10-2, 10  knockouts), a Mexican now living in Phoenix, who will be making his debut in  the United States.  </P> <P> Rafael Ruelas (6-0, four knockouts) also fought in Houston 11 days ago,  stopping Benito Rodriguez on a third-round knockout. Tuesday, the North  Hollywood super bantamweight will face Porfirio Guzman (4-4, two knockouts) of  Tucson. In other preliminary fights, middleweight Ron Wiswell (4-11-1, two  knockouts) of Bakersfield will face Robert Carson (5-1-2, three knockouts) of  Santa Monica in a six-rounder; and middleweight Steve Nickson (0-3) of Hobbs,  N. M., will be opposed by Vince Wilkerson (1-5) of Los Angeles in a  four-rounder.  </P> <P> First bell is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.  </P></p>

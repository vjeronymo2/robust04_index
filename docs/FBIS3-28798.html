Tsutsumi, chosen by Trade Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, will be  appointed to the post on approval at a cabinet meeting Tuesday,  the officials said.    Masahisa Naito resigned from the post in December following  charges of favoritism in promoting a junior while he served as  director general at the MITI minister's secretariat.    In December 1992, Naito promoted Yasufumi Tanahashi, son of  a  former vice trade minister, to the hurriedly created post of  planning officer shortly before Tanahashi quit the ministry to  run in the House of Representatives election in July 1993.    MITI Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano has been concurrently  serving as the Industrial Policy Bureau chief since Naito  resigned.</p>

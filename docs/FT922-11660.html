			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Rea down to Pounds 0.26m after heavy debts After doubling its doubtful debt provision and making exceptional charges, against income last time, Rea Brothers saw pre-tax profit decline from Pounds 1.61m to Pounds 261,000 in 1991. The private banking group provided Pounds 950,000 (Pounds 480,000) for doubtful debts. The exceptional charge, of Pounds 189,000 (credit Pounds 945,000), represented a provision made by Rea Brothers (Isle of Man) relating to potential payments under the Depositors' Compensation Scheme in respect of the collapse of BCCI. Earnings fell to 0.65p (4.09p) but the final dividend is 0.25p to hold the total at 0.5p.</p>

Determinations of disability are generally made by disability determination services (DDS), which are agencies of each State. Present regulations require that, unless the disability determination is made by a State agency disability hearing officer, disability determinations made by a DDS will be made by a State agency medical or psychological consultant and a State agency disability examiner, including those in which the determination is made on technical, non-medical, rather than medical, grounds. We propose to remove the requirement that a medical or psychological consultant make the determination jointly with the disability examiner when there is no medical evidence to be evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  To be sure that your comments are considered, we must receive them no later than December 27, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should be submitted in writing to the Commissioner of Social Security, Department of Health and Human Services, P.

Title II also provides for the payment of child's insurance benefits based on disability and widow's and widower's insurance benefits for disabled widows, widowers, and surviving divorced spouses of insured individuals. In addition, the Act provides, in title XVI, for SSI payments to persons who are aged, blind, or disabled and who have limited income and resources. For adults under both the title II and title XVI programs and for persons claiming child's insurance benefits based on disability under the title II program, ``disability'' means the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable impairment. For a child under age 18 claiming SSI benefits based on disability, ``disability'' means that the child's impairment(s) is of comparable severity to one that would disable an adult (i.e., the impairment(s) substantially reduces the child's ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively in an age-appropriate manner such that the child's impairment(s) and resulting limitations are comparable to those that would disable an adult). Under both title II and title XVI, disability must be the result of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment(s) which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 404.1503 and 416.903 of the Social Security Administration's regulations provide that State agencies make disability and blindness determinations for the Secretary of Health and Human Services for most persons living in the State. Sections 404.1615(c) and 416.1015(c) of the regulations provide that disability determinations will be made by either: (1) A State agency medical or psychological consultant  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a State agency disability examiner or (2) a State agency disability hearing officer. Sections 404.1615(e) and 416.1015(e) of the regulations require the State agency to certify each determination of disability to the Social Security Administration (SSA) on forms provided by SSA. The term ``determination of disability'' is defined in &sect;&sect;404.1602 and 416.1002 of the regulations to mean one or more of the following decisions: whether or not a person is under a disability; the date a person's disability began; or the date a person's disability ended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When a disability determination is made jointly by a State agency medical or psychological consultant and a State agency disability examiner, the medical or psychological consultant is responsible for the medical portion of the determination and the disability examiner is responsible for the remainder of the determination. Under our current procedures, both the disability examiner and the medical or psychological consultant must certify the determination on forms which we provide as required in the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

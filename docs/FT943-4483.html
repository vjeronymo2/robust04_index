			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Freeport-McMoRan arm sells non-mining assets PT Freeport Indonesia, the Indonesian mining unit of Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold of the US, has sold a group of its non-mining assets for about Dollars 77m, AP-DJ reports from New Orleans. The deal is one of a series of completed and planned asset sales. Freeport-McMoRan said the unit sold the assets to its Indonesian joint venture with ALatieF Nusakarya of Jakarta, Indonesia. ALatieF Nusakarya owns two-thirds of the joint venture, while PT Freeport owns the rest. Freeport-McMoRan said the assets were primarily multi-family residential properties and a hotel complex. PT Freeport will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including capital requirements for its mine-mill expansion, which it expects to complete during the second half of 1995. The 84-room hotel complex will be managed under an agreement with ITT Sheraton, a unit of ITT of the US.</p>

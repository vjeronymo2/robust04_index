			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Taking its punishment in public - The mounting tribulations faced by Invesco BAD publicity has haunted the international investment management group, Invesco MIM, over the past year. The group's long-standing links with Mr Robert Maxwell, the disgraced tycoon, inevitably caused embarrassment in the aftermath of the publisher's death. Mr Maxwell owned 20 per cent of the group between 1986 and early 1991, and Invesco MIM was one of the Mirror Group's pension fund managers. In addition, Invesco was fined Pounds 75,000 by Imro (the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation) for accounting failures relating to its Personal Equity Plans. Recently, however, it has been the problems of the group's investment trusts which have attracted attention, and in particular, Drayton Consolidated. At the end of 1989, the net asset value of this trust was 700p; it is currently just 252p. A graph of the recent share price looks like an Alpine ski slope. The problem has been the group's unquoted portfolio. Repeated write-downs of the asset values alarmed investors, who marked the shares down even more quickly. Invesco itself has had to take a Pounds 13m exceptional loss on its holding in the trust. Two specific investments have provoked criticism. Alma, a confectionery company with several famous brand names, was the trust's second largest holding. When it went into receivership in February, the failure knocked 57.8p off the trust's net asset value per share. Disquiet was expressed when it was revealed that Drayton had extended loans to the company even after writing down its value last year. The basis for the valuation of City Merchants Bank, a company jointly owned by Drayton Consolidated and Invesco and the largest holding of the trust, has also been attacked. 'With the benefit of hindsight, too much money was put into too few investments,' said one institutional investor Mr Nicholas Johnson, Invesco's deputy chairman and chief executive, says that other companies with investments in the unquoted area have had to make write-downs because of the recession. 'What has distinguished Consolidated is that it is a listed company and attracts publicity' he argues. The former manager, Mr Alexander Reid, resigned and Mr Peter Knapton was brought in from Samuel Montagu to take his place. But some investors remain resolutely unimpressed and wonder whether Invesco should continue to be in charge of the trust. 'If there was ever a case for taking the management away from someone, this is it,' says one institution. 'The problem is that the whole thing is intertwined with other trusts in the group which also own some of the same investments.' Invesco brought in County NatWest to conduct a review of the trust and Price Waterhouse was asked to conduct a substantial valuation of the holdings. That process has already resulted in a further Pounds 40m write-down of the unquoted portfolio. A reconstruction is being planned. Full details have yet to be revealed but what seems likely is that as many liquid assets will be sold as possible; a new company will be formed to hold the unquoted element, with less liquid assets being sold gradually. Some of the problems of Drayton Consolidated have been repeated in the unquoted element of Drayton English &amp; International's portfolio. And one of the trusts launched last year, Drayton Blue Chip, suffered a 33 per cent fall in net asset value per share in the six months to March 31 (although much of this fall has been regained since the election). Nor has the performance of the unit trusts set the world alight. The majority of the group's unit trusts have a below average performance in their sectors over one, three and five years. Indeed, over the past year, nearly half the trusts have a fourth quartile (bottom 25 per cent) performance, according to Finstat. But Mr Johnson feels the group has been getting an unfair press, in particular citing the publicity given to recent sales by Invesco of shares in United News-papers and Alexander Proudfoot, two companies of which Lord Stevens, Invesco's head, is also chairman. He says that Invesco retains stakes in United (of about 1 per cent) and in Proudfoot (0.75 per cent) and the sales have been part of a long-term process of whittling down holdings, some of which, such as United Newspapers, had been accumulated before. Mr Johnson said that the recent publicity must have done Invesco harm in the short term. But he points out that the group is much larger than its UK business. In the US, the Atlanta-based subsidiary is a substantial pension fund manager with Dollars 24bn under management at the end of 1991. The Denver-based mutual funds business nearly doubled its monies under management to Dollars 5.3bn last year. Another subsidiary is Invesco Solutions, a company which operates in the growing field of 'defined contribution' pensions management - the US equivalent to money-purchase company pension schemes. In Europe, Invesco has a joint venture with IMI Capital Markets, Italy's leading mutual fund manager, plus offices in Paris and the Netherlands and a subsidiary in eastern Europe. In Japan, the company has established a foothold in investment trust and pensions management. But until the company gets over the Drayton Consolidated episode, these other businesses may be forgotten. The County report on Drayton Consolidated is eagerly awaited.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] After ending a one-week official visit to the PRC,  the delegation from the Propaganda and Training Board of the Lao  People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee led by Osakan  Thammatheva, member of the Party Central Committee and acting  chief of the Propaganda and Training Board, returned to  Vientiane on 16 June. The visit, which began on 9 June, was  gloriously successful. During the visit, the Lao delegation  discussed and exchanged experiences with a delegation from the  CPC Central Committee Propaganda and Training Board on the  implementation of ideological work. The visit has contributed  to enhancing the traditional solidarity between the two parties,  two states, and two peoples of Laos and China.    In addition to visiting Beijing and calling on Chinese  leaders, the Lao delegation visited Tianjin and Kunming. The  delegation was accorded a warm welcome by Chinese hosts  everywhere they went. The delegation has also invited a  delegation from the CPC Central Committee Propaganda and  Training Board to visit Laos.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yeoryios Pavleas, Sorbonne University professor </F> of European Law: "Greece and the Commission"]    [Text] The preplanned referral of Greece to the European  Court of Justice by the European Commission occurred in a  climate of extraordinary tension against our country. The  Commission's initiative is essentially not in keeping with  procedural law based on Article 225, Paragraph 2 of the European  Treaty, but should be seen as a political act aimed at  pressuring our country.    Misusing the provisions of Articles 223, Paragraph 1B and  225, Paragraph 2 of the [Rome] Treaty whose context is economic  and devoid of political significance, the Commission acted  against its identity as a keeper of legality in the  implementation and interpretation of Community law, and  simultaneously violated the fundamental principle of Community  solidarity between the European Union (EU) member states.    The provisions of Article 223, Paragraph 1B, of the Treaty  envision granting member states relative freedom to act  unencumbered by the limitation of the competition rules of the  Treaty when manufacturing or marketing war materiel, as long as  this particular initiative is related to the defense of their  security.    However, if one member state, overstepping the boundaries of  such freedom under the pretext that it needs to defend its  security, acts within the EU space against the competition rules  and in a way that may hurt the interests of the other member  states, the Commission, or another member state, has the right  to resort to the European Court of Justice against the member  state overstepping such boundaries. In fact, this is a very  limited form of applying the above provisions.    In this specific instance, our country did not manufacture  or  market war materiel, neither did it hurt EU interests, since in  principle it did not act within EU space and its initiative,  moreover, was not economic, but eminently political. It should  also be stressed that because of the minimal exchanges between  the EU and Skopje, which represent only 0.50 percent of EU trade  transactions on a yearly basis, the preconditions for the  implementation of Articles 85, 169, and 170 of the Treaty do not  exist.    The embargo imposed by the Greek Government on Skopje was  its  ultimate means of defense in the face of the increasing  arrogance of the political leadership of that country, whose  Constitution includes provisions of an irredentist nature  betraying expansionary aims against our northern borders. In  conjunction with Skopje's falsification of our history, the  theft of the Veryina symbol and the name of Greek Macedonia,  this undoubtedly and obviously created a major danger to the  national security and territorial integrity of our country, as  well as the risk of upsetting domestic peace and public order.    The Greek Government's decision was thus aimed at warding  off  these dangers and at safeguarding our country's historic  heritage.    Consequently, our country does not belong in the "box of the  accused." On the contrary, it should raise its voice in protest  against the unjust and abusive behavior of an EU organ. It must  be understood that the functioning of EU organs to threaten  smaller member states using the "two-speed" approach--meaning  the privileged treatment of our northern partners at the expense  of the smaller southern partners--is contrary to the EU's  fundamental proclamations.    Finally, the Commission's initiative is a serious blow to  the  principle of legality and Community solidarity. When viewed as a  political act to pressure our country and favor the goals of a  third country at the expense of our national security, it cannot  be accepted by the European Court of Justice, because by its  very nature it is condemned to rejection as inadmissible,  excusatory, and altogether devoid of context and legal  foundation.</p>

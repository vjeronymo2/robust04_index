He said that the HSP, the Croatian Pure Party of Rights, and  the Croatian National Democratic League are demanding the urgent  convening of a Croatian Assembly session at which the president  of the republic and the foreign minister should reveal all the  circumstances under which the agreement with the FRY was signed.  They are also calling for the rejection of all agreements with  the FRY until the Serb occupation army withdraws from the  territory of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, until all expelled persons are allowed to  return to their homes, and until the FRY explicitly recognizes  the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  and their internationally recognized borders.    Djapic also disclosed that the merger of the three parties  into the Croatian Party of Rights can be expected in the near  future.</p>

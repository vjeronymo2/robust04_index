The reporter asked: Hainan is considered to be a special  area with special power to carry out special projects. Hainan  also enjoys greater autonomy than other provinces and regions.  Does it mean that, in the foreseeable future, certain expensive  sightseeing projects -- such as horse racing and dog racing  --will be permitted in Hainan?    Ruan Chongwu replied: While we encourage the development of  all kinds of recreational activities in Hainan, we firmly forbid  three kinds: gambling, prostitution, and drugs.    We can say that this reply is exactly what the ordinary  people wanted to say. People in some places have written to  [Haikou's] mayor that they want economic growth, not spiritual  garbage.    Regrettably, not all leaders see it the same way. Have we  not heard the argument that when material civilization has  developed, spiritual civilization will naturally follow suit?  Some people even say that gambling, prostitution, and the like  are no big deal; and that these ideas can bring in foreign  capital.    Facts prove that this is an erroneous idea. The development  of material civilization will indeed help the development of  spiritual civilization because people who are well clothed and  fed tend to pay attention to their honor. But there is also the  observation that people who are well fed and clothed will tend  to be obsessed with carnal pleasure. If we fail to intensify  our efforts in building our spiritual civilization, our failure  will certainly affect the development of material civilization.  As far as attracting foreign capital is concerned, we should do  so by counting on our huge markets and good services. We should  always remember that we cannot afford to discard the traditional  culture and ethical sense of the Chinese nation, and we cannot  afford to let in the spiritual garbage of the Western society.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WAVES HAVE A NIGHT TO REMEMBER;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: SENIORS GO OUT IN STYLE IN LEADING PEPPERDINE TO 102-89  VICTORY OVER SAN DIEGO.  </P> <P> Pepperdine seniors Dexter Howard, Shann Ferch, Tom Lewis and Craig Davis made  their last appearance before a home crowd Saturday night a memorable one.  </P> <P> Howard scored a game-high 29 points, Ferch had 20, Davis 17 and Lewis 16 as the  Waves defeated the University of San Diego, 102-89, before 3,027 at Firestone  Fieldhouse in Malibu.  </P> <P> Pepperdine took sole possession of second place in the West Coast Conference,  finishing the regular season at 16-11, 10-4 in conference play.  </P> <P> San Diego, which fell to 14-12 and 9-5, dropped to third place in the WCC.  </P> <P> Lewis scored inside and outside, and Ferch hit consistently from the outside,  as the Waves made 10 of 13 three-point shots (76.9%) in the first half.  </P> <P> Lewis made six of nine field goal attempts in the game and was four of four  from three-point range. Ferch scored 14 points in the first half, including  four three-point shots.  </P> <P> Howard scored 18 points, and Davis made a couple of key baskets in the second  half, which helped to hold off the charging Toreros.  </P> <P> Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said that the Waves have to go into next weekend's  conference tournament at Loyola and "get after them, whoever (we play). I've  got a feeling it's going to be San Diego" eventually. The Waves face St. Mary's  in the first round.  </P> <P> The Waves took control early, after Lewis made a three-point shot during an  11-2 run that gave them a 24-16 lead.  </P> <P> Ferch scored 14 points, and Lewis added 13, and Pepperdine held a 57-43 lead at  halftime.  </P> <P> With 45 seconds left in the half, San Diego's Anthony Thomas got into a shoving  match with Geoff Lear.  </P> <P> A foul was called on Thomas, who protested angrily and shouted at a referee. He  was given a flagrant technical foul and ejected from the game.  </P> <P> San Diego scored the first six points of the second half and kept the pressure  on the rest of the game, twice closing to within three points.  </P> <P> But Geoff Lear made a layup and two free throws, and Howard dunked after  picking up a loose ball and then made a three-point play. That 9-0 run seemed  to take the starch out of the Toreros.  </P></p>

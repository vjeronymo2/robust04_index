			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSEUM DONORS EXHIBIT THE ART OF GIVING  </P> <P> Philip and Beatrice Gersh collect art for an old-fashioned reason: They love  the stuff. And they deal with their most valuable possessions in an  old-fashioned way: They give them away.  </P> <P> As owner of a long-established talent agency and a collector for 35 years,  Philip Gersh has had calls from studio executives seeking advice on how to  invest in art. His answer: "We don't buy that way. You have to buy because you  love the art. If you are concerned about liquidity and investment, forget it."  </P> <P> He and and his wife, who is a trustee of the Museum of Contemporary Art, are  dismayed by wealthy collectors who cash in on their art at auction. "They don't  need the money," Philip Gersh scoffed. "You hear that certain pieces have  become too valuable to keep in private collections. If the art is so valuable,  it should be given to museums. The more valuable it is, the more reason that a  museum should have it."  </P> <P> A few years ago, before the art market zoomed into the stratosphere and before  the 1986 income-tax law reduced art donors' deductions to the purchase price of  an artwork, instead of the appreciated price, the Gershes' attitude toward  their collection was relatively commonplace. But the new tax law has reduced  gifts of art to museums by 63%, a study by the Assn. of Art Museum Directors  shows. At the same time, rising prices have shut museums out of the market.  With paintings going for $20 million, $30 million, $40 million or even $50  million a pop at auction, generosity seems to be an idea whose time has passed.  </P> <P> "Is the ethic of philanthropy an archaic notion? I'm afraid that's about 90%  accurate," Philip Gersh said. That fear is part of the reason for a current  show of the Gersh collection at the Museum of Contemporary Art. The exhibition  at MOCA (to March 11) includes eight works that the Gershes have given or  promised to the museum.  </P> <P> Prime among them is "Cubi III," an 8-foot-tall aluminum sculpture by David  Smith, whose works have brought as much as $1.3 million at auction. When the  show opened, the 1961 sculpture was promised to the museum, but the couple have  subsequently made a "partial gift" of the valuable work and have agreed to give  the piece entirely to MOCA soon.  </P> <P> The towering sculpture -- which is one of two "Cubi" pieces still in private  hands -- is essential to a contemporary art museum's collection, MOCA director  Richard Koshalek said.  </P> <P> Another "partial gift" from the Gershes is "Number 3," a small 1948 drip  painting by Jackson Pollock, whose auction record is $10.5 million. The other  Gersh gifts are less pricey but highly desirable acquisitions for the museum: a  mixed-media collage by Alexis Smith, a photograph by Boyd Webb and paintings by  Ed Ruscha, Susan Rothenberg, Neil Jenney and Tom Wudl.  </P> <P> The Gershes hope that MOCA's show of their collection will encourage others to  give. Their example has already produced at least two followers: their sons  Robert and David Gersh who collect contemporary art and support the museum.  </P> <P> "Collecting has enriched our lives," Beatrice Gersh said. "Art is not a  commodity. It's something that gives great pleasure because of its quiet  beauty, which can take many different forms. We feel strongly that the works we  have should live together in our home and we've spent many years refining the  collection."  </P> <P> Every work that has become part of their collection has a life story. Wandering  around the show and marveling at how different the art looks in a museum  setting, the Gershes recounted tales of artworks bought in a fit of passion and  others purchased after long periods of deliberation, dusty artworks rescued  from storage bins and fresh ones snapped off delivery trucks.  </P> <P> There are also stories about artworks lost and gained. One dealer reneged on  the sale of a Jean Dubuffet collage when a more valued client wanted it, but  then came through with a better piece. Beatrice Gersh once missed a Francis  Bacon painting because her husband found it too disturbing, she said. Years  later, when she saw Bacon's "Portrait of a Man With Glasses" in a London show,  she announced that she wouldn't leave the gallery until they bought it. The  small 1963 portrait is on view at MOCA in an intimate display of works by  20th-Century masters.  </P> <P> "In the early years Bea was way ahead of me, but now our eyes have adjusted to  the point that we often go for exactly the same thing," Philip Gersh said.  </P> <P> "If I was ahead it's only because I devoted more time to it," Beatrice Gersh  said. "One problem with many collectors starting out now is that they don't  have any idea of the past and how it relates to the art of our time. You have  to put in a lot of time, going to galleries and museums, looking and getting  trained."  </P> <P> The Gershes have never employed a curator or an adviser to tell them what to  buy. Instead, they have taken their own education in hand, traveling widely to  see exhibitions and continually working to keep up with the changing scene.  </P> <P> They stand out as a rare example of public-spirited collectors, but they are  not entirely alone in Los Angeles. Earlier this year, the Museum of  Contemporary Art received a $60-million donation of classic modern and  contemporary art from the Rita and Taft Schreiber collection. Among the 18  works by 13 artists are paintings by Pollock, Mark Rothko, Piet Mondrian and  Arshile Gorky, and sculpture by Alberto Giacometti.  </P> <P> During the past three years, MOCA has also received works by Christian  Boltanski and Sarah Charlesworth from Peter and Eileen Norton; a John  Chamberlain sculpture from Robert Halff; and Red Grooms' near life-size  re-creation of a "Discount Store" from Irma and Norman Braman. Among other  gifts, MOCA trustees Eli Broad and Douglas S. Cramer have each donated funds  for the purchase of art.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Museum of Art also has angels who remain devoted despite  current tax laws. Pop singer Graham Nash recently announced that he will  present the museum with about 140 photographs, plus half the profits from an  upcoming auction of his photography collection.  </P> <P> Raymond and Frances Bushell have donated 141 Japanese netsuke as part of a  larger miniature sculpture collection promised to the county museum. Mary  Stansbury Ruiz bequeathed more than 600 Mannerist prints to LACMA, while Hans  and Varya Cohn have donated more than 200 examples of ancient, Sasanian,  Islamic and Indian glass.  </P> <P> Collectors Howard and Gwen Laurie Smits in 1987 gave the museum 171  contemporary ceramic works and subsequently established an endowment fund for  the purchase of 20th-Century ceramics. In making the gift, the Smits said that  the donation was the best way to make "maximum use" of their collection.  </P> <P> Film producer Ray Stark last year gave the museum Ellsworth Kelly's "White  Sculpture II," a massive painted aluminum piece. "I have another one and I  thought this sculpture would go well with the museum's collection," Stark said.  Denying that he has "great altruistic motivations," Stark nonetheless said that  he plans to give most of his sculpture collection to the County Museum of Art.  </P> <P> "I think it's a shame that the government discourages gifts of art. I can  understand people who don't want to give now (under present tax laws), but my  personal feeling is that eventually I would like most of my sculpture to go to  the museum," Stark said.  </P> <P> The Gershes, like many other museum supporters, hope that income tax laws will  be changed again to allow deductions for the appreciated value of art. "All our  great museums have been endowed by great private collectors. The Reagan and  Bush administrations have emphasized the responsibility of the private sector,  but private collectors are selling at auction now -- and at astronomical  prices," Philip Gersh said.  </P> <P> The couple used to buy at auction, when bargains could be had, but now they  stay away. And they entertain no thoughts of cashing in. "We're very happy in  giving. We know people are going to enjoy the art," Beatrice Gersh said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Communications Secretary General Mauricio Antezana  has reiterated that the government firmly maintains its  commitment to the Bolivian workers and to low income families.  He said the programs being implemented, among them those of  popular participation, capitalization, and education reform,  seek to help the poor and to make the changes the country needs.    [Begin Antezana recording] The workers must realize that the  government understands their situation and that it acts in  solidarity with their demands because they are fair demands.  However they must also understand, especially the labor leaders,  that the real situation of our national economy does not allow  us to immediately carry out a salary policy that will create an  inflationary spiral. [end recording]    Antezana added that the government goals are: to avoid  raising fuel prices and to rationalize and streamline the  economy. These goals seek to protect the poor by offering them  a real sustainable salary increase. The communications  secretary added that the national budget is an innovative tool  to benefit the needy.    [Begin Antezana recording] The national budget allocations  are mainly concentrated in social investments. This is a new  element that represents a great innovation compared with the  system used in the budgets of the past few years. The national  budget includes the innovation that this year it incorporates  the participation of the people. By doing so, it establishes a  discipline for the distribution of income among the provinces.  The Popular Participation Law establishes a fair distribution  of resources according to the number of inhabitants of certain  municipalities, and particularly benefits the provinces. This  means the national budget is based on a social principle and  goal. The government's overall economic policy also seeks to  benefit the low-income sector and all workers.    The government asks the Bolivian people for understanding in  these difficult moments. The people must understand that this  is not a simple provision. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Robert Horton We are asked to clarify Mr Robert Horton's role in the acquisition by BP of the minority shareholding in Standard Oil of Ohio (Sohio) (FT June 30). On his appointment as chairman of Sohio in 1986, Mr Horton relinquished his BP directorship. Negotiations on BP's initial offer of Dollars 7.4bn took place at arms length. The minority shareholders, some of whom referred the bid to the court, were separately advised by a special committee, of which Mr Horton was not a member, chaired by Mr Douglas Danforth, chairman of Westinghouse. Negotiations improved the original BP offer by Dollars 420m and the terms of the final agreement were approved by the court.</p>

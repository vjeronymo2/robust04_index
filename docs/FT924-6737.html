			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Warning over rail-track costs POWERGEN and National Power, the privatised electricity generators, yesterday called for British Rail's freight transport arm to be exposed to a free market. But they warned that the allocation of rail-track costs would be crucial to their future use of the rail network. Their warning came as Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, fiercely rejected accusations that BR was blocking the plans of private-sector train operators by overcharging for the use of its tracks. The generators complained that they were being charged more than other freight users, and were being denied information on how costs were calculated. Mr Alf Roberts, an executive director of PowerGen, said in evidence to the Commons transport committee: 'We believe the charges we experience are significantly higher than those for other users for an equivalent service.' He added that there was a 'significant connection between the issue of British Coal and the issue of British Rail and freight transport costs.' Mr Keith McNair, National Power's director of fuel management, warned that increased rail transport costs could prompt a move away from coal to other fuels as transport costs formed 10 per cent of the final cost of coal. Mr McNair said that National Power's offers to buy and operate its own locomotives and trucks had also been rejected. If no other operator could offer competitive transport after privatisation, National Power would consider operating the service itself. Sir Bob denied in a lecture at London University that BR was overcharging private operators. He said track infrastructure represented nearly 50 per cent of BR's costs and private-sector train operators wanting access to the tracks must expect to share the burden. In the last few weeks several companies have accused BR of undermining their plans to introduce new rail services. BAA, the airports group, has been particularly outspoken in accusing BR of blocking the launch of the Heathrow Express by asking too much for the use of its tracks out of London Paddington station. Sir Bob said the track was not only very expensive to put in place, but also required extremely costly maintenance.</p>

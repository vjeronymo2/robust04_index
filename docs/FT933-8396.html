			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Observer: Time for a change Ever felt that your curriculum vitae needed a little extra something? Admit it. Despite all the titles, years of study at the highest seats of learning, and truly eclectic pastimes, haven't you ever dreamed of topping off your resume with an MSc in Managing Change? Thankfully, help is at hand. Sheffield Business School, in partnership with the London-based Centre for the Study of Change, has scored a world first. Senior managers and consultants can now obtain a master's degree in what TV troubleshooter Sir John Harvey-Jones calls the 'most desirable management skill for the 1990s'. 'When it was an occasional problem, change seemed much simpler,' says Dr Ian  -I/C change - Cunningham. 'Today, as wave upon wave of change crashes through nations and organisations, it no longer looks so simple.' Glad to have you aboard, doctor. Now down to basics. It's a part-time course, takes two years, and involves the self-managed learning approach - not to be confused with the DIY approach. To begin, participants will need their own 'Learning Contract'. But don't be put off by the jargon. It is simpler than it sounds. Just answer the following five questions: Where have I been? Where am I now? Where do I want to go? How will I get there? How will I know if I have arrived? Answer at least three of these questions correctly, promise to pay Pounds 14,000, and Observer feels sure that you are capable of winning a place on a course that promises to equip you with 'one of the rarest and most difficult skills to learn'.</p>

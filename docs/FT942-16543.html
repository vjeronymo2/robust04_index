			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / International Company News: De Benedetti to raise L650bn Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian industrialist, yesterday announced plans to raise more than L650bn (Dollars 396.3m) at his two main Italian holding companies - Cofide and Cir - through a rights issue and a convertible bond issue. In the last 48 hours, Mr De Benedetti has revealed plans which could net more than Dollars 850m in new funds for French and Italian companies in which his family has an interest. In the case of Cofide and Cir, a spokesman said the cash could be used for a new expansion drive, as the Italian and European economies emerge from recession. On Thursday, Olivetti, the Italian computer group in which Cir has a large stake, announced plans to raise between L500bn and L600bn through a convertible bond issue, to help finance its share in a new mobile telephones venture. Cerus, the French holding company, 49 per cent of which is controlled by Cir, also proposed a rights issue on Thursday, aimed at raising FFr858m (Dollars 147.2m) to strengthen its balance sheet. Mr De Benedetti announced yesterday's fund-raising proposals, which have to be approved by shareholders later this month or in early May, on the back of results showing that both Cofide and Cir returned to profit in 1993. Cofide, the ultimate holding company for the De Benedetti family's interests, including Cir, reported a net profit of L3.2bn, against a loss of L281bn in 1992. The group is to seek approval to raise up to L154.2bn, with an issue of 154.2m new shares at nominal value of L1,000 each. Most will be offered to existing shareholders on the basis of one for every four held, but 12.2m will be reserved for the exercise of warrants. Cir, which groups stakes in Olivetti and Cerus, as well as Italian publishing and industrial companies, recorded net profits of L16bn in 1993, against a loss of L540bn in 1992. Cir pointed out that apart from Olivetti, which hopes to break even at operating level in 1994, all its industrial holdings made a positive contribution to 1993 results. It added that its debt-to-equity ratio of 4 per cent, compared with 21 per cent at end-1992, made it financially one of the most solid companies on the market. The company plans to issue bonds convertible into Cir shares. The final price has yet to be set, but the eventual issue should raise between L500bn and L600bn for Cir. Mr De Benedetti's attempts to raise funds coincide with a post-election surge in activity on the Italian stock market. Before the Cir and Cofide announcements, the Milan stock market indices recorded new highs for the year.</p>

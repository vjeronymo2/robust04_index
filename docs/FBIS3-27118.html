			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary: It Is Necessary To Strengthen Control Over the </F> Cultural Market]    [Text] Over recent years, a flourishing scene has emerged  in the province's cultural market. Thus far, the number of  cultural markets has developed to 19,581 in the province. These  markets have played a positive role in building the socialist  spiritual civilization, in meeting the ever-growing demands of  the masses on cultural life, in settling down the surplus work  force in society, and in increasing financial revenues of  localities. However, along with the constant development of  cultural market, some problems have been revealed, and some  unhealthy articles have been put on market for sale, thus  polluting and corrupting social environment and social  atmosphere and arousing the broad masses of the people to great  indignation.    Major indicators are: First, the cultural market has been  flooded with illegal publications. Over the past two years, the  Shenyang city cultural market administration department alone  has ferreted out 120,000 copies of illegal books and periodicals  of more than 300 categories. Second, the situation of publicly  showing obscene video tapes has gained ground. Of the 2,000-odd  video tape projection units in the province, a considerably  great number of them are very poorly equipped. To pander to low  tastes of some persons in society, these units have publicly  projected the low-class films of Hong Kong and Taiwan and even  the obscene video tapes of foreign countries. Third, some  ballrooms have become the medium for prostitution and visits to  whores. A few ballrooms have even employed young women to  specially entertain the guests. In addition, the illegal  running of video game recreation places and the confusion in  performing market have also greatly jeopardized the society.    For this reason, governments at all levels should attach  importance to building up the cultural market, strengthen the  control over the market, and persist in the principles of  advocating the healthy ones, permitting the harmless ones,  resisting the vulgar ones, banning the obscene ones, and dealing  blows to the reactionary ones. In addition, governments at all  levels should conduct an all-round inspection and rectification  of the cultural market, ban all unhealthy cultural places, and  develop and support healthy cultural places. At the same time,  governments should accelerate the establishment of the rules and  regulations on management of the cultural market, rapidly build  the ranks of workers of cultural market management organs, and  improve the level of management of cultural market.</p>

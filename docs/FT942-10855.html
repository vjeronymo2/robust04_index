			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / French to urge Airbus challenge to US jumbo Aerospatiale of France will press its European Airbus partners to step up marketing and development efforts of a new 500-550 seat large Airbus airliner - the A3XX - to challenge the monopoly of the US Boeing company in the jumbo aircraft market. The move reflects concern over Boeing's plans to develop a larger version of its Boeing 747-400 jumbo with a new wing to consolidate its dominance of the big aircraft market. Although the four Airbus partners - Aerospatiale, Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain - have been involved for the past two years in joint studies with Boeing of the development of a very large aircraft, Aerospatiale is worried that Boeing is moving to develop a bigger version of the 747. 'We must give Boeing the strongest possible signal that Airbus will develop its own jumbo if Boeing decided to go it alone with a bigger 747,' said Mr Louis Gallois, the Aerospatiale chairman. Airbus has suspected that Boeing has been using the joint studies on a super jumbo programme with the Europeans as a device to delay Airbus' own efforts to compete against its monopoly of the jumbo market while it continued to study a bigger version of the 747. Airbus, however, has also continued to pursue studies of a 500-550 seater airliner. 'These preliminary studies on the A3XX jumbo will be completed in the next few weeks,' said Mr Claude Terrazzoni, head of Aerospatiale's civil aircraft division. Mr Terrazzoni said Aerospatiale estimated the cost of developing the A3XX, a double deck jumbo airliner, at around Dollars 8bn. This compares with Dollars 6bn the Airbus partners spent on the development of the A330-A340 family of 350-seat widebodied aircraft which have recently entered service. Although only two airlines, British Airways and Singapore Airlines, have so far shown interest in a super jumbo aircraft, Mr Terrazzoni expected demand for around 500 very large capacity airliners costing between Dollars 200m and Dollars 250m each to emerge within 20 years. 'Aircraft with over 400 seats will account for over 40 per cent of the value of the civil aircraft market in the next 20 years and Airbus simply cannot afford not to be part of that market,' he stressed. While continuing their joint studies, each side is now striving to position itself ahead of the other to launch its own super jumbo programmes. This issue is expected to weigh heavily in the revival of negotiations in Geneva on May 19 on a new civil aircraft subsidy code under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The talks were suspended at the end of last year when it was decided to try to reach accord on a Gatt civil aircraft code by the end of this year. But the Europeans fear the US has little interest in negotiating such an agreement, preferring to see the civil aircraft sector fall into the general Gatt subsidy code. This reflects differences in which the US and European aircraft industries are subsidised. European manufacturers rely on direct refundable loan support from their governments while the US industry benefits from indirect research and development support from government agencies. In 1992 the US and the then European Community agreed to limit direct support to 33 per cent of development costs of new aircraft programmes.</p>

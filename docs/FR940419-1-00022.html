			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Abatement Plans and Progress Reports <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulation allows the Agency's Area Director ``at his or her discretion'' to require an abatement plan and progress reports when multi-step abatement is ``deemed appropriate.'' At the current time, when the Area Director issues a citation to an employer (usually involving air contaminants, noise, or ergonomics) which will require a long, or multi-step, abatement effort, the citation letter lists both the steps to be taken and a schedule for completion. The Agency in its citation letter informs the employer that it must send progress reports to the Area Director. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the employer will have in hand OSHA's proposed plan for multi-step abatement to use as a guide, the Agency estimates that it will take an employer two hours to write the plan as required by the proposed regulation. The Agency estimates that, on average, there are three steps in a multi-step abatement and that it will take the employer 30 minutes to prepare each progress report. The Agency estimates that the total wage rate of a supervisor, manager, or proprietor who would perform this work is $25 per hour (Bureau of Labor Statistics News, June 18, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, citations requiring multi-stage abatement efforts are a small percentage of all citations. Virtually all of the multi-stage abatements for Federal violations are for three causes: Ergonomics, noise, and permissible air limits. In 1991 there were 749 Federal OSHA inspections that resulted in citations for ergonomics, air contaminants, noise, or single-substance OSHA standards, resulting in 1,934 violations (all of which would have required multiple step abatement). Based on this number of multi-stage abatements required in Fiscal year 1991, and assuming that State-plan agencies had an equal number, the Agency estimates that the cost of proposing multi-step abatement plans and providing progress reports is: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> Cost = (1934 &times; 2) &times; $25/hr &times; [2 hours + (3 &times; 1/2 hours)] = $338,450. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Benefits (Cost Savings) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Verification Efforts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulatory action will reduce time-consuming efforts required of OSHA's enforcement officers to verify and document abatement in order to close files, thereby increasing the time available for inspection activities. OSHA's Directorate of Compliance Programs estimates that these efforts consume approximately 5 percent of compliance staff time, or the equivalent of 50 full-time compliance officers for Federal enforcement. The Agency estimates that an equal number of full-time equivalents perform this task for State-plan agencies, or a total of 100 full-time-equivalents. With an average estimated salary of $50,000 including benefits, the dollar value of this time is approximately $5 million annually. The Agency estimates that the increased work of collecting and analyzing abatement certificates and accompanying documentation for enforcement agencies will be minor_OSHA is currently receiving abatement information for approximately 70 percent of its citations. The Agency estimates that affected employers should also save approximately the same amount of time and money ($5 million annually) spent in responding to OSHA's letters and calls seeking verification of abatement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Follow-Up Inspections <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In FY 1991, Federal OSHA performed about 2,000 follow-up inspections, and State-plan agencies about 7,000 (Table 2), for a total of about 9,000 annually. Combined, these efforts represented 100,700 staff hours, <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  or approximately 50 full-time compliance officers. One of the Agency's goals in promulgating this regulation is to reduce the resources employed in follow-up inspections as well as other unproductive efforts associated with abatement verification. The Agency's Directorate of Compliance estimates that under this regulation, the Agency will decrease its follow-up inspections by half, and OSHA estimates that State-plan agencies will do the same. With an estimated average salary and benefits of $50,000, cutting follow-up inspections by half will save enforcement agencies $1.25 million in resources annually. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Estimated follow-up inspection staff hours: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1,477 (Fed) safety &times; 14 Avg. Hrs./follow-up = 20,678 Hrs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  562 (Fed) health &times; 46 Avg. Hrs./follow-up = 25,852 Hrs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5,610 (State) safety &times; 6 Avg. Hrs./follow-up = 33,660 Hrs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1,465 (State) health &times; 14 Avg. Hrs./follow-up = 20,510 Hrs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Total = 100,700 Hrs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although a significant portion of a Compliance Officer's time is spent in preparation and travel to a worksite for these inspections, at the worksite he or she is accompanied by one or more employer representatives as well as an employees representative. The Agency estimates that: The total hourly wage of the employer's representative is $25; the total wage of the employee's representative is $15 (BLS News, June 18, 1993); and that a follow-up inspection takes, on average, three hours. The Agency estimates that reducing the number of follow-up inspections by half will annually save employers $540,000 [4,500 inspections &times; 3 hrs &times; ($25 + $15)]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Economic Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency estimates that the economic impact on individual employers, industry profits, and product prices to be insignificant for every affected industry, and therefore concludes that the regulation is economically feasible. Only 15 minutes of a manager's time, on average, should be needed to verify abatement and provide some documentation. Since employers will avoid time spent responding to verification requests from the Agency as well as follow-up inspections, the Agency estimates that overall there is a net savings for employers. There is a savings of resources for Federal OSHA and State-plan states. As a whole this regulation should result in a saving of resources (Table 3). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

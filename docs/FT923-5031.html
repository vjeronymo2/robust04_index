			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Letter: Unrealistic employment prospects Sir, 'Escape from the Black Hole' (August 29) gave useful advice to the newly redundant executive. The prospect of re-employment within five months and at higher salary levels held out by Mr Bell is, however, quite incongruous, particularly when applied to senior executives from the City. I, and others, who have used outplacement services have a much slower tale of re-employment. I created my own business 12 months after leaving my former employer and it will be some time before it affords an assured future. Outplacement, particularly the use of networking, had a valuable part to play in my own re-establishment but does its reputation little good if it holds out quite unrealistic prospects to those that use its services.

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading MORE RIGHTS issue fears, coupled with a general lack of buying interest, led to a lacklustre day in derivatives yesterday, writes Joel Kibazo. The early announcement of a cash call from Commercial Union was at first poorly received and the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened weakly at 2,823. However, the view that the funds were to be put to good use helped to steady nerves and the March contract shrugged off the early gloom to move into positive territory on sporadic buying, mainly from independent traders. That positive mood received a sharp knock when a leading securities house moved to sell the contract. March fell sharply and was soon trading at a discount to the underlying cash market, which had followed it down. With a dull Wall Street and few buyers, March fell to a day's low of 2,808 at 2.50pm. But a feeling that the contract's fall had been overdone, together with general short-covering, helped it rally in the last half-hour of trading. March finished at 2,827, down 6 from the previous close and at a premium of 12 to cash. Turnover fell to 9,918 lots. In traded options, a total of 30,523 contracts had been dealt by the close, with some 7,616 lots transacted in the FT-SE 100 option. Tesco was the most active stock option with volume of 2,733 contracts.</p>

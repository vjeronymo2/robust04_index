			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Britain to stop funding OECD research group Britain is withdrawing from part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's research programme as a signal of its growing unease with the organisation's overspending. The decision to withdraw from the OECD's Development Centre was communicated to the organisation last Friday by Mr Keith MacInnes, the British ambassador, in a statement which clearly reflected a rift between the UK and the OECD over budget control. The move also seems likely to fuel concern about the future direction and funding of the OECD, which represents 25 leading industrial nations, as it seeks to expand into new areas and take on more members. Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the OECD's secretary-general yesterday said: 'I am surprised by this (decision) - it came out of the blue. Britain had been one of the strongest supporters of the centre.' The UK will withdraw in 1996 the FFr3m (Pounds 355,000) funding it provides to the centre, which carries out research into third world issues and builds links with countries such as China. Mr MacInnes told the OECD that the UK was prepared 'with reluctance' to join a consensus about the OECD's latest proposal for its overall budget, which was agreed in Paris last week. This has been set above the French inflation rate and follows a growth in the organisation's budgets of nearly 40 per cent in cash terms over the past four years. Mr MacInnes contrasted this with the 'the great efforts' being made by the UK government to restrain public expenditure, 'in step with principles advocated by the OECD'. He said: 'The increase in budgets of international organisations such as the OECD causes us very real difficulty.' A UK official said yesterday: 'We are making it clear that we are not happy with the way OECD money has been spent.' The UK contributes about 5 per cent of the Development Centre's annual funding. The centre is a semi-autonomous wing of the OECD and its budget is separate from the overall OECD budget. Membership is voluntary for OECD members, but most support it as part of their funding for the OECD. British officials pointed out that the decision should be seen as part of broader cuts and reallocation in the UK development budget. However, OECD officials suggested that the move could be a retaliation for the UK's defeat in its attempts to impose tighter controls on the overall OECD budget. The Development Centre said it was disappointed by the decision and warned it would probably reduce its employment of British consultants as well as research into areas of interest to Britain.</p>

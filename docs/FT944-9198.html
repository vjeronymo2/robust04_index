			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: De La Rue jumps Shares in cash rich De La Rue, the bank note printer, hit an all-time high as the market responded to a sparkling set of interim results. Profits of Pounds 72.8m were boosted by a far higher than forecast input from its printing machine subsidiary, and compared with forecasts of Pounds 65m to Pounds 67m. The interim dividend was raised by 6 per cent. The stock also received a fillip from the lively start to the National Lottery - De La Rue is one of the five companies in the Camelot consortium which runs the Lottery. The shares jumped 31 to 1034p, although some analysts were beginning to wonder if their premium rating is beginning to look a little demanding. Paper group Portals, one of De La Rue's principal suppliers, rose 37 to 725p. However, Racal, another of the Camelot partners, failed to share in yesterday's lottery fever, sliding 11 1/2 to 235 1/2 p late in the afternoon as a sizeable line of stock hovered over the market. Turnover in the stock totalled 2.4m.</p>

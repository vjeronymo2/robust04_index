The two officials illustrated the recent successes of a city  that now boasts some 12 million inhabitants and is considered  the financial and industrial capital of China, lying at the  centre of a region that has regularly notched up some of the  world's highest economic growth rates in recent years.    For the future, they mapped out programmes for the special  economic zone of Pudong, where Italy had already pledged cash  and expertise for major infrastructure developments.    Senator Spadolini, who will tomorrow complete the Chinese  tour he has undertaken at the invitation of the National  People's Assembly, today also visited Shanghai's Academy of  Social Sciences.    After his meeting with Mayor Huang Jin -- with whom he also  examined ways of extending political and cultural co-operation  between Italy and China -- Spadolini visited the diocesan  seminary at Sheshan and met the bishop of Shanghai Aloisius Jin,  with whom he had a wide-ranging discussion of the situation of  Catholics in China and the possibility of normalisation.    In Beijing previously, the Senate Speaker had long talks  with  Bishop Michele Fu Tie Shan on the same issues.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Croatian attack on Serbs shatters ceasefire: Krajina offensive threatens to put skids under United Nations peace arrangements CROATIAN troops yesterday launched an offensive into Serb-held Krajina, crossing the UN ceasefire line and threatening to wreck UN peace arrangements in Croatia and undermine the Bosnian peace talks, which resume in Geneva today. A Croatian advance provoked an immediate warning from the leaders of the rump Yugoslav federation and the Bosnian Serbs that their forces would go to the help of Serbs in Krajina if the Croat attacks were not stopped. The UN Security Council deplored the Croatian offensive and urged the Croatian authorities to withdraw their forces to their previous positions. It called upon all the parties not to take any action that would jeopardise the peace process. In a letter to the Security Council yesterday, Mr Dobrica Cosic, the Yugoslav president, said that if the UN did not stop Croat encroachments, Belgrade would do so. 'We are now at a turning point - either towards peace or toward total war,' he warned. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, who promised similar action, said he believed Croatia was aiming to wreck efforts to bring peace to Bosnia. However, Mr Fred Eckhard, the spokesman for international mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, said last night there was no indication that the Geneva talks, due to be resumed today, would be postponed as a result of the fighting in Krajina. 'If anything, it will provide a venue for the principals to talk it over,' he said. UN officials in Zagreb said Croatian troops crossed the year-old ceasefire line around the Maslenica bridge, the main overland route linking central Croatia with its southern Adriatic coast and around the Zemunik airport, near the port of Zadar. The offensive comes amid mounting frustration among Croat leaders over their lack of control over about one-third of Croatia, which is held by Serb militias and under nominal UN authority. 'They have told us they want to secure the Maslenica bridge area and the area around it because they are exasperated with Serb delays with regard to reconstruction of the vital bridge,' Mr Cedric Thornberry, the UN chief of civilian affairs, said in Zagreb. Yesterday's offensive shattered a relatively stable ceasefire in Croatia and raised fears of a renewal of the Serbo-Croat war. At least 10,000 people were killed in the seven-month conflict in Croatia which erupted in June 1991 when the western republic declared independence from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. Backed by the Yugoslav army, Serbs, who comprised 13 per cent of the 4.7m population, took up arms against Croatian independence. Belgrade Radio said several French peacekeepers were wounded in the fighting at Zemunik airport. The report could not be independently confirmed. They said hundreds of refugees were fleeing artillery and mortar barrages in the area. Serb commanders in Krajina, the self-proclaimed Serbian state in Croatia, announced a general mobilisation. Under the UN peace plan, Serb fighters were supposed to hand over their weapons to UN supervision to create demilitarised zones. But a UN official yesterday said Serbs had removed heavy artillery from UN-supervised arms depots. Meanwhile fighting was reported throughout Bosnia-Hercegovina. Sarajevo radio said the old town centre of the besieged Bosnian capital came under heavy shelling by Serb forces from the surrounding hills. Serb forces bombarded Mostar, the Croat-held city in south-west Bosnia, said Croatian radio. In eastern Croatia, a UN soldier was killed when he stepped on a landmine in Sector East. He was the 24th UN peacekeeper killed since UN troops were deployed last March.</p>

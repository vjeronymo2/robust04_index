			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Letter: The Archbishop, shareholders and re-thinking the purpose and standards of business Sir, Professor Handy's starting point for rethinking the company implies that companies are all large quoted plcs and that shareholders are all institutional. The total number of UK companies is 700,000, of which only 1,955 are quoted. Prof Handy's thesis can only, therefore, apply to just 0.28 per cent of companies. And although institutions own the majority of shares, he should not ignore private shareholders, not least because they 'think and act' differently from institutions. Prof Handy implies that shareholders are unfairly rewarded compared with other stakeholders. It is misleading for him to quote the purpose of the company as being to 'enhance shareholder value' and imply that company results achieve this purpose. They do not. The average plc dispenses 50 per cent of value added to employees and 5 per cent to shareholders in dividends. We do need to rethink the company. This needs to start from an understanding of why the model of shareholder democracy no longer works so well. 'Most large investing institutions have neither time nor inclination to exercise their ownership rights' is a view in the US. Barry Riley cites the triumph of 'managerial' over 'entrepreneurial' capitalism and points to the 'hefty remuneration to top executives' as a symptom. The concept of shareholder democracy and the role of the private shareholder should be central to our re-thinking. That is why several private shareholders are establishing a UK Private Shareholder's Association to help them perform more effectively their ownership role.

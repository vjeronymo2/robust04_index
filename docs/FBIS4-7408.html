			<p>BFN     [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  initially planned to dispatch a two-person inspection team to  North Korea early this week in connection with the replacement  of nuclear fuel rods. However, North Korea has not allowed  essential inspection activities. Thus, the IAEA decided to  temporarily withhold dispatching the inspection team.    David Kyd, director of IAEA Information Department, said  that  the IAEA, when accepting the North Korean proposal concerning  the replacement of nuclear fuel rods, demanded that North Korea  allow essential inspection activities, and requested the  issuance of visas for two inspectors to be dispatched as advance  team members.    Director Kyd said that the IAEA urged North Korea to allow  essential inspection activities pertaining to the replacement  of nuclear fuel rods. He stressed that as long as North Korea  does not show a change in its basic position, the dispatch of  the inspection team will be withheld.    Director Kyd said, however, that if North Korea flexibly  accepts the IAEA proposal by Thursday [28 April], the IAEA would  consider dispatching an inspection team on Thursday.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel's cash crunch Eurotunnel and its advisers, SG Warburg, should be suitably red-faced for undershooting its revenue projections by so much so quickly. Long-suffering shareholders who subscribed to May's rights issue at 265p yesterday watched their sterling units drop to just 221p - their lowest point since 1988. The group's deteriorating cash position is the immediate concern. It means Eurotunnel is unlikely to meet the conditions necessary to access its senior debt next spring. This need not involve yet another rights issue because the breach is likely to involve tens rather than hundreds of millions of pounds. But it adds aggravation at a time when the management should be concentrating on next summer's peak season. Each time important milestones have been reached - when the boring was completed, when the tunnel was commissioned, when the Queen and President Mitterrand opened it - doubts have emerged. Concerns over whether the group can generate enough revenue to cope with its interest burden should be dispelled or confirmed next summer when the system is supposed to run at full capacity. Three things will be needed if it is to succeed. Eurotunnel has to ensure service quality, running fast, reliable and frequent trains; British Rail and SNCF have to generate volumes on the city to city routes; and Eurotunnel must avoid a price war with Stena and P&amp;O. The auguries are not good. The margin for error is tight and Eurotunnel's historic inability to predict even the nearest of futures does not instill confidence. The tunnel will undoubtedly be a money-spinner at some point. But whether under this management and for this generation of shareholders remains doubtful.</p>

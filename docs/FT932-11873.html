			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Sotheby's Holdings trims deficit By Reuter in New York SOTHEBY'S Holdings, parent of Sotheby's worldwide auction, finance and real estate operations, incurred a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 5.2m or 9 cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 5.7m or 11 cents a year earlier, Reuters reports from New York. The company said the results represented a 9 per cent improvement over the same period last year. Sotheby's said the first and third quarters were generally loss periods, as at least 80 per cent of auction sales took place in the second and fourth quarters. Auction sales for the quarter fell to Dollars 129.6m from Dollars 141.4m in 1992. This was due mainly to currency movements, as well as a large sale by a single owner in Monaco in 1992, which had no equivalent the first quarter of 1993. The jewellery sale in St Moritz totalled Dollars 23.9m, the highest result achieved there, the company said. The jewellery market continued its strong performance into the second quarter when the New York sale generated Dollars 19.8m.</p>

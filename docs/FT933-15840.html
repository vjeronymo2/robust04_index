			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / House prices 'decline 1.1%' HOUSE PRICES fell by 1.1 per cent in June, Halifax, the country's biggest building society, said yesterday. The society said it was the second monthly fall in succession. The findings conflict with figures published by Nationwide, the second largest society, which reported that prices rose 1.6 per cent in June, the fourth consecutive monthly price rise recorded by the society. Halifax, unlike Nationwide, adjusts its figures to take account of seasonal variations. It said that if figures from both societies were 'averaged out', they would show very little movement since last September: 'House prices are unlikely to show consistent rises until there is firmer evidence of rising demand for mortgage finance and increased levels of transactions.' Housebuilders have expressed concern that the revival in house sales has faltered in recent weeks. Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, said on Monday that a lack of consumer confidence was having a 'particularly severe impact on the private housing market which, having shown an improvement in prospects in the spring, has now faltered'. Halifax said it expected increased demand for mortgages to feed through to gradual increases in house prices in the second half of this year. It added that prices should rise more steadily next year, increasing by about 5 per cent. Halifax said the average price of a house last month was Pounds 62,440 - 4.5 per cent lower than 12 months ago.</p>

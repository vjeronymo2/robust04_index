			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Reasons why float had to be pulled BrightReasons, the owner of Pizzaland, has become the latest new issues casualty. The company announced yesterday that its share offer would be 'delayed'. Its brokers had advised that the shares would have to be offered at a price that its management was not prepared to accept. The decision follows the sudden postponement of the share offer for New Look, the women's wear chain, after fund managers had shown limited interest in the offer. BrightReasons had planned to raise about Pounds 35m from investors in an offer that would have valued the group at between Pounds 60m and Pounds 80m. The money was to have paid down debt built up in expanding restaurant chains, which include Pastifico, Prima Pasta and Pizza Piazza. Despite the recent stock market recovery, brokers UBS Securities advised that this valuation was not possible. BrightReasons was adamant that it was in no hurry to float and that the issue would go ahead once market conditions were more favourable. The company's said its recent trading performance had been 'extremely strong'. It has been a difficult period for new issues. This year has broken records for both the number of companies and the size of offerings. However, a number of flotations have been followed by disappointing trading statements and institutional interest has waned. Property group London Capital Holdings was the first issue to be pulled, in May. It was followed by a number of others, including British Printing Company, Life Style Care, General Cable and Telewest, which has recently resuscitated its share offer.</p>

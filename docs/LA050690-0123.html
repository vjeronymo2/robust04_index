			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> GHOST SUBWAY STOP LOOKS BACK TO FUTURE  </P> <P> Fifty yards from City Hall and 35 feet below it lies a long slow curve into New  York's past. It is a subway station that recalls a time when underground train  rides were trips into the future and when terra cotta, not stainless steel, was  the underground vogue.  </P> <P> Few of the city's daily 10 million subway riders have ever seen or heard of the  City Hall Station, which was the last stop on the city's first subway line, the  Interborough Rapid Transit. Since 1948, passengers have had to get off at the  larger but more plain Brooklyn Bridge stop.  </P> <P> City Hall Station is a ghost station. Its brass chandeliers and vaulted  ceilings are for the most part seen only by engineers and conductors who guide  their trains through the station from the downtown to the uptown track.  </P> <P> There are five ghost stations in New York, but none so historically significant  or remarkably well preserved.  </P> <P> "Each time I go by, it's like going into the past," said John Morton, a driver  for 16 years.  </P> <P> On Oct. 27, 1904, New York's 93rd mayor, John McClellan, descended the steps of  one of two kiosks marking the station's entrance in City Hall Park. Then taking  a silver key from an engineer, he switched on the electricity and drove the  first train out of the station to the wild cheering of passengers as well as  above-ground crowds.  </P> <P> Because of its location literally at the foot of New York's government, City  Hall was the crown jewel among the IRT's original 49 stations. Aside from its  chandeliers and cream-colored matte ceiling tiles, it featured three skylights  of tinted glass and station name plaques of blue and white glazed tile.  </P> <P> Work on the original IRT lasted almost five years and cost $35 million. The  line stretched from the City Hall Station north to Grand Central Terminal, west  to Times Square and then north again to 145th Street in Manhattan. One  newspaper reported that although New Yorkers were a little mystified at seeing  people emerge from underground stations, they quickly embraced their subway, as  more than 150,000 people went for a ride on opening night.  </P> <P> But in 1948, the city's transit authority decided to end service to City Hall  Station. It said that the extreme curve of the station, which created gaps of  one to two feet between trains and the platform, was a hazard for passengers.  Trains would continue to use its tunnel to turn around, but Brooklyn Bridge,  which despite its name lies roughly the same distance from City Hall, became  the last stop on the No. 6 line.  </P> <P> In contrast to the opening ceremony, City Hall Station closed without fanfare  on the stroke of the new year. New York's newspapers barely made note of its  passing.  </P> <P> Citing its historical importance and beautiful tile work, New York's Landmarks  Commission made City Hall Station a landmark on Oct. 29, 1979. Michael Corbett,  a commission researcher, said landmark structures are "customarily open to the  public."  </P> <P> Tour groups cleared by the Transit Authority are now the only passengers  permitted to see the station.  </P> <P> Bob Previdi, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transit Authority, said that the  agency had considered opening City Hall to the public, possibly as a  restaurant, but that the station's narrow platforms and poor plumbing presented  formidable obstacles.  </P> <P> Melanie Crawford, a traffic controller for the No. 6 line, said that she was  proud to have the station under her jurisdiction. "You get a feeling of  history," she said.  </P> <P> The gloominess of the station easily evokes memories of the past. Two of the  three skylights have been blocked. Only the lights from the chandeliers -- 12  in all with four bulbs each -- illuminate the platform. A short flight of  stairs up from the platform, 12 more bulbs provide light for the small  mezzanine.  </P> <P> The tile work is marred only by a small chip over one of the nameplates, and  some graffiti. Marvin Capers, a former train engineer who leads tours of the  station, said it is cleaned regularly.  </P> <P> "Look at how the work has held up," he said. "If you built something like this  today, the tiles would be gone."  </P></p>

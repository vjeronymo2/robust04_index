			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau, February 28 TASS -- The early returns of  the parliamentary elections in Moldova have proved sensational.  Spot calculation of the ballots has shown that the despite  forecasts, the coalition of the Socialist Party and  International Movement Unity, mainly backed by the  Russian-speaking population, are in the lead in Chisinau, some  cities and rural districts of the republic.    Together with the Agrarian Democratic Party headed by  parliament speaker Petr Luchinschi, the socialists are ahead of  all the other parties.    Judging by the preliminary results, the opposition in the  new  parliament will be made up of pro-Romanian coalition of  intellectuals and peasants and the Christian Democratic Popular  Front, which rank third and fourth but will be unable to for a  majority in new parliament.    The above four parties cleared the four-per cent election  hurdle and won seats in the new parliament.    If the forecasts based on the preliminary returns  materialise, the Agrarian Party will have to team up with the  socialists to form a majority in the parliament and form a new  government to lead the republic out of the crisis. If this does  not happen, "Moldova is in for difficult times", according to  Petr Luchinschi.</p>

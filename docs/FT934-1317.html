			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Housing at top of spending league: In spite of Tory pledges, the quango seems a more voracious beast than ever The Housing Corporation, which distributes government grants to housing associations in England, is the biggest spender in this year's FT top 40 list of quangos - quasi-autonomous non-governmental bodies, whose power and influence the government is pledged to curb. The corporation, at Pounds 2.3bn, has risen from 10th place in last year's list following the boost given to its budget to buy unsold homes as part of the housing market package in the autumn statement last year. New entrants this year include English Heritage, the quango which looks after historical buildings and monuments, and English Estates, which builds business premises in depressed areas. Just four of the top 40 quangos are chaired by women, in spite of the government's drive to increase the number of women appointed to public posts. Women hold 28 per cent of places on quango boards. Businessmen, current and retired, continue to dominate as chairmen of the top 40. In the list for the first time this year are Sir Martin Jacomb, chairman of the British Council and former deputy chairman of Barclays Bank, and Sir Anthony Cleaver, who chairs IBM UK as well as the UK Atomic Energy Authority.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- QUANGOS - SEE HOW THEY GROW  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Number               Staff          Expenditure                                                           (Pounds m)                1991-92  1992-93    1991-92    1992-93  1991-92  1992-93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Non-departmental   public bodies  1,412    1,389    114,400    111,300   13,750   15,410 National Health   Service          510      629  1,027,678  1,076,179   22,858   25,086 Training and   Enterprise   Councils         116      116        n/a        n/a    2,448    2,690 TOTAL            2,038    2,134  1,142,078  1,187,479   39,056   43,186  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Public Bodies (HMSO); Department of Employment; Welsh Office; Scottish Office.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE 10 BIGGEST SPENDERS AMONG THE NHS QUANGOS, PLUS THE 30 BIGGEST NON-NHS SPENDERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               Annual          Staff                                           spdg Pds m         1.4.93  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1  Housing Corporation                        2,371            715  2  Universities Funding Council               1,807            151  3  W Midlands RHA                             1,767          1,168  4  Trent RHA                                  1,594            509  5  North East Thames RHA                      1,448            580  6  North Western RHA                          1,440            785  7  South East Thames RHA                      1,383            604  8  Yorkshire RHA                              1,276            518  9  North West Thames RHA                      1,260            381 10  South Western RHA                          1,128            559 11  Legal Aid Board                            1,117          1,426 12  Northern RHA                               1,107            656 13  South West Thames RHA                      1,078            611 14  Polytech, Colleges Fund Council            1,035            151 15  Scottish Homes                               626          1,279 16  Science &amp; Eng Research Council               566          2,589 17  Police Authority for Northern Ireland        566         15,860 18  Northern Ireland Housing Executive           492          4,263 19  Scottish Enterprise                          449            317 20  National Rivers Authority                    437          7,599 21  British Council                              433          5,006 22  UK Atomic Energy Authority                   415          8,033 23  Medical Research Council                     251          3,343 24  London Pension Funds Authority               244            105 25  Health and Safety Executive                  211          4,436 26  Arts Council of Great Britain                206            148 27  Remploy Ltd                                  196         10,000 28  Housing for Wales                            187             75 29  London Docklands Dev Corp                    186            235 30  Natural Env.

The largest quangos are dominated by health service bodies which make up more than half the top 40 spenders among UK public bodies.  To make a representative selection of the different fields covered by quangos, the FT top 40 combines the 10 highest-spending national health service bodies and the 30 largest non-NHS bodies.  Nationalised industries, public corporations and Northern Ireland bodies with functions carried out by local government in the rest of the UK are excluded.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

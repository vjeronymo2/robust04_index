			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The annual summits of the  Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries have reached "an  important crossroads" following the end of the Cold War,  according to senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official Koichiro  Matsuura.    The invitation to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to  the G-7 summit in London in 1991 marked the diplomatic end to  the Cold War structure, said Matsuura, former deputy foreign  minister for economic affairs, in a recent interview with KYODO  NEWS SERVICE. "But the G-7 nations have yet to form a consensus  on what role their summits, marking their 20th anniversary at  this year's Naples gathering, should play in the post-Cold War  era," he said. The East-West confrontation of the 1970s and the  first oil crisis in 1973 were prime movers in launching the  summits, Matsuura said. "But now there is nothing that binds  them together so firmly," he claimed. "They are now in a  transitional stage."    Matsuura served as a sherpa, or personal representative of  the prime minister, at the 1992 Munich summit and the 1993 Tokyo  summit. He said the G-7 countries are having difficulty dealing  with Russia, which has stumbled in implementing reform programs  despite full- fledged aid commitment by the G-7 at last year's  Tokyo summit. "How to define Russia's role in the summit  framework will probably be taken up at the Naples summit," he  said. "But G-7 leaders are unlikely to reach an accord on the  matter and the topic will be carried into next year's summit in  Canada." He said Russia appears to want to use its  participation at the summit to give the world the impression it  is an economic power.    Matsuura said the G-7 nations have effectively tackled trade  and currency issues throughout the past 19 summit meetings,  which began at Rambouillet, France, in 1975. He said a floating  exchange rate system has come to function well, while new global  trade rules are expected to take effect at the beginning of next  year under the World Trade Organization (WTO) following the  recent conclusion of the Uruguay round of multilateral trade  talks. But macroeconomic issues, which Matsuura claims are "far  more difficult" to cope with than currency and trade problems,  are still pending, necessitating further policy coordination  among the G-7. Matsuura said the Naples summit will give  priority to how to achieve growth and employment simultaneously,  an issue also discussed at the Tokyo summit under the "global  growth strategy."    The economy is recovering smoothly in the United States  while  signs of a pickup are appearing in Japan, but this does not mean  that global unemployment will be easily solved, he said. Global  joblessness can be partly traced to structural problems that  often require political solutions, he added.    Directly or indirectly, Japan will probably be asked to  boost  its domestic demand during the Naples summit as part of efforts  to reduce global unemployment. But it is unlikely there will be  any magic prescription for dealing with structural problems on  the jobless issue, he said.    On the political front, Bosnia will top the Naples agenda in  view of its geographical proximity to most summit member  countries. The suspected nuclear arms program by North Korea  could also be taken up if the situation becomes more serious,  Matsuura said.</p>

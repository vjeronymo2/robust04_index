In his address, Major General Saw Lwin, chairman of Kachin  State LORC and commander of northern military command, explained  that the meeting was held so that personnel of the local KIO and  the DBANR groups could meet and hold talks in order to increase  the momentum of development in the region. He said economic,  social, and other development activities in the Kachin State  could not be carried out as in other states due to climatic and  transportation difficulties. The commander reiterated that  development activities have been carried out nationwide since  1988, when the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC]  took over the responsibilities of the nation. They are being  implemented with cooperation and coordination from regional  organizations at various levels.    Saw Lwin added that, in implementing regional development  activities for the development of border areas and national  races, and in accordance with SLORC guidelines, development  programs will be conducted in three stages. The first stage  involves activities directed from the central level; the second  stage involves Kachin State level activities; and the third  stage concerns district level works. Maj. Gen. Saw Lwin then  asked to be excused if any weaknesses or imperfections occurred  in implementing the development works and noted that every  effort will be made to the best of the ability of those involved  to ensure the projects are a success.    He requested that local KIO personnel regroup villagers who  have vacated their villages and places of abode for various  reasons due to insurgency and told them about the need to  nurture the education, health, and economic development of  villagers. Continuing, the commander noted that villages must  be systematically reorganized according to their prevailing  needs, and the chosen localities should have suitable regional  and climatic conditions. Maj. Gen. Saw Lwin added that  long-term and long-term plants and fruit trees should be planted  for the benefit of future generations, with preference given to  commercial and important plants. He then explained that the  main transportation routes for commercialization are being built  by the Kachin State LORC with cooperation from higher  departments. He noted the need for cooperation by the KIO in  building these roads, and explained the frankness and goodwill  in implementing development activities for the benefit of future  generations; that they can be proud of. Finally, Maj. Gen. Saw  Lwin urged cooperation and coordination in fulfilling the  development tasks, keeping in mind the love of country and  patriotism.    The commander then introduced KIO leader U Lamung Tugyaing  and his party to personnel from the DBANR working group and  Kachin State departmental officials. The commander then  presented the KIO leaders with gifts -- 400 pieces of clothing  -- for the local people in the Kachin Independence Army [KIA]  First Brigade region.</p>

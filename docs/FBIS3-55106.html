			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mamuka Dzebisashvili: "Why Were We Defeated in </F> Abkhazia?"]    [Text] The first stage of the Abkhazian conflict has ended  with the defeat of the Georgians. However, as has been said  more than once, the war has not ended and it is only a matter of  time before it begins again. Consequently, the renewal of  combat actions in Abkhazia is unavoidable. Therefore, it would  be better for us to take into account those military mistakes or  technical failures that took place during the course of the  conflict. In spite of the self-sacrifice of Georgian fighters,  these errors were, to a significant degree, responsible for the  defeat of the Georgian Army and the loss first of Sukhumi and  then the whole of Abkhazia.  <H5>  Without a State Army: </H5>   The process of forming a single Georgian army has been going  on for several years now. However, almost nothing has been done  in this respect. A hastily formed, untrained, undisciplined  army will not be able to win a war. Any person with a military  education knows that an army is formed through incessant  training at barracks. In this respect, the situation is bad.  The barracks, firing ranges, and military bases that Russia  transferred to the Georgian Ministry of Defense are in a  demolished state. Many are, in general, abandoned military  installations that do not have the appropriate military  contingent and that have been plundered by the local population.  However, once repaired and provided with elementary defense,  they will play a decisive role in the formation of the Georgian  Army. There are significant problems within the military  commissariats that are unable to call up the necessary number of  young persons for service in the armed forces. The reason is  simple: The commissariat is a bureaucratic body. Due to  thousands of "arrangements" and machinations, conscripts have  easily been able to avoid compulsory military service. If this  body is not reformed or replaced by another structure, we will  not be able to achieve the desired results. We have to create  an institution that will punish with the full severity of the  law those persons who avoid service in the armed forces.    The lack of officer cadres remains an unresolved problem. On  the initiative of the Ministry of Defense, Georgian and  non-Georgian officers serving in the Russian Army have started  to be brought into the national army. However, unless there is  an improvement in the social situation of officers, this  priceless treasure will slip out of our hands.    The existence of armed formations remains an insurmountable  barrier to the creation of an army. These subunits are not  accountable to anyone and, in a number of cases, appear almost  as bandit detachments. It has been repeatedly stated that they  are to join the official armed forces but, in reality, nothing  has changed. Quite recently, the republic's defense minister  again issued an order on the necessity of all military  formations becoming part of a single army and on providing the  sides that participated in the Abkhazian conflict with weapons  and technical equipment. Naturally, the nonexistence of a  trained army played a big role in the defeat in Abkhazia.  However, the antiquity of Georgian military equipment and  weapons had decisive importance. At the initial stage of the  conflict, the Abkhazians had a qualitative rather than  quantitative advantage in equipment over their opponents.  However, following violation of the Sochi agreement [signed on  27 July 1993], they also had quantitative superiority.    Armored equipment: The existing conflicts on the  territory of the former Soviet Union have clearly shown the  importance of armored equipment in conditions of war. In  today's conditions, having modern armored forces that have been  tactically trained means being halfway toward winning a war.  Unfortunately, Georgia has nothing to boast about regarding its  armored equipment. Of all the former Soviet republics, Georgia  was the one that received the most antiquated and worthless  equipment. Whereas Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan  received modern armored vehicles (T-72, T-80, BTR-80, and so  forth) from the Russian Army, Georgia, on the other hand, was  given tanks and APC's (T-54, T-55, T-62, BTR-60BP, and BRDM)  dating from World War II and its aftermath.    During the initial stage of the Abkhazian war, the Georgian  side had a big advantage (in the main, quantitative) as far as  armored equipment was concerned. However, the situation  gradually changed. The Abkhazians had in their weaponry: T-72,  T-55, BTR-80, MT-LB, and so forth. The defenders of Gagra and  Sukhumi were astonished by the qualities of the so-called  "uncapturable" T-72 tank. It was impossible to destroy it with  small-caliber guns and the RPG-7 and "Mukha" [antitank] rocket  launchers. The IFV-2 also worked well for the Abkhazian side, a  vehicle which, for the most part, is an improved version of the  IFV-1 in possession of the Georgians, the only difference being  that it has a semi-automatic gun (while the IFV-1 is still  loading a shell, its new modification manages to fire 10).    Of the new Russian weapons that were used by the Abkhazians,  it is worth singling out the antitank guided missile. This  missile was responsible for destroying a large number of tanks  on the Georgian side. These were fired, in the main, from the  [seismic] laboratory in Zemo Eshera.    The importance of armored equipment is also borne out by the  opinion of the majority of the defenders of Sukhumi, according  to which the city would not have fallen if they had possessed  tanks.    Artillery: At the start of the conflict, the  Abkhazians found themselves in a difficult situation as they  practically had no artillery. They had innumerable automatic  weapons, machine guns, rocket launchers, but no cannons and  howitzers; by rarely using 85 mm D-44-type cannons, it was  impossible to destroy the many Georgian tanks and, in general,  inflict serious damage upon the enemy. However, as time passed,  the Abkhazians acquired all the modern artillery currently to be  found on the territory of the former USSR. Their weaponry  included 122 mm D-30 howitzers and 152 mm self-propelled  artillery systems (2S-3 "Akatsiya" and 2S-1 "Mimoza"), and they  also later acquired the so- called "Grad" launcher vehicle,  which is capable of salvo fire and has a huge destructive force.    The Georgian Armed Forces did not lag behind the enemy as  far  as artillery was concerned; as a result of the selfless struggle  of artillerymen, Sukhumi escaped being taken on several  occasions.    The plethora of artillery and the lack of qualifications of  those operating it (thanks to Russian military instructors, the  combat capabilities of Abkhazian artillery significantly  increased during the final period of the conflict) conditioned  the destructive and devastating character of combat actions.  This was shown by the burned-down city of Sukhumi and the  destroyed villages in Ochamchire rayon.    Aviation: Georgian aviation was produced, in the  main, at the former Dimitrov 31st Aviation Factory (Su-25  fighters) although the Georgian Ministry of Defense did receive  a squadron of strike [damrtqmeli] helicopters (Mi-24 and Mi-8  MT). Our aviation took an active part in the Abkhazian war but  it also incurred big losses. By using antiaircraft missile  systems, the Abkhazians succeeded in shooting down several  planes and helicopters (Su-25, Mi-24, and Mi-8 MT). Such losses  incurred by Georgian aviation are wholly understandable since we  had neither fighter-interceptors (Su-27, MiG-29) nor combat  radar systems, as a result of which our aviation became an easy  prey for Abkhazian antiaircraft defense and fighters.    It is a joke to speak about Abkhazian aviation. It would be  more correct for us to speak about Russian aviation that was  hired by the Abkhazians and that actively participated in the  conflict: Su-25's bombed and reconnoitered Georgian positions  and Mi-24's also frequently took part in battles; however, it  was the Su-25's that carefully protected the aforementioned  fighting vehicles. In spite of the high caliber of Russian  pilots and the poor capabilities of Georgian antiaircraft  defense, the Georgians did succeed in shooting down Mi-24's,  Mi-8 MT's, and, most importantly, Su-25's.    Antiaircraft Defense: It would not be an  exaggeration to say that antiaircraft defense brought the  greatest advantage to the sides fighting in the Abkhazian war.  This was particularly true in the case of the Abkhazians. By  means of the "Igla," "Strela," and "Osa," portable antiaircraft  missile systems and the "Su-25" [as published] "Shilka"  self-propelled antiaircraft gun, they were able to neutralize  Georgian aviation. The "Osa" was particularly effective in this  respect. It should be said here that, according to certain  sources of information, the latest antiaircraft systems located  in Gudauta were also used in battles.    It is true that the antiaircraft defense of the Georgian  Armed Forces was not equipped technically to the same level as  that of the Abkhazians. Nevertheless, it also achieved certain  results. The date 19 March 1993 represents a landmark in the  history of our antiaircraft defense. On this day, a Su-27  fighter-interceptor (tail number 11) belonging to the Russian  Army and piloted by Major Vatslav Shipko was shot down. In  addition, several assault aircraft and strike helicopters  belonging to the Russian Army and based at the Babushera  military airfield were destroyed.    If we do not take into account barges and "Kometa"  [launches]  on which heavy-caliber machine guns, guns, and "Grad" launchers  were installed, the sides involved in the fighting did not have  navies. By using these means, it was impossible to carry out  precise bombing of the opposing side's positions and it resulted  only in destruction and the killing of the peaceful population.    Such an Abkhazian navy presented a danger for Georgian  aviation as they had portable antiaircraft systems on the  launches, which enabled them to destroy several Su-25's  belonging to the Georgian Armed Forces and several passenger  aircraft belonging to the "Orbi" Aviation Company.    At the same time, it was established that vessels belonging  to the Russian Black Sea Fleet were participating directly in  battles on the Abkhazian side. For example, the combatant ship  "Bezukoriznennyy" fought against the Georgians.    The one thing for which the Abkhazians made superb use of  their so-called navy was landing an amphibious assault force,  which caused considerable damage to Georgian military formations.    Fire arms and rocket launchers: In this war,  different types of Kalashnikov assault rifles [AK] were widely  used. The Kalashnikov improved assault rifle (7.62 mm) [AKM]  proved to be particularly effective. A 5.45 mm bullet from the  AK-74 and AKS [folding-stock assault rifle] changed its  trajectory when fired in cornfields or mandarin groves in  contrast to a bullet fired from the AKS [as published] that did  not change its trajectory. In this respect, the Abkhazians were  at an advantage. They were armed, in the main, with AKM's and a  rocket launcher of the same make that was unrivalled in street  battles.    Of the Kalashnikov assault rifles, one can single out the  7.62 mm Kalashnikov medium machine gun and the 12.7 mm  Degtyarev-Shpagin heavy machine gun. These weapons represented  a big force in battles in forests and ravines.    Snipers also played their part in the fighting. They used  the Dragunov and Tokarev semiautomatic sniping rifles. It is  significant that there were many female snipers on the Abkhazian  side.    One of the "heroes" of the Georgian-Abkhazian armed conflict  was the rocket launcher. On account of geographical conditions,  it proved to be the most effective weapon in this war. It was  used both to destroy armored equipment and to bomb positions.  The Abkhazians undoubtedly held the advantage regarding this  type of weapon. The sides involved in the fighting had the  RPG-7, RPG-18, "Mukha," RPG-22, "Osa," and the 30 mm AGS  [expansion unknown] rocket launcher.    Proceeding from all the aforementioned, one can draw the  following conclusion: The Georgian defeat in Abkhazia resulted  from having an army that was untrained and lacking in discipline  at an elementary level and having antiquated military-technical  capabilities compared with the Abkhazian side. Therefore, if we  want to achieve any kind of military success in the future, we  should start eradicating these shortcomings now.</p>

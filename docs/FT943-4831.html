			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (5): Battle of the sexes - The Labour Market When Admiral Insurance, which specialises in over-the-telephone motor policies, set up in Cardiff in January 1993, it was uncertain if it could recruit the people it needed. There were many positive factors: the transport links with London, an enthusiastic county council, cheap and available office space, and grant support of Pounds 1m. A stumbling block was the difficulty of persuading managers to relocate because of the dwindling disparity in house prices between the south-east and Wales, and a shortage of executive houses (a frequent complaint by relocating companies). But the big imponderable, because it was hard to research in advance, was the quality of the local labour. After 19 months, Mr David Stevens, Admiral's marketing manager, gives his verdict. 'We've been very pleased with the quality of the labour force, notably their reliability and stability. The level of turnover of staff is much lower, and the staff's longer-term commitment to the company is higher, than we would have experienced in the south-east.' In manufacturing industry, Mr Alfred Gooding, head of Gooding Group, is an equally keen advocate of the virtues of Welsh workers, which is one reason why his new joint venture with Grundig, the Germany consumer electronics company, is sited at Llantrisant near Cardiff. Many other employers in Wales talk of the flexibility and reliability of their staff. Last year, days lost per 1,000 employees due to industrial action were 21, compared with a UK average of 30. However, while unemployment in Wales has been reduced to about the UK average, this disguises higher levels of male unemployment. In pockets this is severe, with consequent social problems. A survey last year of a randomly-chosen street on a housing estate in Blaenau Gwent found only 22 adults were working and 60 were out of work. Disability or long-term illness was common. One man had been out of work for 17 years and several for seven to 10 years. Of those in work, many were on low incomes. The survey was published in 'The politics of poverty in Blaenau Gwent', by Llew Smith, the local Labour MP, Lynda Bransbury and Sarah Gillam. The authors remarked: 'An overwhelming number of households complained about being in debt and failing to manage on benefit levels.' In Wales as a whole, gross earnings of full-time employees last year averaged Pounds 281 a week, only 89 per cent of the figure for Britain. For workers to raise their incomes, there is an obvious need for higher skills. For companies, a shortage of skilled labour is seen as a constraint on expansion as the recovery gathers pace. In one initiative, the Welsh Office announced in June it would fund a Pounds 3.6m scheme to support 550 engineering apprenticeships, provide engineering equipment for colleges, and instruct workplace trainers. Sir Wyn Roberts, then Welsh minister, commented: 'Manufacturing is a key sector in the Welsh economy, but a common theme in my discussions with industrialists is the shortage of trained people at craft and technician levels.' The need is also for better school results. Welsh boys have lagged behind their English and, in particular, Northern Irish and Scottish counterparts in gaining A-levels (or the equivalent). This year, the chief inspector of schools in Wales reported that although there had been 'a steady improvement in pupils' performance within GCSE at every level . . . much under-expectation of pupils remains.' There has been a big rise in the numbers of those in Wales who go on to further education, from 36 per cent in 1988-89 to 53 per cent. However, female students - who achieve better school results than males - also outnumber them in further education by 20 per cent. In spite of this, fewer women are economically active than in other parts of Britain. Yet the proportion of women in work has risen sharply in recent years, partly because of part- time working. A survey by the Welsh training and enterprise councils, published this year, showed 57 per cent of employees were male and 43 per cent female, but in small firms the balance was almost equal. Nearly three times as many women as men worked part-time. Among the full-time workers, female weekly earnings in Wales were on average 27 per cent below male earnings in 1992. 'People and Prosperity, a Challenge to Wales', published last November by the Welsh Office, pointed out that both men and women tended to follow stereotyped vocational routes. 'Women are much more likely than men to be in unskilled and semi-skilled jobs, and in jobs without long-term career prospects,' it said. 'They are in turn under-represented at the senior levels of industry, public service and the professions as compared with UK averages.' The report added: 'Employers in Wales are losing by this waste of resources.' One determined attempt to reduce this waste is Chwarae Teg, the women's fair play organisation launched in 1992. This year, it received Welsh Office funding of Pounds 50,000 with a commitment for two more years. Chwarae Teg, which has become a non-profitmaking company, aims to encourage good practice in training, flexible working and better childcare to enable women to return to work or training. It has become a role model for similar initiatives in England. Women in Enterprise, an independent networking support group, was launched in 1990 to raise the status of women in business and the professions. It has corporate and individual members and does not exclude men - 'We do not believe it is realistic to survive in a one-gender vacuum,' says Ms Jeannie Hainsworth Lamb, the chairman. But she points out that Wales still has a male-dominated culture. Women are under pressure to conform to domestic roles and find it hard to be promoted. 'Lip service is paid to equal opportunities,' she says, 'but what is wanted is more practical help.'</p>

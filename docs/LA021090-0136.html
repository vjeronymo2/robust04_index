			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WEAK E. GERMAN MARK DRAINS BLOOD BANKS  </P> <P> The earning power of the West German mark, largely blamed for East Germany's  wave of emigration, is now draining its blood banks.  </P> <P> East Berlin's 28 hospitals were short 3,000 blood donations at the end of  January because about 500 regular donors had begun selling their blood to  hospitals in West Berlin for West German marks, the official news agency ADN  said.  </P> <P> The West German Red Cross paid $27 for each donation in West Berlin. In East  Berlin, hospitals paid $29 in East German marks, but the East mark in reality  is virtually worthless in the West.  </P> <P> "It's definitely very seductive (West German mark payments), but this blood is  really needed in our own hospitals," ADN quoted Henn Roigas, senior medical  officer for East Berlin's blood donation and transfusion institute, as saying.  </P> <P> East Germany's hospitals are also desperately short of qualified personnel such  as nurses because of the continuing emigration, causing serious breakdowns in  availability and quality of medical care.  </P></p>

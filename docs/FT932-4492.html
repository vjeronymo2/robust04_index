			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Dark delusions on the Conservative right - Political Notebook THE arrogance is breathtaking. Follow the scenario now being mapped out by some of Mr John Major's so-called supporters on the Tory back benches at Westminster. The prime minister, already badly wounded, is delivered a fatal blow by a Conservative defeat in the Christchurch by-election. He struggles on until the autumn. A stormy party conference (spiced with the revelations promised in Lady Thatcher's memoirs) and an anaemic economic recovery sap what remains of his political authority. The men in grey suits appear on the steps of 10 Downing Street. Mr Major decides not to wait for a formal leadership challenge and retires on health grounds to Huntingdon. Mr Norman Lamont considers justice has been done. The Tory party elects by acclamation Mr Kenneth Clarke as prime minister. There are one or two conditions, of course. The right wing of the party, so disenchanted now with the leader they chose to replace Lady Thatcher, demand that the centrist Mr Clarke don a suitably ideo-logical straitjacket. Mr Michael Portillo must be given the chancellorship - with a free hand to dismantle the welfare state. Mr John Redwood is promoted from Wales to health. Mr Peter Lilley keeps command of social security. Mr Michael Spicer, the self-proclaimed leader of the Fresh Start group of anti-Maastricht MPs, returns to the government as minister for Europe. All that agreed, the Euro-sceptic right is perfectly happy to sustain the government in office for another two or three years. The fantasy does not end there. For all the valiant efforts of Mr John Edmonds to ensure that Labour never again becomes a party of government, Mr John Smith wins the general election. Mr Clarke goes the way of his two predecessors. He is replaced, yes, by Mr Portillo. The true heir to Thatcherism has four years in opposition to stiffen the ideological backbone that sustained the Conservatives in the 1980s. If, by some mishap, Mr Clarke wins the election, then Mr Portillo, still a stripling of 43, remains well placed to assume the mantle four or five years later. No wonder Mr Major is weary. For the above represents not the dark delusion of one of Westminster's occasional, overlooked eccentrics. Instead, give or take a detail of two, it encapsulates the embittered dream of two dozen MPs on the Tory back benches. Add one or two further modifications and up to 50 - including a handful of ministers - might sign up. So deep during the past year has their hatred of Maastricht run, so great is their detachment from the world of government, that Mr Major's very own Militant Tendency now operates outside the para-meters of political logic. That brings us to the arrogance. There is no mention of the electorate - save as a convenient instrument for Mr Clarke's early replacement by Mr Portillo. In this self-obsessed world, politics is no longer about such esoteric notions as good government but about revenge and ideological purity. There is no reference to the commitments offered to the voters barely 15 months ago. Instead, a new dictum is applied: Conservative manifesto pledges operate not for the lifetime of a parliament, but only during that of the leader who penned them. Of course, it will not happen like that. Politics is not susceptible to neat blueprints. The notion that a few dozen backbench MPs can choose now who might lead the Tories in five or 10 years' time - assuming there is still a party to lead - lies outside the realm of sensible politics. So, too, does idea that the party can swap its prime minister every two or three years and remain a coherent force in politics. Mr Portillo is an astute politician. He might one day lead his party. But he must tremble at the thought of the future mapped out by Mr Major's enemies. For all their noise, the Tory right remains a minority. Taken as a whole it can claim, at most, the support of a third of the 332-strong parliamentary party. That is a distinctly generous estimate. The hard-line Eurosceptics represent half again of that number. So Mr Major can relax? Well, no. If his fortunes continue to slide, the ideologues may enlist the support of that other lethal grouping in the Tory party - the pathological panickers. They are scornful of their colleagues' bizarre plan for the rebirth of Thatcherism. Yet some are already whispering that salvation in the end may lie with Mr Clarke. The odds still are all this will turn out of be a particularly acute attack of midsummer madness. But it is no longer possible to be sure. In its present state, the Conservative party is capable of anything - including setting off on the route to self-destruction.</p>

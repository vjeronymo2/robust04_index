According to an official concerned, Commander Nikolayev  visited the MOFA on 3 February to meet with officials of the  MOFA and the Maritime Safety Agency. At the meeting, he warned  that Russia will take measures to ban Japanese boats from  fishing in Russian waters in the future, saying: "Such acts  cannot be tolerated because it is a violation of Russian  borders." The MOFA insisted there was no problem because these  northern territories are Japan's territories. But the Russian  commander said emphatically: "No peace treaty has been concluded  with Japan yet, and Russia's borders with Japan are existing  facts."</p>

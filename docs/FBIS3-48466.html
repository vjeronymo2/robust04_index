So far a mixture of four to six kinds of raw materials was  baked at high temperature. But the new technique requires the  baking of one kind of raw material at low temperature. The new  method increases the kiln efficiency two or three fold.    In the past it took 12 to 14 hours to get powder of mixed  materials, while the new technique requires less than eight  hours.    The new method is favorable for transport because it relies  on the raw material rich in different parts of the country. It  also saves fuel, electricity and manpower considerably.    The porcelainware made by the new method is light, solid and  low in absorption rate. When used as a building material, its  life span is considerably lengthened.    The method has been developed by teachers and researchers of  the geological department of Kim Il-song University and  technicians of the Taesong ceramic factory.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> ART FARMER'S FLUEGELHORN OF PLENTY  </P> <P> Elario's, the restaurant and jazz club that tops off the Summer House Inn in La  Jolla, again demonstrated its resourceful booking policy by bringing in Art  Farmer for a two week stand. The Vienna-based master of the fluegelhorn will be  skipping Los Angeles this time around.  </P> <P> Farmer has virtually defined a position for fluegelhorn in jazz. The spiritual  beauty he brings to it is a reflection of his personality: mellow, relaxed and  sometimes gentle, especially when the vehicle is a ballad like Mal Waldron's  "Soul Eyes" or the neglected Ellington tune "What Am I Here For."  </P> <P> When he aims at a higher level of intensity, Farmer occasionally switches to  the trumpet, which he plays both open ("Embraceable You") and muted ("Bags  Groove").  </P> <P> His rhythm section consisted of Bob Magnusson, that most supple of bassists;  Jim Plank, a steady and reliable drummer; and a promising pianist, Randy  Porter. Only 26, Porter fits well into this context and is familiar with such  standards as John Coltrane's "Moment's Notice" and Fats Navarro's "Nostalgia."  </P> <P> Wednesday's opening was unique, since Farmer's first set was preceded by two  film presentations. One was a sampler of 15 segments from "Club Date," a  public-TV series shot at San Diego's KPBS-TV studio. Featuring Bud Shank, James  Moody, Joe Pass and others, the sampler was a fascinating cornucopia. It was  followed by a full half hour Art Farmer show taped during his visit here last  year with a quintet, featuring saxophonist Clifford Jordan.  </P> <P> Farmer continues at Elario's five days a week through April 8. That he is not  to be seen in person in Los Angeles is regrettable. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

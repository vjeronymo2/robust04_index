			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The 45th Sudeten German Days culminated in  Nuremberg in Bavaria today. Our correspondent in Germany, Jiri  Halousek, filed this telephone dispatch.    [Begin Halousek recording] [passage omitted] One of the  first  speakers to address the main gathering in the Franken Halle at  the Nueremberg trade fair was Imrich Kruzliak, adviser to the  Slovak president. Kruzliak conveyed to the Sudeten Germans'  greetings from Slovakia and said that the Sudeten German issue  must not be swept under the carpet for political reasons.    Afterward, Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther  emphasized that Sudeten Germans had to be included, in the  spirit of friendship, in future German-Czech relations. At the  same time, he gave them an assurance of support by the  Bonn-based Federal Government.    Bavarian Minister-President Edmund Stoiber also voiced  support for the Sudeten German Landesmannschaft. He recalled  that this year it was precisely 40 years since Bavaria took over  the patronage of Sudeten Germans. Edmund Stoiber went on to say  that in recent years there has been a comprehensive development  of relations between Bavaria and Germany and the Czech Republic.  In order to describe them as good, it is apparently still  necessary that the Czech Government and parliament open a  political dialogue with the elected representatives of the  Sudeten German Landesmannschaft.    The Bavarian minister-president went on to say that he  discussed this issue with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus in  August last year. At that time he gained the impression that  Vaclav Klaus was going to give serious consideration to his  proposal. That is why he is supposedly waiting for a signal  from the Czech side.

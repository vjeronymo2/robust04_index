			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Petrobras considers international share issue PETROBRAS, the Brazilian-state controlled oil concern, is considering an international issue of new shares to raise capital, its financial director said in London yesterday. Mr Carlos Thadeu de Freitas Gomes, whose company is launching a new Eurobond this week to raise Dollars 150m, said the issue of equity would come once the company had exhausted its potential to issue international debt. That would not happen before the middle of the year. However, an issue of new equity - of as yet undetermined magnitude  - was possible later in the year, probably through American depositary receipts so that the shares would be easily tradeable in the US. He said he believed the federal government in Brasilia would favour such an issue. Latin American companies, particularly from Mexico, have over the past 12 months raised significant sums through the issue of shares in the international market on the back of sharply rising stock markets. The Brazilian market has continued a strong performance in the first two weeks of this year. Over 81 per cent of voting capital and 51 per cent of total share capital of Petrobras, Brazil's largest company in terms of revenues and assets, is currently held by the federal government. Its shares have accounted for over 6 per cent of the trading volume in the Brazilian market over the last three years. Mr de Freitas Gomes told a conference, organised by the investment group Stephen Rose and Partners, that Petrobras's investment programme envisaged the spending of Dollars 2.91bn this year, up from Dollars 2.41bn in 1991. This would rise to Dollars 4.4bn in next year, Dollars 5.7bn in 1994 and Dollars 6.1bn in 1995. Company projections showed production reaching just under 1.5 barrels per day by the year 2000, accounting for 83 per cent of Brazilian demand, against average output of 650,771 bpd in 1991, 57 per cent of demand.</p>

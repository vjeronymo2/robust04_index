As  compared with January-February 1993, production of gasoline  declined by 12 percent in Russia, production of diesel fuel--by  17 percent, and production of heating oil--by 10 percent; the  corresponding figures for Belarus were 20 percent, 24 percent,  and 30 percent; and for Uzbekistan--31 percent, 12 percent, and  31 percent.    As compared with the same period last year, production of  finished rolled metal products in January-February 1994 declined  by 22 percent in Russia and by 36 percent in Kazakhstan.  Production of steel pipe in Russia declined to roughly one-half  its previous level.    In machine building, production of some of the most  important  types of output declined significantly as compared to the  January-February 1993 level. In the last 2 months, production of  metal-cutting machine tools declined by 46 percent in Belarus  and by half in Russia. In Russia 71 percent fewer pieces of  forge-press equipment were produced than in January-February  1993. Production of motor vehicles declined by 56 percent in  Belarus; while in Russia production of trucks fell to one-third  its previous level and production of passenger cars fell by 41  percent. Production of tractors declined by 45 percent in  Belarus, to one-quarter its previous level in Kazakhstan, and by  81 percent in Russia. Their production ceased almost completely  in Uzbekistan.    The lag in production of chemical output continues.  Production of mineral fertilizers in January-February 1994  declined by 29 percent in Russia, to two-thirds its previous  level in Uzbekistan, by 36 percent in Belarus, and to one-third  its previous level in Kazakhstan. In Russia, production of  chemical fibers and threads and soda ash declined by 49-53  percent and production of tires declined by 41 percent. In  Belarus, production of synthetic resin and plastic and chemical  fibers and threads declined by half or more and production of  tires declined by 30 percent.    Production of building materials declined in most  Commonwealth states. Thus, production of cement declined to  roughly two-thirds its previous level in Russia and Kyrgyzstan  and by 55-57 percent in Belarus and Kazakhstan.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Sweden and Spain lead European decline Europe, once again, was the centre of share price volatility last week. Excluding the UK, it showed a fall of 2.9 per cent in local currency terms on the FT-A World Indices, the worst performers being Sweden and Spain. In Sweden a government pledge to provide a safety net for the country's financial system was outweighed by heavy loan losses, domestic institutional illiquidity and fears for the property and construction sectors. Spain introduced exchange rate controls, effectively closing the peseta forex market and stabilising the currency. 'However', says Mr Stephen Hughes of Nikko Europe, 'international investors pronounced their verdict on the intervention . . . through massive selling of Spanish assets. Prices collapsed on both the fixed and variable income markets.' There was no obvious advantage, last week, in being in a hard or soft currency. Germany and Italy fell by similar amounts, the first because the strength of the D-Mark threatened its export margins and the second discovering that a stiff budget and high interest rates, designed to counter the weakness of the lira, were no obvious prescription for strength in equities. The two rises of the week were in Switzerland, stimulated by the strength of its currency and a decline in short-term interest rates, and in the UK. Sterling did not lose a lot last week but it was enough to bring a 1.8 per cent rise in local currency terms down to one of 0.3 per cent in terms of the dollar. Along with Europe, the land of the dollar helped push the FT-Actuaries World Index to a 0.7 per cent fall on the week. The US only had two bad days in its 1.9 per cent fall. On Tuesday, it fell on a drop in bond prices; on Friday, a strong recovery in bonds was not enough to offset more bad economic news, and renewed uncertainty about the presidential election battle.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 % change    % change in                  % change in local currency**   sterling**  US Dollars**              1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of   Start of     Start of                                         1992       1992         1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -1.39   +11.32   -22.49   -6.48      +4.55        -4.17 Belgium      -0.89    +4.17    -1.91   -3.63      +7.37        -1.58 Denmark      -1.43    -5.33   -29.27  -26.55     -17.35       -24.24 Finland      -1.06    +7.47   -30.03  -21.13     -23.89       -30.24 France       -2.06    +6.78    -1.45   +3.69     +16.66        +6.93 Germany      -4.60    +0.71   -11.19   -7.05      +3.66        -4.99 Ireland      -0.71    -1.21   -16.70  -12.69      -3.54       -11.58 Italy        -4.89    -8.77   -30.93  -27.59     -27.03       -33.12 Netherlands  -0.46    +3.10    +3.30   +4.44     +16.61        +6.88 Norway       -3.16    -1.71   -33.86  -19.47     -12.55       -19.84 Spain        -7.62    -2.42   -27.15  -18.97     -17.57       -24.44 Sweden       -8.14    -6.89   -25.63  -12.12      -4.26       -12.24 Switzerland  +0.57    +8.07   +12.45  +13.13     +29.03       +18.26 UK           +1.76   +12.87    -1.31   +4.06      +4.06        -4.62 EUROPE       -0.96    +6.48    -6.05   -1.27      +4.67        -4.06 Australia    -1.99    -4.02    -7.39  -11.60      -8.17       -15.82 Hong Kong    -0.05    +1.75   +44.76  +32.47     +45.45       +33.32 Japan        +1.41    -0.69   -23.23  -19.07      -8.42       -16.04 Malaysia     +2.92    +6.70   +14.76   +6.89     +26.44       +15.90 New Zealand  -0.31    -0.45    -1.16   -9.81      -1.96       -10.13 Singapore    -0.18    -2.49    -7.93  -16.54      -7.98       -15.65 Canada       -1.64    -0.28    -2.18   -4.65      -3.02       -11.11 USA          -1.93     0.00    +7.47   -0.54      +8.51        -0.54 Mexico       -2.83    -8.36    +1.70  -12.17      -6.00       -13.84 South Africa +1.49    +1.58    -7.43   -9.04     -21.91       -28.42 WORLD INDEX  -0.71    +1.41    -6.13   -6.50      +1.83        -6.66  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on September 25th 1992.

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Union links set to survive STATE FUNDING for political parties, promised in Labour's manifesto, would loosen but not sever the ties between the party and the unions that finance it, according to Labour and union officials. Both sides agree that a more distant relationship is preferable. State funding would be a financial relief for the Labour-affiliated unions, which at present finance about half Labour's running costs between elections and nearly all election spending. Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, believes his proposal for reducing the union block vote at Labour conference from 90 per cent to 50 per cent is likely to be accepted more quickly as a result of the prospect of state funding. Labour officials argue that the unions' 'political ballast' at party conference and in the electoral college will still be required to balance the unreliable constituency parties.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kalman Petocz, spokesman of the Hungarian Civic  Party, stressed at the party's news briefing held in Bratislava  today that forming a coalition [by the ethnic Hungarian parties  and movements in Slovakia] before the scheduled 30 September and  1 October elections would be a positive step and might  contribute to the collaboration of people having a democratic  approach. He stressed that the Hungarian Civic Party  unanimously supports the establishment of a tripartite coalition  by the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, the Coexistence  Political Movement, and the Hungarian Civic Party. The party  regards the Coexistence's proposal for a union of the ethnic  Hungarian parties as a positive step. However, it considers it  impracticable and unacceptable from the political point of view.  If a tripartite coalition is not formed, only one opportunity  will be left for us--to run separately in the elections, just as  happened two years ago--the Hungarian Civic Party's spokesman  stressed at today's news briefing.</p>

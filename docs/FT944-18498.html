			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Warburg warns of sharp fall in profits S. G. Warburg, the UK investment bank, warned yesterday that profits for the six months ended September 30 would be less than half those for the same period of 1993. The group blamed tough conditions in the equity and bond markets for the plunge in profits. Income from the investment banking side of the business is believed to have collapsed. Warburg's share price fell 101p to 569p, its lowest level this year. Other leading City firms also suffered share price falls. Smith New Court, the leading independent market-maker, saw its share price drop 40p to 334p. Schroders, the merchant bank, fell 43p to 1335p and Kleinwort Benson, the UK investment bank, finished 11p down at 440p. Warburg said it would reorganise senior management to streamline decision making and review costs in the wake of the profits warning. The bank forecast first-half pre-tax profits of Pounds 55m to Pounds 65m against a record Pounds 148.8m last time. The interim dividend is expected to be held at last year's level of 6p. Mercury Asset Management, in which Warburg has a 75 per cent stake, said its profits would be maintained. Analysts downgraded their forecasts for Warburg's results for the full financial year to a range of Pounds 165m to Pounds 180m, compared with the Pounds 297m in the previous year. Warburg's profits warning comes after a round of trading losses and redundancies at US investment banks such as Salomon Brothers, which have seen market conditions deteriorate since the first quarter. Lord Cairns, Warburg's chief executive, said a review of group costs was now in progress, although he stopped short of committing the firm to significant cuts. Staff costs rose 40 per cent last year, much of it in performance-related bonuses. Warburg's average staff expenses were the highest in the quoted merchant banking sector last year at Pounds 105,000 a head. Lord Cairns blamed the group's poor performance on 'thin, illiquid and quite volatile markets' in equities, bonds and derivatives. Most trading activities in the UK and in the US were affected, as were some in Europe. Fee and commission income may also prove to be slightly lower than last year, Warburg said. As a result of the poor performance, Warburg said it would reorganise its senior management so that decision-making became the responsibility of fewer people. It said it would pare down the numbers on its management committees, such as the investment banking committee, which has 18 members.

The heads of the Ministry of Machine-Building,  Military-Industrial Complex and Conversion, the Ministry of  Energy and Electrification, the Ministry of Agriculture and  Food, the Ministry of Transport, and other ministries and  departments of Ukraine, the leaders of Crimean Government  structures headed by Anatoliy Franchuk, first deputy chairman of  the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Crimea, and  directors of a number of Crimean enterprises, took part in the  consultations.    The press service of the president and Cabinet of Ministers  of Ukraine reported that "the consultations proceeded in the  spirit of full mutual understanding," and that Ukraine's  Government will most likely take a decision on the results of  its work.    A UNIAN correspondent has learned from unofficial sources  that during the consultations, the Crimean delegation insisted  on the resolution of the issue of resubordinating the town of  Sevastopol to the Republic of Crimea. In an interview with a  UNIAN correspondent Yaroslav Shpak, chief of Krymenerho [Crimea  power] and a member of Crimea's delegation, reported that it has  also been proposed to abolish the pass system in Sevastopol.</p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses soured by bond markets, US influence Bourses were soured by bond markets, and lifted temporarily by early gains on Wall Street; late closers weakened again as the Dow subsided, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS dipped beneath the 2,100 level just before the close, before finding a fresh burst of energy which was enough to push the CAC-40 index to a close of 2,102.71, a day's fall of 33.27 or 1.5 per cent. Bonds weakened on heavy US selling. Traders were looking to the Bank of France to cut interest rates today. Turnover was FFr4bn. Weakness was particularly marked in the financial sector, with Societe Generale and Bancaire both falling to year-lows during the session, of FFr598 and FFr537 respectively, before recovering slightly to close down Fr16 and FFr27 at FFr600 and FFr540. There was one positive move on the day as Christian Dior improved FFr7 to FFr407 after noting that it expected a rise in 1994 net profit, following a sharp rise in turnover during February. Peugeot lost FFr9 to FFr914 ahead of today's results which are expected to show a 1993 loss of between FFr1.5bn and FFr2bn. However, analysts see a pick-up in demand for automotive shares this year. Pechiney International continued its downtrend following Tuesday's disappointing figures, the shares hitting a year's low of FFr170.30 during the session, before closing off FFr7 at FFr173. MADRID blamed Wall Street, bond markets and a lack of liquidity as the general index closed 3.87, or 1.2 per cent down at a new 1994 low of 309.73. Turnover was low to moderate at Pta28.26bn. Banesto dropped by Pta50, or 6.2 per cent to Pta750 ahead of the bids for the company from Argentaria, BBV and Santander. FRANKFURT, once again, was happier in the afternoon than it was earlier. During the session equities were depressed by a fall in bund futures, in spite of a cut of 12 basis points in the German repo rate; the Dax index closed the official trading period at 2,182.64, 11.25 down from its post-bourse level on Tuesday. Turnover rose from DM11.2bn to DM11.6bn. In the afternoon, bund and index futures recovered but an Ibis-indicated close of 2,194.09 left the index almost exactly where it was on Tuesday evening. The switch from financials to cyclicals continued but the contrast between Deutsche Bank, virtually flat on the day, and Volkswagen, up DM16.40 to DM546 and DM4 higher again in the afternoon, reflected more than that, said Mr Klaus Ropke at James Capel. Deutsche's image had suffered not only from the Schneider affair, but also from the Metallgesellschaft debacle and recent experience in the new issue market. On VW, Capel switched recently from sell to a buy recommendation, and there was talk of a big US order for the stock. AMSTERDAM was bruised by bonds, Wall Street and a weakening of the dollar, the AEX index losing 1.61 at 414.84. One of the biggest falls on the session was recorded by Royal Dutch, down Fl 2.90 at Fl 204.20, but off a day's low of Fl 203.80, attributed to profit-taking after the stock's recently strong performance. Hoogovens, the steel producer, went against the trend, rising Fl 1.40 to Fl 63.10 after raising its profit forecast for 1994. An early gain for Fokker was eroded by the close, the shares ending unchanged at Fl 17, having risen earlier to Fl 17.70, on reports from Deutsche Aerospace, the parent group, that the aircraft manufacturer would break-even by 1995. MILAN moved 1.6 per cent higher although domestic funds waited for lower prices. Foreign investors, who had helped to fuel the market's recent surge, were reported to be taking profits selectively. The Comit index rose 12.41 to 777.59. Fiat put on L183 or 2.9 per cent to L6,490 amid rumours that it will soon report a 13 per cent rise in 1993 turnover and net losses at the lower end of expectations. The positive tone spilled over to other industrials. Pirelli added L141 or 4.8 per cent ahead of results while Montedison rose L41 to or 2.8 per cent to L1,491 and its parent, Ferruzzi, rose L121 or 4.9 per cent to L2,565. Benetton fell L240 to L25,389 ahead of 1993 results today at which the group is expected to announce profits up about 12 per cent to L205bn-L210bn. ZURICH picked up from early lows, the recovery aided by some short covering and Wall Street's early performance. The SMI index finished down 18.4 at 2,818.7 after a day's low of 2,810.6. Financials were out of favour with UBS bearers losing SFr19 to SFr1,193, and SBC down SFr8 at SFr412 ahead of its forecast that business would remain satisfactory this year as a result of lower provisioning requirements and cost cutting measures. Against the trend, Georg Fischer bearers put on SFr45 to SFr1,400, with the rise attributed to recent positive comment from UBS. Roche certificates slipped below the SFr7,000 level, ending down SFr30 at SFr6,900. HELSINKI overcame early losses after Nokia shares jumped 6.3 per cent in response to the announcement of a mobile telephone deal with AT&amp;T. The Hex index rose 6.7 to 1,799.7 as Nokia ordinary put on FM25 to FM422.

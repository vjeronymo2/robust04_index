			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT CARD ON U.S. SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Generally, our schools are very functional and constantly improving. The  training and personal qualities of teachers are extremely adequate, and  typically they are dedicated, skilled professionals.  </P> <P> New curriculum, teaching methodology and technology are constantly provided and  introduced through intensive staff development programs. State-mandated quality  reviews are being conducted in all schools.  </P> <P> Compensatory education, bilingual programs and various other categorical  services for special-need students attempt to equalize the achievement  potential of all youngsters.  </P> <P> Yet, underachievement remains a massive problem.  </P> <P> My conclusion regarding the causes of the problem are based on 30 years  experience in education.  </P> <P> The primary source of underachievement is the home environment.  </P> <P> I found that most parents want their children to succeed. However, three basic  causes interfere in their participation: The parents are so overwhelmed by the  socioeconomic circumstances of their lives that there is little left to give  the child; parents don't know what their role should be or how to perform it;  parents are too busy and/or self-centered to focus on their child.  </P> <P> The obvious solution is parent education. If parents could be trained when  their children are very small, and be assisted as their youngsters grow and  mature, I'm convinced that much of the publicly perceived problems in education  could be reduced and kids would achieve.  </P> <P> FRED WOLFF  </P> <P> La Quinta  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOARD TO WEIGH FATE OF BEVERLY HILLS HIGH;  </P> <P> REPORT INCLUDES PLAN TO DEVELOP SCHOOL PROPERTY TO RAISE MONEY FOR DISTRICT  </P> <P> Despite an overwhelmingly negative public reaction, a controversial proposal to  tear down historic Beverly Hills High School and replace it with a high-rise  development will be considered this month by the Board of Education.  </P> <P> The proposal to redevelop the high school site near Century City was one of  several options included in a final report issued by the Beverly Hills Unified  School District's real estate committee. For nearly three years, the committee  has been examining ways of developing district properties to raise money for  the schools.  </P> <P> The committee touched off a storm of protest in March when it introduced in a  preliminary report the idea of tearing down the high school. Since then, the  committee has held five public hearings, incorporating public reaction in its  final report. The Board of Education plans to discuss the findings in the  report at its June 27 meeting.  </P> <P> "We dealt with a number of different proposals in our report, but the one that  everyone wanted to talk about was the redevelopment of the high school and the  reaction was negative," said committee chairman Kenneth Goldman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Difficult Choices  </P> <P> The committee chairman added that the community will have to make some  difficult choices. "It's like comparing apples and oranges," he said. "How do  you balance the educational needs of children, the needs for smaller class  sizes and teachers salaries with the environmental concerns like open space,  density and traffic."  </P> <P> The committee said the district could produce annual revenues ranging from  $500,000 to $16 million from the various proposals to develop district  properties.  </P> <P> The money generated would be used to help bail out the district, which has a  $26 million budget and projects an annual shortfall of about $1 million a year  over the next three years.  </P> <P> The 27-acre high school campus sits in the shadow of Century City high-rise  office buildings.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, the district would raze the existing high school and  construct a new "state-of-the art high school" on the northern 19 acres. By  using the 19 acres more efficiently, most open space and playing fields would  be preserved, according to the proposal.  </P> <P> The remaining eight acres at Olympic Boulevard and Spalding Drive would be  leased to a developer for construction of an office complex. Depending on the  size of the development, the district could earn $10 million a year from the  venture, according to the report.  </P> <P> The report noted that before the plan could be implemented, the district would  have to figure out a way for the high school to function during the  construction period.  </P> <P> The committee's report also suggests using the district's headquarters as a  potential site for other development. It also lists parking lots and  playgrounds as potential sites for development.  </P> <P> For example, the report suggests that a portion of the playground at Horace  Mann Elementary School be used to build a row of one-story retail stores along  Robertson Boulevard. Students would use the roof as playground space and  parking would be provided under the stores.  </P> <P> At Tuesday's board meeting, a group of parents presented the board with a  petitions bearing 450 signatures protesting redevelopment of the high school  site.  </P> <P> "It is some of the best open space in the city," said Dr. Brian Kahn. "Once you  build on it, it's gone forever. . . . That's the wrong moral message to send."  </P> <P> School board member Betty Wilson praised the committee. "It gave us all the  options available to us. It did just what it was supposed to do."  </P></p>

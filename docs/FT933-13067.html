			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Observer: Deaf ears Radio buttons will soon be too hot to handle. Into the franchise ring step Dame Shirley Porter, who quit politics and became chairman of LBC, and Charlie Cox, until recently LBC's managing director. Yesterday, Cox turned up as managing director of The London Radio Company, which is hell-bent on ousting LBC from its frequencies. So LBC promptly called its lawyers. It claimed that Cox, once the youngest manager of a large metropolitan radio station in Australia, and who resigned a week before LBC's application for new licences was delivered to the Radio Authority, had given legal undertakings not to do anything to help any LBC competitor. But Bert Hardy, chairman of The London Radio Company whose heavyweight investors include Associated Newspapers, Reuters and Independent Television News, says Cox is only prevented from helping a rival until September. 'He's off to Australia on holiday,' says Hardy. It just so happens that the franchises will be awarded in September or October.</p>

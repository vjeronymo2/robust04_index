			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / PLO and Israel sign deal after last-minute row Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, yesterday signed into existence the first form of Palestinian self-rule since Israel's creation in 1948 - in an accord rescued by one of the most public haggles in Middle East history. The 450-page agreement signed, and partly negotiated, on stage at the Cairo Convention Centre put into immediate effect the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho and began the handover of police and limited political and economic powers to a new Palestinian authority. It was hailed by Mr Arafat as 'the true beginning, the start of the end of Israeli occupation' and by Mr Rabin as 'an historic opportunity to build different lives'. But the precariousness of the deal was underlined in the occupied territories, where it was greeted by strikes across the West Bank and clashes between troops and settlers in Jericho. Syria signalled its rejection of the accord, while Jordan announced that it would not be pressed into accelerating its negotiations with Israel as a result of it. While yesterday's agreement was the culmination of more than seven months of arduous negotiating since Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat last shook hands on the White House lawn in September, the statesmanlike dignity of the Washington proceedings was absent. Instead, the PLO and Israeli leaders, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, Mr Amr Moussa, his foreign minister, and Mr Warren Christopher and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Mr Moussa's US and Russian counterparts, were forced into unseemly huddle-and-whisper diplomacy after Mr Arafat refused to sign part of the deal. Mr Rabin thumped the table and summoned Mr Shimon Peres, his foreign minister, on discovering that Mr Arafat's signature was missing from documents containing maps of Gaza and Jericho. He returned to the main group to begin agitated consultations which eclipsed the two following speeches. Mr Moussa and Mr Mubarak sought to calm both sides. Advisers were summoned on stage and documents were passed to and fro. Several minutes later the principals left for the wings, returned, and Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat completed the signing, to the relief of all on stage and 2,500 dignitaries assembled for the pageant. Although a broad agreement on the delineation of Jericho to come under Palestinian authority had apparently been reached in talks before the signing, Mr Arafat was 'surprised', according to aides, to see definitive maps of Jericho for his signature and refused to sign them. He was eventually persuaded to do so only when he could add the caveat that these were not final documents. Mr Peres restored some dignity with a speech in which he elegantly praised Mr Mubarak and heralded an optimistic future of Israeli-Palestinian co-existence. He said: 'We assure you that we shall not stop here, and we shall reach peace with Syria, Jordan and Lebanon.' Mr Rabin underscored his doubts about the Palestinians' readiness to assume the administrative powers which the deal grants them. He told reporters that Israel 'would like to get out as quickly as possible', but that Mr Arafat had asked for a delay of up to four 'or even more' weeks to complete the transfer of powers.

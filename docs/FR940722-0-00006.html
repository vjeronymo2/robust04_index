			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCA has reconsidered the proposal and has determined that a more flexible filing requirement would be less burdensome to the banks and associations, without compromising the FCA's ability to monitor the capital strength of the institutions. The final regulation deletes the 3-day FCA filing requirement and provides, instead, that a certified copy of the agreement must be filed with the appropriate FCA field office on or before the effective date of the agreement, and that copies of agreements must be sent to other associations in the district within 30 calendar days of signing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter requested assurance that the allocation agreement could consist of a contract, an exchange of board resolutions, or an incorporation of the terms of the agreement into the business plans of the institutions. The commenter is correct that any of the means described would be appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(E)_Notification to the FCA of Objection to the Extension of an Allocation Agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(E) provided that the allocation agreement would be automatically extended for another year if not amended and if neither party to the agreement notifies the FCA of its objection to the continuation of the agreement at least 30 days before the expiration date. A commenter suggested that the notification to the FCA be made in writing. The FCA agrees that this notification should be made in writing, and the final regulations include this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter also stated that the agreement itself should govern such matters as termination and extension rather than the regulations. The FCA has considered this comment and agrees in principle that the bank and association should be free to provide in their agreement for such matters as termination and extension. However, the FCA also believes that it is appropriate to provide for an automatic extension of the agreement if the matter has not been addressed in the agreement. The final regulations reflect this change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(F)_Default Allotment Formula  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter asked for clarification of whether permanent capital ratios for the default allocation formula would be computed in proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(F) using a 3-month average daily balance, as the regulations otherwise require for permanent capital ratio computations. The ratios would be computed in the same manner in this circumstance, using a 3-month average daily balance, and the final regulations contain this clarification. The regulations further provide that the permanent capital computations must be calculated as of the expiration date of the existing agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(G)_Reallotment in Connection With Payments Relating to Capital Preservation Agreements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(2)(ii)(G) required a bank and one or more associations to amend their agreement in order to reallot the allocated investment if such reallotment would enable the FCB to make its Capital Preservation Agreement annuity payment and still meet minimum permanent capital standards. However, it did not specify a basis to determine which associations must amend their agreements. A commenter recommended that the regulations require that the allocation agreements provide for such reallotment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA agrees with the commenter and believes that this issue would be appropriately provided for in the allocation agreements as suggested. The final regulations include a provision requiring the issue to be addressed in the allocation agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Other Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter recommended that, in addition to the preferred stock that System institutions are presently authorized to issue, subordinated notes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediate-term preferred stock be allowed to be counted as permanent capital. The commenter suggested that such issues be limited to 25 percent of total capital so that an institution would not be able to rely principally on this source. Another commenter expressed an opinion that the use of debt instruments as a substitute for capital would undermine the safety and soundness of the System and, therefore, opposed that part of the proposal. Yet another commenter stated that debt securities should be included in permanent capital if they are counted on a discounted or sinking fund basis. These proposals are still under consideration by the FCA and will be addressed in future proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA has deleted from the definition of permanent capital the reference to preferred stock issued to the FAC, since all such stock has now been retired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the proposed regulations inadvertently eliminated a provision of existing &sect;615.5210(d)(3) regarding investments made in connection with loan participations. That provision states that, where an institution invests in another institution to capitalize a participation interest, the investing institution must deduct from its total capital an amount equal to its investment in the participating institution. The proposed regulations addressed situations where an institution invested in a bank for any purpose, including to capitalize a loan participation, but did not address any situation where a bank or association invested in another association (to capitalize a loan participation or for any other purpose). The provision from the existing regulations has been revised to apply only to investments in associations and restored as &sect;615.5210(e)(5) in the final regulations, and the succeeding paragraphs have been renumbered accordingly. Furthermore, proposed &sect;615.5210(e)(3) has been revised and a new paragraph (e)(4) has been added to clarify that all earnings allocated by a bank to a recipient will count as permanent capital of the bank in the absence of an allocation agreement, except when the bank is a Farm Credit Bank or agricultural credit bank and the recipient is a Farm Credit association, in which case the default allotment formula would apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

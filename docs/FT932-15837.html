			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cominco modifying mill to overcome shortfalls COMINCO is modifying the mill at its Red Dog zinc and lead mine in Alaska in a further bid to overcome persistent shortfalls in production. The Vancouver-based company said that changes to the grinding circuit should bring performance 'close to' the design capacity of 42,000 tonnes per month of zinc concentrates. Zinc recoveries improved to 81 per cent of concentrate content in the first quarter, from 73 per cent last year and 65 per cent in 1991. But a spokesman acknowledged that further adjustments, mainly to pumps and pipelines, will be required to bring lead recoveries to an acceptable level. Lead accounts for about one-fifth of Red Dog's output. Despite containing the world's richest zinc deposit, Red Dog's operations have been hampered since it was commissioned in 1989 by an unexpectedly complex ore body. A Toronto analyst said yesterday that Cominco 'turned the deposit over from the geologists to the mine planners too quickly.' Among the unforeseen problems has been the discovery of oxides, which do not float and have complicated the recovery of metal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Carlos Menem yesterday said that the  social situation in Tierra del Fuego had been caused by  "activists who go around the country creating problems for those  who want to work." Menem did not identify the official report on  which he based his statement. He added that "there were hooded  people with blunt objects in their hands" at a factory that had  been occupied by strikers. Despite the fact that he was aware  of the description that Menem gave of the labor conflict, Tierra  del Fuego Governor Jose Estabillo said at a meeting with  Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf that the social situation was  under control, and without any possibility for an outburst.    After meeting with Estabillo, Ruckauf went to a meeting also  attended by Presidential Secretary Eduardo Bauza, Economy  Minister Domingo Cavallo, and Labor Minister Armando Caro  Figueroa. Caro Figueroa reported on the negotiations,  expressing optimism for a rapid solution to the conflict.  Cavallo, Ruckauf, and Bauza also decided that Caro Figueroa  would coordinate all negotiations, although at yesterday's  meeting it was made clear that the labor minister will have to  report on each step of the negotiations.    Hours before the meeting held at Bauza's office, Menem made  statements to the radio station of his friend Gerardo Sofovich.  The president made assurances that a handful of activists are  going around the country showing up at every social conflict,  and that UOM [Metalworkers Union] leader Lorenzo Miguel intends  to facilitate a settlement to the labor crisis.    "It is obvious that it is not only workers who are operating  now, but groups of agitators who go around the country, creating  problems for those who want to work. I listened to a report by  a judge, who in order to enter a factory had to adopt a series  of measures, and he finally met with hooded strikers, who were  hooded not because of cold weather but because they wanted to  conceal their faces. Some of them had blunt objects," Menem  told Sofovich.    [Sofovich] "Did you have a chance to meet with Governor  Estabillo?"    [Menem] "Yes, he told me that the situation in Tierra del  Fuego is totally under control. Yet it seems that strikers  continue in their position without obeying the decision by the  Labor Ministry."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Leaders of the Association for the Development of  the Shipibo-Conivo Culture of Peru have denounced the chief of  the Regional Health Directorate of Ucayali for embezzling more  than 73,000 soles that the Health Ministry allocated for it to  combat the various epidemics that have been ravaging this  extensive jungle region.    Owing to this serious irregularity, which has prevented  medications from being purchased, there are currently more than  250 cases of cholera, 200 cases of malaria, and 75 cases of  yellow fever, and more than 15,000 natives have been struck by  tuberculosis in Shipibo communities in this region.    One-thousand five-hundred of the victims died from January  to  October of this year owing to the lack of medications and  specialized medical care.    A delegation from the Association for the Development of the  Shipibo-Conivo Culture, headed by coordinator Andres Castaneda  Saavedra, arrived in the capital to explain this tragic  situation to government officials.    The coordinator told LA REPUBLICA that about 35,000 members  of this ethnic group in 108 native communities have suffered  losses because of the flooding of the Ucayali River, aside from  the diseases that the flooding has caused.    The flooding started in January of this year and resumed in  recent months, burying huge fields of rice, yucca, corn, and  beans in the Ucayali Valley under more than two meters of water.  The local communities consume these crops themselves.    All of the crops were lost, and since other food was not  forthcoming from elsewhere in the country, owing to the lack of  roads and vehicles, hunger began to decimate the population,  causing the more than 15,000 cases of tuberculosis.    The huge swamps and pools of stagnant water became breeding  grounds for cholera, malaria, and yellow fever, which spread  rapidly, especially among children and the elderly.    The chiefs of the native communities worriedly gathered  together early in the year and asked the Health Ministry  directly to declare a state of emergency in the Ucayali region.    The ministry did not declare a health emergency in the  region  until this past October and on the seventh of the month approved  73,363 new soles in funds to combat these epidemics in Ucayali.    The money was sent to the director of the Ucayali Health  Region, Dr. Antonio Mundine Medrano, who was supposed to  purchase medications and see to it that patients were treated  immediately.    Nevertheless, the incidence of cholera, malaria, and yellow  fever remained unchanged, and patients seemed to be receiving no  treatment whatsoever.    The Shipibo culture association contacted the chiefs of the  various native communities to check whether medicine had been  received or medical care delivered.    All said that they had received no medications or visits  from  physicians, and the hovels that function as medical posts have  lacked basic items for medical care since last year.    According to Castaneda Saavedra, Dr. Mundine Medrano has not  accounted for the alleged aid shipment to the communities that  requested it, contending only that the aid has already been  distributed and that if it did not reach certain communities, it  did reach others, which he did not specify.</p>

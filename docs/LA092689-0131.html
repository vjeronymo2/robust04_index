			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: SAMURAI SALES PLUNGE SPARKS SHUFFLE AT AMERICAN SUZUKI  </P> <P> American Suzuki Motor Corp., staggered by a catastrophic decline in Samurai  sales and weakness in its other automotive lines, said Monday that its  president has been reassigned to corporate headquarters in Japan, and the three  top officials of the auto division have resigned.  </P> <P> Kenji Shimizu, chairman of Brea-based American Suzuki since July and a longtime  executive and managing director of the Suzuki Motor Co. conglomerate in Japan,  will replace Toshiyuki Arai as president of American Suzuki.  </P> <P> Yoshi Fujii, another longtime Suzuki executive from corporate headquarters in  Hamamatsu, Japan, has been named to the new position of executive vice  president of the American Suzuki automotive division, which markets cars and  sports vehicles. Other American Suzuki divisions market motorcycles and such  miscellaneous products as outboard motors and snowmobiles.  </P> <P> A company spokeswoman said no replacements have been named for the three U.S.  automotive division executives who resigned Monday: Doug Mazza, vice president;  John Dorsey, sales director, and Larry Messelt, national sales manager.  </P> <P> Mazza and Dorsey were hired in 1985 to create American Suzuki's auto division,  the same year Suzuki introduced the Samurai.  </P> <P> The Samurai quickly caught on with younger drivers interested in low-cost  sports vehicles, and sales soared to 81,349 cars in 1987. But in June, 1988,  Consumer Reports magazine criticized the Samurai as being susceptible to  rolling over, and sales began to plummet.  </P> <P> Even though a federal study has since concluded that the Samurai is no more  prone to rolling over than are similar vehicles, sales slumped to about 50,000  in the first eight months of 1988, and in the first eight months of this year,  just 3,399 Samurais have been sold.  </P> <P> Sales of Suzuki's other vehicles -- a line of subcompacts and another sports  vehicle introduced within the last year -- have also been hurt by the  publicity. As of Sept. 1, Suzuki had sold just 21,389 cars and sports utility  vehicles in the United States.  </P> <P> In American Samurai's only statement about the management changes, spokeswoman  Laura Segall said the company "has undergone significant changes in the past  year."  </P> <P> "When Mazza and Arai started in 1985, they had only one automobile product, the  Samurai, and the goal was to establish a following for and generate sales of  the Samurai, which they did," she said.  </P> <P> "But now Suzuki is in a situation where we have a full line, including the  Sidekick and the Swift passenger cars. The complexion of the company has  changed, and there are different goals and philosophies on how best to run what  essentially is a new company."  </P> <P> Also Monday, American Suzuki announced its 1990 automobile lineup. The Samurai  is being de-emphasized, with fewer models and options being offered. Meanwhile,  the Sidekick -- a squat version of the Samurai with a lower center of gravity,  is being offered in several new configurations. As last year, there will be  three models of the Swift.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SHAKE-UP AT AMERICAN SUZUKI  </P> <P> American Suzuki Motor Corp., based in Brea, reorganized its executive suite  Monday amid a continuing sales slump.  </P> <P> Kenji Shimizu  </P> <P> Chairman since July, will assume the additional title of president.  </P> <P> Toshiyuki Arai  </P> <P> Former president, reassigned to corporate headquarters in Japan.  </P> <P> Doug Mazza  </P> <P> Former vice president, one of three automotive division executives who  resigned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SUZUKI'S SAGGING SALES  </P> <P> Suzuki Sales  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.22IN:1.78IN:1.78IN:2.33IN:2.33IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL SPN="4" CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> NUMBER OF VEHICLES SOLD  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> August  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> August  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> First 8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> First 8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C">  * 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Months 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Months 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> All models  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12,208  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3,300  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 49,756  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 21,389  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Samurai  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12,208  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 193  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 49,756  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3,399  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sidekick  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,376  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 13,827  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Swift GT  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 601  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3,001  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Swift GLX  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 103  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 838  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Swift GA  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 57  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 161  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *Suzuki sold only the Samurai Jan.-August 1988.

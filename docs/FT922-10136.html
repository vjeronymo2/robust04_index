			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The bottom line on life MORE MYSTERIES of the life industry were revealed this week with the publication of a survey of With Profits guides by the magazine Money Marketing, in conjunction with the actuaries Clay &amp; Partners. This is not recommended bedside reading for any bar the most chronic insomniacs. But the fine detail it provides about the future of life assurance-based investments is invaluable. An issue often overlooked when choosing an office is its ownership, which theoretically is all-important. Mutual companies are owned by their with-profits policyholders and operate solely for their benefit. When bonuses are paid, all the money which can prudently be distributed will go to the policyholders as nobody else has a claim. Proprietary companies have a dual loyalty. While they need to provide as healthy a pay-out as possible to policyholders, they also have to produce a dividend for shareholders. This may sound sinister, but the shareholders' allocation is usually quite small. The Money Marketing survey provides figures on the share of profits going to policyholders for 16 proprietary offices. Most stipulate that at least 90 per cent of profits is ear-marked for policyholders. Exceptions include Pearl, which has a minimum of 80 per cent on its ordinary branch surplus, and Legal &amp; General, which keeps a strict 90 per cent of its with-profits surplus for policy pay-outs, with other surpluses at directors' discretion. In 1990, most offices chose to distribute exactly 90 per cent of their available surplus. Scottish Mutual and Swiss Pioneer, both once mutuals, gave 100 per cent of their distributable profits to policyholders. However, some offices vary - for example, Eagle Star paid out 80.2 per cent and Legal &amp; General 87.5 per cent, while the figure for Sun Alliance was 91.0 per cent and for LAS 93 per cent. This might make you rush to invest with a mutual, but further analysis gives strong reasons to invest with a proprietary office. As Clay &amp; Partners points out: 'The security of policies may be higher because it is backed by extra reserves and bonus rates may be more stable.' A glance at the Money Marketing tables, published last week, shows a pronounced strengthening by quoted companies. If terminal bonuses are included, then over a 25-year term for endowments, Commercial Union is second, General Accident third, Equity &amp; Law eighth, and Eagle Star ninth. If terminal bonuses are excluded five of the top seven offices are proprietary, even though on average a tenth of their profits must go in dividends. The appeal of endowments is limited, owing to their inflexibility, but cautious savers looking for security might be prepared to go with a proprietary office and share some of their funds with shareholders. Their stolid merits seem rather greater after a bad year for the markets.</p>

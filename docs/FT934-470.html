			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Siemens to invest DM2.4bn in Dresden microchip plant Siemens, Germany's largest electronics manufacturer, is to invest DM2.4bn (Pounds 950m) over 10 years in a new microchip plant in Dresden. The project will be one of the largest single investments in eastern Germany and the biggest anywhere in the European electronics sector in recent years. More than 1,200 jobs will be created, and another 2,000 ancillary jobs are expected to grow around the new plant. The investment is part of Siemens' strategy to increase its share of the international telecommunications market, which is expanding rapidly, particularly in Europe. Growth would be largely driven by worldwide exports, the company said. Mr Heinrich von Pierer, chairman, said that the investment would be made primarily in production, with 10 per cent for research and development. 'By building this new plant in Dresden, we want to increase productivity, focus on innovation and expand our markets,' he added. Production and research will be based under one roof. The production centre, scheduled to be on line by early 1996, is expected to have an annual turnover of DM1bn. It will make 64-megabyte memory chips and the 256-megabyte chip used for telecommunications, mobile telephones and the car industry. Siemens intends to invest and organise production alone in Dresden, but Mr von Pierer added that 'the door would be left open' for potential partners, including Toshiba, the Japanese electronics group. Siemens chose Saxony instead of expanding outside Germany after lengthy negotiations with Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the state's prime minister, who is adept at cutting through red tape. There were also attractive investment grants. The European Union's regional fund and the German Ministry for Research and Development will contribute about DM300m. Siemens said it chose Dresden partly because it offered a highly qualified workforce. The skills available in the region meant it could become a new centre of an eastern German electronics industry.</p>

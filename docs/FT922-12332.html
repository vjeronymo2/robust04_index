			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Experts lead by a nose PERHAPS IT pays to trust the experts.  Last July, we assembled four notional share portfolios for private investors by four methods. Initially, the portfolio chose by experts - analysts, fund managers and private client stockbrokers - lagged in the race.  But during the last three months it has pulled ahead. The success is relative.  Even including dividend income and excluding dealing costs, anyone investing in the experts' portfolio would be around 3 per cent down so far.  The FTA-A All-Share Index rose 2.2 per cent over the same period, and that excludes any income. Ove the last three months, the experts' portfolio has risen by almost 9 per cent, helped by the post-election rally.  But six of the original 10 stock selections have fallen in price since last July (Vodafone was split off from the original selection of Racal, giving this portfolio 11 stocks). The directors' portfolio, which led for the first six months, is now second.  It was chosen by picking stocks where directors had previously bought shares in unison. This portfolio has a built-in handicap, in that the share price of a company often moves immediately after news of a director purchase. Our portfolio was thus bought after a price rise had occurred.  But private investors would face the same handicap, so we thought this was a fair test of the strategy.  A 5.4 per cent fall in the portfolio to date indicates that the system still has a bit to prove. In third place is the dart board portfolio, our 'control' for this experiment.  The stocks were selected by throwing darts at the share price pages of the FT.  This system was beating the experts after six months, but has made little progress over the last three.  Were it not for the inclusing of TVS Entertainment, however, it would be ahead. As it is, an investor would have seen a 7.8 per cent loss to date. Two adjustments have been made since July.  Precious Metals Trust was wound up and was replaced by media group EMAP.  And Harrison Industries was the subject of a reverse takeover by Antares, which resulted in a change in the share capital of the group. Still bottom of the pile, alas, is the high yield portfolio.  This was selected by picking the stocks in the All-Share index witht he highest yields.  A degree of safety was added by only choosing stocks where the dividend was twice covered by earnings. The risks and rewards of this are neatly illustrated.  Five of the stocks show gains and the income from the portfolio is the best of the four.  But three of the stocks, Ratners, Lep and TVS, have been disastrous, showing losses of between 80 and 90 per cent.  The net effect has been a 9.7 per cent loss. There is no hope that an economic and stock market recovery might allow this portfolio to recoup its losses.  Over the last three months, it has shown a 10 per cent gain. What has the exercise shown so far?  First, that portfolio selections, and outperforming a stock market index, is tricky.  Second, that the investor cannot expect to make short term gains from equity investment. The proper time ti judge these portfolios will be in five years.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           EXPERTS' PORTFOLIO  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Company               No of    Original  Current       Gain or                       shares   price (p) price (p)  loss (Pounds)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ABP                    352       284       381         +341.44 BP                     282       355       252         -290.46 Cable &amp; Wire           175       571       570           -1.75 Hillsdown              437       229       176         -231.61 Kingfisher             195       514       555          +79.95 Land Secs              204       489       393         -195.84 NatWest                305       328       311          -51.85 Racal                  458       218        61.5       -716.77 Vodafone               261         0       358         +934.38 RTZ                    174       574       592          +31.32 Tarmac                 450       222       145         -346.50 Income BP div                                                   11.84 C &amp; W div                                                 7.44 Racal div                                                 1.37 Vodafone div                                              7.46 Accrued income                                          111.57 Total income                                            139.68 Total gain/loss                                        -308.01  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Apr 14 closing prices.

			<p>BFN     [Text] "It is questionable whether numerical targets can be  achieved even by China, which has a planned economy." These  were the words used by a senior PRC official speaking about the  numerical targets demanded of Japan by the United States in the  Japan-U.S. economic consultations. The Chinese official was  speaking at a high-level working-level meeting held between the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the PRC  State Economic and Trade Commission at the MITI for two days up  to 26 April.    The official supported Japan's position in the economic  consultations, saying--as if citing from a textbook on  capitalism--"It is the market which decides which products are  sold in what quantities." He also spoke about the U.S. stand of  attaching human rights questions to the issue of extending  most-favored-nation [MFN] status [to China], and he criticized  the United States, insisting, "It would be meaningless if the  United States were to impose its way of doing things on us."    Japan avoided making any comment on the U.S. human rights  diplomacy, but a top MITI official who has borne the brunt of  criticism from the United States [in the economic consultations]  for so long looked very pleased by this unexpected friendly  "yell" from China. He said, "There is an expression: One  million troops have arrived to help us. I felt as though I had  1.2 billion troops who had arrived to help us."</p>

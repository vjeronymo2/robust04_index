			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: In the know? Sir, You mention ('BAe close to clinching Pounds 250m Taiwanese deal', August 26) the cautious approach of Taiwanese banks to aircraft leasing due to 'their unfamiliarity with western leasing techniques'. In the same issue you reported on the GE rescue agreement for GPA's aircraft-leasing company. Could it be that Taiwanese caution is in fact due to their 'familiarity' with western leasing techniques?

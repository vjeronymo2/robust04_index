			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Overseas pensions paid to dead people The Benefits Agency pays social security benefits worth more than Pounds 800m a year to people living abroad without regularly checking that they are still alive, the National Audit Office says in a report published today. According to the public expenditure watchdog, a spot check last year into the eligibility of 7,700 pensioners and widows led to the suspension of payments to a fifth of those contacted. The agency pays benefits and pensions to 680,000 people overseas, almost half in Australia, Canada and the US. More than 95 per cent of the payments are retirement pensions or benefits to widows. The NAO says most other countries regularly check the eligibility of pensioners living abroad, usually annually. They send out 'life certificates' requiring recipients to attest to the fact that they are still alive and entitled to the benefits. The US had suspended payments to 1.5 per cent of its 353,000 beneficiaries abroad in 1989 after such an exercise, and found that the circumstances of a further 15 per cent had changed. Canada suspended payments to 2.5 per cent of its 78,000 recipients in 1990. Similar checks were carried out on a selective basis by the Department of Social Security until 1985. However, these were discontinued after industrial action left a backlog of work to be cleared. The Benefits Agency, which took over the payment of social security benefits in 1991, has begun a programme of selective checks. The first, last year, involved contacting all retired pensioners in the Indian sub-continent and all widows receiving benefits in Bangladesh. By January, payments to 20 per cent had been suspended, though some payments may be resumed if the recipients react to their suspension by returning the life certificates. The NAO says the agency has only one employee abroad to keep in contact with pensioners in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Other UK organisations in the public and private sector make regular checks on the eligibility of pensioners abroad, according to the NAO. Army pensioners are required to complete a life certificate every five years. Shell UK sends certificates out every three years - annually to pensioners living in Iraq.

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Letter: Greater frequency of realignments only way forward Sir, Some feel that Monday's rate cut damaged the independence of the Bundesbank. But the key violation of independence happened five years ago. Monday's rate cut was only an example - admittedly, the most dramatic so far  -of the results of the exchange rate mechanism procedures introduced in 1987 (the so-called Basle-Nyborg Agreement), which require the Bundesbank to finance intervention that is in principle unlimited, to stop another currency from breaching its lower ERM limit. By inflating the German money supply, such a requirement directly conflicts with the Bundesbank's statutory responsibility of safeguarding the D-Mark. Surely the lesson of Monday's cut is that the Bundesbank cannot be expected to operate in the face of such direct conflicts of interests. That is why the ERM has no choice but to go forwards - to EMU - to more frequent realignments; the present state of limbo is completely unsustainable.

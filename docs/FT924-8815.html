			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Maxwell US units attract Dollars 1.2bn bid MR ROBERT BASS, the Texan billionaire whose 1988 intervention prompted Mr Robert Maxwell to increase his bid for Macmillan, is leading a new Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 788m) offer for the US publisher and for Official Airline Guides. The two companies are the main US business of Maxwell Communication Corporation. Price Waterhouse, the MCC administrator, has rejected the offer by Mr Bass and other investors, claiming that it can raise more money for creditors by selling the companies separately. In 1988, Mr Bass cleared an estimated Dollars 75m after bidding for Macmillan and then pulling out after Maxwell increased his offer to Dollars 2.6bn. Although asset sales later recouped part of the purchase price, it was a 'victory' that put Maxwell on the road to ruin. He paid Dollars 750m for OAG at about the same time. The latest offer involves Dollars 750m in cash, the balance coming from assuming commercial liabilities such as OAG preferred stock and a mortgage on Macmillan's New York headquarters. The Bass-led investment group is pushing for a meeting with the steering committee of banks such as Credit Lyonnais and Chase Manhattan, which effectively own MCC, and has set a two-week deadline from November 6. Earlier this year, Price Waterhouse said the best way to raise the maximum amount of money for MCC creditors, owed around Pounds 1.5bn, was to split the business. OAG is to be sold, a process that has already begun, and the Macmillan publishing businesses floated sometime next year. The administrators said they hoped the sale of the US businesses would bring in between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1.1bn net of tax and other charges. The Dollars 1.2m Bass offer includes such commercial liabilities. Mr Alan Jamieson, joint administrator, confirmed yesterday there had been an approach from parties interested in buying the whole group. The approach, Mr Jamieson said, is 'so much at the bottom end of our expectations' that they were not going to be diverted from their strategy of breaking up the group. The investor group is led by Acadia Partners, a Dollars 1.7bn investment partnership including Mr Bass and Keystone, formerly the Robert M. Bass group. It includes Bain Capital, Bear Stearns and DLJ Merchant Banking. It has committed Dollars 200m of equity capital and Chemical Bank says it will underwrite Dollars 300m in credit and provide working capital. DLJ and Bear Stearns have expressed confidence that the remaining Dollars 300m needed to finalise the deal can be raised.</p>

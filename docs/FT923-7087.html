			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Observer: Quis custodiet? Isn't it about time somebody conducted a value-for-money investigation into the Audit Commission, the watchdog charged with promoting efficiency in local government and the health service? Its annual report deserves rigorous attention. The fees charged to local authorities rose by an average of 6.6 per cent during the 1991-92 year, compared with an inflation rate of 4.1 per cent. The report tries to justify this by comparing the rise with the 6.7 per cent rate of salary inflation in the financial sector. Average salaries rose by more than 10 per cent to Pounds 24,674, despite a fall in staff turnover for the third successive year. Meanwhile, Controller Howard Davies took a hardly less generous 9.9 per cent rise in total remuneration to Pounds 106,018. To be fair, at least one knows what he was getting, which is more than can be said now that he has moved over to the CBI. The Commission has conducted a review of its own central costs which highlighted a number of areas where there was scope for savings. Perhaps it would be more convincing if an outside body carried out an efficiency investigation. How about calling in the National Audit Office, the Commission's less glamorous rival?</p>

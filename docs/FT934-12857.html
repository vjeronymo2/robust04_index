			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Lord Grimond dies of a stroke aged 80 LORD Grimond, who led the Liberal party for 11 years from 1956, died last night aged 80. His family said at his Orkney home that he had died in hospital from a stroke. Last night Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: 'We have lost a lion of the Liberal cause. Jo Grimond's death will be mourned by millions who shared his beliefs and by all who value the strength of our democracy and integrity in our politics. 'He brought the Liberal cause back from the verge of extinction, introduced new ideas which have today become commonplace in the agenda of all parties and inspired a whole new generation of liberal thinkers and activists.' Sir David Steel, Liberal Democrat MP for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale, and a former Liberal leader, said: 'Jo Grimond brought me into politics and he was the inspiration of an entire generation of Liberals. 'But his gift was that he reached out beyond the ranks of Liberals. His were the grand themes of European integration and of Scottish self-government within it. 'He was a great debunker of pomposity and bureaucracy, a cultivated man who enjoyed literature and art and had a glorious sense of humour. I do not believe that the Liberal party would have survived at all but for his leadership in the late 50s when it was down to five MPs. We all owe him an immense debt.' Lord Whitelaw, a former Conservative home secretary, said he was 'very upset' at the death of his former adversary. He added: 'Although he was an opponent in politics I always held him in very considerable regard for his ability and indeed for his charm. I always liked him very much indeed and admired him immensely.' Lord Grimond, a barrister, entered parliament in 1950 as MP for Orkney and Shetland. He held the seat for 33 years and became a life peer in 1983.</p>

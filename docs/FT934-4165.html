			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Books: General Gordon - a very rum cove - The imperial progress of this evangelical soldier hero GORDON: THE MAN BEHIND THE LEGEND by John Pollock Constable Pounds 19.95, 373 pages General Gordon was one of our great imperial heroes but he was also a very rum cove - come to think of it, like so many of them. He was 'inspired and mad', said Gladstone; the procrastination of Gladstone's government was of course responsible for Gordon's death in Khartoum in 1885, two days before the relief party arrived up the Nile. It can be agreed that Gordon was 'very eccentric to the point of making one doubt his absolute sanity', according to another, more sympathetic acquaintance: he reviewed his troops in a frock coat; he fined officers a shilling if they called him 'Sir'; at Khartoum he sat every night in a brightly-lit window in defiance of the Mahdi's snipers; he led his men into battle carrying only a cane and a cheroot (but surely that was not so unusual? - Cardigan is supposed to have headed the charge of the Light Brigade holding a cigar, and it has been argued that the unarmed British officers who took their companies 'over the top' were somehow disassociating themselves from the vulgar business of slaughter). No, the central eccentricity in Gordon's life was that he was an extreme specimen of an evangelical Christian whose faith, acquired at 21, gave him a disregard for death and a total reliance on divine destiny; sometimes it appears in his letters a deathwish. His friend Field-Marshal Lord Wolseley later wrote, 'Life was to him but a Pilgrim's Progress between the years of early manhood and the Heaven he now dwells in, the Home he always longed for'. In the meantime, Gordon was not just a brave and efficient man of war, he was also close to being a soldier of fortune - the word 'mercenary' is wrong because he was not remotely interested in money and he was always under the War Office - who successively commanded in battle Chinese, Egyptian and African, but never British, troops, and yet he became a British military hero. It is a good illustration of the workings of the Pax Britannica. There have recently been a number of intelligent books about the Empire which focus in particular on the sexual ambiguity of these imperial servants. Gordon always figures prominently. Ronald Hyam, for instance, in Empire and Sexuality, has a list of what he calls 'a-sexual' high-achievers including Gordon, Kitchener, Jowett, Twining, Rhodes, Milner, Baden-Powell, Lugard, Curzon, Churchill, Montgomery, Macmillan, etc. Evidently these men were not all suppressed homosexuals, but the implication is that they were formed so as to be able to devote their principal energies to their public role. Some of them must have been suppressing something. Gordon's particular affection, which he never concealed, was for young boys, whose welfare and moral development were his deepest concern throughout his life. John Pollock, in this new biography Gordon: the Man behind the Legend, does not belong to this generation tempted by psychoanalytic theory, and is more concerned to put down the recurrent story that Gordon was a secret drinker. There have been plenty of biographies of Gordon over the years, many of them hagiographical (the recent ones by ex-politician Anthony Nutting and Charles Chevenix-Trench are not) and Pollock's justification for yet another is that he has been able to draw heavily on the millions of words in Gordon's family letters in order to rescue 'the real Gordon'. It was Lytton Strachey, in his wonderfully mischievous Eminent Victorians in 1918, who first raised the scandalous suggestion that the general, apart from lashing out in un-Christian temper at his servants, would sometimes seal himself in his tent with 'an open Bible and an open bottle of brandy'. Pollock convincingly argues against the liquor at the price of conceding that Gordon was a dangerous smoker ('. . . smoking knocked off, never, DV, to be resumed, as yet it has not been my greatest trial. I can say that, as far as the flesh, I do not care for anything . . .') He never managed to give it up. This is a respectful, cautious biography, untouched by Strachey's elegant intelligence, but there is a good tale to tell, deliberately uncluttered by too much analysis or interpretation. Gordon was a Sapper who, after the Crimea, found himself in China in 1861 putting down the pseudo-Christian Taiping rebellion as commander of the foreign-officered 'Ever Victorious Army'. The legend of'Chinese' Gordon was quickly established. Then came years of fortification construction and devout social work in Gravesend - 'Something broke in my heart, a palpable feeling and I knew God lived in me'  -and, in 1874, the Governor-Generalship of Equatoria Province and then of the Sudan itself, absolute monarch of a country the size of Western Europe, answerable only to the Khedive in Cairo. He was 44. Then Abyssinia (a set-back), a mistaken appointment to India, China again, a sabbatical in Ireland, and Mauritius and the Seychelles where the Bible-reading soldier discovered the Coco de mer and decided he had come to the Garden of Eden. The celibate Gordon's obsession with a nut shaped unmistakeably like a vulva is, to say the least, curious. After Basutoland (another mistake) and the Holy Land he almost went to work for King Leopold in the Congo, but at the last moment was diverted by Gladstone's reluctant government to Khartoum where his mission, hopelessly under-formulated by Cabinet, was to secure the retreat of Egyptian rule in favour of Sudanese independence. In essence, Gordon was expected to produce an impossible miracle. The rest of the story is familiar, though we shall never know the true detail of Gordon's death exactly a year after he arrived in the palace overloooking the Nile. Curiously, Pollock is at his weakest in this his most dramatic episode (compare him with Thomas Pakenham's splendid The Scramble for Africa). We could also have done with a posthumous chapter explaining what happened next - but the slightness of historical context is the main weakness of this readable study which is strongest in the attention it pays to Gordon's religion, his theology described by the expert Pollock as 'an unintegrated mixture brewed from early Christian fathers, Gnostics, medieval and 17th century mystics, Evangelicals and Tractarians' In view of all the other books, perhaps the priority is right. One footnote: on the final voyage to Khartoum, Gordon annotated a copy of Newman's The Dream of Gerontius; that volume was sent to England and eventually re-published complete with the general's pencil markings; Edward Elgar was given a copy: and that inspired the Oratorio]</p>

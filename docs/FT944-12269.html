			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Senators criticise CIA over spy case US senators demanded fundamental changes in the culture of the Central Intelligence Agency yesterday. They castigated its director for his response to the discovery of a Russian spy within the agency's counter-intelligence division this year. The Senate intelligence committee said it found 'a bureaucracy which was excessively tolerant of serious personal and professional misconduct among its employees, where security was lax and ineffective'. The committee also criticised the disciplinary action taken by Mr James Woolsey, the CIA director, after the unmasking as a spy of Mr Aldrich Ames. In a detailed report, the committee said 'gross negligence' had allowed Mr Ames to remain undiscovered for almost nine years. He was arrested in February and jailed for life after admitting spying for the Soviet Union and then Russia. The findings come at a difficult time for the CIA, as the justification for maintaining a Dollars 27bn annual intelligence budget after the end of the cold war comes under increasing pressure. Apart from its handling of the Ames case, the agency has been challenged on questionable judgments in countries such as Haiti, where it repeatedly undermined President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and kept supporters of the military junta on its payroll. The committee said it had found 'a system and a culture unwilling and unable  -particularly in the early years of Ames's betrayal - to face, assess and investigate the catastrophic blow Ames had dealt to the core of its operations'. The committee found Mr Woolsey's disciplinary action inadequate. It says he only issued letters of reprimand to seven retired and four current CIA employees. None of the employees was fired, demoted, suspended or even reassigned. Editorial Comment, Page 21</p>

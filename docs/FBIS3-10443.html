			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By PRENSA LATINA correspondent Mary Simon] </F>   [Text] Geneva [no date or agency attribution as received]  -- Jose Perez Novoa, Cuban ambassador to the Human Rights  Commission (CDH), stated that this nation rejects the imposition  of a rapporteur appointed as a result U.S. pressure or attempts  to impose any type of alternatives.    With respect to this issue, the head of the Cuban delegation  participating in the 50th session of the CDH described the  appointment of the aforementioned rapporteur as part of  Washington's hostile and unmerciful policy toward his country.    In an interview granted to PRENSA LATINA [PL], Perez Novoa  stressed that at a time when the end of the so-called Cold War  is being used as an instrument to demand an end to hostilities  in regions such as Palestine and South Africa, as well as  between bloc relations, ironically, that same policy is still  being used and reinforced against Cuba.    To the diplomat, it is unacceptable to discuss an anti-Cuban  resolution promoted by the United States such as the one  scheduled to be voted on next week when the CDH is expected to  end its current session.    In this respect, Perez Novoa indicated that "we did not come  here on the defensive, nor did we arrive and feel that we are on  the defendant's seat."    This is why Cuba's participation is directed toward the  overall context of the CDH programs which has encouraged and  negotiated dozens of projects, some of which were approved  already during the CDH's second voting round on Friday, 24  February [date as received].    Moreover, the Cuban delegation's participation is taking  place in an integral, multivalent, and comprehensive manner,  completely divorced from any perception of isolation toward  Havana.    In this respect, Perez Novoa stated that they are not  concerned or apprehensive about the ghost of an alleged  resolution against Cuba. In nothing -- he insisted -- does this  cause us to lose sleep.    The proposal for a special rapporteur came about as a result  of a U.S. imposition in its vendetta against Cuba. During the  presentation of the report to the general assembly, [CDH  rapporteur] Carl Johan Goth pointed out that in Cuba there are  no missing persons, torture, murders, or armed groups.    Later on -- Perez Novoa stated -- he tried to justify an  institutional system, but what is very clear to him is that "in  Cuba there is no indication of massive and flagrant human rights  violations."    That is obvious, insisted the ambassador, who believes that  the real source of this resolution is the hostile and aggressive  policy of U.S. Administrations against Cuba.    In this respect, Perez Novoa regretted that the new  administration still clings to such a position which has no  basis whatsoever.    That is why Cuba maintains its rightful position with  respect  to there being no reason for selective and discriminatory  treatment by this CDH, nothing to justify the existence of the  rapporteur or it being included as item 12 of the agenda.    Nothing of the sort -- he stated -- corresponds to the true  situation in Cuba or what its people are experiencing.    "They simply cannot acknowledge that Cuba has been able to  accomplish a social, economic, and political program such as the  one it has despite hostilities from the United States," Perez  Novoa indicated.    When correlating Washington's position with respect to the  so-called Cold War, the ambassador indicated that while the new  administration calls for an end to the Cold War and to  confrontation in Palestine and South Africa, as well as in  relations between blocs, it continues and reinforces its policy  toward Cuba.    How can they explain to the world that they continue this  Cold War policy and harass our small country, the ambassador  asked, when Cuba does not constitute any danger whatsoever to  the United States. Today -- he indicated -- they cannot even  resort to the false but much used argument that we are "a Soviet  base" because the Soviet Union as such no longer exists.    Perez Novoa insisted that Cuba has historically maintained,  is, and will always be willing to discuss its differences with  the United States under an equal condition of sovereignty and  without any preconditions.    The ambassador asserted they are the ones who do not want  to accept and evade the responsibility of having normal  relations and discussing differences.    "An example that obstinacy remains is this false and  manipulative human rights policy, and this is why they seek a  new resolution," he said.  <H5>  Cuban Cooperation With the CDH </H5>   Jose Perez Novoa recounted what he called Cuba's broad,  frank, and transparent cooperation with the entire human rights  system and rapporteurs throughout the years.    In this regard, he described how, encouraged and subsidized  by the United States, the rapporteurs receive complaints, which  are sometimes presented without any evidence, legality, or  force. Nevertheless, he said, the rapporteurs received the  complaints and sent them to the government. The government, in  turn, answered them without any doubt or fear because we have  nothing to hide, he said.    On the contrary, the ambassador said, we feel proud of the  human rights situation prevailing in Cuba as few nations have  been able to accomplish what we have in this respect.    He added that cooperation is valid for all countries without  discrimination, selectivity, or political imposition. Perez  Novoa observed: Cuba is willing to cooperate, has done so, is  doing so, and will continue to do so.    On this subject, he mentioned the time in 1988 when Cuba  invited a CDH delegation for a visit. The CDH representatives  visited the island, met with all those they wanted to see and  made a report. The report was presented the following year and  discussed publicly with the media, nongovernment organizations,  and observer governments during three sessions.    Perez Novoa said the report was discussed as no other in the  CDH session and no evidence was found to justify that Cuba be  assigned a rapporteur.    What's more, he said, when the issue was taken to a vote,  they [the United States] lost. The ambassador then referred to  the phase after the debate, when Cuba negotiated its desire to  continue cooperative relations with the [UN] secretary general  with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries  (Grulac) [Grupo de Paises Latinoamericanos y del Caribe] and the  EEC. [sentence as received]    Cuba, he said, was not included on the agenda, had not been  assigned a rapporteur as the United States lost that vote  (1989), and -- as was accepted by then UN Secretary General  Javier Perez de Cuellar -- the island maintained smooth and  transparent cooperative relations.    Not satisfied with the situation, Washington asked for a  report from the secretary general in 1990, who presented it and  had it analyzed.    The fact that Cuba had maintained permanent and stable  cooperation with the [UN] secretary general was obviously  established in the negotiations with Grulac and the EEC.    As it did not further [U.S.] propaganda goals to say Havana  had been registered as a human rights case because it was under  topic 12 or had a rapporteur, it took advantage of the changes  in the correlation of international forces. At the time, the  disintegration of the Socialist field had already begun. This  situation was used by the United States to impose an amendment  to the resolution presented by Grulac, which was signed by  approximately 20 representatives.    The only thing our people have always objected to in their  history and will continue to object to is when something is  imposed upon them, he asserted. Our people are open, warm,  affectionate, and compassionate, but we will never accept those  who try to impose their power upon us, the ambassador stressed.    Regarding the changes [in Cuba], as they are usually called,  they are the ones born from our own national identity, the ones  needed by our country and, based on this, the ones being  implemented because they are not meant to satisfy the world, he  said.    The diplomat was clear when he said: "We will not turn our  backs on the world. We know there have been changes. However,  we also know we have to protect the great social, economic, and  political accomplishments of the revolution, which is the  essence of the Cuban program. [no ending quotation mark as  received]    To further this objective, he manifested, we are obliged to  make adjustments in the country -- including economic ones -- to  secure those achievements as much as possible. What we are not  ready to do, under any circumstances, pressure, or even under  the threat of weapons, is to surrender our independence and  sovereignty, he stressed.</p>

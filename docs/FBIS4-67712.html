			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Gavrilenko report: "Health Deteriorating, but No </F> Increase in Medicine. Difficult Situation Developing With  Medical Supplies for Pacific Fleet Servicemen"]    [Text] Vladivostok -- Quite recently it used to be far  safer going to military doctors for help than their civilian  counterparts. Now when the health of the draft contingent is  deteriorating every year the job of military medical staff is  becoming more and more difficult. And not just because last  year for instance the number of instances of scabies,  tuberculosis, and diphtheria in the Pacific Fleet alone almost  trebled.    In some garrison hospitals patients are already being placed  in two-tier bunks. There is a catastrophic shortage of medical  staff, who even in the past did not have the luxury of high  wages. The supply of ambulances is just over half the required  level and those that are still in operation are well and truly  worn out.    According to Colonel (Medical Service) Nikolay Popov, chief  of the Pacific Fleet main hospital, a sick servicemen today no  longer has guarantees that he will be able to receive the full  course of treatment he requires. At present for instance there  are no broad-spectrum antibiotics, medicines to treat cerebral  circulation disorders, and effective antiulcerative  preparations. The medical equipment with which the fleet's  medical establishments are equipped is by no means perfect.  Above all there is a shortage of apparatus to study small  vessels and the gastrointestinal tract, computerized tomographs,  which enable early diagnosis, and much else besides.    At the same time, Colonel (Medical Service) Gennadiy Shokin,  acting head of the Pacific Fleet Medical Service, said that the  health of the young men turning up for service in the fleet is  getting worse with every year. Thus, one in five new draftees  is not fit for service among the seagoing personnel, one in six  has circulation problems, one in seven has a gastric ulcer, and  one in 10 has abused drugs before being drafted. Some 30  percent of future seamen are underweight and almost 20 percent  are suffering from psychiatric disorders.    In 1993 around 400 young men who turned up for service in  the  Pacific Fleet were sent home before swearing the oath and almost  as many seamen again were discharged on health grounds in the  first three months of service.    If the prevailing situation is not put right, there will  soon  be simply no one to serve in the fleet.</p>

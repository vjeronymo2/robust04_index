			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): HK at record high as Nikkei weakens ARBITRAGE and index-related selling weighed on the Nikkei average, which closed marginally lower in light trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average fell 87.32 to 17,303.39, down 1.36 per cent on the week, after moving within a narrow range of 17,273.38 and 17,453.73. Volume rose slightly from 220m shares to 230m. Advances led declines by 527 to 427 with 182 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 4.05 to 1,313.41. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.67 to 1,065.96. Trading centred on short-term activity by dealers, while share prices also fluctuated on light arbitrage-related activity prompted by a weak futures market. Institutional investors remained absent ahead of the long weekend. The market will be closed on Monday and Tuesday. Some market participants are hopeful that the market will turn up after the Golden Week holidays. An official at Nippon Life, the leading life assurer, said the downside was limited and there could be a slight increase in volume. However, the spate of corporate earnings announcements starting in the middle of this month could depress sentiment. NEC, the electronics company, fell Y40 to Y1,000 after reports that it would announce its second downward earnings revision for the fiscal year ended March. Other electronic blue chip issues were also lower, with Hitachi down Y11 to Y839 and Matsushita Electric Industrial retreating Y30 to Y1,410. Dealers sought speculative favourites. Bio-technology related issues firmed, with Okamoto up Y40 to Y1,210 and Morinaga Milk adding Y14 to Y784. Plant engineering companies were traded on reports of an increase in projects in south-east Asia. Chiyoda rose Y90 to Y1,570 and JGC added Y30 to Y1,930. Housing companies advanced as some investors were encouraged by the slowing decline in housing starts figures. Housing starts for March fell only 2.3 per cent from the same month last year, adding to hipes that the residential property market was close to touching the bottom. Taisei Prefab Construction added Y80 to Y2,340 and National House Industrial rose Y30 to Y1,700. In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 40.08 to 19,846.64 in volume of 12.4m shares. Small-lot buying by foreign investors and investment trust funds supported the index. Short-term trading lifted Shimano, the bicycle maker, by Y70 to Y1,370. Roundup HONG KONG recorded an all-time high while other Pacific Rim markets were mixed. Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Manila were closed. HONG KONG rose over 2 per cent ahead of a half-point cut in interest rates which was announced after the market had closed. The Hang Seng index closed up 114.64 at 5,484.21 for a 2.8 per cent rise on the week. Turnover was HKDollars 3.56bn from HKDollars 2.78bn. Comments by a Chinese official that the country's economic reforms will continue also improved sentiment. Commercial and industrial stocks led the day's gains, followed by property shares. Hutchison and Cheung Kong both rose 80 cents to HKDollars 17.40 and HKDollars 23.40 respectively. Among the banks HSBC put on HKDollars 1.06 to HKDollars 41.50 while Hang Seng Bank improved HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 43.25. AUSTRALIA continued to advance.

Fletcher Challenge continued to perform well, gaining 3 cents to NZDollars 3.50. Fay Richwhite eased 5 cents to 62 cents on news that New Zealand's America's Cup challenger had been eliminated from the series. The shares had climbed to NZDollars 1.20 earlier this year.

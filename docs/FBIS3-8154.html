The four ministers who have been newly appointed to the  Vacaroiu cabinet through Decree No. 26 of 6 March 1994 took the  oath during the ceremony. Here is the text of the document that  Dan Nastase, head of the Presidential Chancellor's Office, read  at the beginning of the ceremony:    [Begin Nastase recording] Decree on release from and  appointment to the position of minister:    In accordance with Article 85, Paragraph 2; Article 94,  Paragraph C; Article 99, Paragraph 1; and Article 105 of the  Romanian Constitution, and taking into consideration the  proposals advanced by the prime minister for a government  reshuffle, Romania's president decrees the following:    Article 1: Petre Ninosu, minister of justice; Niculae  Spiroiu, minister of national defense; George Ioan Danescu,  minister of interior; and Paul Teodoru, minister of  transportation, are released from their position as members of  the Romanian Government.    Article 2: The following persons are appointed to the  position of members of the government: Iosif Gavril Chiuzbaian,  minister of justice; Gheorghe Tinca, minister of national  defense; Ioan Doru Taracila, minister of interior; and Aurel  Novac, minister of transportation.    The document is signed by the president of Romania Ion  Iliescu [end recording]    The four ministers read and signed the oath, an event that  was followed by President Ion Iliescu's act of signing the  required protocol. The head of the Romanian state then made the  following speech:    [Begin Iliescu recording] Mr. Prime Minister, Ministers: We  have carried out a natural constitutional act in our political  life upon proposals advanced by the prime minister, by taking  into account reasons connected with the actions and efficiency  of the government's activity and on the basis of consultations  with the political formation that is supporting the government.  Thus we have carried out this reshuffle.    The new element that appears in the structure of our  government is in line with a more general practice in other  European countries, namely, a civilian is appointed to the helm  of the Ministry of National Defense.    This is our debut in this practice, although we have had a  civilian minister at the head of the Ministry of Interior in the  period following the December 1989 revolution. I believe that  the proposals and thus the changes that followed will bring  about the necessary moving spirit to improve activity.    I would also like to thank the ministers who have carried  out  their activities and their duties so far for their work. Each of  them individually will receive a new assignment. Mr. Spiroiu  will represent us at Brussels and will continue implementing the  measures required by the Partnership for Peace. Mr. Danescu, in  his capacity of a professional, will remain the major assistant  at the Ministry of Interior in work aimed at modernizing this  ministry. Paul Teodoru will assist the new minister in  fulfilling his duties for a while, although the transfer is not  so complicated considering that Mr. Novac has worked in the  leadership of the ministry and will receive assignments from the  government. As far as Mr. Ninosu is concerned, as lomg as he is  healthy he will receive new assignments.    I would like to ask the new ministers to approach with  utmost  seriousness the problems that the government and the respective  ministries are currently facing and to take over the duties  incumbent on them in the shortest time possible. We should  establish a united and cohesive team in the government to  continue the complex and difficult program for this year's  activity. This is an essential year for the reform as a whole  and for the economic reform as a central goal of the government.  Actions that started last year will be finalized and those  actions will have to lead to a certain curbing of inflation, the  stabilization of the national currency, and a certain  stabilization of economic life in general.    There are also a number of actions necessary to improve  activity in all the other areas, the affected ministries, and  the important sectors, where the processes of consolidating  state institutions will make new steps forward.    I would like to wish for success in the mission for the new  ministers and the government as a whole. [end recording]    [Announcer] Senate President Oliviu Gherman, Prime Minister  Nicolae Vacaroiu, and Viorel Hrebenciuc, general secretary of  the government, attended the ceremony.

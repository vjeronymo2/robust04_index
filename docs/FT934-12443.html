			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / UN curbs Bosnia aid until safety guarantees given THE United Nations yesterday suspended delivery of emergency aid to more than 1m people stranded in central Bosnia until warring Croat and Moslem forces guarantee the safety of relief workers. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, took the decision after UN convoys on Monday were hit by machine gun and mortar fire, killing a Danish lorry driver and wounding nine workers. Lord Owen, the European Community's peace mediator, told EC foreign ministers in Luxembourg yesterday he was sceptical about using force to get supplies through to people as winter approached. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said yesterday that the area under suspension included Mostar in the south-west, and towns in central Bosnia where Croats and Moslems were fighting. Ms Sylvana Foa, for the UNHCR, said operations would start once the parties gave credible guarantees for safe passage. The decision to suspend some aid convoys would make it extremely difficult for people in some areas such as Mostar, although others would still get help, Lord Owen said. The idea of creating a 'safe route' from the Adriatic coast to Sarajevo was being considered, but he pointed to enormous problems with using force. President Francois Mitterrand called on Monday for help, including US military protection, to force open the road to Sarajevo. Meanwhile, a renegade Bosnian army commander accused of running a criminal gang surrendered to Moslem-led government troops in Sarajevo yesterday after a day of gunbattles in the centre of the city, Bosnian state radio said. Ramiz Delalic, commander of the army's Ninth Brigade and better known as 'Celo', gave himself up to troops ringing his headquarters. Twenty five civilian hostages were freed. The radio said troops were still pursuing a more powerful alleged army crime kingpin, Musan Topalovic, commander of the 10th Mountain Brigade.</p>

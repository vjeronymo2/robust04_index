			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Elite child of a depression - Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley was born, sixty years ago next September, an offspring of the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression. Amid the economic calamities of the era, a Congress eager to strengthen the foundations of the nation's financial system passed the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, enshrining the separation of the commercial banking and securities businesses in the US. Forced to choose between the two businesses in 1934, JP Morgan - Wall Street's dominant firm - elected to concentrate on banking. Within a year, a group of senior partners at JP Morgan resigned and joined forces with several partners of the Philadelphia firm of Drexel &amp; Co to form 'a new organisation for the underwriting and wholesaling of investment securities.' Under the leadership of Harold Stanley and Henry Morgan, the grandson of JP Morgan, the firm of Morgan Stanley set up business at Number Two Wall Street on September 16, 1935. In its first full-year, Morgan Stanley managed or co-managed Dollars 1.1bn of public offerings and private placements, or 24 per cent of the entire market, and from that auspicious start it never looked back. In the ensuing 40 years, Morgan Stanley grew into Wall Street's most successful and prestigious wholesale securities firm. Throughout its prime, Morgan Stanley was sustained by a corporate culture that set the firm apart from the trailing pack. Hiring the best and the brightest from the country's top families and universities, the firm molded its executives into an elite corps which cultivated a mystique that impressed clients and intimidated rivals. By the 1970s, although the firm was one of the biggest underwriters of securities in the US, it began to diversify into securities trading and later, the rapidly-growing and glamorous business of mergers and acquisitions, where Wall Street's pre-eminent dealmaker, Mr Robert Greenhill, led the way throughout the M&amp;A boom years in the 1980s. But the firm's dominance began to slip as its competitors adapted faster to a rapidly-changing world. In 1986, the firm went public to secure access to the capital the biggest securities houses increasingly needed to compete in US and global capital markets. Although it was still regarded as the best-managed of Wall Street firms  - its return on equity consistently outstripped those of its rivals in the mid and late-1980s - the future appeared to belong to the new giants of Wall Street, such as Goldman Sachs (which took over Morgan Stanley's mantle as the elite of the industry). By the start of the 1990s, Morgan Stanley was just one of several dominant 'bulge bracket' firms in the securities industry. The balance of its business had shifted away from stock broking and underwriting and towards proprietary trading, and its M&amp;A business was enduring the sharp decline in deal activity apparent across Wall Street. The M&amp;A department later suffered a blow when Mr Greenhill left the firm in June 1993 to join securities house Smith Barney taking a dozen top investment bankers with him. In the last two years, the firm has bounced back, moving rapidly into the burgeoning derivatives business. Although its earnings have been hit by the sharp downturn in the securities industry this year, it has pursued an aggressive expansion strategy, focussing primarily on building up its presence in overseas markets. Mr John Mack, Morgan Stanley's ambitious president, said recently that the firm's goal was to be the 'Number One global investment bank'.</p>

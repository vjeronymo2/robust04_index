			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Major puts animals on agenda The Tories yesterday attempted to soften their 'hunting-and-shooting' image  -making animal welfare a central policy in their European campaign alongside farming, fishing and the countryside. They launched a dossier, Animal Welfare - The Conservative Record, listing government action on animal experiments, whaling, elephants, wildlife, dangerous and stray dogs and farm animals. In the foreword, Mr John Major, the prime minister, writes: 'The welfare of animals is no longer a fringe issue. 'Most people feel that there is room to improve the way animals are treated. No other government - in Britain or abroad - can match the record of this Conservative government on animal welfare. 'We have taken comprehensive steps to strengthen the protection of animals in the wild, on the farm and in laboratories.' At a news conference at Conservative Central Office, Mr Nicholas Soames, junior agriculture minister, said: 'Historically, we in the British Isles have taken pride on our efforts to protect animals from cruelty and neglect.' Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, attacked Labour for seeing the countryside as 'an urban playground', and the Liberal Democrats for failing to mention animal welfare in their manifesto.</p>

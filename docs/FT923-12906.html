			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / US warns Iraq of risk to ceasefire THE US yesterday issued its sternest warning in months to Iraq, accusing it of jeopardising the Gulf war ceasefire by refusing to allow United Nations weapons inspectors to enter a Baghdad ministry building in search of documents, writes Mark Nicholson, Middle East Correspondent. Washington's tough statement, which implies that continued Iraqi resistance to the UN might prompt a military response, came as Iraq itself sharpened its recent defiance of the UN by demanding the annulment of all resolutions adopted since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. In Washington, Mr Richard Boucher, a state department spokesman, said Iraq's refusal to allow a team of UN inspectors access to an agriculture ministry building 'is putting at risk the ceasefire that concluded Operation Desert Storm'. Iraqi officials have denied the UN inspectors access to the building since July 5 and have couched the refusal in increasingly hostile terms.</p>

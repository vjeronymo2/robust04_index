			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / US steps up pressure for Mideast talks: Palestinians warn that stranded deportees still pose a problem EFFORTS to set a date for the resumption of Middle East peace talks will intensify this week with a visit to the region by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state. The US and Israel believe that the Arab delegations can be brought back to the table, even though nearly 400 deported Palestinians remain stranded in south Lebanon in defiance of a United Nations resolution. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, said yesterday he believed 'that parties interested in peace will come to the negotiations and I believe that the Palestinians will do the same'. Israel has ruled out further concessions on the deportees, beyond offering to take back 100 immediately and reducing by half the two-year banishment order for the others. On Friday, the UN Security Council welcomed the offer to readmit 100 Palestinians and repeated its demand for the rest to be allowed back as soon as possible. The statement appears to have headed off any Arab attempt to persuade the Security Council to impose sanctions against Israel. Mr Nabil Sha'ath, who has co-ordinated the Palestinian negotiating position during the Washington talks, said yesterday the US was making a mistake if it thought it had resolved the problem of the deportees in advance of Mr Christopher's trip. 'That would be a very big mistake and really does not augur well for his visit,' he said. Syria, Jordan and Lebanon all wish to resume peace negotiations soon. But they would hesitate to attend if the Palestinans stayed away. Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, said she was not insisting that all deportees be taken back imediately but there had to be an acceptable timetable. The deportees are accused by Israel of being members of Hamas or Islamic Jihad, the two radical Palestinian organisations in the occupied West bank and Gaza that oppose the peace talks and are challenging the political leadership of the PLO, headed by Mr Yassir Arafat. Accepting an arrangement set by Israel and the US to resume peace talks while the 400 deportees remain in Lebanon could further reduce PLO influence in the territories, especially as anger is running high over the sharp increase in children and young people shot dead by Israeli troops during the past two months. Some western diplomats fear that even if Mr Christopher succeeds in bringing all delegations back to the peace talks, recent events will have soured the negotiating atmosphere and will make compromises more difficult. Mr Rabin has also been under fire from the right wing in Israel for bowing to US pressure on re-admitting 100 of the Palestinian deportees and may want to reinforce his credentials as a tough negotiator.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Vestey arm plans disposals to concentrate on core businesses UNION INTERNATIONAL, the trading arm of the Vestey Group, is planning new disposals as part of its strategy to develop into a smaller food processing and distribution group. The company yesterday reported profit before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 30.8m in the year ended December 31, compared with a loss of Pounds 20.5m in the previous year. An exceptional credit of Pounds 1.6m contrasts with the previous year's exceptional loss of Pounds 81.8m, which mainly arose from losses on disposals. Net debt fell 38 per cent, from Pounds 327m to Pounds 202m, through sales and reorganisation. Mr Terry Robinson, chief executive, said the group was already planning its future after the completion of the refinancing at the end of next year. 'We want to rebuild our fortunes by disposing of our non-core activities and expand our core businesses.' Union International, one of the UK's largest private companies, is to focus on its food processing and distribution business. Mr Robinson said he expected net debt to be 'well below Pounds 100m' by the end of the year. The group is to seek new equity for its meat operations in New Zealand. Union is looking for an overseas investor to buy 30 per cent of Weddel New Zealand, with the remaining 20 per cent sold through a public flotation. It also plans to sell its international food processing and distribution businesses based in Brazil. The group is close to finalising the sale of its Brazilian farming interests - expected to fetch around Dollars 45m (Pounds 30m). Sales of minor operations in other parts of Latin America, UK, Australia and the Far East are also being considered. Union's UK property portfolio, which includes office developments in the City, has also been earmarked for sale. It has already been written down by more than Pounds 60m over the past two years. Under Mr Robinson's control, Union has reasserted its authority over its subsidiaries, by capping capital expenditure and setting profit targets. Union has formalised its refinancing agreements with its 70 banks in 25 countries through to December 1994. Shareholders funds increased more than 40 per cent from Pounds 26.6m to Pounds 37.9m.

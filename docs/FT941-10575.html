			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / NUT votes to continue boycott of schools tests Britain's largest teachers' union yesterday decided to press ahead with its boycott of national curriculum tests in England and Wales for another year. The move by the NUT increases the chances of renewed political difficulties this summer for Mr John Patten, the education secretary. But teachers' unions are now split, as leaders of the other two unions have opted to call off the test boy-cott. Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, announced the action after a poll of members had found 89.9 per cent support for continuing the union's campaign against the tests and the associated teacher assessments. Only 31.2 per cent of the union's school members participated. He said: 'The evidence of this survey is there. Teachers want time to teach. They do not want to waste time on unnecessary and unsound statutory assessment and testing systems.' Tests would not take place in many schools if the NUT carries out its threat. Both the other two unions, the NASUWT and the ATL, have agreed not to take over the work of NUT members taking industrial action. The two associations for head teachers have both recommended that the boycott should be lifted, but have said they will not put pressure on teachers who continue with industrial action. Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority which sets the tests, said: 'The NUT appears not to be recognising how much has already been done to help teachers by limiting these tests to the essentials - national language, mathematics and science - and by finding ways of relieving them of administrative work. My only concern is the interests of the children.' The Department for Education also attacked the decision. It said parents would not understand why the NUT had not dropped the 'unnecessary' boycott in line with the other unions.</p>

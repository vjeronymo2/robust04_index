			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger </F> by unidentified correspondent in Bonn; date not given: "There  Must Be an End to Minimization"]    [Text] [DIE WELT] Should Republikaner leader Franz  Schoenhuber be allowed to call the chairman of the Central  Council of Jews, Ignatz Bubis, one of the "worst instigators of  people" in Germany with impunity?    [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] With his statements,  Schoenhuber has unmasked himself. One who makes such a  statement publicly after the shocking attack on the synagogue in  Luebeck, repeats it, and is impertinent enough to bring a charge  against the chairman of the Central Council of Jews for the  instigation of people not only reveals what sort of person he is  but also what political movement he stands for. There must be  an end to the minimization of the Republikaner! The competent  judicial authorities will have to examine whether Mr.  Schoenhuber's statements are punishable or not.    [DIE WELT] Expressions of dismay about Schoenhuber's  statement after the attack on the Jewish synagogue in Luebeck  have come from all the democratic parties. Is verbal  condemnation sufficient?    [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] Of course verbal outrage is  not enough. Yet it would be a mistake to believe that an open  political dispute can be avoided through criminal prosecution.  In a democracy, political dispute is based on words, and  therefore it is important to use these words in a conscious and  responsible manner. Politicians who use terms like "mixture of  races" and "infiltration with foreign elements" in a careless  manner appear to have no sense of responsibility about the form  of political dispute and the political climate in the country.  They more or less accept that public statements like that of  Mr. Schoenhuber, which are clearly reminiscent of our worst  past, are possible again today.    [DIE WELT] Do you join those who call for legal  investigations against Schoenhuber?    [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] I believe that Schoenhuber's  statements might be punishable. The authorities responsible  have already started investigations.    [DIE WELT] Have the politicians made mistakes if such  statements are again possible 50 years after the holocaust?    [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] I do not believe that it would  appropriate to speak of mistakes. However, there are alarming  developments and politicians are partly using a language  conducive of a climate that makes statements like Mr.  Schoenhuber's possible again. Thus, it is important to continue  consistently and increase the political argument against the  right and to point out developments that might pave the way for  demagogues.    [DIE WELT] Are Schoenhuber and his Republikaner right-wing  radicals or right-wing extremists?    [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] I think that Schoenhuber's  statements speak for themselves. No politically minded person  will find it difficult to assess them.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Jetstream has requested that the FAA increase the current limit, which they believe is arbitrary, and allow up to 30 passengers in accordance with same special conditions. As noted by the applicant the demonstration conducted for approval of the 29 passenger version Model 4101 did include 30 occupants in the passenger cabin (to account for the JAA approved arrangement) and was completed well within the allowable time. Therefore, from the standpoint of amending the special conditions, an additional demonstration would not be required. While the limit of 29 passengers is somewhat arbitrary, the FAA must consider whether other conditions should apply if the limit is raised. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the existing conditions is that there be no more than ten seat rows on either side of the aisle. The 30 passenger arrangement proposed by Jetstream still complies with this requirement. In fact, the additional seat is located on the left side of the aisle at the extreme rear of the airplane, and does not produce the same kind of aisle offset that occurs throughout the cabin. This is because the seat is opposite a windscreen at which point the aisle leads into the passageway for the aft exit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These special conditions are intended to provide requirements which result in a cabin aisle that is as effective and safe as those envisioned by the regulations for the maximum number of passengers on the airplane. Where appropriate, requirements have been drawn from existing regulations. In other cases, new requirements were developed to preserve the level of safety which is inherent in the design of more conventional aisle arrangements. The FAA considers that an additional passenger does not invalidate the existing special conditions. It is noted however, that further increase in passenger capacity would violate one of the other conditions because it would result in more than ten seat rows on at least one side of the aisle. Therefore, any increase beyond 30 passenger seats would very likely require the development of additional conditions. As noted above, the FAA has determined that the staggered aisle should limit the passenger seating capacity to something less than would otherwise be allowed by the regulations. Under the terms of these special conditions, 30 is considered to be the reasonable maximum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As in the case of Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;45, an evacuation demonstration would be required for the 30-passenger version. Since the applicant chose to conduct it with 30 rather than 29 passengers, the evacuation demonstration conducted for the 29-passenger version would show compliance with this requirement for the 30-passenger version as well. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, in addition to the requirements of &sect;25.815, the following amended special conditions are proposed for Jetstream Model 4100 series airplanes with a staggered main aisle. Other conditions may be developed as needed based on further FAA review and discussions with the manufacturer and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, the proposed special conditions would be applicable initially to the 30 passenger version of the Jetstream Aircraft Limited Jetstream Model 4101 airplane. Should Jetstream apply at a later date for a change to the type certificate to include another model of the 4100 series incorporating the same novel or unusual design feature, the special conditions would apply to that model, as well, under the provisions of &sect;21.101(a)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jetstream, in their petition, requested that the amended special conditions be promulgated without delay as a final rule and in time to permit delivery of 30 passenger airplanes during August 1994. The FAA has determined that public comment would be in the public interest, but will shorten the comment period to 20 days in order to expedite the issuance of the final special conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action affects only certain novel or unusual design features on one Model of airplanes. It is not a rule of general applicability, and it affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 25 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Proposed Amended Special Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes the following amended special conditions for Jetstream Aircraft Limited Model 4100 series airplanes with an offset main cabin aisle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PART 25_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The authority citation for these special conditions is as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  49 U.S.C. 1344, 1348(c), 1352, 1354(a), 1355, 1421 through 1431, 1502, 1651(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 1857f&hyph;10, 4321 et seq., E.O. 11514; 49 U.S.C. 106(g) (Revised Pub.

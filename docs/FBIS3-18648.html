			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bo Jeppesen: "Center Democrats: The WEU Isn't </F> Everything"]    [Text] Mimi Jakobsen, minister of Business Policy and  Coordination of the Western European Union and leader of the  Center Democrats, confirmed that getting closer to the Western  European Union [WEU] is a central -- but not a deciding --  demand of a new government in which the Center Democrats will  participate. The Center Democrats are in an electoral alliance  with the Liberal and Conservative Parties for the European  Parliament elections.    The leader of the Center Democrats [CD], Business Policy and  Coordination Minister Mimi Jakobsen, agreed with her policy  spokesman, Peter Duetoft, when he announced yesterday that  Danish membership in the WEU must be a part of the basis for a  new government.    "It won't be the deciding factor, but it is one of the  points  the CD will fight for. It's entirely natural," Jakobsen said.    She said that there was nothing new in the fact that the CD  is working in favor of membership in the WEU, but the CD's  partner in the coalition government, Foreign Minister Niels  Helveg Petersen (Radical Liberal Party), was not enthusiastic  about Duetoft's statement, which he believes is "ill timed."    "We have a government and the basis for a  government, so I would also like to point out that when putting  together a government you can't promise that Denmark will or  will not be part of the WEU," Helveg Petersen said.    He finds the debate important, but believes it is too  restrictive just to debate the WEU.    "The WEU is in fact just a very small detail. On the other  hand, we do want to have a broad national debate about the  entire changed security policy situation in Europe. It's  needed," the foreign minister said.    The CD will not get unexpected support from the Conservative  and Liberal Parties in starting now to introduce membership in  the WEU as part of the basis for forming a future government.  The Liberal and Conservative parties have in fact just formed an  electoral alliance with the CD for the European Parliament  elections in June.    "It is a completely absurd situation for Denmark to be the  only European NATO country that is just there as an observer  while the WEU, with the blessing of the United States, has begun  to play a role in European security. We must have a discussion  about this, something the government has thus far rejected. For  that reason it is a brilliant idea for the CD to have made  inroads in the discussion," said former Foreign Minister Uffe  Ellemann-Jensen (Liberal Party).    The Conservatives' Kent Kirk believes the present foreign  minister is neglecting the importance of the WEU.    "WEU membership will be a very significant policy element in  connection with the creation of a new government," he said.</p>

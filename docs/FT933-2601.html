			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Major scorns Lamont attack as 'sad' MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, dismissed Mr Norman Lamont's attack on the government as 'sad and disingenuous' yesterday, and said speculation about a leadership challenge was 'silly'. Mr Major's advisers said the prime minister expected to continue in office 'for years'. However, rightwing backbenchers said the issue would dominate the party conference this month. The former chancellor is expected to launch a further attack on Mr Major at a conference fringe meeting. Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East, claimed that Mr Lamont was giving a public airing to views held privately by ministers who were unable to speak out. He said the conference would be 'very difficult'. The prime minister's response to Mr Lamont was echoed by cabinet colleagues, who condemned the former chancellor's comments, delivered in newspaper articles. The strongest reaction came from Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, who said the sight of 'ex-ministers rewriting history' was 'sickening'. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, claimed that Mr Lamont's comments had been ignored by regional officials attending a morale-boosting meeting in Cardiff. 'The issue which has been raised with me is that of loyalty to John Major, support of John Major as prime minister,' he said. 'There is no question whatsoever about that.' Significantly, rightwing ministers also spoke out in support of Mr Major. Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, said much of the debate was 'surreal'. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said it was 'sad that Norman does think it necessary to continue to comment in this vein'. However, in a comment reflecting the unease felt in the Tory party, Sir Marcus Fox - chairman of the backbench 1922 committee, which represents all Conservative MPs - said it appeared that 'Norman Lamont is going to be a loose cannon on the back benches'. Mr Major's strategy is to seek to reduce the impact of the continuing attacks on his leadership by belittling the credentials of the rebels. Mr Lamont was described privately as 'embittered' by his dismissal from the Treasury in May. Mr Lamont, who refused to comment further, appeared to have succeeded in establishing himself as a leader of the rightwing Tory Euro-sceptic MPs. However, his call to the prime minister to rule out British participation in European monetary union was dismissed by Downing Street as an empty challenge. Advisers said the prime minister had repeatedly described the timetable for monetary union set out in the Maastricht treaty as unsustainable. MPs loyal to Mr Major also sought sought to undermine the effect of Mr Lamont's remarks by ridiculing his suggestion that Britain required a change of leadership to prosper.

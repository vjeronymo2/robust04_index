			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The European Parliament's [EP] plenary session  accepted the Greek presidency's program without substantive  criticism. Reservations were expressed only regarding the white  paper's implementation.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Theodhoros  Pangalos, the Greek alternate foreign minister and president of  the Council of Ministers, presented the Greek presidency's  program to the European Parliament's plenary session. Pangalos  particularly stressed what could be expected from a presidency  in an international environment that is very unstable,  experiencing serious crises, and suffering clashes. In his  address, Pangalos stressed that the Greek Government attaches  particular importance to implementing the white paper on  employment and development. He said he hopes this will not be  hindered by financial obstacles.    Discussing the European Union's [EU] expansion with four new  members from the North, Pangalos referred specifically to  Cyprus' application.    Referring to EU initiatives on common foreign policy,  Pangalos mentioned the Greek presidency's sensitivity toward  promoting peace and security in the Balkans and working toward  resolving the tension in the former Yugoslavia. This position  was accepted, the Greek presidency indirectly clarifying that it  will not exploit the presidency to promote a national policy on  the Balkans. This is why Pangalos carefully avoided mentioning  Skopje or Turkey's policy toward Greece, something that was  criticized by KKE [Greek Communist Party] Eurodeputy  Efraimidhis. Replying to Efraimidhis, Pangalos said he was  speaking for Greece as the EU president, not as a Greek  nationalist who could satisfy his own wishes. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LAST FIGHT OF FATHER OLIVARES;  </P> <P> FOR YEARS HE CHALLENGED THE CATHOLIC HIERARCHY AND FOUGHT FOR IMMIGRANTS, FARM  WORKERS AND THE POOR. NOW HIS OPPONENT IS AIDS  </P> <P> A FEEBLE, DISHEVELED OLD MAN shuffles into the study of the graceful,  Spanish-style religious residence in Hancock Park. The elderly man, a retired  priest who lives here, wears a watch cap and several day's stubble on his face.  Clearly senile, he laughs uproariously as he recites, over and over, a  nonsensical rhyme about Pancho Villa.  </P> <P> Across the room, Father Luis Olivares watches silently, sitting crossed-legged  at a large wooden table that dominates the study. "Si, como no," Olivares  finally says, kindly humoring the old priest. "Yes, of course."  </P> <P> But Olivares squirms in his chair. It is an unsettling moment for the  controversial social crusader who suddenly -- since he was stricken with AIDS  last summer -- finds himself idled, his world drastically shrunken, confined  for the most part to this residential complex where he is convalescing.  "Sometimes I say to myself, it would be better if I just went ahead and died,"  Olivares says. He is not afraid of death, he adds, but the thought of becoming  dependent on others for his every need terrifies him as much as the stigma the  disease carries.  </P> <P> Daily, however, a steady stream of friends and admirers try to lessen his  burden. Bishops and government leaders write or visit. Hollywood personalities  drive up to the religious center in Jaguars and Mercedes-Benzes to take  Olivares to lunch at the finest restaurants. Women of humble means from his old  downtown church bring him home-cooked meals, and groups of his parishioners  awaken him on occasion with morning serenades and cheers. And with loving  silence they shelter their fallen leader from the rumors that now surround him.  </P> <P> Olivares and his doctors believe that he, a diabetic, was infected through the  use of improperly sterilized needles on one of his many trips to refugee camps  in Central America. But inevitably, his vow of celibacy has come into question,  and he anguishes over the possibility that innuendo will undermine his life's  work.  </P> <P> Olivares thought that he knew all about being poor and dejected. Hadn't he  opened the doors of his historic downtown church, Our Lady Queen of Angels, to  homeless immigrants and Central American refugees? Hadn't he championed the  cause of farm workers and helped shape a poor and powerless East Los Angeles  flock into an influential citizens lobby? Hadn't he clashed with the archbishop  himself in pressing these causes?  </P> <P> But suddenly, at 56, the priest who had become the voice of activism in the Los  Angeles church finds his role reversed as he faces the cruel prospect of  becoming one of the powerless outcasts he has long defended.  </P> <P> The tall, now gaunt Olivares wanders the halls and gardens of the stately  residence, sometimes in desperation, he says, "not knowing what to do with  myself." A striking man, he remains elegant in fine tweed coats or guayaberas,  but there is a vulnerable, almost brittle quality about him; his confident  stride has become tentative, his balance and vision blurred by meningitis, a  complication of AIDS.  </P> <P> Yet if his spirits seem dampened, Olivares remains open to the world. He  continues to grant interviews. "Everybody wants to know how a priest feels when  he gets this," he says with good-natured sarcasm.  </P> <P> Before his diagnosis, Olivares occasionally appeared at AIDS fund-raisers. In  recent months, however, he's put AIDS at the top of the list of causes to which  he devotes his time; last month, he appeared as grand marshal at an AIDS  benefit in East Los Angeles. And AIDS patients he has never met call for  appointments, hoping for some special insight or wisdom. So far, he has been  unable to provide it. "Most of the time, I don't know what to say. This is all  new to me," he explains. "You try to live out your remaining time doing  whatever good you can. That's what I'm looking for now."  </P> <P> During interviews this fall, Olivares' strength ebbed and flowed as he battled  the illness that sent him to the hospital for frequent blood transfusions. His  speech was slow, and he found it difficult to remember dates and details of his  past.  </P> <P> Though he won't complain, Olivares repeats the words of others who bemoan the  unfairness of his predicament. From the hundreds of letters he has received,  Olivares quotes a New York Protestant minister he has never met who wrote that  when he read that Olivares was ill, he literally screamed. "Why?" the minister  demanded to know of God. "Why does He afflict people who are doing good?"  </P> <P> As Olivares faces this, his toughest battle yet, he sees his many triumphs  paling. "I've been trumpeting this identification with the people in my  ministry. Yet, have I really been poor? Undocumented? Homeless?" he asks  himself in one of his deepest moments of reflection. "Then the Lord sends this  along and here I am." For the first time in his life, the veteran strategist  for social change seems at a loss.  </P> <P> A POOR MEXICAN KID from San Antonio, Luis Olivares rose quickly through the  ranks of the church hierarchy to a life of material comfort, even luxury. Then,  in the late 1970s, he traded position and rank to minister wholeheartedly to  the poor. Though he has always hungered for acceptance, Olivares often has  courted rejection, alienating some church and government officials by his  strident stances in defense of his marginalized constituency.  </P> <P> "Rejection is his cross," says Father Richard Estrada, a longtime friend. "He  wants badly to be accepted by his (religious) peers. . . . But he won't back  down."  </P> <P> Olivares is not easy to pigeonhole. He may be devoted to the poor, but he is  also known for his expensive taste in clothing. After a week's hard work among  the desperately poor, he heads to fancy shopping malls to browse amid the gaudy  opulence. The contrast with his usually stark surroundings provides much needed  "comic relief," he says. And yes, he confesses, there is a "very slight" thrill  in seeing part of a world he gave up.  </P> <P> At a benefit in his honor a few months ago, he was lauded by a glittering crowd  of celebrities as well as government, labor and church leaders. In an  arrangement symbolic of Olivares' principles, luminaries such as United Farm  Workers union President Cesar Chavez, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, state  senators and chancery officials sat next to immigrants and ordinary  parishioners at tables elegantly set for the outdoor dinner at Olvera Street  Plaza. From Our Lady Queen of Angels Church across the street came shouts of  "Que viva el Padre Olivares! " Scores of homeless Central American refugees and  illegal immigrants chanted enthusiastically as they stood in a sidewalk soup  line outside the church where Olivares once ministered to them. It was this  church that he opened to the homeless, allowing them to sleep in the pews  despite protests from some parishioners and church officials. It was this  church which, in 1985, he declared a sanctuary for Central American refugees --  the first in the Los Angeles archdiocese.  </P> <P> "I'm convinced," Olivares told the dinner crowd, "that despite the futility  that it might seem, our ministry was justified because it was a transparent  sign of a better world. . . (an) exaggerated sign of God's presence in the  midst of the poor."  </P> <P> Many at the benefit praised Olivares as a modern-day prophet, a visionary hero,  the conscience of the city. In less cordial settings, however, some of  Olivares' detractors have labeled him a communist, citing his staunch  opposition to U.S. policy in Central America. Others have called him a  self-serving zealot who bought into his own press.  </P> <P> "I always wondered when I'd see a picture of him and (former Nicaraguan  President) Dan Ortega, what side of the issue of democracy he was really on,"  says Harold Ezell, former Western region commissioner of Immigration and  Naturalization Services. "He was an embarrassment to the church leadership.  You'd think he was the archdiocese spokesman, not the archbishop."  </P> <P> Even some of Olivares' Claretian brethren, who saw his mid-career  transformation from ostentatious church official to charismatic social  crusader, have questioned his motives.  </P> <P> "The order knows Louie as he was before," says Estrada. "They remember him with  his big cars. Then they saw him going to El Salvador and being at the forefront  of demonstrations, even getting arrested. And they feel he does it for ego.  They don't trust him."  </P> <P> The once scrawny barrio kid has found himself at the center of some of the  region's most compelling and electric social causes -- often to his surprise.  Olivares has celebrated union victories with farm workers and officiated at  their funeral Masses. He was instrumental in founding the United Neighborhoods  Organization of East Los Angeles, which has grown into the largest network of  grass-roots organizations in the county. And in recent years, he has railed  against U.S. funding of the right-wing government of El Salvador and led  Southern California's immigrant- and refugee-rights movement, addressing  thousands from the pulpit of Our Lady Queen of Angels Church -- the largest  congregation in the sprawling Los Angeles archdiocese and long the focal point  for Southern California's Latino Catholics.  </P> <P> Olivares "fell deeply in love" with the farm workers, with his East Los Angeles  parishioners and the poor who flocked to his church, says Father Rosendo  Urrabazo, another longtime friend. "There is nothing he wouldn't do for them. .  . . If Louie has made a mistake, it has been the mistake of all of those who  fall in love -- his love blinded him to other realities."  </P> <P> AS FAR BACK as Luis Olivares can remember, he thought he was special. In the  large matriarchal family of Mexican immigrants, he was his grandmother's  favorite. Olivares' brothers and sisters were charged with protecting and  looking after him, the sickliest and most timid of seven children. Even when he  got into mischief, the boy was easily forgiven. "Louie could do no wrong," his  brother Henry and sister Rosario recall.  </P> <P> He was only a toddler when his mother died. While his father worked to support  the family, Olivares and his brothers and sisters were raised by an aunt and  their grandmother, Inez, a Mexican immigrant widely respected in their San  Antonio barrio as a spiritual adviser and folk healer. "Our grandmother gave us  a good sense of self," Olivares says. "She didn't try to mold us. Rather than  someone who protected us, she was an educator."  </P> <P> In their hometown of Parras in the Mexican state of Coahuila, Inez and her  family had been pillars of their church. When an anti-clerical fervor swept  Mexico in the wake of the revolution of 1910, family members risked their lives  to hide priests from government persecution. Then, fearing for their own  safety, the family fled across the border to San Antonio, where they continued  to shelter priests in exile.  </P> <P> Priests from the local parish were always in and out of Louie's home; he  considered them family. While other children played school or house, the  Olivares youngsters often spent their days celebrating make-believe Mass. They  used leftover pieces of unconsecrated Communion wafer bread and old prayer  books. Louie, dressed in miniature vestments sewn by his grandmother, always  officiated. Whenever they tired of the religious game and began making noise  about playing something else, Louie would chastise them from his makeshift  pulpit.  </P> <P> Shortly after his grandmother's death when he was 13, Olivares entered a  seminary in Compton, Calif.; his older brother Henry had entered the year  before. The seminary was run by the Claretian Missionaries, the same order as  their role models back home. This small order traces its roots to Spain and is  best known for its ministry to Latinos.  </P> <P> When Olivares joined, he had a vague idea of wanting to "do good." But it  wasn't pure idealism that lured him to the seminary -- it offered one of the  few tickets out of the barrio. "Given our economic condition, was it realistic  to think I'd go to college or be able to pursue a career?" he says. It would be  years before he would "look upon the priesthood as what it's supposed to be --  a means for changing the world, changing minds and hearts."  </P> <P> Away from the cocoon of home and family, the youngster felt his first sting of  racism -- white classmates made fun of his Spanish accent. His humble roots,  his Mexican culture, even the Spanish language that he grew up with became  distant memories as Olivares flourished in the Anglo-dominated seminary. "Louie  was never satisfied with just doing what was expected," recalls Henry, who  later left the priesthood to marry. "He was always involved in extracurricular  activities, going on field trips, organizing picnics, in charge of committees."  </P> <P> Olivares was singled out for special treatment by teachers who saw in the boy a  strong sense of responsibility and leadership. He was entrusted with  straightening out the prefect's office and polishing the sacred vessels used  during Mass. In college at the Claretian seminary in Dominguez Hills, he led  the school choir and managed to raise several hundred thousand dollars for the  seminary by marketing greeting cards.  </P> <P> In Olivares' high school yearbook, his classmates predicted that he would be a  cardinal someday. The attention helped puff an already well-developed ego, but  it also stirred resentment among peers. "There are a lot of strong egos in any  religious community, and a lot of jealousy," Olivares says. "Being young and  inexperienced, I didn't learn my lesson well. I tended to gloat. The notion is  you're supposed to act very humble. . . . I thought that was false humility,  and I never yielded to that."  </P> <P> He earned a master's degree in business administration from Notre Dame  University in 1964. Only three years later, at 33, he was appointed corporate  treasurer of the Claretians' Western province, one of the highest church posts  ever held by a Latino in the country. In Los Angeles, Olivares developed a  taste for expensive silk suits, big black sedans and business lunches at the  finest Beverly Hills restaurants. Shepherding the religious order's investments  took him on regular trips to Europe for conferences at the Vatican, and to  Chicago and New York, where he traveled by limousine and was wined and dined by  bankers, stockbrokers and wealthy contributors.  </P> <P> When a group of activist nuns lobbying for a "morally responsible" investment  policy asked him to help cleanse church portfolios of company stocks tied to  the Vietnam War, Olivares demurred. His only concern as trustee of Claretian  money, he says, was to "maximize profits."  </P> <P> During this time, he even turned down an invitation from a national group of  priests called Padres to join their campaign to focus more attention on the  concerns of Latinos in the church. Being linked to such a radical group, he  reasoned, wouldn't do an up-and-comer much good. (He later regretted his  decision and joined the group, eventually becoming its president.)  </P> <P> As he rose through the ranks, Olivares returned to the seminary briefly -- this  time as an administrator of the Claretian training center, then located on an  old estate in Malibu Canyon. Some of the idealistic young men he supervised  were scandalized by his well-heeled lifestyle.  </P> <P> "We kidded him a lot about the new big, black LTD he got every year," says  Urrabazo, one of the young seminarians who disdained Olivares' lifestyle. "He  was a sobering statement to a lot of us that the world isn't the way we think  it is."  </P> <P> Even his family was a bit put off by bureaucrat Louie. Now and then he would  breeze into San Antonio for a brief visit. But his brothers and sisters found  it difficult to recognize the self-important priest with the designer clothes  and businesslike manner. "It wasn't Louie," recalls Rosario Olivares, now  Sister Victoria. "We weren't brought up that way."  </P> <P> OLIVARES' RETURN to his cultural and spiritual roots began with one in a series  of chance events that he came to call "opportunities for conversion."  </P> <P> In 1974, a seminarian in East Los Angeles asked Olivares for permission to help  the United Farm Workers organize their grape boycott. Seminary rules required  such outside activity to be supervised by a senior priest. Without much  thought, Olivares volunteered. Around the same time, Olivares was assigned to  head his first parish, Our Lady of Solitude in East Los Angeles. He figured  that experience at the large Latino parish, known as "La Soledad," would look  good on his resume.  </P> <P> What he hadn't counted on was the emotional wallop of working among his own  "flesh and blood." For the first time since joining the priesthood, Olivares  stepped out of the rarefied atmosphere enjoyed by the church elite and rubbed  elbows with the Mexican community and the poor. "Then, (I came) into contact  with the farm workers themselves and the spirit that moves them," Olivares  recalls.  </P> <P> He was impressed by Cesar Chavez, the UFW leader, who had managed to unite  Latinos in a national movement for the first time. Olivares walked the picket  line with them, officiated at weddings and baptisms, and shared their sorrow at  funerals when the union struggle sometimes turned violent and deadly. Olivares,  who became the unofficial poet of the movement, inspired forces with eloquent  homilies, "with words like wings," says union vice president Dolores Huerta.  </P> <P> Olivares learned a lesson from the farm workers: You are converted by those you  serve. "You may initially get involved in a cause for altruistic reasons,  because you want to help those 'poor people,' " he says. "But pretty soon you  are fighting with them and they are doing more to convert your way of thinking  than what you are doing for them. After a while, the enthusiasm comes out of  that rather than out of your own convictions."  </P> <P> In 1976, he responded with similar enthusiasm when Ernie Cortes, a fellow Texan  and professional community organizer, enlisted Olivares' help in organizing a  powerful and highly disciplined citizens lobby in East Los Angeles. Members of  the Soledad parish still recall how Olivares encouraged them. He set up English  classes and brought in professional organizers who taught parishioners how to  speak in public and challenge officials to respond to their community needs.  </P> <P> It was the first time an advocacy group had drawn its strength and its  structure from a parish organization. Among its victories, the United  Neighborhoods Organization lists successful campaigns to reduce auto insurance  rates, evaluate the performance of school principals and lobby for tough  anti-crime legislation.  </P> <P> At UNO, Maria de la Luz Hernandez was one of Olivares' "creations," as she puts  it. The mother of nine children, Hernandez was once so timid she never ventured  from home without her husband's permission. But with Olivares' encouragement,  she learned to address large crowds at UNO conventions and lobby city officials  for neighborhood improvements. "For 24 years I lived in silence," she once  said. "But Father Olivares dared to come to our home. My husband had too much  regard for him to say no."  </P> <P> Olivares came to believe in including lay and religious church members, without  regard to rank, in the building of a community -- an uncommon, if not  revolutionary, notion in the church's highly hierarchical structure. His  willingness to involve parishioners in church decisions and his team-approach  to ministry became his trademarks. "I recognize that those instances in which  something significant has happened, it has been because of somebody by my side,  rather than out of my own initiative," he says. "If you trust a person, a lot  can happen."  </P> <P> In 1981, Olivares was assigned to Our Lady Queen of Angels, the 200-year-old  church in the heart of Los Angeles' Mexican birthplace that draws 10,000  worshipers -- mostly Latinos -- to Sunday Masses. Under Olivares, the church  that Latinos affectionately call La Placita, "Little Plaza," became a haven for  refugees and illegal immigrants -- a place not only to bed down and get a  square meal, but also to find encouragement and someone willing to speak out on  their behalf.  </P> <P> For Olivares, the presence of so many desperate people at his church door was  clear testimony of the failure of immigration laws as well as U.S. policy in  Central America. He felt compelled to see for himself the source of so much  misery. That quest took him to Salvadoran refugee camps in Honduras and later  to El Salvador. At the camps, he found refugees living in squalid conditions as  virtual prisoners. "You cannot be witness to human suffering and not be  convinced of the existence of social sin," he said at the time. "We are all  responsible unless we take a stand and speak against it."  </P> <P> OLIVARES HAD infuriated immigration authorities by declaring his church a  sanctuary in 1985. Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony sidestepped the issue,  declining to publicly condemn or condone the action. Then, in 1986, Congress  passed sweeping changes in immigration laws, including a provision that  outlawed the hiring of undocumented workers. And when Olivares announced that  he planned to urge employers to continue hiring illegal immigrants, federal  officials complained to Mahony and launched an investigation.  </P> <P> Olivares, his associate pastor, Father Michael Kennedy, and Father Gregory  Boyle, pastor of nearby Dolores Mission, were summoned to Mahony's office. The  archbishop asked them to sign pledges to respect the hiring ban. They refused,  saying they couldn't comply with a law that they believed was immoral. "What  right do you have to set policy for this archdiocese?" one of Mahony's aides  angrily shot back, Olivares says.  </P> <P> By resisting Mahony, Olivares knew he was jeopardizing his future at La  Placita. But he calculated that the archbishop would prefer to avoid the public  relations stink that would surely ensue from sacking three controversial  priests. The gamble paid off. Within days, Mahony retracted his request for  their signatures and asked only that the three exercise more discretion in  their pronouncements. As a compromise, the priests agreed to tip off Mahony  before going public with controversial stances. Since then, Olivares has  frequently found himself on the wrong side of the law. Last year, he was  arrested several times for blocking the entrance to the Federal Building in  downtown Los Angeles during mass protests against U.S. policy in El Salvador.  </P> <P> Mahony has been "very effective in providing a sense of vision," particularly  on issues of social justice, Olivares says. "But his methodology for getting  things done takes a lot of time. Meanwhile, those of us on the front lines have  to deal with the problems at our church door."  </P> <P> On the immigration issue, for instance, Mahony's approach has been to lobby for  changes in the law. Olivares, however, argues that there are times when  "unjust" laws must be broken. Olivares doesn't expect someone in Mahony's  position to espouse breaking the law. Still, he adds, "I'd prefer he were  publicly more supportive of those of us on the front lines.  </P> <P> "Historically, the real radical changes in the church have never come out of  the institution," Olivares explains. "They always come out of the periphery."  </P> <P> That reasoning as well as his insistence that ministering to the poor holds a  higher priority than running a smooth parish operation was rejected by some of  Olivares' Claretian brethren. In their eyes, Olivares allowed La Placita to  devolve into a disorderly, even dangerous place overrun not just by homeless  men but also petty criminals. An elderly priest had been mugged in the open  courtyard, and merchants in the Olvera Street tourist complex had begun  complaining that they were losing business. Several of Olivares' fellow  Claretians at La Placita abandoned ship; no volunteers took their places.  </P> <P> "The question is: 'What is the priority?' " Olivares argues. "Do you limit the  number of people you are going to serve for the sake of efficiency? Are you  going to exclude some people from church services because they look sloppy and  the church looks messy with all these homeless people floating around?"  </P> <P> One of the priests who left La Placita, Olivares recalls, accused him of  allowing "the myth of Luis Olivares" to go to his head. At a general assembly  of the order last spring, which surprised some by its emotional and bitter  tone, some members questioned Olivares' motives and accused him of being "out  for his own glory."  </P> <P> In 1983, Olivares narrowly lost an election among Claretians to become head  Provincial for the order's Western province. A few years earlier, his brethren  had refused to reelect him to a third term as their treasurer. Such rejections  weighed heavily on Olivares, who found himself outside the circle of power.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to say it hurts, but it does make you angry," he says. Although  he recognizes that the strong reaction he elicits is a sign that he is "making  a difference," it is an uncomfortable position for a man who thrives on  acceptance.  </P> <P> Then, last summer, after serving nine years as pastor at La Placita, Olivares  was removed from his post by his superior in the order. Technically, Olivares  had been allowed to serve well past the usual three-year term for a pastor. So  he did not object when he was told that, at the end of his third term, he would  be reassigned to a parish in Texas. What he did object to, and strenuously, was  the method of selecting his successor.  </P> <P> He pleaded with superiors to choose someone willing to continue his work. But  when that failed, Olivares planned to take his objections all the way to Rome.  "I just could not see how my (regional) superiors could make changes at Plaza  without knowing what the needs there are," he says. "They never came and asked  questions of the pastoral team or of the employees or of the parishioners."  </P> <P> But Olivares fell ill before he could follow through on the appeal. In early  June, after several days in bed with what he thought was the flu, he was taken  to the hospital where doctors began tests that would diagnose his illness. From  his hospital bed, Olivares received disquieting reports: An interim pastor  began scaling back services to the homeless, and the church courtyard was made  off limits to them during the day. Meanwhile, police, whom Olivares had barred  from church premises, began chasing homeless men away from the street and  sidewalks. The new permanent pastor, Albert Vazquez, former vice president of  the Mexican American Cultural Center in Los Angeles, has vowed not to throw the  men out, but he is trying to assuage authorities, parishioners and nearby  merchants.  </P> <P> During Olivares' tenure, there was no mistaking his priorities. If anyone  complained about his favoritism for immigrants and the homeless, he simply  asked: "What if that person is Jesus and I turn him away? How can I do that?"  </P> <P> ON A CRISP fall afternoon, Olivares receives a hero's welcome at an open house  at Casa Rutilio Grande, the refugee shelter he helped establish five years ago  at a former Hollywood convent. He now works here a few hours almost every day.  A handful of young men who run the facility -- refugees and immigrants  themselves -- speak glowingly of the difference that Olivares has made in their  lives and in the lives of hundreds of others who have passed through the  shelter's doors.  </P> <P> A middle-aged Salvadoran woman with waist-long black hair runs and buries her  face and her tears in Olivares' chest and won't let go. The fact that he does  not know her does not seem to matter. "I love him like a father," she says,  explaining later that she had not seen him since he had fallen ill. "There'll  never be another to speak for us like he did."  </P> <P> Olivares' illness has silenced most of his critics. Ernest Gustafson, a former  Los Angeles director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, stopped by  to visit, as has Archbishop Mahony. In a public statement released after his  first visit, Mahony called Olivares a man of commitment and courage who  "aroused the conscience of us all as we try to understand our responsibilities  toward newly arrived peoples and those whose lives are not sheltered by laws  and protections."  </P> <P> Gustafson, however, couldn't resist getting in a jab. When Olivares  complimented him for "helping people" in his new role as unpaid adviser to  Latino immigrants, Gustafson responded: "But I do it within the law."  </P> <P> Immigrant advocates say Olivares' unexpected departure has left a terrible  vacuum in the movement's leadership. "Father Olivares helped shape public  attitudes and created a critical mass that finally broke through the  indifference of city officials," says Linda Wong, a leading immigrant-rights  activist and director of the California Tomorrow Foundation, a nonprofit  research group. "I can't think of anyone else in Southern California with the  kind of stature and moral authority he has. And I haven't seen many people so  willing to commit beliefs to action."  </P> <P> Supporters among his fellow Claretians have taken to calling him "a living  hero." "He has taught us a concern for the poor, a willingness to take risks,  the courage to say what needs to be said, and his concept of being a public  presence in the fight for social justice," Urrabazo says.  </P> <P> Now his battle is with a more personal foe. Doctors at Cedars Sinai Medical  Center summoned Olivares' family and closest friends to his bedside in late  June when it looked as if he might not survive. At times, the frail and  emaciated Olivares, lying in a fetal position, failed to recognize them. The  life-and-death battle continued for weeks, as doctors struggled to control the  meningitis so they could begin administering AZT, the AIDS drug.  </P> <P> When doctors told Olivares he had AIDS, he cried. He delayed telling even his  family the truth, but doctors convinced him that the best way to head off  criticism was to break the news himself.  </P> <P> As in previous battles, the most troubling aspect is the potential personal  rejection. "It's hard for me to say (even to hospital nurses) that I am  HIV-positive. People jump to conclusions, judgments. The stigma of AIDS, I  believe, is part of the rejection and abandonment Our Lord (went through) when  he was put on the cross. That's very real to me now." Though he flatly denies  having engaged in any sexual activity, Olivares has resigned himself to the  fact that "people will continue to speculate, no matter what I say."  </P> <P> There are small consolations. He still takes refuge in the Arvizu family,  former parishioners he has known for years. On his weekly visits to their West  Covina tract house, he is so at home that he scavenges the refrigerator for  snacks and naps while watching television in the family den. It's a large,  fun-loving family with three children and eight grandchildren. They are among  the few allowed to glimpse the guileless, playful and easily hurt man who hides  behind the imposing public persona. With them, he shares his childlike  enjoyment of Christmas preparations and the good-natured teasing of family  members. He likes nothing better, they say, than a raucous family party, where  after a few drinks, he can belt out his favorite Mexican country ballads.  </P> <P> What has him stymied is the uncertainty and unpredictability of his illness,  and the conflict between his desire to work and the doctor's vague admonition  "not to overdo it." He hears accounts from other AIDS patients who have  returned to normal lives only to be struck down again. He has yet to decide  exactly how to live out the time left to him.  </P> <P> He has lost interest in many things he used to care about -- especially  discussions about the future. Recently, at a meeting to discuss the financial  future of the order, Olivares found his only concern was how the changes might  affect his medical care.  </P> <P> The uncontrollable self-preoccupation is terrible, he says. But it has led him  to put his house in order. He gave most of his clothes and books away as well  as dozens of religious statues and medals.  </P> <P> Similarly, he has undertaken a spiritual housecleaning of sorts. "The Lord has  given me notice so I have enough time to re-establish my priorities as a  religious person." But he admits that serious reflection is difficult for a man  who has lived by the axiom that work is his prayer. The impulse to be involved  remains strong; slowly he has resumed making public appearances. And he has  begun exploring the possibility of returning to work at a parish. "I would like  to be available to people," he says.  </P> <P> He is not afraid of death, he says again: "Life is worth living.

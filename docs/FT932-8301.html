			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (7): World glut hits kiwi-growers - The reasons for the fall in fruit exports THE OUTLOOK for Chilean fruit exports has become less sunny after a decade of spectacular growth. Rising protectionist sentiment and the emergence of new competitors have combined with last year's strong peso and lower international prices to place unaccustomed pressures on the industry. The European Community has moved to curb imports of apples following a good growing season. In addition, tumbling prices for kiwi-fruit, due to a worldwide glut, have hit Chilean growers hard. Fruit exports, which constitute about a tenth of Chile's exports, slipped 2.3 per cent to Dollars 938m in the first 11 months of last year, according to the Central Bank. By volume, fruit exports from September 1992 to March 18 this year grew a modest 2 per cent, compared with the same period of the previous season, according to the Chilean Exporters Association. Shipments to the EC fell 10.1 per cent, hit by the introduction of a licensing system in February aimed at protecting European apple growers. While the problems over apples may prove a short-lived result of the good European season, the difficulties of Chile's kiwi-fruit growers are more intractable. 'The market cannot consume all the kiwi-fruit being produced. This is now a world problem,' says Mr Ricardo Ariztia, president of the Federation of Chilean Fruit Producers (Fedefruta). Of the major producers - Chile, New Zealand, Italy and the US - one country will lose out heavily, according to Mr Ariztia. 'New Zealand and Chile is the big commercial fight. Some of our kiwi growers will undoubtedly go out of business,' he says. Chile has planted about 12,000 hectares with kiwis. South Africa's re-emergence in international markets has added to these woes. The country shares the same growing season as Chile, as do emerging competitors elsewhere in Latin America, such as Argentina and Brazil. 'Last year we lost out in the German market competing against South African fruit,' says Mr Ariztia. He cites South Africa's high quality control and standardised packaging as posing the biggest threat to Chilean growers. Argentina, according to Mr Armen Kouyoumdjian, an independent economic consultant, 'is a sleeping giant. When it gets its act together it could compete very effectively against Chilean fruitgrowers.' These challenges take place against a background of continuing tensions between Chile's exporters - dominated by multinational companies - and the growers, often small, under-capitalised operators. The biggest bone of contention is the 'free consignment' market system, under which growers hand over their produce to the exporters, not knowing what price they will eventually get after the fruit is sold on. 'We believe the final price we receive can be improved,' says Mr Ariztia. Some growers have started to export direct, so far with very modest amounts of fruit, to circumvent the exporter companies. In turn, the multinationals have been buying agricultural land themselves in a bid to integrate their operations. Yet, in the face of these internal tensions and mounting external compeition, the mood in the industry remains optimistic, if concerned. 'The market for Chilean fruit is not saturated,' says Mr Ronald Bown, president of the Chilean Exporters Association. 'This is a special year and we expect to overcome many of the problems that are facing us.' Both growers and exporters are seeking to move to a mandatory system of quality control and to standardise packaging and box sizes. Almost all Chile's major fruit export companies have their own quality certification units. About 70 per cent of exports are self-inspected with only the remainder looked at by third parties. 'We must work very fast on these issues. But I hope we can reach agreement on mandatory quality control and packaging standardisation with the exporters by next season,' says Mr Ariztia. The industry is also boosting its promotional activities. The exporters have earmarked Dollars 3m for promotion in Europe in 1994, and are working on a long-term marketing plan for the US. 'The EC and the US are still the most promising markets for us and will probably remain so for around the next 10 years,' says Mr Bown. Fruit and vegetable exports to Latin America soared 48 per cent in the growing season to mid-March, from an admitedly low base, helped by a free-trade agreement with Mexico. A similar agreement with Venezuela at the beginning of April and a planned deal with Colombia should also help develop this market. Longer term, Chile is hoping for great things from Asia. The exporters association is looking for a way into the coveted Japanese market, with its strict quarantine rules against agricultural imports, and expects to enter the Korean market in the next four to five years. 'We have to work with imagination and intelligence - exporters, growers and government together,' says Mr Ariztia. 'The industry is not going to grow at 10 per cent a year any more, but we still have a big contribution to make to this country.'</p>

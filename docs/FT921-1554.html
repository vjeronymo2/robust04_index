			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Arts: Leonardo the magnificent LEONARDO AND VENICE Sponsored by Fiat Palazzo Grassi until July 5 This year, through the early summer, the Palazzo Grassi, Fiat's cultural institute on the Grand Canal at Venice, offers us an art historical and aesthetic treat. Leonardo &amp; Venice (until July 5: sponsored by Fiat) is a sustained attempt to see him not as the profound and unique master, sui generis, which is how he is customarily regarded, but set rather into the proper working context of his time. As such it immediately breaks new ground and could hardly be more important, for all that it leaves the visitor not unconvinced but as tantalised as ever. The questions pour in. Why Leonardo and Venice: why not Florence, most obvious all; why not Milan, Rome, France? Leonardo was born in 1452 and died in 1519, yet beyond the well established framework his life remains a shadowy and uncertain affair. Details, circumstances, movements emerge elliptically here and there, by chance reference, a note here, pure surmise there. We know that he travelled widely, especially during his first long period at the Sforza court at Milan, from 1482 until 1499. Yet we are certain of only one visit to Venice, of three months early in 1500. The choice of Venice, therefore, may be one more of opportunity than priority, yet in the event it proves entirely justified. There is an important group of drawings by Leonardo in the collections of the Accademia at Venice. How they came to be in Venice in the first place is uncertain. Were they left by the master himself, fragments scattered around the studios he worked in or visited in his brief stay, to be collected later? Whatever the case, they had not been shown before in an international context. Here they are set out in the themes into which they naturally fall - adorations, military studies, the proportions of the figure, studies for the Last Supper, Madonnas, heads, grotesques - and, for the first time, compared directly with works from the worlds's principal Leonardo collections, most notable of all the Royal Collection at Windsor. Insensibly, with the presentation of each theme, so the broader implications are registered, the connections made which the second half of the exhibition proposes and explores. One commentator in the wonderfully exhaustive and exhausting catalogue - for it is nearly two inches thick - supposes those three months in 1500 too short a time in which to come to terms with the richness and complexity of Venetian art. Perhaps so, but there was rather less of it then than now - no Titian as yet, no Tintoretto, no Veronese, and no San Giorgio in its present state, no Redentore, no Salute. Leonardo was a remarkable man and already a celebrity, and commonsense suggests he would have the freedom of the place to see what he wanted to see, meet whom he wished to meet. The questions begged are what he knew if it already, of Bellini in particular, and what was known of him, that would affect the rising generation of Giorgione, Sebastiano and the precocious Titian. Can it really have been so, that Leonardo, with all his natural curiosity, made only the one visit to that magical city? The exigencies of travel in the late quattrocento notwithstanding, Milan was not so very far away. His schemes for the hydraulic defences of the Veneto presuppose a certain familiarity with local resources and terrain. The magnificent equestrian monument to Colleoni by Verrocchio, the master in whose studio he had worked and studied in the 1470s, completed but uncast before his death, had been set up before the great church of SS Giovanni e Paolo in 1496, where it still stands. Certainly the progress of Leonardo's great mural painting of the Last Supper was monitored through the later 1490s far beyond Milan, and at Venice curiously it is in sculpture quite as much as in painting that the reference is made apparent. The Ca' d'Oro relief attributed to the studio of Tullio Lombardo is an almost direct transliteration into stone of the central group of figures in the composition. And Lombardo's exquisite pair of heads in bas-relief, from Vienna, clearly casts that mood of gentle, almost elegiac ecstasy so characteristic of Leonardo's adoring Madonnas. It is perhaps too fanciful to sense, in return, in the general composition of the Last Supper, with its high and frontal presentation, a formal echo of the high stage-like chancel of Pietro Lombardo's Santa Maria dei Miracoli, finished in 1489. It is upon this quality of mood, atmosphere and emotion, intangible at the best of times, that the question of Leonardo's lasting influence upon Venetian painting would seem to rest. In particular it rests upon the equally shadowy and debatable figure of Giorgione, who held the pass between Bellini and Titian, and died too young. Leonardo had nothing technical to teach such a master as Bellini, yet is it entirely true that Bellini's work lacks the emotional force that Leonardo was able to pass on to the younger man? Bellini's work can be as moving as anything of anyone's, as his Madonna with St Catherine and the Magdalen here clearly proves, yet the emotional force is contained, implicit, contemplative rather than openly expressive. With Leonardo comes something more actively emotional and expressive which, being more active, brings with it a sense of realism that, within the context of Italian art, is quite new. And to move on from Bellini and Leonardo to Giorgione's extraordinary painting of la Vecchia, an ageing woman, worn out by work but not yet ravaged by age, is to confront one of the first great images of the modern era. We look on, suddenly, to Velasquez, Goya, Gericault, Degas . . . Such is the Maniera Moderna of Venice and Leonardo around 1500, albeit not quite the modern manner the renaissance scholar might choose to admit.</p>

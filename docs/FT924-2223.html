			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Letter: Low gas prices a loss leader? Sir, The report by Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, into the 'dash for gas' misses one important possibility. It is common practice for a new supplier aiming to establish a new market to lower prices as a loss leader. The gas industry is offering lower prices now but is unlikely to be able to sustain them. If this has the effect of knocking most of the coal-based competition so much the better for the new supplier. However, the long-term effect will be to increase both electricity and gas prices. There is no sign Prof Littlechild has taken this into account. His evidence should therefore be treated with considerable caution. Roger Backhouse, 112 Thorold Road, Ilford, Essex IG1 4EY</p>

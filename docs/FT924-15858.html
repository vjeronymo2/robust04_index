			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / US purchasing managers' indexdives to 49% A PLUNGE in the purchasing managers' index, a closely watched indicator of US business conditions, yesterday heightened speculation that the Federal Reserve may soon be forced to cut interest rates again to stop the economy sliding back into semi-recession. The index fell 4.7 points to 49 per cent last month, taking it below the psychologically weighty 50 per cent level for the first time since January. A level below 50 per cent indicates the manufacturing sector is contracting. The decline - much sharper than expected decline - mainly reflected heightened pessimism about the outlook for US industrial orders. Separately, the Commerce Department reported a 0.8 per cent decline in construction spending in August, the largest monthly decline since November 1991 when a full-blown recession was under way. Claims for state unemployment insurance jumped 15,000 to 429,000 - far above the levels normally consistent with economic recovery. The bleak figures - which followed recent reports of sharp declines in home sales, consumer confidence, industrial orders and personal incomes  - prompted a sharp gain in bond prices on anticipation of another easing move by the Fed. They also left analysts apprehensive before the release today of an employment report that could dent President George Bush's re-election hopes. Most analysts anticipate a politically embarrassing rise in the unemployment rate, now 7.6 per cent nationally, perhaps into double digits in some depressed states such as California. Non-farm employment is expected to fall by about 75,000, after a big drop last month, although the figures will be distorted by the ending of a temporary federal summer jobs programme. A sharp decline in employment could spark another interest rate cut, although the Fed will be wary of cutting the discount rate, now 3 per cent, for fear of undermining the dollar. Many analysts, however, believe the Fed may signal a quarter-point cut to 2.75 per cent in the federal funds rate in the next few days. The most worrying aspect of the purchasing managers' report was a collapse in the component of the index measuring the strength of new orders. This fell from 59.8 per cent in August to 49.6 per cent last month. Mr Robert Bretz, purchasing managers spokesman, said the plunge indicated the 'manufacturing sector could no longer sustain growth.' The 'economic malaise will likely continue,' he predicted.</p>

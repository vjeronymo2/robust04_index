			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): When a gift is taxable - Briefcase I own a half share in a plot of land leased to a petrol company, on which it built a petrol station 30 years ago. Eight years of the lease remain. If I were to give my share (value Pounds 70,000) to my two nieces, would I be liable to pay capital gains tax immediately on valuation? Or am I correct in thinking that this can be put off so long as my nieces do not sell the property? And is there any top limit to the value of a gift? You can make gifts of any value without inheritance tax being payable if you survive for seven years from the date of giving. There is no limit to potentially-exempt transfers, which become fully exempt after seven years. You are correct in your concern over CGT. You are gifting an investment and CGT could be payable. It is not possible to defer tax if your nieces do not sell the property, as it is not possible to obtain hold-over relief on the gift of an investment. If there is likely to be a large CGT liability, you could consider putting the assets into a discretionary trust as a gift for the benefit of your two nieces, so that hold-over relief is available. While this gift would fall within your nil rate band, this band would become available again in full after seven years. Within the next 10 years, the assets could be transferred out of the trust to your nieces, or the trust could be changed so that it became a life interest trust; IHT could be avoided in this way. I suggest, however, that you take legal advice if you wish to pursue this matter further and contact your accountant regarding the likely CGT which could be involved.

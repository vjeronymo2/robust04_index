			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Markets: Savers need a new economic policy, too - Serious Money THE BASE RATE cut may be good news for mortgage payers but it represents another blow to those savers who keep all their cash in the building society. As banks and building societies cut their rates over the next few weeks, many savers may see their gross rates fall below 7 per cent. For a top rate taxpayer, that may mean a net return of 4 per cent, scarcely ahead of inflation. 'Building society investors are being squeezed at both ends with their incomes falling and the real value of their capital still being eroded by inflation,' says Clive Scott Hopkins, of Towry Law. With some predicting that base rates may need to fall to 6 per cent if the government is to have any hope of reviving the economy, the problems for savers are set to grow. For many, this is a culture shock. Building societies have offered very attractive rates over the past few years and savers have been able to ignore the alternatives, especially as shares have effectively gone nowhere since July 1987. However, if they want to avoid a drop in their standard of living, savers are going have to consider some wider choices. One simple and relatively secure option is suggested by James Higgins, of financial advisers Chamberlain de Broe. He suggests that small savers with Pounds 15,000 should keep Pounds 5,000 on deposit and place Pounds 10,000 in index-linked National Savings certificates, which offer a tax-free return of around 4.5 per cent plus inflation if held for five years. Investors can then run down their deposits at a rate of over Pounds 1,100 a year. Since they are eating up their capital, this income will be mostly tax-free. After five years, if inflation has averaged 4.5 per cent, then the certificates will have grown sufficiently to repay the original Pounds 15,000 of capital. Another relatively secure investment field for those who need income is gilts. Many are priced above face value (and thus offer the investors the prospect of capital loss). But although gilt prices rose 1 1/2 points yesterday some still offer yields of nearly 9 per cent, which could look a very handy return in six months. Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, says that the base rate cut 'doesn't much alter our medium term view that bonds and bond funds are still attractive. We also like the permanent interest bearing shares (PIBs) issued by building societies and some of the zero dividend preference shares issued by investment trusts.' Clive Scott Hopkins says the answer for savers must be to move into gilts and to start moving into shares. He favours three products: a Generali Lifetime Income Bond, which pays 8.5 per cent net, and is linked to War Loan; Barclays Sterling Bond Fund, based in Jersey, which invests in gilts and Eurobonds and pays income gross; and with profits bonds, where some companies are currently offering 9 per cent. It is pretty difficult to set hard and fast guidelines for savers, if only because government policy seems to change from day to day. After all, base rates are now almost half the 15 per cent level which the chancellor planned to impose on Black Wednesday, only a month ago. But the saver needs to stand back from the current turbulence to get the right perspective. Only a few weeks ago, Britain's membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism seemed to indicate that the country had entered an era of low inflation, low growth and low interest rates. Now everything has changed. Whether the devaluation of sterling will lead to inflation depends on which economist you ask. In the short term, there are strong deflationary forces at work; but the recent surge in index-linked gilt prices indicates that many investors feel inflation will eventually rebound. The government is certainly under immense political pressure to abandon its strong anti-inflationary stance and concentrate on dragging the economy out of recession. In other words, we may be returning to old-fashioned British stop-go economics. And past experience has shown that, over the long term, shares have been the best performers in those conditions. So the smart investor cannot afford to ignore equities altogether. Shares offer the prospect of capital gain (which still has tax advantages for the vast majority) and rising income over the long term. Building societies offer neither. Although the arguments about whether shares are cheap today are complex (see Page III), investors should consider how they can gradually build up an equity component of their portfolios. Relying on the building society alone can damage your wealth.</p>

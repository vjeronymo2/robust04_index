			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- Members of the National  Alliance for Democracy and Reunification (Chongukyonhap) and the  South Korean Federation of General Student Councils  (Hanchongnyon), more than 4,000 in all, held an all-people  memorial service for those who fell while fighting for the  nation and democracy at the amphitheatre of the Hanyang  University on June 11, a Seoul-based radio reported.    In his opening address, Yi Chang-pok, permanent chairman of  Chongukyonhap, charged that "the present Kim Yong-sam  `government' is totally blocking democratisation and  reunification" and called for an all-people movement to check  "the parliamentary ratification of the final act of the Uruguay  Round world trade accord" and demanded a peaceful solution to  the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula.    Then, a rally marking the June resistance anniversary was  held to inherit the spirit of the martyrs.    The ralliers vowed to fulfil the tasks to realise a genuine  democracy and independent reunification on the occasion of the  7th anniversary of the resistance.</p>

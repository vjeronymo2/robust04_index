			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALESA IS SWORN IN, PLEDGES TO PRESS REFORMS  </P> <P> Lech Walesa was sworn in Saturday as president of Poland, capping a decade-long  struggle by the Solidarity movement, under his leadership, to drive the  Communists from power.  </P> <P> Walesa, 47, immediately establishing a tone of presidential confidence, pledged  to press on with Poland's economic reforms, promising to continue  decentralization so that "as many decisions as possible are made at the grass  roots."  </P> <P> In a move that is certain to please Poland's international creditors and  economic advisers, Walesa also pledged to continue a "modified version" of the  economic reforms launched by Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, widely  credited for moving Poland far ahead of its East European neighbors, all  struggling to overcome 45 years of Communist central planning.  </P> <P> The swearing-in ceremonies were held before a packed session of Parliament.  </P> <P> Conspicuously absent was the outgoing president, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, a  former Communist Party leader whose declaration of martial law in 1981 cracked  down on Solidarity and resulted in a yearlong detention for Walesa. Jaruzelski  was not invited to the ceremony.  </P> <P> Walesa, a former shipyard electrician born of peasants and educated in a trade  school for mechanics, wore a formal blue suit for the occasion and, as always,  wore a pin of the Black Madonna of Czestochowa, a holy symbol, on his lapel.  His wife, Danuta, the mother of their eight children, stood at his side. He  reminded Poles that he is the first directly elected president in the country's  history.  </P> <P> "The evil era when the authorities of our country were appointed under pressure  of foreigners or as the result of forced compromises is ending," he said.  </P> <P> "Today we are making a significant step on a long and bloody road to  reconstruction of our independence."  </P> <P> Walesa offered what could be taken as a brief sketch of his foreign policy  horizons, noting historical connections with Poland's neighbors, pointedly  omitting any direct reference to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "Independent Poland wants to be an element of the peaceful order in Europe. It  wants to be a good neighbor. Centuries of mutual history link us with the  Ukraine, Byelorussia and Lithuania. This applies also to Germany, in which we  want to see a friendly gate to Europe. Being culturally connected with the  West, we simultaneously want to build a spirit of sympathy and cooperation in  our relations with Russia. But we are aware that only a reformed and  economically strong Poland will be an equal partner for others."  </P> <P> About a third of the new president's brief inaugural address dealt with  economic issues, which were key in his campaign for the presidency against  defeated Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who watched the proceedings from  the Parliament gallery.  </P> <P> Walesa's campaign criticism of Mazowiecki seemed at times to cut in two  directions at once, as Walesa argued that reforms were too harsh to ordinary  working Poles but that the changes were also moving too slowly.  </P> <P> In the days since his election, however, he has appeared committed to speeding  up change, a theme that ran strongly through his speech Saturday.  </P> <P> "Poland has achieved much" during its year under Mazowiecki, he said. "Today,  the nation expects from us even more -- it expects changes in economic policy  and the manner of ruling. The attitude of millions of voters was unequivocal  about that. Our reforms must unfold more quickly and more skillfully. . . .  </P> <P> "Universal privatization is an equally huge task. Poland should become a nation  of owners. Everyone can and should become an owner of a part of the nation's  property, part of our homeland. This is the simplest, time-tested road to  responsibility. Only in this way can we multiply our prosperity and teach  ourselves economy."  </P> <P> Walesa has delayed choosing a prime minister until after the holidays and has  run into problems finding a leader for a government that might serve only until  parliamentary elections, scheduled for the spring. Some potential candidates  withdrew when told that Balcerowicz would continue to hold sweeping authority  over economic matters.  </P> <P> Insiders now say that Balcerowicz himself is Walesa's leading candidate to  become the prime minister.  </P> <P> Walesa is still considering whether to postpone the parliamentary elections for  a year -- to give a new government time to establish itself -- or to go forward  with the elections as scheduled.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONEY TALK: HOW TO OBTAIN PRIVATE LETTER RULING FROM IRS  </P> <P> Q: My wife and I have a financial situation that we believe conforms to the  facts covered in a private letter ruling received by another set of taxpayers.  We would like a similar decision and have been advised that we need to get our  own private ruling. How do we do this? Is there a specific form that the  Internal Revenue Service provides? Does an attorney have to handle this or can  we do it ourselves? -- J.F.S.  </P> <P> A: The IRS does not provide a specific form. The process you must follow to get  a private letter ruling is spelled out in various "Revenue Procedures," a  regular feature in the IRS's Cumulative Bulletin, a weekly publication  available in most law libraries. Typically, the first revenue procedure  published each year lists the necessary information.  </P> <P> However, there is more. Depending on the type of ruling you want, you must  submit supporting documents and materials that deal with your particular issue.  These are published in yet other Cumulative Bulletins. Some of these bulletins  could be a few years old; some will be recent. The revenue procedure that  applies to your case will tell you to which branch of the IRS national office  you should send your private letter ruling request. Another source of IRS  procedures is IRS Regulation 601, the statement of procedural rules.  </P> <P> Until a few years ago, the IRS did not charge for private rulings. However,  when its mailbox began bulging with requests, fees were imposed. Currently,  fees range from a few hundred dollars for determinations on simple matters to  as much as $2,500 for complex issues. A revenue procedure will list the fee. In  addition, there are attorney fees to consider.  </P> <P> Could you handle this by yourself? Possibly. But it might be time-consuming and  complicated. However, if you know that the IRS has already issued a private  letter ruling similar to one that you want, your task could be easier. You  would be wise to submit a copy of the first ruling with the other materials  required.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Widower Can Take One-Time Exemption  </P> <P> Q: My wife and I owned our home as joint tenants between 1959 and her death in  1982. I took sole title to the house in 1987. I sold it in 1990. I am 67. My  understanding is that I am not eligible for the $125,000 one-time exemption on  the profit from the sale because my wife, having died eight years ago, did not  satisfy the requirement of living in the house for three of the last five  years. But it didn't really matter because I bought a new house for much more.  But now, will I be able to take advantage of the exemption when I sell the new  house? My deceased spouse obviously does not satisfy the holding and use  requirement. -- R.T.P.  </P> <P> A: First, you could have taken advantage of the profit exemption this year when  you sold your house, even if your deceased wife could not meet the eligibility  requirements. She didn't have to -- only you did. The same applies to your  current house. So long as you meet the requirements -- you are at least 55, you  have lived in the house three of the last five years and the house is your  principal residence -- you are entitled to it.  </P> <P> One caveat: If you remarry and your new wife has already taken advantage of the  exemption -- it doesn't matter if it was with another spouse -- your  eligibility is lost.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Real Estate Can Be Considered a Gift  </P> <P> Q: I own property in New Hampshire. My uncle owns 10 acres adjacent to mine and  is considering selling it. He has agreed to give me approximately 0.6 acres as  a buffer zone. One acre has been appraised at $15,000, which is considerably  more than the property was worth when he inherited it from our grandfather. Can  land be considered a gift and given tax-free if it is valued at less than  $10,000? Do I have to pay any tax other than increased property taxes to the  county? What is the paperwork needed to handle this transaction? -- D.E.D.  </P> <P> A: Yes, land can be given as a gift if it meets the gift-tax value standards.  And with only one exception, your uncle will not be required to pay capital  gains on the property, despite its considerable appreciation. The only  exception would crop up if your uncle passed on debt with the property that  exceeded his tax basis in it.  </P> <P> Here's how that situation might work: Let's say that when the donor (your  uncle) originally got the property from your grandfather, it was worth $500 per  acre. As the land appreciated, your uncle mortgaged it to the tune of $10,000  per acre. If he owes more than $500 per acre on the land when he gives it to  you -- and you agree to assume the debt -- the donor is considered to have a  taxable gain to the extent that the debt he passes on exceeds his taxable basis  in the property.  </P> <P> Regardless of what happens to the donor, you have no income tax obligation to  the federal government. To complete the transaction, you can simply file a  grant deed in the local New Hampshire county recorder's office, detailing the  legal description of the property that is being given to you. You do not need  to note the gift on your income tax filing.  </P> <P> Last week's column on Social Security benefits available to divorced spouses  left the wrong impression about a divorced spouse's eligibility for full  widow's or widower's benefits upon the death of the wage earner. A divorced  spouse may begin drawing benefits at 60, but he or she will receive only 71.5%  of what the wage earner would have received. The percentage increases gradually  until it hits 100% when the ex-spouse reaches 65.  </P></p>

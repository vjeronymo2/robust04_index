			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: AH Ball shares drop 30p after warning on profits SHARES IN AH Ball Group fell by 30p to 75p yesterday after the civil engineer issued a warning on trading results for the year. Mr Tom Austin, chairman, said that as a result of deteriorating trading conditions during the six months to March 31, the optimism expressed in the interim report had proved unfounded. Order awards had been delayed or cancelled and the group had experienced a serious decline in the volume of work being executed within the AH Ball &amp; Co period schedule maintenance contracts. That, linked with an expected 3 per cent fall in gross margins and reduced interest receivable, was likely to result in the outcome for the whole of the current year showing little or no improvement on the Pounds 407,000 achieved in the six months to September 30 1992. In the last full year pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 960,000. Mr Austin added that trading conditions for the coming year remained uncertain, although tendering levels for specific contracts were currently higher than in recent years. From December 1992 to February 1993 the group had received about Pounds 3m of new orders, of which about Pounds 1m related to KD Process International, the maker of process control systems for the water industry which AH Ball acquired last July. Cash balances at March 31 were expected to remain satisfactory. However, Mr Austin said the directors anticipated cutting the final dividend to 3.3p (4.8p). The group transferred from the USM last August.</p>

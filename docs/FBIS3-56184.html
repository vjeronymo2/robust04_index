			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Ground Rent Instead of Profits Tax?"] </F>   [Text] Petr Filippov, head of the presidential  administration's analytical center for socioeconomic policy,  supports the idea of fundamental reform of the tax system.    The idea was voiced by participants in an economic  conference  of scientific and business circles.    "I am in favor of switching to taxation of natural resources  and using ground rent instead of stifling taxes on profits and  wages," P. Filippov said. However, some other proposals made  during the conference "create a complex impression," he said.  In particular, in P. Filippov's opinion, the proposal from one  of the conference organizers, the economist Sergey Glazyev, for  a "compulsory freeze on amortization payments" would ruin  enterprises.    The head of the presidential administration's analytical  center is also worried by the "talk about enforced vertical  integration of industry." "We had this with ministries and  departments. If we want to create viable financial and  industrial complexes, they must develop from the mutual  interests of the participants and not according to the will of  state officials," he said.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Electricity dips after job provisions Heavy provisions for redundancies were behind a dip in profits at Yorkshire Electricity last year. But the Leeds-based distributor said that the underlying business was strong and growing, and raised its dividend by 15 per cent. Pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 were Pounds 149m, a drop of 4.7 per cent. The figure included a Pounds 43.5m exceptional for rationalisation costs through to 1997, by when the company expects to have shed 1,000 jobs in addition to the 632 lost last year. There was also a Pounds 17.4m provision for writing off the investment in Homepower, its joint electrical retailing venture with East Midlands Electricity which has been in severe difficulty. Without these exceptionals profits would have amounted to Pounds 210m before tax, a gain of 21 per cent. Mr John Tysoe, chairman, said: 'I am fully convinced that we are pursuing a well balanced strategy which focuses on the efficiency of our core business and the development of related activities.' Before exceptionals, the electricity distribution business increased profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 162m, with units rising 2.1 per cent. On the same pre-exceptionals basis supply profits rose 84 per cent to Pounds 20.6m. Pre-exceptional controllable costs fell 5.3 per cent to Pounds 223m as the restructuring began to bite. Yorkshire's share of Homepower's losses was Pounds 5m. Mr Malcolm Chatwin, chief executive, said that new plans for the business were being prepared. 'It needs to be bigger,' he said. In other sectors, Yorkshire made Pounds 11.4m from power generation and Pounds 400,000 from its gas business. The company expects to be making a Pounds 160m investment for a 17 per cent share of Stockholm Energi, the Swedish utility. Mr Chatwin said that Sweden met the company's criteria of growth, market liberalisation and stability, and presented opportunities that were not available in the oversupplied UK market. Earnings per share dipped 4 per cent to 51.5p. The final dividend is 16.58p, making a total of 23.48p, covered 3.4 times by earnings excluding exceptionals. COMMENT Yorkshire, once the sector darling, has slipped to become one of its highest yielding stocks. Analysts were divided yesterday over whether the results displayed weakness or strength. The exceptionals were large and perhaps belated, but at least Yorkshire is getting to grips with its costs. The Swedish venture is unusual and expensive but it could yield useful upside.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN OF WAR ON MISSION OF PEACE  </P> <P> Nine young people from Children of War, a youth leadership group with chapters  in 15 U.S. cities, visited John Muir High School in Pasadena Monday and  Tuesday. They were among 48 youths from war-torn countries, refugee communities  and U.S. inner cities who are touring the country to tell their stories.  </P> <P> The tour, which began March 17 and ends today, includes youths from Northern  Ireland, Lebanon, Israel, South Africa and Cambodia. In all, 15 Children of War  representatives are visiting the Los Angeles area. Pasadena is the only San  Gabriel Valley stop on their tour. Other young people from the organization are  speaking in Boston and New York.  </P> <P> "It makes me feel proud I have the freedom I have," remarked Muir ninth-grader  Herbie Judware, after hearing 14-year-old Margaret Leosevich of Chernobyl,  Byelorussia, talk about the nuclear accident and government restrictions in the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Children of War was created in 1984 by the New York-based interfaith Religious  Task Force. Its members are between the ages of 15 and 22. The nonprofit group  paid round-trip travel expenses for the 20 young people who traveled to America  for the speaking tour, and is picking up tour-related expenses for the 28  others. The youths receive no compensation, but Children of War organizers say  their programs give the young people "incredible leadership training."  </P> <P> "Everyone is scared out of their wits at the growth of drug and gang problems,  and the general despair and alienation of our young people," said the Rev. Paul  Mayer, the task force's director, in explaining why the program is welcomed in  schools and communities. Children of War will be following up on the tour with  leadership training workshops at each of the sites visited.  </P></p>

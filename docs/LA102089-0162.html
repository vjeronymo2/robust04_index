			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE SEEK INFORMATION ON ELDERLY MISSING  MAN  </P> <P> Glendora police are seeking information from the public that might help them  find an 81-year-old Glendora man who has Alzheimer's disease, and who has been  missing since Oct. 6.  </P> <P> Ulysses Sheridan Stanton wandered away from his Wabash Street home wearing a  white straw hat with a red hat band, a pale green silk shirt with a navy blue  neck tie, blue pants and a charcoal colored suit coat. He also had on brown  dress shoes, said his daughter, Betty Millican.  </P> <P> "He usually doesn't go anywhere by himself," Millican said. "He walked out the  door while my mom was making him lunch. He sometimes gets confused and doesn't  know where he is when he is in the driveway."  </P> <P> Stanton usually goes by the name Stan, Millican said, but he often does not  remember his name or his family. He is 5-feet-7, weighs 150 pounds, has white  hair and hazel eyes. He also has burn scars on his arms, hands, lower face and  ears, Millican said. Stanton had surgery for throat cancer a week before the  disappearance and is supposed to be on medication, she said.  </P> <P> Anyone who has seen Stanton should call the Glendora police at (818) 914-8250.  </P></p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Observer: Silver dollars It is not every day that someone dumps 622 tonnes of silver - or, if some bullion traders are to be believed, perhaps even twice that amount. But dealers with long memories may reflect that their lives were disrupted some years ago when the very same National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia offloaded 100 tonnes of gold. The gold sale was hailed as a shrewd move by Khalid Bin Mahfouz, the bank's operating officer, who switched into US dollars and made a subsequent packet as the rate rose. Mahfouz, who now finds himself indicted in the US for his part in the BCCI affair, is no stranger to the bullion markets and was one of the players invited to join in Nelson Bunker Hunt's ambitious plan to corner the silver market in the late 1970s. Hunt wanted Mahfouz and Ghaith Pharaon, another Arab closely connected to BCCI, to join in his scheme. Pharaon demurred but Mahfouz started buying enthusiastically and lost Dollars 600m when the scheme backfired and the price of silver plummeted. Three years ago he had a bad car accident in Jeddah which left him badly injured, though he has continued to play a central role in the bank's affairs - as, indeed, in those of the kindgom itself.</p>

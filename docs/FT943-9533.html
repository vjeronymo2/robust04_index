			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Canada Toronto closed mixed after moderate trading, although the key composite index was boosted into positive territory by a modest late-afternoon rally. The TSE 300 composite index finished 11.5 firmer at 4,186.8, but declining issues outnumbered advances by 389 to 338. Volume amounted to 62.6m shares valued at CDollars 719m. Nine of the 14 sub-indices gained ground, led by transportation, up 1.7 per cent. Lac Minerals recommended that its shareholders reject a takeover offer from American Barrick, but said it will examine a revised offer from Royal Oak Mines before making a recommendation on that bid. Lac shed CDollars  3/8 to CDollars 14 1/4 , American Barrick was unchanged at CDollars 30 5/8 and Royal Oak hardened CDollars  1/8 to CDollars 5 5/8 .</p>

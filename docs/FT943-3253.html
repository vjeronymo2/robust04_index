			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / World Trade News: EU power struggle makes Gatt approval another cliffhanger - Uruguay Round ratification Just as prospects of swift congressional approval of the Uruguay Round are starting to brighten in Washington, the fate of the world trade deal faces another cliffhanger in Brussels. EU efforts to endorse the round in time to bring it into effect on schedule at the start of next year are threatened by a internal power struggle. Unless the row can be defused in the next three weeks, EU ratification could face indefinite delays, even deadlock. 'Time is very short. Any slippage means things risk going completely off the rails,' says one European trade policy expert. Prolonged uncertainty could not only prevent the EU from acting in time to implement the deal and set up the new World Trade Organisation. It could also reduce the impetus for swift ratification in other member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, is sufficiently worried to have visited Brussels this week to urge the EU to set aside its internal differences and make approving the round its top priority. In contrast to the US, where some in Congress oppose the deal, there is widespread support for it in the EU Council of Ministers, the European parliament and national legislatures, all of which will be involved in ratification. The problem arises from a dispute between the European Commission and the Council over the legal basis on which the deal should be approved. Because of the wrangle, the Commission has yet to submit a legislative text to the Council. The Commission argues it should be ratified under those articles of the Rome and Maastricht treaties that give it exclusive authority to negotiate on trade. That is disputed by most member governments, led by France - increasingly suspicious of the Commission and resentful of farm trade concessions made by Brussels in Gatt negotiations last year. They object that the Commission's existing authority does not extend to the Uruguay Round's ground-breaking agreements in areas such as services and intellectual property rights, and that these require another legal basis. Last spring, the Commission asked the European Court to clarify the legal situation. It is particularly worried that continuing confusion could undermine EU participation in the Gatt and the WTO, the more powerful body due to succeed it at the start of next year. Some senior Commission officials now say involving the court was a tactical error. However, a spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, the trade commissioner, said: 'We are not trying to take away sovereignty from member states. We just want an amicable, workable arrangement.' In search of a compromise, the German presidency of the council has suggested a 'code of conduct', designed to enable the EU to continue to act as one in external trade negotiations. The code, in the process of being drafted, is expected to argue for 'mixed competence' in trade policy between Commission and member states, supported by mechanisms for resolving rows between them. The Commission says it is willing to consider the code as an alternative to a court opinion. However, Belgium and Spain, for different reasons, have expressed strong reservations about the code, which Germany is due to submit to a foreign ministers' council on October 4. That may be the last opportunity for a deal which would enable the Commission to withdraw its legal case before the court starts oral hearings on it a week later. Once in train, the court proceedings cannot be halted. If the court failed to reach a quick decision which also endorsed the Commission's position, EU ratification could drag on until after the end of the year and the legal dispute could be made still more difficult. In theory, the Council could force the issue by amending provisions in the Commission's Uruguay Round legislation with which it disagreed. However, it would have to vote unanimously and would be unlikely to win the support of Belgium, the only member state openly to support the Commission's position. It is also uncertain how such tactics would be received in the European Parliament, which must be consulted on ratification of the round. But it is unclear that even adoption of the proposed code and withdrawal of the Commission's court case would be enough to clear away the problems, in the absence of a wider agreement on the legal basis for ratification. The EU's smaller member states have been particularly adamant about the need for firm legal underpinnings, though there is still no clear consensus in the Council on what form they should take. One way in which delays could be avoided would be for all 12 national parliaments to ratify the Uruguay Round deal - as they will eventually have to do - before the end of the year. This was the solution urged in Brussels this week by Mr Sutherland, who argued that the unanimous support for the trade agreement in EU capitals meant that parliaments had every reason to endorse it swiftly. So far, however, only the British, German and Greek parliaments have ratified the deal. In several other countries, legislatures have been holding back until the rights and wrongs of the EU legal dispute are clarified.</p>

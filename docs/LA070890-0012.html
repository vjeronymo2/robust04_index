			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A VOTE FOR LA VERNE'S 'SMALL TOWN CHARACTER'  </P> <P> For those who still misunderstand the purpose of the La Verne Small Town  Preservation Committee's initiative or "Bob Mastro's" lawsuit against the  Edwards Cinema Co. and the city of La Verne (Times, March 25), let me try  again.  </P> <P> First of all, the "1,000 seat" initiative now exempts all nonprofit  organizations.  </P> <P> Secondly, the lawsuit was filed by several property owners and residents of La  Verne, not one individual alone. Third, our intention is to limit the size of  the proposed theater, not its existence.  </P> <P> Mr. Edwards personally has refused to compromise with us on the theater's size.  The proposed theater will seat 2,950 people, be 64,000 square feet in size, an  acre and a half, and be equal to a five-story building at its highest point.  </P> <P> The city of La Verne and Mr. Edwards have refused to listen to the citizens of  La Verne. If the merits of our lawsuit are unfounded, why has Judge John  Zebrowski of the L.A. Superior Court extended his stay order against the  issuance of grading and building permits for the Edwards project indefinitely?  </P> <P> Property owners within 300 feet of adjacent property to be rezoned are to be  notified by law of that pending change. I was so notified. Taxpayers should be  interested in changes which may affect them. I am.  </P> <P> Businessmen should be more than involved and concerned with business  development in their area, but also the compatibility and appropriateness of  each development in the city as a whole. I am.  </P> <P> People should be concerned for other people and with maintaining the quality of  life for all. I am.  </P> <P> Someone has to be concerned enough to fight to maintain as best as possible La  Verne's small town character. For the record, I am.  </P> <P> BOB MASTRO  </P> <P> La Verne Small Town  </P> <P> Preservation Committee  </P></p>

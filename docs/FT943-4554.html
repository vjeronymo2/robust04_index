			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: RTZ rides the cycle RTZ is not just a reflection of the commodity price cycle. What it controls it controls well. In most sectors, the group remains the lowest-cost producer. Operating margins at the bottom of the cycle were a creditable 13 per cent. These have now reached 23 per cent, an increase admittedly helped by the disposal of Pillar's rag-bag of low-margin businesses. More cost-cutting is promised. As for volume growth, RTZ continues to invest in new projects. Capital investment nearly doubled in the first half, and exploration spending on long-term projects is up two-thirds. But RTZ cannot control prices. Recent rises augur well. Since June non-ferrous metal prices have ad-vanced 16 per cent, those of copper by 23 per cent and aluminium by 18.6 per cent. Such increases have contributed heavily to the shares' advance. Less clear is whether these higher prices are sustainable. Habitually cautious RTZ managers are unusually upbeat about economic prospects. The leading economies appear to be lining up in the same direction, offering the prospect of synchronous economic growth. The danger is that the commodity market, pushed partly by speculators' hot-money, has over-anticipated the recovery. As in the plastics and paper industries, where prices have also moved forward sharply, much of the increased demand has come from restocking. If stocks fail to fall this autumn, metals prices could suffer a correction. That would knock inflationary pressures on the head. But it would also shake stocks like RTZ which have risen on expected further price rises.</p>

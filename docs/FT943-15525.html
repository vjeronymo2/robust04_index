			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Murdoch's stake in Fairfax said to be over 2% John Fairfax, the Australian publishing group, said yesterday that it believed that Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Limited, the Australian arm of News Corporation, had increased its stake and now held more than 2 per cent of Fairfax's shares. On Monday, News revealed that it bought a 1.7 per cent shareholding in Fairfax, which publishes three of Australia's leading daily newspapers, in mid-June. It made the disclosure after Fairfax had formally requested details of share trading around that date. Yesterday, Fairfax said that it had since received confirmation that additional purchases made 'in the last week or two' had gone into five nominee accounts connected to News. These further shares lifted News' stake in Fairfax - which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, Melbourne Age and Australian Financial Review newspapers - to 2.05 per cent. In addition, Fairfax said that it knew of a further block of shares bought at the end of June into an account which had previously been identified with News. However, Fairfax said it had not yet received any official confirmation that News was interested in this latest parcel of stock. If these shares do prove to be connected to News, Mr Murdoch's group would have a 2.3 per cent interest in Fairfax. The disclosures sent Fairfax shares 10 cents higher yesterday, to ADollars 2.80, in a generally falling market, as speculation over Mr Murdoch's motives and talk of a bid play starting at Fairfax continued to circulate. Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media magnate who is currently embroiled in newspaper price war with Mr Murdoch in the UK, owns almost 25 per cent of Fairfax, while Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman, has almost 15 per cent. Australian Pay Television, the consortium of media interests which was formed to pursue opportunities in the pay-TV field, announced yesterday that Network Ten, one of the country's commercial TV networks, had withdrawn from the grouping. It said that in the short to medium term Ten would still participate in the pay-TV industry by making programming available to the consortium. The consortium includes Mr Kerry Packer's leading Nine Network, Mr Rupert Murdoch's News group, and Seven Network, another commercial network, as well as Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications body. The consortium, better known as PMT after its three most powerful members, is thought to have faced internal strains recently, as its members have developed differing interests in the evolving pay-TV sector in Australia. However, it said yesterday that 'plans to established the best and most attractive pay television service . . . will not be affected by Ten's withdrawal as a shareholder'.</p>

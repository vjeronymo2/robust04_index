The Jamahiriya News Agency's international affairs editor  commented on this saying that the decision made by the British  Government exposes the true intention [word indistinct] the  British Government to escalate it with the aim of carrying out  an aggressive act against Libya and to inflict damage on its  interests. This is [word indistinct] and parcel of previous  (?attacks) carried out against Libya without regard for  international law, without regard for the truth and without  respect for the mediation which was undertaken by several  countries. They also have no consideration for the ease with  which the Great Jamahiriyah responded as well as the practical  initiatives which are sufficient for reaching the truth and  solving the problem from the very core. However, the three  Western allies decided to ignore these and failed to reconsider  their stance.    The important thing to do now is to develop the Arab  position  with the aim of having the embargo on the Great Jamahiriyah  lifted through the channels of their compatriots in the Arab  League, firstly and secondly through the Islamic Conference.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Moscow's dollar dealers raided Russian central bank officials have raided foreign exchange offices to force them to comply with regulations. Mr Victor Melnikov, head of the bank's currency control department, said the clean-up was launched because up to a third of exchange offices in Russia could be operating without permission. 'If you want to change some dollars in Moscow, it's a risky affair and you are never safe when left alone with those new businessmen who look more like criminals,' Mr Melnikov said. The central bank had checked the accounts of about 900 exchange offices in Moscow opened by 101 commercial banks. Of these, 165 offices did not correspond to 'civilised standards'.</p>

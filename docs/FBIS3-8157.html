Referring to the changes made, he emphasized that the PNTCD  views the appointment of a civilian at the helm of the Army as  inopportune and that General Niculae Spiroiu's replacement will  exert a negative effect, while the presence of Iosif Gavril  Chiuzbaian as head of the Ministry of Justice could be  beneficial.    Insofar as the replacement of the other ministers is  concerned, in the opinion of the PNTCD this looks like a change  of cadres.    Keeping the prime minister in his position, Coposu  continued,  proves that the ruling party is trying to avoid parliament  control and to postpone early elections.    In conclusion, Coposu specified that the PNTCD believes that  the reshuffle has not contributed to the consolidation of the  government nor has it ensured its stability at home and abroad.    We want to recall that Coposu made a similar statement  during  an earlier program this morning. In addition, the PNTCD leader  said that he hopes for a positive conclusion of the current  negotiations between the Social Democracy Party of Romania  [PDSR] and the other political formations, so that by the  beginning of summer a viable government may be formed that is  able to cope with the current crisis situation. If this is not  the case, then early elections are the only solution.</p>

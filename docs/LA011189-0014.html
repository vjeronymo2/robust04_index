			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEER REVIEW REVISITED  </P> <P> Even though it had sailed through the California Legislature with strong  support, Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed medical peer-review legislation last  autumn and urged further negotiations to produce a law more widely acceptable  to the professionals whom it would affect. He did the right thing, and his  proposal is being pursued.  </P> <P> This is a complex and difficult subject because of the risks of abuse. On  occasion, physicians have used peer review to exclude others who would be  competitive. There are glaring examples in which disciplinary action has been  delayed because of the unwillingness of some doctors to report incompetence on  the part of others. An effective and fair system of peer review is essential to  maintaining quality on hospital medical staffs.  </P> <P> California already has in place one of the best peer-review laws in the nation,  and it is working reasonably well. Unless a new law is adopted, however, there  is a possibility that the provisions of the state law will be preempted by  federal rules taking effect next October. Even if the federal law does not  preempt state law, it will open the way for unnecessary litigation in the  federal courts. The state will benefit from maintaining its own laws, which can  be fine-tuned in Sacramento, with disputes settled in state rather than federal  courts.  </P> <P> The California Medical Assn., representing most of the state's doctors, was the  prime mover for the legislation that the governor vetoed. The California Assn.  of Hospitals and Health Systems, which was officially neutral when the final  version of the CMA bill was adopted last fall, is convinced now that existing  case and statutory law in California is adequate. But it is open to  consultations, and agrees that the effect of the new federal law could pose  problems next October.  </P> <P> In those circumstances, representatives of both the medical association and the  hospitals and health-systems group have agreed to sit down this month and try  to work out the kind of consensus urged by the governor. That is a good  beginning.  </P> <P> It will serve at least to put aside some misunderstandings that have haunted  the medical association's bill from the start. At least some of the opposition  to it has been based on incorrect information. For example, the bill would not,  as some opponents have said, mandate that lawyers participate at each stage of  peer review. Indeed, lawyers are excluded from initial phases unless hospitals  and their medical staffs should make special provision. Many doctors are  concerned that professional medical relationships would be broken if each phase  of peer review became a legal confrontation. Provisions of the CMA bill for  discovery, setting forth what information would have to be provided to the  physicians under review, are now being refined to limit the risk that these  could be an invitation to what lawyers call fishing expeditions -- an  uncontrolled search for information. The burden of proof, which rests with the  physicians when seeking to join a medical staff but with the medical staff and  hospital when seeking to discipline an individual, seems reasonable enough. But  those who drafted the earlier legislation acknowledge its extraordinary  complexity, and that may be a cause in itself to set sights for clearer and  simpler rules.  </P> <P> The key task, it seems to us, is to preserve California's discretion over this  matter. The best way to do that is through compromise among the doctors and  hospitals so that a fair system -- but a forceful system, with protections  against abuse -- is the result.  </P></p>

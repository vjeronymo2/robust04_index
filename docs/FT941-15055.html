			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Sega plans link-up with Microsoft for new video game Sega, the Japanese group, plans a link-up with Microsoft of the US to develop an advanced video games machine in a venture with far-reaching implications for the world electronics industry. The deal could give Microsoft, which provides software for more than 90 per cent of the world's business personal computers, similar dominance in the market for home entertainment. The venture was confirmed by Sega, although Microsoft would not be drawn last night on any relationship with the Japanese group, saying reports were 'speculative'. According to Sega, the companies will co-operate on the Saturn project, a games console combining video images, stereo sound and telecommunications. Sega will make the computers and Microsoft will provide the operating software. Microsoft's software for Saturn would give the machine advanced graphics and data processing capabilities, although it would be cheaper than standard home computers. Co-operation between Microsoft and Sega could lead to a new industry standard for home entertainment software. The US company has grown to a turnover of Dollars 3.75bn (Pounds 2.53bn) in 10 years through licensing deals that put its software on every IBM and IBM clone of personal computer. The implication is that software houses developing educational and games programs might have to write their products to Microsoft's standard, just as business software developers have to work with Microsoft's MS-Dos and Windows operating system. The prospective tie-up comes as other companies in the video games, electronics and computer industries have been taking positions in preparation for what is expected to be fierce competition ahead. Nintendo of Japan and Silicon Graphics, the US company, agreed last year to co-operate in developing Nintendo's advanced games machine. Matsushita, the consumer electronics company, has brought out an advanced games machine developed by the US venture company 3DO. Sega has already formed an alliance with TeleCommunications, the US cable TV company, and entertainment group Time-Warner. Blockbuster takes stake in Virgin games subsidiary, Page 19</p>

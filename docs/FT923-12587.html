			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Observer: Don't read this The Scots are forever complaining that, when it comes to catching the attention of London-based journalists, they might as well be on the moon. But some bright spark at Scottish Life has had a good go at it - as witness yesterday's media announcement of the company's new business results for the first half of the year. 'Another Boring Bombastic Press Release from Scottish Life', it starts, and continues: 'The only possible item of interest is that most of the growth is in the single premium area, single premium personal pensions and executive pensions in particular (up 160 per cent to Pounds 89m).' Then it adds: 'Just in case anyone is remotely interested, the detailed figures are attached'. The acid test, of course, is whether the result is widespread coverage in the press at large. But, whatever the pay-off, Observer and colleagues are grateful. It makes such a change.</p>

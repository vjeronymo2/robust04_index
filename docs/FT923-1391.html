			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: British Fittings loses Pounds 1.02m BRITISH FITTINGS Group yesterday reported its second successive half yearly loss but is paying a token interim dividend as an indication that it has reached its nadir and will return to profit by the end of the year. The group, which distributes valves, tubes and fittings, manufactures and hires high pressure water products, and distributes non-ferrous metals, yesterday announced a pre-tax loss for the six months to June 30 of Pounds 1.02m compared with a profit of Pounds 1.71m in the 1991 first half. The group's position deteriorated during the second six months, however, and it posted a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.96m for the full year after heavy exceptional items relating to the cost of cutbacks and provisions for its water business hire fleet of vehicles. The latest deficit, struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 622,000 (Pounds 374,000) relating mainly to redundancies and property disposals, came on turnover reduced to Pounds 40.4m (Pounds 42m). Fully diluted losses per share were 3.48p compared with earnings of 5.37p. However, Mr Brian Stanton, chief executive, said 'the company should run into profit in the second half.' An interim dividend of 0.5p (1.375p) is declared. In July 1991 shareholders subscribed to a Pounds 7.13m rights issue aimed at reducing debt. Although gearing at the end of 1991 was announced as 61 per cent, against 77 per cent a year earlier, this figure could have been understated. Current gearing, reflecting the diminution of shareholders' funds, is 75 per cent. Problems have not been solely related to depressed markets for the group's products. It is still negotiating with insurers about compensation for thefts of Pounds 1m in its non-ferrous metals division and coping with a Fraud Squad investigation into the affair which came to light in January. It has also been coming to terms with its own internal accounting and putting in place a system which will accurately reflect the value of stocks and progress of sales. Mr Cecil Buckett, the new finance director, said the latest figures did not hide anything. But Mr Michael Borlenghi, the new non-executive chairman, pointed to illusory accounting in the past when he warned that 'the directors believe that the disclosed results for the six months ended June 1991 may not reflect a true comparison with those for the half year to June 30 1992.' The arrival of Mr Borlenghi and Mr Buckett, coupled with the decision that Mr Stanton should concentrate on his chief executive role, have been the most obvious signs of a management shake-up throughout the group.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Back to the future Distress feeds on distress in financial markets. The FT-SE 100's 74-point fall yesterday undoubtedly stemmed from the fall of over two points in the gilts market, which itself can be traced back to worries about US bonds. Whether there is much logic to these movements is another matter. There was not much cash selling in UK markets, where the falls were largely futures driven. There could be any number of reasons for the futures pressure. That the market is reduced to guessing is testimony both to the worrying lack of transparency of derivatives as well as to their destabilising power. The fundamentals do not indicate great need for alarm. Equities may have been trading on ambitious multiples, but they have fallen 7 per cent from their peak at the start of the month. So far, the results season has lived up to expectations; dividends have slightly exceeded them. As for bonds, the Federal Reserve's pre-emptive tightening should be ultimately positive. If it keeps inflation at bay, short-term interest rates will end up lower than they otherwise would have been. There is no sign yet of inflationary pressures returning in the UK. Nor can the authorities be keen to raise rates again while the fiscal screw is tightening. The real problem is that no one knows when the futures pressure will stop. While it continues, cash buyers might as well sit on their hands and watch markets become cheaper. Real long-term interest rates are rising both in the US and in Europe, though, as liquidity disappears from the bond markets. That cannot continue for long without jeopardising growth. Then equities really would have something to worry about.</p>

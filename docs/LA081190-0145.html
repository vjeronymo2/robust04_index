			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AUTO BODY FILLER WORKS ON CRACKS, HOLES IN WOOD  </P> <P> For years I've been pushing polyester auto body filler as one of the best  materials there is for filling holes, dents, cracks and gouges in wood.  Reasons? It's easy to apply. It sets up in a matter of minutes, never shrinks  or cracks no matter how large the repair, it sands easily and finishes very  well.  </P> <P> Its only real drawback? Depending upon the brand you buy, it usually comes out  a gray or dirty grayish pink. That's not exactly the shade you'd look for if  you want a good wood-tone color match under a clear finish. For this reason, I  normally use the stuff only when I plan to subsequently cover it up, with  either a couple coats of paint or perhaps some plastic laminate.  </P> <P> Not long ago, however, Minwax came out with a product called High Performance  Wood Filler. Like polyester auto body filler, it comes in two parts: a can of  putty and a tube of hardener.  </P> <P> As soon as I saw it on the hardware store shelf, I surreptitiously popped open  the can and took a look. A quick sniff revealed the telltale odor of polyester.  The color was, if not a perfect wood-tone, at least in the neighborhood. I'd  call it a warm, brownish gray. Not only that, according to the label, this  stuff could be stained! Although it cost about three times as much as auto body  filler, it sounded good. I decided to buy a can and compare it to my old  standby.  </P> <P> I quickly discovered that it handles just like auto body filler. As with auto  body filler, the goo in the can is composed of a liquid resin combined with  powdered fillers to create a puttylike material. As with body filler, the two  components tend to separate with storage so it pays to stir the can before use.  </P> <P> After stirring, scoop out a blob big enough to handle the job you have in mind,  and mix it with a bit of the hardener from the separate squeeze tube. Body  fillers usually come with a rusty red hardener. This makes it easy to see when  you've done a good job of mixing, but it also gives you that dirty pink color  mentioned earlier.  </P> <P> The hardener with the Minwax filler is basically colorless. This makes it a bit  harder to judge how well you've mixed your putty, but it also avoids that  sickly grayish pink.  </P> <P> Once either product is mixed with its hardener, you should apply it without  delay. Depending upon how much hardener you've used, and the ambient  temperature, the mix may set up pretty quickly. Use a flexible putty knife and  hold it at a low angle. This helps force the putty into the defect you are  filling.  </P> <P> Since neither product shrinks, there's no need to overfill as you must with  many other products. Just smooth the filler on and level. Avoid holding the  knife at a steep angle, however. This tends to drag the filler out of the  defect and you won't get a level coverage.  </P> <P> On with the tests. Once my samples were mixed, I applied them to shallow  one-inch holes drilled into ordinary pine. Ten minutes later, when the samples  had set up, I tried staining them. According to the Minwax directions, you  should sand the filler lightly with 100-grit paper (finer paper closes the  pores of the filler so it takes less stain) and apply your stain while the  filler is freshly cured. You should then let the stain penetrate for an hour  before wiping off the excess. I followed those directions on the Minwax filler,  using a Minwax stain. And while I was at it, I tried the same procedure on my  grayish pink auto body filler samples.  </P> <P> Results? To my surprise, once the stain was on, there wasn't much difference in  color between the two products. The auto body filler was just a tad pinker than  the Minwax filler, but to be honest, neither was really a very good match for  the color of the stained pine surrounding the test patches.  </P> <P> Of course you will probably get different results with different stains and  different woods, but my initial reaction is that neither body filler nor the  Minwax wood filler is a good choice if you want an accurate color match under a  clear finish. For accurate color matching, you'll probably get a better job  with stick shellac, or a product such as Plastic Wood, especially if you take  the time to blend two or more colors together to get the exact shade you like.  </P> <P> But for filling under paints or laminates, for repairing plaster and wallboard,  for anchoring screws, and working indoor or out, polyester fillers are still my  first choice. And given its clear-cut price advantage, I'll stick with ordinary  auto body filler, stuff with names such as Bondo, White Lightning or Black  Knight.  </P></p>

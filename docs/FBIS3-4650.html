In the period from February 21 to 24 strategic  reconnaissance  planes committed aerial photographing and electronic  reconnaissance on the areas of the North as a whole repeatedly  making flights between Kangnung and Tokjok Islet in the West Sea  of Korea.    On Feb. 25, twelve reconnaissance planes including RV-1 and  RC- 12 made day-and-night cross flights between Tokjok Islet and  Chunchon, between Chunchon and Kangnung and between Yonchon and  Kanghwa Island for photographing and reconnaissance on the  frontline and the eastern and western coastal areas of the North.    U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance plane committed  photographing and electronic reconnaissance on the depths of the  North on 29 occasions in February.    The U.S. imperialists' aerial espionages against the North  via high-altitude strategic reconnaissance planes, Army and  Airforce tactical reconnaissance planes and early warning planes  number more than 190 cases in February.    All these aerial espionages clearly show that the U.S.  imperialists are desperately stepping up their preparations for  another war of aggression against the northern half of Korea.</p>

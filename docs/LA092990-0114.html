			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANONYMOUS DONOR GIVES $2.83 MILLION TO UC IRVINE  </P> <P> A retired Orange County man has given $2.83 million to UC Irvine's Global Peace  and Conflict Studies program, the third-largest private donation in the  school's history.  </P> <P> The 80-year-old donor, who attends public lectures offered by the peace and  conflict program, requested anonymity, Terry Jones, vice chancellor for  university advancement, said Friday.  </P> <P> The gift, which will arrive in monthly payments for the next 30 years, is from  land the man sold, Jones said.  </P> <P> "The checks are already arriving," he said.  </P> <P> Most anonymous gifts are made because donors are afraid of being inundated with  further requests for money, Jones said. But in this case, the donor just  doesn't want a fuss made over the gift, Jones said.  </P> <P> "He said he's just not interested in having his name released," Jones said.  "He's a pure philanthropist."  </P> <P> Proceeds will support education, public service and research for the 6-year-old  peace and conflict program, which is designed to introduce students to the  nature of international conflict. About 60 students take courses offered by the  interdisciplinary program.  </P> <P> The donor specified that the money be spent on the program, "but he has given  quite a bit of latitude to the faculty who run the program," Jones said.  </P> <P> Before the university can accept the gift, it will require approval by the UC  Board of Regents, the governing body for the nine-campus system. It is expected  to grant routine approval at its November meeting.  </P> <P> The gift comes at a good time for UCI because an uncertain economic future  could reduce private donations to the campus. Gifts make up 5% of the  university's operating budget.  </P> <P> "We're watching the economic situation carefully because a lot of our business  leaders are saying, 'We're not sure what's happening out there,' " Jones said.  </P> <P> But with this $2.83 million and an additional $1.5 million received this year  in smaller gifts, the university's fund-raising program is off to a good year,  he said. Total gifts to the university dropped in last fiscal year ending in  June -- from $32.8 million in 1988-89 to $27.4 million in 1989-90. However, the  1988-89 gifts include an $8.5-million trust donated to the medical school, he  said.  </P> <P> Edra E. Brophy of Palm Desert donated the personal trust to the campus for  medical research and teaching programs, the largest gift ever to the campus.  </P> <P> "That was such an anomaly, it was almost impossible to duplicate," Jones said.  </P> <P> On the other hand, total gifts -- money immediately available to the university  -- have continued to increase each year, Jones said.  </P> <P> The university received $25 million in cash and equipment 1989-90, up from $20  million in 1988-89 and $17 million in 1987-88, he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BOY SUFFOCATED BEFORE HE WAS SET ON FIRE, CORONER RULES  </P> <P> The Ventura County coroner ruled Thursday that an 8-year-old Northridge boy,  whose burned, bound body was found near Simi Valley last Friday, suffocated  while his mouth was gagged.  </P> <P> Dr. F. Warren Lovell said that a bruise on Paul Bailly's neck indicated that he  may have been strangled.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a classic strangulation," Lovell said. "It could have been, but I  think it was something akin to . . . grabbing him around the neck."  </P> <P> Lovell said that either strangulation or fear may have caused Paul to throw up  at some point. Because of the gag sealing his mouth, Paul choked on his own  vomit and died of asphyxia, the coroner said.  </P> <P> Asked if he could tell whether Paul's death was intentionally caused, Lovell  said, "I don't know."  </P> <P> Lovell said he ruled that Paul was dead when his body was set afire because  there was no soot in the boy's nose or windpipe and no carbon monoxide in his  blood.  </P> <P> The coroner said that there was no evidence of sexual assault but added that  investigators are conducting further tests.  </P> <P> Paul disappeared last Friday morning after his mother dropped him off at a  child-care program at Darby Avenue Elementary School in Northridge.  Firefighters who were called to extinguish a brush fire in the Santa Susana  Knolls area south of Simi Valley found his body that afternoon.  </P> <P> Early Saturday morning, Ventura homicide investigators arrested Gregory Scott  Smith, 21, who remains the sole suspect in the case. He is being held without  bail by the Ventura County Sheriff's Department pending an arraignment hearing  scheduled for Monday afternoon.  </P> <P> Officials of the Parent Teacher Student Assn. at Darby said this week that  their records include notations of at least two incidents in which Smith was  chastised for improper behavior with Paul.  </P> <P> Smith worked permanently at two schools and as a fill-in aide in at least eight  or more other schools, officials said.  </P> <P> "Our intention is to go over all evaluations of Greg, even where he had worked  only an hour," said Cecelia Mansfield, president of the 31st District PTA.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Detective Sgt. Terry Hughes said Thursday that investigators believe  a pair of handcuffs found near Paul's body belonged to Smith.  </P> <P> Investigators are trying to learn whether those were the same handcuffs Smith  reportedly brought to a school Halloween party last fall at the Chatsworth Park  Elementary School latchkey program, where he worked before he was fired on Dec.  7.  </P> <P> Staff members of the 31st District PTA child-care program said that Smith  appeared at the party wearing camouflage fatigues and handcuffs, which he was  asked to leave outside in his car.  </P> <P> But Hughes declined to elaborate, saying only, "We consider it circumstantial  evidence, and it has been incorporated into our investigation."  </P> <P> Smith also had been fired March 6 for harshness in disciplining children he  cared for in a PTA-run program for latchkey children at Darby.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Michael Connelly contributed to this story.  </P></p>

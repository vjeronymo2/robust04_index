			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Comments Received by the MSRB <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In August 1994, the MSRB published its proposal for comment, and subsequently received five comment letters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that its dealer department is a two-person operation and the proposed Firm Element is an unreasonable burden to be placed on such a small operation. The Firm Element Committee of the Council is developing materials for dealers' use in devising and carrying out training programs to meet the requirements of the Firm Element. The Committee intends to incorporate ``samples'' of how different firms might approach the requirements ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , firms that deal with one product, small firms, and firms with large numbers of very small offices or solo representatives). The MSRB believes this future guidance would assuage the concerns of small firms as to the burden of compliance with this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter, a municipal securities broker's broker, asked whether it would be subject to the Firm Element requirements. The Firm Element is applicable to all persons who conduct business with retail, institutional, or investment banking customers of the dealer and the immediate supervisors of such persons. The Firm Element is not applicable to dealers who deal only with other brokers and dealers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that the MSRB has not shown that a continuing education program is needed in the industry. Another commenter expressed similar concerns. The Task Force formed by the securities industry to study the issue of continuing education and to develop recommendations concluded that the industry would be will served by a uniform continuing education program. The MSRB believes that a formal industry-wide continuing education program to keep professionals up-to-date on products, markets, and rules would be beneficial to the municipal securities industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter sent the same comments to the MSRB and the NASD. These comments have been summarized above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MSRB also received two telephone inquiries from bank dealers concerning the planned procedure for the CRD system to track and communicate an individual's registration anniversary date for use with the Regulatory Element. Bank dealer personnel are not registered on the CRD system. The MSRB has discussed this notification matter on an informal basis with the bank regulatory agencies. Such agencies have stated that they would probably require banks to put procedures into place for internal tracking of anniversary dates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Comment Received by the NYSE <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NYSE received one letter from a member organization commenting on its proposal. The commenter endorsed the computer-based training of the Regulatory Element, but recommended that such training be required upon an individual's initial registration, in addition to the required three occasions thereafter ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , after the second, fifth and tenth registration anniversary dates). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NYSE believes that the continuing education program has been designed to apply to registered persons after they have satisfied the initial qualification requirements and that two years after a person's initial registration and qualification is an appropriate time to reinforce significant general regulatory and sales practice concepts and provide training on recent rule and other current developments through the continuing education process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Comments Received by Other SROs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The other SROS have not solicited, and do not intend to solicit, comments regarding the proposed rule change. They also have not received any unsolicited written comments from members or other interested parties. All of the SROs have made, or intend to make, changes to their proposals to conform to changes made by the other SROs in response to comments they received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Changes and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organizations consent, the Commission will: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. By order approve such proposed rule changes, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule changes should be disapproved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Solicitation of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing.

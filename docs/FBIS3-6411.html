Australia was branded a weak link in Western security last  night in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation television  investigation following the expulsion of six Russian spies last  year. The expulsions, reportedly on CIA directions, were kept  quiet by the Australian government, which is embarrassed at its  image as a soft target used by Moscow during and since the Cold  War. The expulsions were only exposed last month by an  opposition MP.    A spy hunt is under way to identify a network of as many as  30 Russian-recruited agents. The investigation was confirmed  last night in an interview with David Sadlier, Director-General  of the Australian Secret Service.    Through its shared military and commercial operations with  Britain and the United States, Australia is still considered to  be a more relaxed target for Russia to learn about its more  powerful allies. The security breach could date back ten years,  or possibly 30 years as the case of the last Soviet spy in  Australia, Vladimir Petrov, is reopened. A Russian translator  with the Australian secret service George Sadil, has been  committed for trial in Canberra for handing over intelligence  secrets that would have been passed on to MI6 and the CIA.    Last night the programme Lateline offered the first specific  details of Soviet penetration and damage. The targeting the  late 1980s was the joint Anglo-Australian development of the  worlds most sophisticated sonar buoy for tracking Soviet  submarine movements. The Barra sonar buoy was used by Britain in  the Atlantic and Australia in the Far East.    Developed in a project between Plessey and the Australian  government's Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the  Australian AWA defence manufacturer the buoy has 25 underwater  hydrophones. They are dropped by RAF Nimrod surveillance  aircraft for the Royal Navy, and by Australian Air Force Orion  aircraft for the Australian Navy.    Disclosure of the operation was made by Professor Desmond  Ball, of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, at the  Australian National University in Canberra.    The focus of attention was the Garden Island Naval Dockyard  beside the Opera House. Professor Ball explained how Soviet  agents intercepted phone calls between naval officers and  defence headquarters in Canberra, allowing Soviet agents to  monitor trials of the buoy by the naval facility south of Sydney.</p>

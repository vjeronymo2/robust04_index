			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Borrowing may not be indicator of growth Your report, 'Recovery hopes dented by weak bank lending' (December 21) may contain a possibly erroneous assumption: that increased lending to companies must imply increased growth, and per contra. Companies have been so badly burdened by debt in the late 1980s that many are vowing 'never again' to resort to bank borrowing, at least on a substantial scale. This need not mean that they are starved of funds, merely that they get them from a different source. Given the greater sophistication that recession has (commendably) forced on them, their most readily available sources of course are increased (retained) profits and better control of working capital. Companies can 'bootstrap' growth without resorting to former levels of borrowing. Restricted borrowing does not therefore necessarily mean restricted growth and it may be quite wrong to draw such an, inevitably pessimistic, conclusion.

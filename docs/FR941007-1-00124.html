			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix C to Part 228_CRA Loan Data Format  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Instructions for the Small Business and Small Farm Loan Register  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This form contains the instructions for completion of the Loan Register for Small Business and Small Farm Loans. This register is used in conjunction with the reporting of this information as part of the CRA data collection process. The register and these instructions are to be used to provide the format in which the data should be reported. The actual data are to be submitted in machine-readable form in accordance with the instructions for submission of data pursuant to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> I. Who Must File a Register  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> All independent insured banks and thrifts with $250 million or more in total assets and all insured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> banks and thrifts that are members of holding companies with $250 million or more in bank and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thrift assets must report this information for small business and small farm loans outstanding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning December 31, 1995. Banks and thrifts with fewer assets that wish to be evaluated under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 CFR 228.22 through 228.24 must also report this information. Only provide information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on business or farm location and borrower information for loans for which applications were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted after July 1, 1995. For loans for which applications were submitted before that date,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enter ``N/A'' for all information relating to location or borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> II. Types of Loans To Be Reported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The loan register should contain individual loan data on each small business or small farm loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as defined on schedule RC-C of the December 31 Report of Condition and Income. Include data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on individual small business loans with original loan amounts of $1 million or less and individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small farm loans with original loan amounts of $500,000 or less that had an outstanding balance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as of December 31.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> III. Submission of Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The data must be submitted in machine-readable form consistent with requirements for submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of data pursuant to 12 CFR Part 203 (Regulation C). The format must conform exactly to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form, including the order of columns, column headings, etc. Contact your federal supervisory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency for information regarding procedures and technical specifications for automated data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Your institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow for collection of the data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the Supplemental Instructions For Collection Of Data In Connection with Small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Business and Small Farm Loans. Keep in mind that data reported on the register are outstanding as of December 31 and not originations as are reported for some other regulatory purposes. Your  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution may collect the data on separate registers at different branches or on separate registers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for different loan types (small business or small farm), but make sure each loan number is unique.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Entries need not be grouped on your registers by MSA, or chronologically, or by census tract, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in any other particular order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Instructions for Completion of Register  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Loan Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> LOAN NUMBER_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Enter an identifying number that can be used to retrieve the loan file.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It can be any number (not exceeding 25 characters). Use letters, numerals, or a combination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both. Make sure that all numbers are unique within the institution. If registers contain data for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> branch offices, for example, use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans of different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> branches or assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of the borrower's tax-payer identification number or social security number is strongly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discouraged for privacy reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> OUTSTANDING LOAN AMOUNT_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Enter the outstanding loan amount (balance) as of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 31. Show the amount in thousands rounding to the nearest thousand. Do not report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loans with balances below $500. For example, a loan with a balance of $500 would be rounded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to $1,000; a loan balance of $50,300 would be rounded to $50,000; and a balance of $15,700  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be rounded to $16,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Letter: Europe's obsolete HDTV dream Sir, Thank you for your common-sense leader regarding high definition television standards for Europe ('High-cost TV', May 13). Let's be absolutely clear. The prospects for a MAC-based future for UK broadcasters died on the day BSB merged with Sky. With developments in the digital transmission domain developing apace, it is obvious that the technology is as wrong for Europe as the motives for establishing the standard were misguided. We talk optimistically about government efforts to reduce the level of funding given to HDTV standards; but with nations across Europe so obviously strapped for cash there is absolutely no benefit in propping up this obsolete dream any longer. One more penny in extra funding is too much. Gerry Hinde, editor, The Independent Electrical Retailer, Farnham Road, West Liss, Hampshire</p>

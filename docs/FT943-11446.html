			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Vote to freeze Ukraine sell-off Ukraine's parliament voted yesterday to freeze the privatisation of state enterprises for six weeks. Deputies voted 180-62 for a resolution that said the system of privatisation was flawed and had to be stopped until the assembly decided which types of property are not to be transferred to private ownership. It ordered the government to draw up a list of enterprises in transport, energy and communication which should not be privatised 'because of their national significance' and submit the list for parliament's approval in September. The resolution also ordered a review of the mechanism by which foreign investors participate in privatisation. Deputies were keen to prevent enterprises avoiding the competitive process and buying out their leases from the state for a low price. Reformers, including Mr Volodymyr Kuznetsov, head of President Kuchma's economic service, were opposed to the resolution, and said the process of privatisation could not be stopped.</p>

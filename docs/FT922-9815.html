			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Letter: Polyester not an ICI invention Sir, Your story, 'Raw materials of a promising deal' (April 24), refers to ICI's 'difficult decision to stop making polyester, which the company invented. . .' I am aware that this myth originated from ICI's PR department during the Hanson-ICI polemics. But I would have thought by now that someone at ICI would have corrected this error. Polyester was invented and patented by the late Dr Rex Whinfield and his co-workers at Calico Printers Association. Dr Whinfield told me that CPA decided the project was too big and so he was instructed to approach ICI. ICI fibre scientists eventually declared that the fibre had 'no future'  - a severe blow to Whinfield and CPA. The CPA board decided to send Whinfield to see Du Pont US, even though it knew that in those days ICI and Du Pont had a technical and commercial information exchange agreement and Du Pont would know of the ICI rejection. Whinfield was told to try to at least get his research outlay back - which, if my memory is correct, was Pounds 66,000. Du Pont decided to buy the US version of the patent, and Whinfield was delighted to sell for that sum. When ICI learned of Du Pont's purchase it tried to buy the UK and other country patents. Whinfield, though, realised they might have a winner after all and CPA refused to sell to ICI for a lump sum and demanded royalties. Whinfield joined ICI and was responsible for the development of the fibre. I believe in the end ICI paid many millions of pounds in royalties.

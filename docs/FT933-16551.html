			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Money Markets: German futures record THE BUNDESBANK'S long awaited announcement of lower interest rates yesterday triggered a spate of rate cuts across Europe and lead to record volumes of trading in German D-Mark futures, writes Gillian Tett. The German central bank cut its discount rate by 0.5 per cent to 6.75 per cent, and the Lombard rate by 0.25 per cent to 8.25 per cent. The move was matched by similar cuts in Switzerland, Sweden, Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Austria and Ireland, pushing many European official rates back below German levels. The Bank of Switzerland started the trend by cutting its discount rate from 5.0 per cent to 4.5 per cent. This was followed by a 25 basis point cut in the Bank of Austria's Lombard and discount rates, bringing them to 7.25 and 6 per cent respectively. The Irish central bank announced a similar 25 basis point cut in its short term facility rate, bringing it to 7.5 per cent. Denmark's central bank said it would lower its key discount and deposit rates to 7.25 per cent from 7.75 per cent from tomorrow. Finally, the Dutch central bank cut its advances rate from 6.90 per cent to 6.70 per cent, prompting Belgium to announce an identical cut in its money market central rate, and a 0.25 point cut in its discount rate, bringing it to 6.00 per cent. The Bundesbank's move triggered record levels of trade in the German D-Mark futures market, with the day's estimated volume exceeding 223,000 contracts. The previous record, 196,173, which was set during sterling's suspension from the ERM last September. The activity pushed the September Euro D-Mark contract some 10 basis points higher in the morning. However, it later fell back, closing around 93.24, little changed on the day, reflecting, dealers said, the fact that the market had already been pricing in some type of German rate cut this month. In London, as the Bundesbank's move fuelled hopes that the British authorities might follow the trend and cut their own interest rates, September sterling futures rose 10 basis points to 94.33. But, a lunchtime announcement from the Treasury signalling no easing in monetary conditions dampened the optimism, pushing the contract back to the previous day's level of around 94.23. Three month interbank rates closed little changed at 5 7/8 per cent.</p>

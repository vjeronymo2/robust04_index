			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Marley Marley first warned of a downturn in profits three years ago and has paid an uncovered dividend for the past two. No surprise, then, that the market barely twitched yesterday on news that the pay-out this year will be cut by a third. Of greater concern for the sector as a whole, however, are indications from Marley's interim figures that producers are losing control of pricing across the range of UK building products. The cyclical softness in brick prices now extends through roof tiles and aggregates. Conditions could deteriorate through the second half if big players, notably Redland following the acquisition of Steetley, take an aggressive stance. Without increased demand from the construction industry - and Marley made plain yesterday it expected no such upturn until well into next year or 1994  -margins will be restored only if excess capacity is taken out. This could imply a further round of provisioning. Hepworth got the ball rolling last month by flagging unspecified reorganisation costs in the second half. Marley's decision to close two Thermalite plants could give rise to an exceptional charge of Pounds 10m, suggesting the dividend will not be covered this year even at the reduced rate. With Marley's margins under such pressure, cost savings are not flowing to the bottom line. Even a sharp reduction in working capital and interest costs this year will be balanced by the write-off of up to Pounds 1.5m ACT because UK profits are so low. Albeit rather belatedly, the company is taking steps to form a base from which earnings can grow. But against a background of serious weakness in its core market, a prospective yield of 7 per cent leaves little to chance.</p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: ITT nets Dollars 600m quarterly gain on Alcatel share sale ITT, the US conglomerate, said it would record a third-quarter extraordinary gain of Dollars 600m as a result of the sale of its 30 per cent shareholding in Alcatel, the French telecommunications company, to Alcatel Alsthom, Alcatel's French parent company. The Alcatel share disposal - which will involve the payment to ITT of Dollars 3.7bn in cash and stock between now and 1994 - was first announced in March and completed yesterday. ITT said it might use some of the proceeds of the disposal to buy back its own shares: the ITT board in May approved the repurchase of up to 25m shares. Alcatel was first formed in 1986 when ITT sold its European telecommunications businesses to Compagnie Generale d'Electricite of France (CGE) in exchange for Dollars 1.3bn and 37 per cent of the combined CGE-ITT operations. Two years ago ITT began disengaging from the Alcatel shareholding by selling a 7 per cent stake in Alcatel to CGE for Dollars 640m, thus reducing its equity interest in Alcatel from 37 to 30 per cent. The Alcatel share sale involves an immediate Dollars 1bn cash payment to ITT from Alcatel-Alsthom, which was ITT's joint venture partner in Alcatel. As part of the transaction, ITT also received 9.1m newly issued shares in Alcatel Alsthom, giving the US group a 7 per cent stake that had a value of Dollars 1.lbn based on Thursday's closing share price of FFr638 (Dollars 125.09). ITT has agreed to retain these shares for five years. The balance of the Dollars 3.7bn of payments to ITT will come in the form of cash over the next two years. A year from now ITT will be paid Dollars 766.8m, while the final payment of Dollars 816.6m will occur in July 1994. Rand Araskog, ITT chairman, has meanwhile been named to the board of Alcatel Alsthom.</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Lloyd's agency group in direct response plan HAYTER Brockbank, the Lloyd's agency group, is to launch a direct response insurance company to market motor and other personal types of insurance in the way already pioneered successfully by Direct Line, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland Policies will be insured by syndicates at Lloyd's of London which are managed by the agency. Lloyd's already has just over 13 per cent of the UK motor market but up to now brokers have generated this business. Hayter Brockbank will invest Pounds 1.8m in start-up costs this year. It will begin underwriting - initially motor insurance - in January next year - and hopes to have 50,000 policyholders by May 1994 and 100,000 policyholders by January 1995. It hopes to eventually form a consortium with other Lloyd's agencies to increase the amount of capital it can commit to the business. Recent regulatory changes at Lloyd's have given agencies greater room for manoeuvre to write business directly rather than through Lloyd's registered insurance brokers, while the task force report into Lloyd's future, published 10 days ago, suggested that the superior cost structures enjoyed by direct writers might allow them to eat into Lloyd's share of the motor market. The success of the direct writers, however, has been an important influence for Hayter Brockbank's in the new venture. 'We are using them as our model, particularly Direct Line', said managing director Mr George Stevens, referring to the Pounds 10.1m profits recorded by Direct Line last year.</p>

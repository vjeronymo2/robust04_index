			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Lockheed L1011 series airplanes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;McDonnell Douglas_DC&hyph;8&hyph;60, DC&hyph;9&hyph;31, DC&hyph;9&hyph;51,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DC&hyph;10&hyph;10 DC&hyph;10&hyph;30, DC&hyph;13&hyph;30F, MD&hyph;11, and MD&hyph;80 series  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Rockwell International NA&hyph;265&hyph;65 airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons have been afforded an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to participate in the making of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendment. Due consideration has been given to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments received from 33 different owners, operators,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers, and organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All commenters express their concern of the FAA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance date of December 30, 1993, especially since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allied Signal's service bulletin will not be available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until early 1994. The following summarizes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance times that the commenters recommended:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;18 recommended one year or less;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;5 recommended longer than one year; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;10 recommended an extension without a proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The National Air Traffic Controllers Association and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Airline Pilots Association both recommend an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``aggressive implementation'' of ``Change 6.04A''. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA has re-evaluated the December 30, 1993, compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time and has determined that the compliance time should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be changed to December 31, 1994. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Change 6.04A'' has been upgraded to ``Change 6.04A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enhanced'', which eliminates unnecessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-crossing resolution advisories (RA's) included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Change 6.04A''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allied Signal has assured the FAA that (1) the upgrade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ``Change 6.04A Enhanced'' is minor and will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated in the logic change for the TCAS II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor upgrades; and (2) this compliance time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correlates with their schedule for disseminating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service information and kits necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplish the incorporation of ``Change 6.04A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enhanced''. The proposed AD has been changed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect the compliance time change and logic change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, Allied Signal states that ``Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.04'', which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA-certified and is currently in service, accomplishes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the major intent of ``Change 6.04A Enhanced'' and should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be considered as an acceptable interim version to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the eventual upgrade to ``Change 6.04A Enhanced''. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA recognizes that ``Change 6.04'' incorporates several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the features of ``Change 6.04A Enhanced''. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FAA has determined that (1) ``Change 6.04'' does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide an equivalent level of safety to that of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Change 6.04A Enhanced''; and (2) ``Change 6.04A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enhanced'' should be incorporated as a way to prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collisions or near misses caused by incompatibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the TCAS II processors and the current air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traffic control system. Compliance time extension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration will be given on a case-by-case basis to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airlines or operators experiencing compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficulties that arise because of fleet size. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD remains unchanged as a result of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allied Signal also lists several additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft that these TCAS II processor units are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified for installation. The FAA has incorporated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these into the proposed AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter, who supports the implementation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Change 6.04A Enhanced'', requests that the FAA issue a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplementary notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propose installing this revised software by June 30,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995. This commenter states that significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differences exist between ``Change 6.04A'' and ``Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.04A Enhanced''. The FAA does not concur. Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received in response to the proposed AD reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unanimous support for implementing ``Change 6.04A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enhanced''. The FAA considers the logic change (which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduces non-crossing RA's) to be minor. The intent is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to correct the unsafe condition by installing modified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TCAS II computer units that incorporate updated logic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that the requirement to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement Version 6.04A software, including the latest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhancement, will (1) correct the unsafe condition;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) maintain the same intent originally proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without altering the substance of the proposed rule;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (3) impose no additional burden on the public than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was previously proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, issuing a supplemental NPRM would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessitate (under the provisions of the Administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedures Act) reissuing the notice, reopening the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comment period, considering any additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments received, and eventually issuing a final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The time required for these procedures could take as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long as four additional months. In light of this, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in consideration of the amount of time that has already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elapsed since issuance of the original NPRM, the FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concludes that soliciting further public comment is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary and that further delay of the final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action is not appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters request that the FAA revise the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impact specified in the proposed AD to reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs associated with the development, testing prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification, and certification of the modified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor. These costs would be absorbed by suppliers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installers, and airline operators. The FAA does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concur that the economic impact statement include this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information. The 1 workhour necessary to accomplish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed action was provided to the FAA by the TCAS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II processor manufacturer based on the best data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to date. This number represents the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to install the revised software. The cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis in AD rulemaking actions typically does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include costs associated with development, testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to certification, and certification of a modified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor. The proposed action remains unchanged as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of these comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of all available information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the comments noted above, the FAA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that air safety and the public interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the change in compliance time, the logic reference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change, the incorporation of known aircraft that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TCAS II processor units are installed on, and minor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these changes and corrections will not change the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public than was already proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 3,000 TCAS II processors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it will take approximately 1 workhour per processor to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplish the required action, and that the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these figures, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators is estimated to be $165,000. These figures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are based on the assumption that none of the operators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the airplanes equipped with the affected TCAS II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors have accomplished the actions specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial direct effects on the States, on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship between the national government and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, or on the distribution of power and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities among the various levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

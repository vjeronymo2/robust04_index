Also in the program is the construction of 59 sea port  berths  with an increased handling capacity of more than 30 million tons.    These were among projects announced here by Huang Zhendong,  minister of communications. Speaking at a national working  meeting, he said that this year China will remold 370 km of  inland navigation canals and construct 19 river berths to  increase handling capacity by over three million tons.    Huang said that buses and coaches will this year carry 9.3  billion passengers on the highways. Road cargo volume will  reach 8.55 billion tons; passengers going by ship are predicted  to total 320 million, and ship cargo is expected to reach 1.1  billion tons.    The handling volume of major coastal ports will be 630  million tons to 660 million tons, Huang added.    By the end of 1993 the total length of China's operating  highways had reached 1.075 million km, an increase of 18,000 km  over the previous year; of which 1,145 km are expressways, an  increase of 493 km.    In addition, last year 19 deep-water berths were built in  coastal ports, four more than the planned number. A number of  key projects, such as Qingdao port, Nantong port and Lianyungang  port, have started operating.    Huang said that in the past year international cooperation  in  the field of transport had been further strengthened, and  agreements have been signed with nine countries on land  transportation, ocean shipping or regional communications  cooperation.    This year the ministry will continue to encourage the  establishment of foreign-funded land and water transportation  enterprises, as well as automobile service enterprises.</p>

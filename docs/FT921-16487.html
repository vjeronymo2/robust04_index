			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Zale may be forced into Chapter 11 ZALE CORPORATION, the largest retail jeweller in the US, said yesterday that it was studying a bankruptcy petition filed on Wednesday night by bondholders, but believed that an out-of-court reorganisation was in everyone's best interests. The heavily-indebted company, based in Dallas although owned jointly by Peoples Jewellers in Toronto and Zurich-based Swarovski International Holding, has already defaulted on a Dollars 52m (Pounds 27.8m) interest payment on its junk bonds. The subsequent 30-day 'grace period', in which payment could still be made, was due to expire yesterday. On Wednesday night, some of the ailing company's bondholders pre-empted the final default, by filing an involuntary bankruptcy petition with the Texas courts. The action, which was led by Barre &amp; Company, the Dallas-based investment firm, forces Zale either to contest the bankruptcy petition in the courts, or to accede to the bondholders' demand and seek protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. Yesterday, Zale said it was still studying the situation, although it described the petition as 'unfortunate'. It claimed, however, that a co-operative agreement between the various interest groups was 'in the best interests of all parties', and that an out-of-court restructuring would be the speediest and most efficient solution. The company, which technically has several weeks in which to respond to the bankruptcy filing, added that no date for a court hearing had yet been set. Earlier this week, Zale offered outlines of a reorganisation scheme, when it announced plans to close 400 of its 2,000 stores, together with a 'downsizing and cost reduction' plan at its corporate headquarters. The company also announced that it was halting all debt payments. Part of the problem at Zale, which has been suffering heavy losses recently, derives from hefty debts taken on when the company was acquired by Peoples Jewellers and Swarovski in 1986. Further debt was then issued, with the help of Drexel Burnham Lambert, when Zale bought out the rival Gordon jewellery retail chain, in the late-1980s.</p>

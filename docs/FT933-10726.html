			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Killings highlight Russia conflict THE MURDER of two senior Russian officials, one of them a deputy prime minister, has brought home to the Russian public the increasingly bitter struggle between two ethnic groups in the north Caucasian region. Mr Viktor Polyanichko, temporary governor of the areas of Ingushetia and neighbouring North Ossetia, was murdered when gunmen fired on his car late on Sunday afternoon. Major General Anatoly Koretsky, commander of the Russian forces in the area, was also killed. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy Russian prime minister for nationalities, and General Pavel Grachev, defence minister, immediately flew to the Ossetian capital of Vladikavkaz for talks with local leaders. Mr Polyanichko, a former senior communist official in Azerbaijan whose appointment as special governor of the region had sparked controversy among democrats in Russia, had emergency powers to rule in the region as increasingly violent conflict followed efforts by Ingush families deported from their homes to resettle in areas of South Ossetia. A state of emergency was declared last week by President Boris Yeltsin, confirmed by parliament on Saturday. Thousands of refugees from both sides have fled their homes in the wake of what Mr Ruslan Aushev, president of Ingushetia, has called 'planned ethnic cleansing' of Ingushes. Both sides blame the other for the murders. The press centre of the North Ossetian government claimed the area where Mr Polyanichko was killed was controlled by Ingush forces. The Ingush president's press secretary said last night that 'the blood of these officials are on the hands of those who tried to stop the Ingush returning to their traditional homes'.</p>

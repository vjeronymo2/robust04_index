			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Minister quits over air crash MR Madhavrao Scindia, India's minister for civil aviation and tourism, resigned on Saturday, hours after an Uzbekistan Airways aircraft leased to Indian Airlines crashed at New Delhi airport, Shiraz Sidhva writes. The Russian pilot, who was told not to land in the dense early morning fog, apparently did not understand the command in English. The 165 passengers aboard the Russian TU-154 aircraft crawled to safety. The aircraft was one of seven TU-154s leased by Indian Airlines, the government-owned domestic carrier, after pilots went on strike on December 10. Mr Scindia said he was taking moral responsibility for the crash, as he had not been able to resolve the strike for more than a month. This compelled 'Indian Airlines to lease the Russian aircraft due to the unfortunate attitude of the pilots'. Mr Ghulam Nabi Azad, minister for parliamentary affairs, will take temporary charge of the civil aviation and tourism ministries. Mr Scindia had distinguished himself as railways minister in Mr Rajiv Gandhi's cabinet, and had held his current office since June 1991.</p>

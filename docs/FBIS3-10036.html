Robaina expressed the island's position after newsmen  consulted him on the subject last night, following a three-day  visit to the central provinces accompanied by more than 40  members of the diplomatic corps accredited in this capital.    The minister said there is no doubt that President Gaviria  is  a man who carries out a mandate and fulfills his  responsibilities, and he is a man with experience who gives  guarantees and achieves results.    However, he made it clear that Cuba "can hardly say who is  the best or the worst candidate" because it is not a member of  that organization.    I am fully convinced that the members of that organization  will know how to evaluate who is the best choice for secretary  general, he stressed.    Havana was expelled from the OAS in 1962 due to the great  pressure exerted by the United States to isolate from the rest  of the continent. [sentence as received]</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARNS AGAINST PAYING IN ADVANCE  </P> <P> On Thursday, March 30, I experienced an activity that must be symbolic of the  breakdown of justice in California. As president of the Continental Assn. that  coordinates the activities of 150 nonprofit funeral/memorial societies in the  United States, I had gone to Long Beach to offer testimony in a hearing  conducted by the State Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers. The board had  proposed changes in regulations affecting the funeral parlors of the state --  and their customers.  </P> <P> These changes would: 1) give the funeral businessmen more of their customers'  money and 2) permit them to pay salespeople with their customers' money, to  promote the sale of prepaid funerals. The funeral industry has since 1983 tried  to get these benefits by legislation. Now the state regulatory board that is  supposed to protect consumers was proposing to bestow them by a change of  rules.  </P> <P> After two hours of testimony involving the American Assn. of Retired People and  the nonprofit societies -- but dominated by funeral industry representatives,  the board, composed of two morticians, a "public" member whose wife is in the  funeral industry and two other public members, voted to give the industry  yearly $40 for every $1,000 of the customer's money held in trust for payment  of a future funeral (up from $25 per $1,000) -- and permission to pay for  promotion of pre-need funeral plans out of that money. Could there be a more  obvious example of a conflict of interest?  </P> <P> The nonprofit funeral/memorial societies do not recommend paying for a funeral  in advance of need.

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Ruling will revive shop hours debate A HIGH-LEVEL court ruling in Germany has confirmed the right of petrol stations to sell a range of goods after normal shopping hours. The ruling by the Federal Administrative Court in Berlin increases pressure for a wider lifting of Germany's restrictive and rigidly enforced laws on shop opening hours. Petrol stations will now be allowed to sell 'goods for journeys', an expression which is defined as including non-alcoholic drinks, sweets, newspapers and 'other goods'. The ruling seems certain to accelerate a revived political debate on the whole issue of shop opening hours, which are normally until 18.30 every evening, and 14.00 on a Saturday. There is late opening on Thursday evenings, and on the first Saturday each month.</p>

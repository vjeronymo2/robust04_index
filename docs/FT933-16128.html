			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Italians demand a say in Somalia: Soldiers' deaths shock nation ITALY yesterday demanded a greater say in running the United Nations military operations in Somalia, Unisom, as an emotional funeral was staged for the three Italian soldiers killed in a skirmish on Friday in Mogadishu, the Somali capital. Also, in an usually outspoken statement on a foreign policy issue, Mr Beniamino Andreatta, the foreign minister, said that the focus had to shift towards finding a political solution in Somalia. If not, he warned, the UN commitment risked being both ineffective and indefinite. The soldiers' deaths - the first of Italian ground troops in combat since the second world war - shocked the nation and prompted questioning about the role of the 2,500 troops who are part of the UN mission there to stop fighting and aid delivery of food to Somalis caught up in the civil war. Italian opposition parties have called for the withdrawal of Italy's force. Italy has been concerned for some time over the way the US military in Somalia has failed to co-ordinate with their contingent. There has been at least one incident in which US soldiers started operations without warning in a zone allocated to Italian troops. This has led to the despatch of a team to Washington to negotiate closer co-ordination, and a meeting due to be held in New York on Thursday among the seven main contributors to Unisom forces. The Italians originally suggested the Unisom command be placed in the hands of one of their generals but appears to have backed off this. However, the Ciampi government is anxious to head of growing public concern over the loss of life and injury of Italian troops with demonstrable evidence that they have a more direct say in how operations are managed. Mr Andreatta in this context sought yesterday to shift attention away from the UN military enforcement action towards a political solution. 'Without a political solution, negotiated through all the parties so bitterly involved in combat, any military action risks being completely ineffective and could well lead to an indefinite presence,' Mr Andreatta told parliament. Germany's first big shipload of more than 1,000 vehicles and around 30 containers steamed for Somalia on Sunday after the Bonn parliament approved a controversial troop deployment there, Reuter adds. A German army spokesman said the 3,056-tonne Beerberg was carrying lorries, four-wheel drive trucks and 11 armoured personnel carriers.</p>

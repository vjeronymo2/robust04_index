			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow higher as interest rate worries recede Wall Street US share prices edged higher across the board yesterday as fears that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates after the release of today's June employment report diminished, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 13.92 up at 3,688.42, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.25 at 448.38. The American SE composite put on 1.10 at 424.65 and the Nasdaq composite added 5.53 at 706.53. NYSE volume was moderate at 259.7m shares. The market's attention remained squarely focused on monetary policy throughout the day. After the meeting of the Fed's open market committee ended on Wednesday with no apparent change in policy, traders and investors began to worry about today's employment figures for June. Some analysts believed that the Fed had held off from lifting interest rates on Wednesday only because it wanted to see how the June jobs data would come out. The same analysts warned that if the figures showed stronger than expected growth in the labour market, then the Fed would probably put up rates to slow the economy down. By yesterday, however, interest rate fears had receded. Analysts predicted that the jobs data would show a rise of about 280,000 in non-farm payrolls in June, and believed that the increase would have to be substantially larger than that for the Fed to be persuaded to raise rates. An early advance in bond prices helped equities to gain ground during the morning session, and stocks held on to their rises later in the day when bonds retreated. Among individual stocks, the cyclicals which led the market higher on Wednesday were mixed. International Paper added Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 68 7/8 and General Electric firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 47 1/4 , but Caterpillar eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 104 3/8 and Alcoa fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 75 1/4 . Wal-Mart firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 24 3/4 , lifted by news of a 9.3 per cent rise in same-store sales during June. Another retailer, Best Buy, dropped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 25 3/8 on disappointing sales. CBS declined Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 308 1/2 as speculation mounted that entertainment giant Walt Disney is seeking some sort of alliance with CBS and its new merger partner QVC. If the story is true, it would scupper the hopes of investors who were looking to Disney as a possible rival bidder for CBS. On the Nasdaq market, Snapple Beverage receded Dollars 1 1/16 to Dollars 19 1/4 after brokerage house Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock from a buy to a hold. Future Now tumbled Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 7 3/4 after the company announced that it would take a second-quarter charge of between Dollars 30m and Dollars 45m to cover a restructuring. Canada Toronto ended higher after a rally sparked by easing interest rate fears and bargain hunting, and traders said the market mood is on an upswing. The TSE 300 index strengthened 36.5 to 4,079.9 and turnover was 58.9m shares valued at CDollars 679m. This marked a resurgence in volume which has been subdued this week as players hugged the sidelines. Rises led declines by 358 to 301. Of the 14 sub-group indices, 11 ploughed ahead. Transportation jumped 148.66, or 3.52 per cent, to 4,368.0.</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET THE FORCES OF RELIGION EXPEL TERRORISTS  </P> <P> Today, the leaders of Hezbollah have every reason to claim victory in their  latest encounter with the West. This, despite the fact that the radical Muslim  fundamentalist organization has been forced to seek ways to limit the damage to  the movement brought about by Israel's abduction of Hezbollah's spiritual and  military mastermind, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid.  </P> <P> They celebrate as surely as civilized people mourn the brutal murder of Marine  Lt. Col. William R. Higgins. They celebrate the confluence of opinion of  European leaders, some media pundits and self-proclaimed terrorism experts who  have conveniently placed the blame for the murder and plight of Western  hostages squarely on Israel's shoulders. They surely revel at the videotapes  showing Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole lambasting Israel for recklessly  "free-lancing" the Obeid operation without apparent consideration for its chief  ally, the United States. And Hezbollah's patrons in Iran and Syria must take  special satisfaction at the spectacle of President Bush's statements, so  carefully crafted to distance his Administration from the Jewish state.  </P> <P> Let us be unmistakably clear: The actions and ideology of Obeid mean to impact  far beyond the confines of the current Arab-Israel conflict. He said it best  himself: "We're not worried about Lebanon . . . Hezbollah doesn't believe in  Lebanon; it doesn't recognize borders . . . What Hezbollah wants is a world  Islamic republic. What we're trying to do now is convert the whole world."  </P> <P> It is the civilized world itself that is being held hostage in Lebanon.  </P> <P> The so-called war against terrorism has been virtually ground to a halt. We  know it, and so do the terrorists. The most powerful offices in the world have  seen their role in this "war" reduced to little more than writing condolence  letters to the next of kin and public bemoaning of the difficulties of pursuing  the elusive enemy.  </P> <P> The current operative "rule of engagement" is to never put the lives of Western  hostages at risk. In reality, our leaders have opted to heed the counsel of  some prominent former hostages. In simple language, this means no war shall be  waged on terrorists unless and until all innocents are out of danger! An  admirable approach, perhaps, but one that clearly plays right into the hands of  terrorist groups that, by their nature, will always hold hostages.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, recent history has proven that an anti-terrorist policy based on  rhetoric rather than action merely ensures repeat performances by terrorists on  the world stage.  </P> <P> Have all but the bereaved families of the victims forgotten the pledge of the  United States and Britain to bring the bombers of Pan Am flight 103 before the  bar of justice? Officials correctly asked for time to pinpoint the identity and  whereabouts of the international criminals. But can anyone take that commitment  seriously in wake of the Hezbollah leader's capture? Here we have a case where  an ally, Israel, has pinpointed the man who planned every aspect of the  kidnaping of an American citizen. Yet not one senior U.S. official has stepped  forward to endorse the call of Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) to extradite Obeid  for trial.  </P> <P> This kind of public hypocrisy cannot be a substitute for policy. Indeed, the  current course of action will only guarantee that there will be many more men  and women likely to suffer the horrible fate of Col. Higgins.  </P> <P> To finally stem the tide of terrorism, President Bush should immediately ask  Congress to formally declare war against terrorist groups that have engaged in  violence against American citizens and interests. He should encourage his  allies to do the same. Such a declaration would give the President immediate  power and political backbone to order surgical strikes and covert operations  against those who mock international law and morality.  </P> <P> The world cannot rely exclusively on political leaders to solve this problem  when the murderers are speaking in the name of religion. It is time for  religious leaders of Christianity, Islam and Judaism to speak out in one voice  and immediately publicly renounce adherents who justify hostage-taking,  terrorism and murder in the name of God.  </P> <P> Indeed, there are many who believe that if the Roman Catholic Church had  excommunicated Adolf Hitler and his followers in the 1930s, the Nazi terrorist  state might have been stopped before it dragged the whole world into the abyss.  Recent events make it incumbent that the spiritual leaders of Islam consider  such an option.  </P></p>

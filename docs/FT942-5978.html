			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Jamaica will help US in processing Haitians Jamaica and the US will sign an agreement this week for the Caribbean island to be the first country to help Washington in processing Haitians seeking asylum in the US. Haitian refugees intercepted at sea by US forces will be questioned on ships anchored in Jamaican territorial waters. Mr P J Patterson, Jamaican prime minister, told parliament last night that the agreement will involve the stationing of 'one or two boats', and that he expected the operation to last 'no longer than six months.' There were reports last night that the US was considering the use of three vessels - two cruise ships and a floating hospital. The agreement concludes discussions between the two countries which started a fortnight ago when President Bill Clinton wrote to Mr Patterson to ask for Jamaican assistance in the new US policy of processing Haitian asylum-seekers at sea or in a third country, rather than returning them to Haiti without a hearing. The prime minister did not say when the agreement will take effect and when the processing will begin. Jamaica had agreed to its territorial waters being used because of its concern for the humanitarian problems caused by the present Haitian situation, and because of the Jamaican government's support for the restoration of democratic government in Haiti, Mr Patterson said. Haiti is one of Jamaica's closest neigbours. The US-Jamaican negotiations gathered steam this week with visits to Jamaica by Mr Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of state, and Mr William Gray, President Clinton's special advisor on Haiti. It seems the US had sought permission from the British government to use the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British archipelago to the north of Haiti in the Caribbean, as a station for processing Haitians. However, there was deemed to be not enough room on and near those islands, according to Jamaican officials. The agreement by Jamaica and the US will not commit the island to admit any Haitian refugees, and all costs of the operation will be met by Washington, Mr Patterson said. The US president's decision to have requests by Haitian refugees for asylum processed at sea or in a third country followed criticism of the US government's policy of intercepting Haitian boatpeople and returning them to their homeland without hearing their claims for political asylum. Human rights groups have consistently charged that some of the Haitians who were returned by the US Coast Guard have been killed or otherwise abused by the Haitian military, which has been running the country since it overthrew and exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide two and a half years ago.</p>

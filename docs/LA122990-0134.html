			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TORREY PINES STRUGGLES PAST LINCOLN  </P> <P> John Farrell, coach of the Torrey Pines basketball team and an organizer of the  Above The Rim Hoopwear Classic, was talking about the $6 ticket price before  the tournament began.  </P> <P> He termed the price, "a steal, considering the caliber of the teams involved."  </P> <P> But he couldn't have been talking about the San Diego teams present -- Torrey  Pines, Lincoln and Valhalla -- not unless the ticket price included a free  bottle of No-Doz.  </P> <P> None of the three teams made it into the semifinals, which was not a surprise  considering three of the top 15 teams in the country (according to USA Today  rankings) were on hand.  </P> <P> So the San Diego teams Friday played less than enthusiastically in consolation  games -- that is, if Torrey Pines' 65-47 victory over Lincoln was any  indication.  </P> <P> The Hornets shot 27% from the field. Torrey Pines wasn't much better, making  good on 37% of its shots.  </P> <P> The Falcons' John Allred, was four of 14 from the field, but finished with 14  points to lead Torrey Pines. Chad Davis was four of six, including two of three  from behind the three-point arc, and finished with 13.  </P> <P> Lincoln's Hosa Baker led all scorers with 18 points.  </P> <P> It was Torrey Pines' second game of the day. Earlier, the Falcons shot 46% from  the field, but lost, 69-66, to Payson (Utah).  </P> <P> Craig Brown led the Falcons with 23 in that one. Payson's Bryan Nielson led all  scorers with 24.  </P> <P> In the semifinals:  </P> <P> St. Raymond's 79, Monsignor McClancy 62 -- St. Raymond's advances to today's  champioship game (8 p.m.) at Torrey Pines High School. It will play the winner  of Friday's late game between No. 9 Jersey City (N.J.) St. Anthony's and No. 12  Miami (Fla.) Senior.  </P> <P> Four of St. Raymond's starters have been starting on the varsity since their  sophomore year: forward Carl Greene, center Orlando Antigua and guards Emanuel  Richardson and Terence Rencher.  </P> <P> "And those four are Division I players," said Monsignor McClancy Coach Don  Kent.  </P> <P> Sure enough, Antigua has already committed to Pittsburgh and Rencher to Texas.  The other two are being recruited by a number of schools.  </P> <P> Yet Monsignor McClancy held tight by slowing the tempo in the first half and  went into the locker room down by seven, 37-30. Impressive, considering St.  Raymond's is ranked No. 2 in the nation by USA Today and Monsignor McClancy is  unranked.  </P> <P> But Antigua single-handedly put the game out of reach with 19 second half  points, 11 rebounds and three steals.  </P> <P> Michael Chaplin led Monsignor McClancy with 20 points.  </P> <P> In other games:  </P> <P> Camden 91, Las Vegas Bonanza 58 -- Camden shot 58% from the field and had five  players in double figures, including Greg Barr and Art Crowder, both with 19,  and Vernell Sturdivant and Keith Carmichael, both with 17. Barr also dealt 11  assists and pulled down 10 rebounds.  </P> <P> Deep Creek (Va.) 77, Valhalla 65 -- Greg Taylor finished with 30 points and 13  rebounds to lead Deep Creek. Mark Dillon had 24 for Valhalla, and teammate Mike  Nalu added 20.  </P></p>

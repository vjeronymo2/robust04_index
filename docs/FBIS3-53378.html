It is a continuation of its previous meetings which it  devoted to discussing the current political crisis in the  country and the very negative repercussions it imposes on other  aspects of life, foremost among which is the deterioration in  the economic and monetary situation and its reflections on the  daily lives of citizens who are suffering from an increase in  prices, deterioration of the exchange rate of the national  currency, paralyzation of life in general, and frustration of  people's interests and transactions. Moreover, the  repercussions of this crisis did not stop when they threatened  people's livelihoods. Indeed, they escalated to the point of  threatening the homeland and its people and served to warn of  sedition and war--a war bound to cause sweeping devastation,  falling into the claws of the schemes hostile to unity,  democracy, and independent development. This would result in  the loss of our cultural plan to build a country of order, law,  and constitutional institutions, and to establish a civilian  society based on righteousness and equality and the recognition  of human rights. Our great Yemeni people are fully aware that  the GPC has always sought to deal with this crisis with wisdom  and even-handedness, arming themselves with the spirit of  national accord, and placing national interest above all other  considerations. The General Committee blessed the national  dialogue and reaffirmed its commitment to the results of this  dialogue. Today, it values the efforts of all the forces taking  part in the national dialogue, and their continuous work toward  arriving at solutions to the crisis. Moreover, it was concerned  about dealing with a great sense of responsibility with all  opinions, ideas, and proposals presented for discussion in all  political, media, security fields, as well as issues dealing  with building the country. The General Committee very  regrettably noticed a host of daily acts and practices that  contradict agreements and resolutions reached through the  National Dialogue Committee. This clearly creates more  complications and obstacles to reaching a national agreement to  solve the ongoing crisis, end its repercussions, and contain its  social, security, and psychological effects. These practices,  for example, have taken the following forms:    First, failure to return the military to pre-crisis  locations. Indeed, moves and infringements contradicting the  spirit of national unity and political accord and threatening  social peace have taken place.    Second, divisive measures that do not serve the interests of  all sectors of the Yemeni people, that entrench factionalism and  parochialism, and lend a party coloring to most activities,  thus rendering them totalitarian and undemocratic.    Third, acts of demobilization and mobilization, the creation  of armed units and militias, and parading military forces in a  manner that shocks the average citizens' sentiments; not to  mention the tension and suspicion and doubt it creates within  the military and security institution, the cohesion, solidarity,  and unity of which is one of the guarantees of national unity,  and is an aspect of security and tranquility among the people.    Fourth, violating the document of the government coalition  and parliamentary coordination, which stipulates that  cooperation must be demonstrated by the government members and  agencies. A deliberate failure to attend meetings has been  noticed. This has confused the government's performance, thus  creating clear confusion in the daily administration of the  state's executive body.    The GPC General Committee is aware, with a great sense of  responsibility, of the difficult and complicated circumstances  created by the crisis and warns against the dangers of what is  taking place on the ground in terms of practices that could harm  the results of the national dialogue and obstruct the  implementational measures and executive programs. Indeed, they  could pave the way for another crisis and serious repercussions  of which only God Almighty knows the magnitude and destructive  ramifications.    From this premise, the General Committee calls on all the  unionist national forces to shoulder their high national  responsibility to maintain the safety of our Yemeni homeland and  our unionist democratic struggle against these practices which  are harmful to our great unionist accomplishment and to the  progress, growth, prosperity, security, and safety of our  country. At the same time, it reaffirms the following:    First, the GPC's commitment to the results that are reached  through national dialogue.    Second, demanding that the national dialogue expose the  facts to the people and define every party's responsibility in  the dialogue and its seriousness and determination to allow the  country to reach the shores of safety, as well as its concern  about social accord and peace. In due course, the general  committee will reveal to the public a host of facts that deal  with the background and developments of the crisis.    Third, any procrastination or prevarication about efforts  to resolve the crisis will only create further serious  repercussions that will jeopardize the survival of the homeland  as well as the citizens' lives, particularly since such  procrastination or prevarication would be accompanied by  attempts to obstruct the functioning of constitutional  institutions to show them as impotent and drive the homeland  into the unknown.    Fourth, the General Committee condemns terrorist practices,  kidnappings, and mysterious assassinations, as well as security  violations, which are masterminded and used for political  purposes. Furthermore, it demands that full investigations of  these violations be conducted, and also that the circumstances  surrounding them, as well as their poisoned purposes be made  public.    While observing the serious deterioration in the citizens'  daily lives, the GPC cannot allow itself to view the people's  sufferings, their livelihood problems, as well as their daily  pains and hard living conditions as food for rhetorical  one-upmanship and media vituperations, or as a means for winning  over the hearts and minds of people to promote partisan or  political purposes. This is because the GPC is well aware that  the people's feelings and views are their own property. Only  the people know the reasons for the crisis, know who stands to  benefit from it, and who stands to benefit from its  continuation. Moreover, they are well aware of the GPC's bright  and honorable record, which is replete with national,  humanitarian, and social contributions.    The General Committee views the initiative of their eminence  the ulema and the favorable response to it by Lieutenant General  brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, secretary general of the GPC and  chairman of the Presidential Council, by his agreement to attend  their meeting at the Mu'ad Bin-Jabal Mosque in the Janad area in  the Ta'izz Governorate as an indication of the importance he  attaches to Arab and Islamic traditions. This move by the  brother GPC secretary general was meant to defuse the crisis,  put minds at ease, promote trust among unity orientated leaders,  and launch steps to achieve national accord and agreement. It  is also proof that the brother president and GPC secretary  general has a great sense of responsibility. It is an  expression of the GPC's sincere desire to take the lead in  showing selflessness in order to safeguard our Yemeni homeland's  higher interests, the people's choice, as well as their free  will regarding unity and democracy. This move is also proof  that he is willing to aid our people's efforts to walk the path  of revival and construction. This move also shows his support  for the sincere national efforts to safeguard the future of the  homeland and citizens alike.    The General Committee also hails the initiatives launched by  the Yemeni revolution strugglers, the Armed Forces commanders,  as well as their sincere and honest contributions to spare the  homeland fragmentation and collapse. The General Committee is  extremely satisfied with the results shown by popular gatherings  in the Republic's governorates, for they have shown an eagerness  to safeguard national unity, and called for resolving crises  through dialogue, which is a manifestation of civilized conduct.  Besides, this is the only option for achieving progress in the  country through broad popular participation, and also through  the introduction of further practices, measures, and regulations  that would recreate the administrative relationship between the  state's central authorities and local administrations. This new  relationship must produce the largest possible degree of  participation in decisionmaking with regard to facilitating  daily life in administrative units, as well as local development.    The GPC cannot but highly value these sincere national  stands. As a matter of course, it finds itself on the side of  these masses, supportive of their demands, and appreciative of  their good initiatives. Meanwhile, it salutes them for their  great concern to safeguard national unity and the democratic  march.    Concluding its periodic meeting, the General Committee  appreciated all the sincere national efforts made by political  and social forces to cope with the crisis, as well as the Arab  and international efforts, which showed an eagerness to  safeguard the soundness of the unionist and democratic march in  Yemen. For, this reflects Yemen's standing, as well as its  importance for regional security and stability, not to mention  its role in peace and development. This also reflects the  desire of these parties to see Yemen involved in the efforts to  build a new world order that would produce security, stability,  and prosperity for it, and for the region at large.    And say: Work righteousness: Soon will God observe your  work, and His Apostle and the believers." [Koranic verse]    Issued by the GPC's General Committee, Sanaa, on 11 January  1994.</p>

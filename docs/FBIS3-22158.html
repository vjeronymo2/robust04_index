			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb 2 KYODO -- A government advisory panel on  Wednesday [2 February] proposed a package of measures to  accelerate the phaseout of ozone-depleting chemicals.    The recommendations focus on bringing forward planned  production cutbacks of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other  solvents that destroy the Earth's ozone layer and expanding the  scope of materials subject to output restrictions.    They are contained in an interim report by the chemical  product council, an advisory body to the trade minister.    The package is in response to a provision in the revised  Montreal Protocol, which calls for complete abolition of five  types of CFCs by the end of 1995, instead of 2000 as recommended  originally.    The protocol, revised in November 1992, also called for  total  cessation of halon production by the end of last year and of  trichloroethane manufacture by the end of 1995.    The panel also recommended establishing a legal framework to  ensure adequate control and management of CFC production and  curbing discharge of ozone-depleting materials.    Item-by-item output, however, should not be restricted  because such a step would run counter to the market mechanism,  it said.    The interim report called for efforts by the government and  the private sector to promote effective recycling of CFCs.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Observer Oversight Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Council Chairman would establish an Observer Oversight Committee (Committee) to provide advice to the Council, the Board, the Commissioner of ADF&amp;G, and the Regional Director on general provisions of the observer and fee portions of the Research Plan. NMFS, with the assistance of ADF&amp;G, would annually provide Research Plan reports and budget documents to the Committee. The Committee would consist of industry representatives from the following groups: Factory trawler, catcher trawler, shoreside processor, crab catcher vessel, freezer longliner, non-freezer longliner, crab catcher-processor, vessels under 60 ft (18.3 m) in length overall, observers, observer contractors, and an independent observer training representative. The Committee would meet with NMFS and ADF&amp;G staff within the annual cycle of the Research Plan to review the reports and budgets and provide input to the Council on fee levels and observer coverage needs. The Committee would not have oversight of the daily operations of the Federal and State observer programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Risk-sharing Pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 313 of the Magnuson Act, the Secretary will review the feasibility of establishing a risk-sharing pool to provide comprehensive commercial insurance coverage for vessels and owners, and the availability of such insurance for vessels and owners, against liability from civil suits by observers. If the Secretary determines that a risk-sharing pool is feasible, any implementing regulations would be codified at subpart B of 50 CFR part 677.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comment and Hearings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public comments on the proposed Research Plan and its implementing regulations are invited for 60 days. During this comment period, the Secretary will conduct public hearings, as required by the Magnuson Act, in Alaska, Oregon, and Washington for the purpose of receiving public comments on the proposed regulations (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for dates and locations). NMFS will consider public comments received in preparing the final rule implementing the Research Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Although it would affect all firms in the Research Plan fisheries, it would not decrease revenues by more than 2 percent. Since costs are approximately equal to revenues in the Research Plan fisheries, costs are not expected to go up by more than 2 percent. Thus, while a substantial number of small entities would be affected, the effect is not expected to be economically significant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. These collections of information have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval. Public reporting burden for each year of this collection is estimated to average 0.5 hours per response for completing the semi-annual Federal Processing Permit Application, 0.25 hours per response for notifying contractors of needs for observers, and 1.0 hour per response to provide information to document claims of disputed bills. For the first year of the Research Plan, completion of Observer Coverage Rebate Application forms is estimated to average 0.16 hours per response. All reporting burden estimates include the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates, or any other aspect of the data requirements, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to NMFS (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503 (ATTN: NOAA Desk Officer).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

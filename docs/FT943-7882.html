			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Leading Article: A raise in time may save nine This week it became still more obvious that short-term rates of interest are passing their trough. This is excellent news, mostly because it means the recovery is increasingly well-established. Since disinflationary forces are strongly at work as well, there is a good chance that the forthcoming interest rate increases will not be particularly sharp. This could, in fact, prove to be the start of a sustained and unprecedentedly global economic expansion. The lead is being given, as usual, by the US. Wednesday's decision by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates by half a percentage point was a pre-emptive move. While the timing was widely expected, the size of the increase was not. Presumably, Mr Alan Greenspan and his colleagues have concluded from the bond market's reaction to the minuscule increase in short-term rates announced at the beginning of February that they might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb. This particular sheep could stay on the Federal Reserve's table for some time, since policy cannot be far from the 'neutrality' sought by Mr Greenspan. Meanwhile, the only question in the UK, now well on the road of recovery, is when short-term interest rates will rise. Some time this year remains likely, despite this week's excellent news on inflation. Amongst major industrial economies, Japan is furthest from recovery. Yet the Bank of Japan has not held on to its 1.75 per cent discount rate for almost a year to lower it now, particularly when it can spy green shoots, including faster growth of the Japanese money supply. If short-term rates of interest are to fall anywhere it will be in continental Europe. But the increasing strength of the recovery there, demonstrated in this week's release of the European Commission's business and consumer survey for July, is making substantial reductions decreasingly likely. The German discount rate has been 4.5 per cent since May. While still above the new US rate of 4 per cent, the traditionally cautious Bundesbank lacks any compelling reason for further cuts. Fastest growth Within the group of seven leading industrial countries, Germany, of all countries, has suffered the fastest growth of broad money over the most recent 12-month period, at around 10 per cent. The performance of the other six has varied between monetary contraction in France, at one end, and growth of 6.6 per cent in Italy, at the other. In between come stagnation in Japan and the US, and a rise of 4.8 per cent in the case of the UK. The relation between monetary growth and inflation is not close enough for precise steerage, but such restrained growth of money and credit seems quite incompatible with an inflationary take-off. This performance is linked to why the recovery has proved voteless in many countries. In the 1980s many people bet on yet another inflationary upsurge, notably by investing in residential and commercial property. Fortunately, they bet wrongly. As a result of this pardonable mistake - pardonable in view of what happened in the 1970s - many still find themselves burdened by debt. They are victims of mistaken inflationary expectations, as surely as those who lent money in the 1970s were victims of their confidence in money. Good news The resultant moneyless recovery is good news. It means not just that inflation should remain restrained, but that resources are more likely to go into additional production than into more speculative assets. An important economic question is what else might halt the recovery. The commodity-price rise already looks like yesterday's story, marking a correction rather than a trend. Equally, provided monetary growth remains slow and the authorities act pre-emptively, the correction in bond markets this year could reverse. In the biggest three economies, interest rates on long-term bonds have, in fact, already stabilised over the last three months. If anything is likely to go wrong it is with fiscal policy. Some industrial countries already suffer from very high public indebtedness. A world economy that is enjoying high economic growth, particularly throughout much of the developing world, will have high real rates of interest. When inflation is lower than nervous investors fear, real rates of interest are pushed higher still. No industrial country can stabilise its ratio of public debt to gross domestic product without running a significant primary budget surplus - that is, surplus without interest payments. That is politically unpopular. It can only be done with a combination of high taxes and tight control on spending  -yet another reason for this recovery to be voteless. However difficult it may be, a prize is there to be won. The global economy has probably the best chance of a long and sustained expansion since the 1960s. This is also truly a global expansion, one that offers hope to an unprecedentedly large proportion of the world's population.</p>

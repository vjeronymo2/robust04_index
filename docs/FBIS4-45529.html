President  Cesar Gaviria, political and private sector leaders, and average  citizens all issued calls today for a defense of the nation's  greatness and dignity.    Colombia is a large and good country, and most Colombians  agree with this and oppose those antagonistic citizens who are  attempting to drive us into pessimism. Not even our national  soccer team's recent defeats or the calls of cowardice cloaked  by anonymity will allow anxiety and uncertainty to return to  Colombia.    Every Colombian agrees on one single truth: Colombia is  greater that those who seek to destroy it. [begin recording]    President Cesar Gaviria: We must not allow the  cartels to emerge victorious in what constitutes their main  objectives: to divide allies in the struggle against organized  crime. When judicial cooperation fails, the cartels win. When  Colombia's image overseas is tarnished, the cartels win. When  the credibility of our political leadership is attacked, the  cartels win. The cartels are quite aware of this.    Vice President-elect Humberto De la Calle Lombana:  As the president of the Republic pointed out, we also reject all  of these malicious and ill-intended attacks whose ultimate  victim will be Colombia. Over the past few days, these  malicious and ill-intended attacks have been circulating  throughout the foreign media.    Carlos Arturo Angel, president of the National  Association of Industrialists: We will continue to work.  We simply believe that these are unfortunate incidents which  damage us, but they will not stain our country's name. This is  a good country. A country of men and women who are determined  to forge ahead at all times.    Ernesto Lima, president of the Lima Insurance Co.:  I am quite certain the new administration will know how to  direct the country toward very optimistic objectives. I am sure  that the country, which has been properly directed in recent  years, will continue to be directed adequately by Dr. Ernesto  Samper.    Sabas Pretelt de la Vega, president of the National  Federation of Businessmen: I do not believe that we should  return to the past days of violence. The business sector is  willing to support Colombia and the new administration in the  state modernization process and in all of their attempts to  strengthen Colombia's institutions.

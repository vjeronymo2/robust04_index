			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ARCTIC FISHERMEN FIGHT CHILL IN ECONOMY;  </P> <P> NORWAY: AS JOBS DISAPPEAR, MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR HARSH  BUT BELOVED HOMELAND.  </P> <P> The tough Norwegians of the north can ride out the savage storms, the isolation  and the winter darkness that lasts for two months. It is the region's shattered  economy that is forcing many to leave.  </P> <P> "Most people very strongly want to stay here. I can't explain it. It's hard to  make the people of south Norway understand, much less foreigners," said Vigor  Rossvaer, a University of Tromsoe researcher.  </P> <P> For unemployed fisherman Vidar Esbensen, the answer is simple: "This is home."  </P> <P> The Norwegian Arctic is vast, sparsely populated and beautiful, with snowcapped  mountains sloping down into the fiords and the northern lights staging nightly  shows. But gorgeous scenery doesn't pay the mortgage.  </P> <P> Unemployment, alcoholism and the death rate have long been higher than the  Norwegian average. Then, in January, codfish quotas were slashed to protect  declining Barents Sea stocks, putting a chokehold on the region's main income.  </P> <P> "You can't live on the quota, and you don't quite die from it either," said  Esbensen, 35, who was thrown out of work when the cod quota was cut to 130,000  tons from 350,000.  </P> <P> In early February, the government offered a $77-million bailout package --  mainly interest relief on state loans -- to tide fishermen over while long-term  solutions are sought.  </P> <P> Disappointed fishermen called the package "a Band-Aid on a bullet wound" and  threatened strikes.  </P> <P> In the northernmost province of Finnmark, unemployment is 7.7%,compared to 3.9%  in Oslo, Norway's capital. The county population has been falling for 40 years,  and it dropped by 6.8% in the last decade to 75,000.  </P> <P> A survey of those who left indicated that 51.6% sought better jobs or schools,  while 22.7% said they were driven off by bad weather and the depressing 24-hour  winter nights.  </P> <P> Rossvaer said the north is a victim of ecology, economy and even world  politics. International pressure forced an end to whale hunting, an important  industry.  </P> <P> Improving relations with the Soviet Union is both menacing and encouraging,  especially in Finnmark, which curls eastward, as if on a map maker's whim, over  northern Sweden and Finland to butt against the Soviet Union along a 122-mile  border.  </P> <P> Some residents fear a scaling back of the permanent military presence and  periodic North Atlantic Treaty Organization maneuvers, which brought airports,  bus services, roads and employment to the north. On the other hand, an open  Soviet border could mean income from trade and tourism.  </P> <P> Business analyst Sven Oppegaard predicts a reconstruction of the region's  economic and social base. Scattered hamlets, where residents catch and process  their own fish, will give way to larger, more efficient centers, he says.  </P> <P> Some fishing stations already are abandoned.  </P> <P> "We can't have a tiny village with a church, school and fish factory on every  little point of land," said Oppegaard, of the Norwegian Confederation of  Business and Industry.  </P> <P> The military disagrees. Residents in villages dotting the long, jagged coast  report on Soviet naval activity, said Gunnar Angeltveit of the Defense  Ministry.  </P> <P> Modern pressures are building up in this once-isolated, tightly knit coastal  society, which may account for the 73% increase in suicides from 1975 to 1985  and rising alcohol abuse, said Rossvaer.  </P> <P> "There is a conflict of two cultures. One is modern Norway, with its  attractions, and the other is the traditional coastal culture," he said.  </P> <P> Northerners are friendly, open, imaginative -- and sometimes wishful. Most  villages, even those seldom visited, have a local polar museum, adorned with  relics of seal and whale hunts.  </P> <P> Locals scratching for opportunities see tourism as a way to help preserve  fading ways of life: whale hunting with cameras, reindeer rides and dog-sled  treks. One suggested selling tourists neckties made from salmon skins.  </P> <P> "We will do whatever we can to hang on," said Esbensen. "It's hard in the  Barents, especially in storms, but there is a freedom out there. I've tried  working on land. I couldn't take it."  </P> <P> Not everyone can stick it out. Two years after its fish-processing plant  closed, the village of Bugoeynes won national attention with an advertisement  seeking a new home in the south -- anywhere with jobs and room for all 300  villagers.  </P> <P> "We don't really want to leave. This is a cry for help," one villager admitted.  </P> <P> "They're a symbol of a people trying to keep their society intact, even if it  means moving south together," Rossvaer said.  </P></p>

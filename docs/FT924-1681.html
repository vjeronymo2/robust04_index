			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / West divided on using force in Bosnia THE US yesterday called for 'more aggressive measures' by the international community against the Bosnian Serbs, but other countries opposed military intervention in the Bosnian conflict. In Paris, a French junior foreign minister, Mr Georges Kiejman, said the US was proposing the pre-emptive bombing of Serb targets in an effort to halt the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems, but that France and Britain opposed such a move. Instead, France and Britain supported the interception and, if necessary, the destruction of Serb aircraft which violated the United Nations Security Council's ban on flights over Bosnia. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary did not deny that such measures were being discussed at the UN and elsewhere, but stressed that no agreement had yet been reached. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, said in Paris yesterday he backed the use of force if necessary but he added it was vital that the EC and the UN continued to act together. Mr Beregovoy told parliament: 'The French government does not rule out any solution to bring the massacres to an end.' Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, Secretary of State in the outgoing US administration, addressing the 29-nation conference on the former Yugoslavia in Geneva, made no mention of a pre-emptive bombing proposal. But he specifically referred to the US and other governments' recommendation that the Security Council should authorise enforcement of the 'no-fly' zone in Bosnia and re-examine the arms embargo against Bosnia-Hercegovina. Mr Eagleburger said that it was essentially the Serbs who had broken the promises made at last August's London conference on the former Yugoslavia, which included commitments to ensure unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid, to lift the siege of cities, to halt all military flights over Bosnia, to place all heavy weapons under UN monitoring and to shut down all detention camps. 'It is clear that the reckless leaders of Serbia, and of the Serbs inside Bosnia, have somehow convinced themselves that the international community will not stand up to them now and will be forced eventually to recognise the fruits of their aggression and the results of ethnic cleansing.' Both Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the two co-chairmen of the Geneva peace conference on the former Yugoslavia, counselled caution on military measures to enforce the ban on flights and came out firmly against a lifting of the arms embargo in favour of the Bosnian Moslems. Mr Vance recognised that breaches of the Security Council's no-fly zone resolution needed to be examined. But he emphasised that UNPROFOR, the UN protection force in the former Yugoslavia, had not detected any use of fixed-wing aircraft in support of combat operations in Bosnia-Hercegovina since the resolution was passed two months ago. Nor could it supply any confirmation of allegations that helicopters had been used in an offensive role. In deciding whether to employ military measures to enforce the flight ban, the Security Council had to take into account the risk of retaliatory action against UN troops and aid workers.</p>

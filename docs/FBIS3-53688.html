			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Taba, 18 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser and head of the  Palestinian side to the Gaza-Jericho Committee, has stated that  the general atmosphere of today's talks was more positive than  the round that concluded last week.    In statements he made today at the end of the first day of  meetings of the Gaza-Jericho Committee's current round of talks,  he added that we must wait until tomorrow to find out the extent  of the progress that can be made in this round. He noted that  no tangible progress was made today due to lack of time.    He said that the Israeli side still rejects the idea of  raising the Palestinian flag over the crossings because it is a  symbol of the Palestinian state. However, he adds, we call on  the Israelis to adopt a new mode of thinking that befits the  peace atmosphere. At this stage, this flag is a symbol of the  Palestinian identity and not a symbol of the state.    Dr. Nabil Sha'th clarified that there were some differences  over the crossings into Gaza and Jericho, as well as over the  border points from Egypt, Gaza, Jordan, and the Jericho area,  and defining the method of control over these crossings. He  noted the importance of cooperation and coordination regarding  the control over the crossings between the two sides.    He said the Palestinian side did not present any new  proposals on the subject of the crossings. But the Palestinian  paper that was presented during the previous round and the  Israeli paper submitted today constitute the two stances that  need to be agreed on.    He added that the Palestinian side accepts the Israeli  electronic supervision of the crossings because it preserves the  dignity of people and is secure at the same time. It also  prevents weapons from being smuggled across the crossings, as  well as catching people who carry out acts of aggression.    Dr. Sha'th said that some progress was made in Civil Affairs  Committee's activities, which specializes in the transfer of  authority, services, and facilities from the Israeli side to the  Palestinian side. He noted that some progress could be made in  issuing the personal identity cards and residence permits, the  historic sites, and various other subjects. He affirmed that he  expects the Civil Affairs Committee to end its work next week  through written texts.    He affirmed that the Palestinian-Jordanian economic and  security agreement, which was recently signed, has improved and  bolstered the atmosphere of the Gaza-Jericho Committee  negotiations.    He added that the political determination to find an  agreement is what determines how long the Gaza-Jericho  negotiations will continue. He noted that in the case where  this determination is available, three weeks is enough to reach  an agreement between the two sides. Otherwise, the negotiations  will take much longer.</p>

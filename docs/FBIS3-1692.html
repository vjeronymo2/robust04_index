			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The German Government  expressed hopes today that the peace process in former  Yugoslavia will not be held up by the shooting down of four  aircraft over Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Government spokesman Dieter Vogel told a news briefing here  that the peace process cannot be broken off.    He said the four planes, identified as Bosnian Serb but  denied by them, clearly violated the UN Security Council  resolution banning flights over the war-torn area in Bosnia.    NATO said the aircraft were Bosnian Serb planes and had  carried out a bombing raid on Muslim-held territory.    Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SDP), while condoning  the attack, nevertheless described it as a serious incident.    "Military action is always accompanied by the danger of it  escalating," the SDP leadership said in a statement. It hoped  the incident would clear the way for a political solution to the  Bosnian conflict.    Germany has joined other NATO countries in enforcing the  Bosnian no-fly zone, but its participation is limited to the use  of its airmen on AWACS planes.</p>

Why should increasing peasant incomes take center stage?  One, with adequate food and clothing, income becomes the  peasants' greatest concern. They will abandon their farmland if  over time farming proves unprofitable. Two, increasing the  effective supply of agricultural products, including growth in  total volume, structural optimization, and quality improvement,  is necessarily related to peasant incomes. Peasants now have a  clear idea of how much they can earn or lose from what they grow  and breed. Increases in output without corresponding increases  in income would do nothing to stabilize agriculture. Three,  agricultural development in the past often ignored peasant  market roles. One of the important reasons why we have had weak  market demand is the failure to widen rural markets. The demand  of some 200-million strong city population cannot possibly  absorb the rapid growth of the entire national economy. To  enliven rural markets, it is necessary to increase peasant  incomes over the years. Four, by the end of this century,  people throughout the whole country, above all peasants, should  be enjoying relatively well-off living standards.    Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly stressed: "The whole political  situation will be unstable if rural areas are unstable. Our  country cannot be said to have eradicated poverty if it still  exists in rural areas." Therefore, increasing peasant incomes  is not an isolated problem, but a strategic problem concerning  the prosperity and development of the entire national economy.    To increase peasant incomes more quickly, it is necessary to  take the entire political situation into account,  conscientiously implement the spirit of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Central Rural  Work Conference, and pursue the following tasks properly:  <H5>  Increase Inputs Into Rural Areas </H5>   Since the founding of the country, industrial development  has  mainly been based on a capital base built up by agriculture but  conditions have changed. This strategy of industrial  development based on agricultural accumulation must change.  Adjustment should also be made in infrastructure investment,  budgetary financial capital, and credit capital mix.    Leading comrades from the central committee and State  Council  have stressed repeatedly that the urgent needs posed by  agricultural development must be met, even if it means  postponing a few industrial projects. Increasing input is meant  to correct the state of affairs wherein agriculture is getting  far too small a proportion of input for the development of the  entire national economy. One, increases in credit; two, an  increase in investment in infrastructure projects; and three,  increases in financial inputs. These are key conditions for  maintaining agriculture as the foundation of the economy.  <H5>  Actively Adjust Agricultural Production and Product Mix </H5>   The crux of the problem for agricultural development is that  it is next to impossible to reverse the trends of diminishing  farmland and increasing populations and market demand. With  these two nonreversals, to increase peasant incomes it is  necessary to rationalize the use of available resources and  continuously adjust the agricultural structure.    One underlying principle for adjustments in agricultural  production and product mix is that they must be pursued while  total grain output is steadily rising. Last year, the State  Council announced the "Outline on China's Agricultural  Development in the 1990's" and the "Outline on Reforms and  Development of Food Mix in China in the 1990's," which are  documents providing guidance for adjustments in agricultural  production and product mix and developing high-yield,  good-quality, high-efficiency agriculture. The central rural  work conference convened earlier decided to pursue vigorously a  number of models of high-yield, good-quality, high-efficiency  agricultural zones. The State Planning Commission and  agricultural and forestry departments have provided specific  details for implementation. The adoption of these measures is  aimed at speeding up adjustment in agricultural production and  product mix. There must be efforts to invigorate agriculture  with science and education, fully exploit modern science and  technology, extend and apply the existing agricultural  technologies with a view to turning them into productive forces.  Grain and cotton breeds must be renewed and their strains and  quality upgraded to increase returns. We must also vigorously  develop the processing, transportation, and sales of  agricultural products to coordinate development in the primary,  secondary, and tertiary industries in rural areas to achieve  added value for agricultural products and increase peasant  incomes.  <H3>  Enlivening the Circulation of Agricultural Products and  Rural Markets </H3>   1. Bring production and markets together by means of  information and contracts. Prices for most of the agricultural  products have been deregulated, except for a few such as cotton  and cocoons. The main problem now is that production by  scattered peasant households is out of touch with market demand.  Many peasants do not know what is going on in the market and  cannot adjust to market demand, not knowing what to produce,  what will sell, and what can fetch good prices. Therefore, it  is extremely necessary to provide information for peasants,  strengthen the effort to build an agricultural product supply  and demand information network, predict and issue bulletins on  the supply and demand, and provide updated information for  peasants in production and operations.    2. Actively guide and organize peasants to enter markets and  build a bridge between production and demand so that the two can  meet. Recently, the operating modes, such as trade-industrial-  agricultural integration, production-processing-sale strings,  firms-led peasant households, and various special associations,  are all better organizational forms in which to guide peasants  toward markets. We must actively supports these forms. We must  break through the restrictions of the ownership system and  administrative regions, orient toward domestic and international  market, guide the agricultural, industrial, commercial, trading,  and technological sectors together to form a risk- and  benefit-sharing common body through socialized services and  channeling of interests.    3. Form an agricultural product market system and build a  normal operating order. To foster and promote a market system,  the state has deregulated most of the prices and operations of  agricultural products, and pursued the policy of allowing  markets to decide prices for agricultural products and different  modes of operation. However, some localities have erected  regional and customs barriers, preventing the circulation of  commodities and the formation of a great national market and  hindering production development. A market is a system. We  must create a primary-product market for producers and a retail  market in sales regions. Most importantly, we must establish  various wholesaling markets. Under unified planning, we can  establish an agricultural product market system centering on  wholesale markets linking up the producers and sellers of key  agricultural products, such as grains and cotton, through  wholesaling markets and establish legally safeguarded economic  relations.  <H3>  Continued Efforts To Underwrite the Healthy Development of  Township and Town Enterprises </H3>   The main objective for developing township and town  enterprises is to put the development of township and town  enterprises on the track of technological progress and upgrade  the quality of labor force. Blind launching of projects and  competing for rates should be avoided. There must be vigorous  efforts to promote and technologically transform and adjust the  product mix and pursue strict scientific management to raise  economic efficiency.    The eastern region must orient toward efficiency and  exporting and adjust the product mix to make improvements in  standards, quality, scale, and efficiency. The central and  western regions must increase the pace of development, organize  the implementation of the "east-west cooperation and development  project," and promote mutual supplementation of comparative  advantages and mutual development. The development of small  industrial zones will trigger the that of small towns and  promote the development of tertiary industry in rural areas.  <H5>  Gradually Transfer Rural Surplus Labor </H5>   One of the causes of slow peasant income growth is the  absence of full employment. At present, there is a 170 million  surplus rural labor force, representing one of the more  outstanding rural problems. Practical situations suggest that  it is possible to transfer part of this surplus rural labor  force to industry and other nonagricultural sectors. From 1985  to 1988, the country transferred on average about 10 million  people each year and 11 million by 1992.    In recent years, peasant incomes derived from labor services  have become an important source of income. In 1985, the per  capita labor service income was 27 yuan, rising to 82 yuan in  1992, 10.5 percent of the year's per capita pure income for  peasants. Localities cite many successes in this regard.  Leaders from Lin County, Henan Province, led, in an organized  manner, peasants as early as the 1980's to work in construction  industry outside the province. Riding on the name of Henan being  the home for traditional fine handicraft workers, this  130,000-strong construction labor force travelled through  Taihang all over the country to earn income for themselves and  create wealth for the country. They returned with much  information and introduced talents and technology, which  promoted the healthy development of township and town  enterprises in the whole county. Last year, per capita pure  income in the whole county was 792 yuan and is expected to reach  some 900. The combined economic strength of the county rose  from 44th to 14th in the province's county-level ranking.  Experience from localities show that transferring rural surplus  labor force must proceed in various ways: One, vigorously  develop township and town enterprises. Plans are in place to  transfer another 50 million by the end of this century, though  this figure can be exceeded considerably. Two, develop and  fully exploit agricultural resources, extend the space of  development for agriculture and create jobs from it. Three, on  the basis of policy coordination, actively create conditions to  get farm hands to work in townships and towns. Four, develop in  a planned manner small towns, and vigorously develops secondary  and tertiary industries to channel rural surplus labor force  toward nonagricultural sectors.  <H5>  Continue To Pursue the Task of Reducing Peasant Burdens </H5>   Reducing peasant burdens is a policy-directed measure for  maintaining peasants' production motivation. Since last year,  governments and departments concerned at all levels have  conscientiously carried out various policies on reducing peasant  burdens and done much painstaking work. They have effectively  curbed arbitrary apportioning, levying, and financing and  reduced much of peasants' unreasonable burdens. Peasants called  the burden reduction policy one of the Communist Party's big  services for the people. But down on the field, factors that  may potentially increase the burdens for peasants remain. Some  departments are thinking of restoring some financing and levy  charges for some public charities. This is understandable. For  a department, the problem is not big. But when all departments  are asking money from peasants for different projects, peasants  will have a hard time. They can hardly bear all these burdens  with their low income.    We should all think with the overall situation in mind and  continue to adopt effective measures to reduce peasants' burdens.  <H5>  Pursue Well the Support-the-Poor Scheme </H5>   At present, there are more than 80 million people across the  country for whom having enough to eat and to cloth themselves is  still a problem. Without this problem for this part of the  population, it is hard to achieve the relatively well-off living  standards for the whole country. To solve the problem of  getting enough to eat and keep warm for this 80 million, the  State Council has decided to formulate and implement a "eight  seven plan to take on the hardest parts of the support-the-poor  scheme." Under the plan, from this year up to the end of this  century, the problem of having enough to eat and keep warm for  this number of people will be basically solved in seven years'  time; and, further, they will have eradicated poverty on their  way to prosperity. The next step consists of the formulation  and implementation of the "eight seven plan to take on the  hardest parts of the support-the-poor scheme." One, a serious  summing up of the work and study to put forward new methods and  measures for the support-the-poor scheme under the new  situation. Two, perfect various policies and measures and  increase input into the scheme. The central authorities are  continuing with the program of getting the aided areas to repay  relief with grains and low-to middle-standard industrial  products. The additional parts of such a program concentrate on  transport and communications in poor regions to ensure that  there are roads to ensure improvements in necessary production  and living conditions. Three, management of funds and materials  for the support-the-poor scheme must be relatively centralized  to be allocated rationally on a regional mix basis, with a view  to gradually spending more in the poorest areas in the central  and western regions.</p>

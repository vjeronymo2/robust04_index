			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Usborne plans expansion via Pounds 4.6m rights Usborne is raising Pounds 4.64m net through a rights issue to strengthen and expand its core activities of grain merchanting and pig production and marketing. Accompanying the funding details is a forecast for the 18 months to June 30, putting pre-tax profit on at least Pounds 1.57m, after write-downs, against losses of Pounds 4.12m for the 1991 year. Shareholders will be offered 26.2m shares on a 2-for-5 basis at 19p. The shares were unchanged yesterday at 25p. The majority of the rights proceeds will provide additional working capital to support geographical and product expansion, particularly during the peak autumn and winter periods when grain purchases were made for storage. The balance will go partially to refinancing the Pounds 1.75m initial consideration paid in a recent deal with Unigate. Under that Usborne expanded its pig stocks through the Pounds 5.25m purchase of a substantial portion of Unigate's outdoor reared pigs. Usborne will supply Unigate with pigs for bacon processing over a six and a half year period on terms that allow it a fixed margin over costs. The forecast profit takes into account a property write-down of Pounds 1.31m. The final dividend is expected to be 0.4p on increased capital, to make 0.8p for the period (0.4p for previous year).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Newsbrief" program, presented by Patricia Glyn] </F>   [Text] [Glyn] We have Barry Claassen on the line, reporting  for Newsbrief from the Library Gardens in central Johannesburg.  Barry, can you hear me?    [Claassen] I can hear you.    [Glyn] Barry, can you tell us, where were those shots coming  from? It seemed to be unclear when you last spoke to us.    [Claassen] Well, it appears that there are snipers on the  rooftops, shooting down into the crowds. The police are  shooting back with what appear to be 9 mm pistols. I personally  came across a man lying in the street. It looked as if he'd  been shot in the head, blood pouring out of his head, and he  wasn't moving. We've now heard an unconfirmed report of about  15 people being shot. How many of those have been killed, I  don't know, but as you might hear in the background, there's  still sporadic gunfire being heard. At the moment it's very  chaotic, with people crowding into shop doorways and trying to  keep down. It's total, it's complete chaos here.    [Glyn] Are any of the snipers on top of the city council  building?    [Claassen] Not that we can see. Some of the high buildings,  but not the city council building at this stage, but anything is  possible. You know, you can't always make out where the shots  are coming from, but I did see snipers up on the buildings. Who  they are, I'm not quite sure.    [Glyn] But the crowd is making no attempt to disperse? Do I  understand that?    [Claassen] At the moment, not. I think they most probably  might be too terrified to move away, so what they're doing is,  they're lying down on the pavement.    [Glyn] Barry, I'm sure we'll hear from you again, but do  take  care of yourself.</p>

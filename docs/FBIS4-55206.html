			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondents report: "Duray, Marko, Vekas Express Views </F> on the First Round of Elections in Hungary"]    [Text] The leader of the Coexistence Movement in Slovakia,  a party that is close to the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]  among the political parties in Hungary, told MAGYAR HIRLAP  yesterday that the victory of the Socialists in Hungary could  lead to cooler relations between the ethnic Hungarians beyond  the borders and the government in Budapest.    Miklos Duray pointed out that "whether we like it or not,  the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is the successor party of  Kadar's Hungarian Socialist Workers Party [MSZMP]." Miklos  Duray thinks that the reason behind the big success of the MSZP  is that some of the voters find the change in the regime too  difficult. In his view, "the MSZP slogans on professional  governing are not convincing, because the MSZP cannot make  wonders either if it wants to continue the market economy, the  change in the regime, and catching up with the West."    Regarding the relations between the ethnic Hungarians beyond  our borders and Budapest, Duray draws a line between the MSZP  and the other five parties that have made it into Parliament.  He reminds the readers that it was the MSZP alone that  categorically criticized the late prime minister Jozsef Antall's  declaration at the time, namely that he felt like the prime  minister of 15 million Hungarians in spirit, and it was only the  MSZP that categorically placed the issue of signing a basic  treaty with our neighbors on the agenda as a first point,  leaving the issue of settling the situation of ethnic Hungarians  abroad as a second point.    Well before the elections, Duray told us that the relations  between the ethnic Hungarians living abroad and Budapest will  cool down if the MSZP gets into power. He repeated this opinion  in his telephone interview on 9 May: "If the MSZP continues to  follow this position, the relations will definitely become  cooler, similarly to the Kadar period" -- said Duray. However,  Duray did not think that the MSZP would form a government alone  and so, "the coalition partner can also have a say in this  matter."    The Slovak partner of the MSZP, the Party of the Democratic  Left, has not yet taken upon itself to evaluate the elections.  However, party chairman Peter Weiss does not find the presence  of trade union leaders in Parliament a dangerous phenomenon.    In its position, the Hungarian Civic Party points out the  following: It became clear that the people want basic changes;  they are more interested in the future, rather than the constant  threat of past sins. The victory of the MSZP does not mean a  radical change in Hungary's domestic and foreign policy;  perhaps, this policy will only be more transparent,  professional, and confident. A calm and balanced social-liberal  government can also create the conditions for settling Hungary's  relations with its neighbors; consequently, Hungary could also  deal with the problem of ethnic Hungarians living abroad from  the position of tangible results -- the position states.    Arpad Duka-Zolyomi, the head of the parliamentary group  Coexistence, told MAGYAR HIRLAP that the contacts of his  movement with the new government will obviously not be so good  as with the MDF government, because their relations with the MDF  were "more than just official contacts."    The principled position of the Democratic Union of Vojvodina  Hungarians [VMDK] is that it refrains from judging the Hungarian  parties from an ideological viewpoint and it sticks to its goal  of building good contacts with the prevailing Hungarian  government -- Janos Vekas, deputy chairman of the VMDK told  MAGYAR HIRLAP.    Vekas told us that they have had correct relations with the  MSZP so far and the fact that [MSZP Chairman] Gyula Horn was the  first to support the VMDK after the crisis that developed in the  wake of the general meeting in Zenta meant a lot to the VMDK.  "We participated in several conferences organized by the  socialists, conferences dealing with the issue of national  minority autonomy. We think the MSZP has been a correct partner  so far" -- Vekas said.    "The Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [RMDSZ --  UDMR  in Romanian] and the ethnic Hungarians living in Romania are  following the Hungarian elections with great interest; it is in  our interest to have a politically stable Hungary with a strong  economy to support us, a country that can and wants to support  the ideas of the Hungarians living abroad and the concepts of  their legitimate organizations" -- RMDSZ chairman Bela Marko  told MAGYAR HIRLAP. He stressed, however, that he does not want  to make predictions or evaluations between the two rounds of  elections.    In Marko's view, we must start from the premise that every  major political party in Hungary accepted the need to settle the  situation of ethnic Hungarians abroad as a basic principle.  This is a nationwide interest, one considered by any future  government, and one that the Hungarian foreign policy will  always have to represent.    "We know the programs of various parties and, based on this  knowledge, we can say that care for the ethnic Hungarians living  beyond Hungary's borders appears in every program. Naturally,  there can be tactical differences. In our view, in the case of  ethnic Hungarians living abroad, and especially in the case of  Hungarians in Transylvania, we must start from the premise that  it is first of all the task of the elected organization of these  minorities to decide what solutions they find positive.  Seeking, supporting, and implementing these solutions could  basically contribute to an adequate settling of the problems  prevailing between our countries" -- Bela Marko said.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Ireland's caretaker Prime Minister Charles Haughey, abandoning his resistance  to a coalition government, began a week of talks with Desmond O' Malley, leader  of the Progressive Democrats in an effort to form a new government. "A new  political era is in sight," O' Malley told deputies in Parliament as his small  center-right party began its battle for Cabinet seats alongside Haughey, whose  Fianna Fail party has never shared power in its 63-year history. Parliament  agreed to adjourn until next Wednesday when it hopes to pick a new prime  minister and end a monthlong political crisis.  </P></p>

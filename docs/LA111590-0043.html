			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIAL REBUTS CHALLENGES TO CENSUS FIGURES  </P> <P> Census Bureau officials warned Los Angeles and other cities Wednesday that many  population count challenges are likely to be dismissed because local officials  tried to pass off vacant buildings, empty lots and other uninhabited places as  occupied housing units.  </P> <P> Delivering her sharpest rebuttal to date of charges that census enumerators  undercounted many communities, Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant told the  census and population subcommittee of the House Post Office and Civil Service  Committee that early housing unit counts "were largely accurate."  </P> <P> Bryant acknowledged that the bureau had committed some coding errors, resulting  in overlooked dwellings, but she said that the agency corrected those mistakes  when found by punching updated information into a computer database.  </P> <P> Bryant said that the bureau's computers were able to correct mistakes made by  census counters in New Jersey, who reportedly fabricated information about some  hard-to-count households without actually visiting them. An investigation into  the allegations resulted in census officials recounting 18,303 households in  northern New Jersey.  </P> <P> Bryant said that the bureau is unwilling, however, to recount some blocks  flagged by city officials because they contained "large amounts of error or are  out-of-date compared to census counts."  </P> <P> Referring to the bureau's efforts to correct its counting errors, Rep. Thomas  C. Sawyer, the Ohio Democrat who heads the subcommittee, said: "I'm grateful  they made the effort, but concerned they had to."  </P> <P> Bryant, however, charged that local officials had made far worse mistakes in  their efforts to discredit the bureau's preliminary figures.  </P> <P> "There was one lively example in Queens (New York), where the city said there  were 414 housing units on what turns out to be a piece of the Gateway National  Recreation Area, and all we can find are three lifeguard benches," she said.  </P> <P> Bryant declined to identify other cities that made such mistakes or to quantify  the number of claims expected to be rejected for bogus documentation. The  bureau is expected to respond to the cities' challenges later this month.  </P> <P> The challenges involve preliminary census findings released in September as  part of the bureau's efforts to review the accuracy of the decennial census.  Many urban mayors, state governors and congressional leaders have complained  that their localities were undercounted.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, city officials reported that the census missed nearly 49,000  dwellings, or almost 6% of the city's total housing stock.  </P> <P> Across the country, about 25% of 39,198 local governments officially responded  to the bureau's findings, including eight large cities that questioned the  counts of more than 2,000 residential blocks in their jurisdictions.  </P> <P> Lance Simmens, assistant executive director of the U.S. Conference of Mayors,  said that because city leaders did not know which challenges would be rejected  by the bureau, they could not respond to Bryant's charge that inaccurate data  was used to support their challenges.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Simmens used the census director's comments as an opportunity "to  reiterate our call for a statistical correction of the 1990 census." The  conference has served as an umbrella group in a series of legal battles with  census officials.  </P> <P> Bryant said that the bureau is on schedule to meet a legal requirement to  deliver a final count of the nation's population to President Bush before Dec.  31.  </P> <P> "I will not speculate on what those numbers will be," she told the panel. "That  is an announcement for the President to make."  </P></p>

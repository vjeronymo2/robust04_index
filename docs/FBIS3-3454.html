			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 22 (AFP)--China strongly criticized  India Tuesday [22 March] for failing to prevent a recent  conference on Tibet from being held in New Delhi, slamming the  event as a "gross interference" in its internal affairs. "We  deeply deplore that such anti-China political activities had not  been forestalled on the territory of India," said a foreign  ministry spokesman, referring to last week's All-Party Indian  Parliamentary Forum for Tibet.    The three-day convention, attended by parliamentarians from  30 countries, "openly trumpeted for `liberation of Tibet' on the  grounds that there were human rights problems in Tibet," the  spokesman said. "This anti-China act and gross interference in  China' internal affairs has aroused great indignation of the  whole Chinese people including the Tibetan compatriots," he said.    The conference statement denounced alleged Chinese human  rights abuses in Tibet, urged the release of all Tibetan  political prisoners and expressed concern over Chinese nuclear  testing in the region -- which Chinese troops entered in 1951.  It also called on China to open unconditional talks with the  Dalai Lama and urged the United Nations to grant observer status  to the Tibetan spiritual leader's government-in-exile, based in  northern India but not recognised by any country.    "We thoroughly condemn the anti-China clamours made at the  meeting," which was organised by "a small number of Indian  parliamentarians in collusion with the international  anti-Chinese force," said the foreign ministry spokesman.    The Indian government has also come under fire from  conference delegates, who accuse it of succumbing to Chinese  pressure by trying to scuttle the event by denying a venue in  the heart of New Delhi and by allegedly declining visas to some  MPs. "The (Indian) government put obstacles at the behest of  China. China twisted India's arm," said Indian MP George  Fernandes Sunday, calling on the Indian government to support  the Tibetan cause. Fernandes said the Dalai Lama, who has  lived in India since fleeing his homeland in 1959 after a failed  anti-Chinese revolt, did not make an appearance at the  convention because of Indian pressures.    India, which is home to some 100,000 Tibetan exiles, treats  Tibet as an autonomous region of China and has cracked down  hard on Tibetan protestors during visits by Chinese leaders in  recent years.</p>

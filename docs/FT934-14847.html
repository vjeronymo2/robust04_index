			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Earnings at Weyerhaeuser fall 38% amid depressed conditions WEYERHAEUSER, the US forest products group, yesterday said its third-quarter earnings had fallen by 38 per cent, as a sharp decline in paper and pulp prices offset a strong performance by its timber business. The company, the world's largest private owner of softwood timber, linked its overall performance to depressed conditions in the North American pulp and paper industry. In this segment, profits were Dollars 2.5m, a sharp drop from last year's Dollars 61.2m. Prices for most paper and pulp products had fallen about 20 per cent from 1992 levels, the company said. In addition, it had curtailed production levels at some mills because of soft market conditions. Net income for the 13 weeks to September 26 was Dollars 66.6m, or 32 cents a share, compared with Dollars 107.2m, or 53 cents, in the third quarter of 1992, which was a period of robust growth for the company. Revenues slipped 5 per cent to Dollars 2.22bn, from Dollars 2.35bn a year earlier. Excluding special factors, however, the decline in earnings was marginal. The 1993 results included a charge of 10 cents a share to provide for changes in the federal corporate tax rate enacted this summer. Last year's figure, meanwhile, reflected a one-time gain of 8 cents a share following the partial settlement of tax refund dispute. By contrast, Weyerhaeuser's timberlands and wood products division continued to improve. Operating earnings climbed to Dollars 165.8m, against Dollars 103m last time, as supply shortages lifted prices for logs and lumber. Sales volume for most products also surpassed year-earlier levels. Weyerhaeuser's property and financial services operations earned Dollars 11.2m in the quarter, compared with Dollars 27.3m last time. The decline in part reflects the sale earlier this year of GNA Corp, a mutual fund business. Although the results were in line with most analysts' expectations, the announcement was followed by a dip in Weyerhaeuser's shares. By midday, the stock was down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 39.</p>

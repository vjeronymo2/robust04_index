			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: No reason to speak English to the Wise Men Sir, I was most surprised to read that Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland, had complained about my speaking in French to the EC Committee of Wise Men ('Pardon', September 23). May I say that I never heard such a complaint from him while I was there. There is no reason to deliver a speech in English to an EC committee meeting in Brussels, where, moreover, most of the members are French-speaking. To my knowledge, English is no more the official language of the European Community than French. I would like to add that an English translation of my speech was available at the time and that I answered in English every question asked in English. Bernard Attali, president, Air France, 1 square Max Hyams, F-75757 Paris</p>

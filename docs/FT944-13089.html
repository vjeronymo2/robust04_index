			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / US taking tougher antitrust stance: The trend to more active intervention in competition questions The US Federal Trade Commission's decision to challenge BAT Industries' Dollars 1bn bid to take over American Tobacco has raised questions about whether the US government is taking a more aggressive approach to competition questions under the Clinton administration. Washington antitrust lawyers say that the evidence of a tougher approach is clear at the Justice Department, which shares jurisdiction over antitrust questions with the FTC, but note that all three FTC commissioners who took part in the BAT decision were appointed by President Ronald Reagan or President George Bush. One commissioner, Ms Christine Varney, has been appointed by President Bill Clinton, but she has only just started work at the commission and did not vote on BAT. Mr Clinton's nominee for the chairmanship, Mr Robert Pitofsky, has not yet been confirmed by the Senate. In addition, almost all the senior staff at the commission have been in place for several years. Some FTC lawyers also argue that the kinds of merger they are being asked to examine are different from the typical merger of the 1980s, which often involved companies in different sectors with few overlapping markets. Yet competition lawyers say the change in approach is palpable not just at the Justice Department, where assistant attorney general Anne Bingaman has taken on issues that have not been touched in recent years, but also at the FTC. 'Both agencies have become much more aggressive both on matters of substance and on procedural matters,' says one former government antitrust lawyer. Other legal experts say that although Commissioner Roscoe Starek is noticeably conservative in his approach to antitrust questions, Commissioner Janet Steiger, the acting chair, and Commissioner Mary Azcuenaga are more accurately labelled independents. Both are thought to be interested in winning reappointment from the Clinton administration. On the matter of substance, the Justice Department has filed the first cases for a decade involving US claims of jurisdiction over anti-competitive action overseas affecting US exporters, rather than US consumers. The FTC, meanwhile, is believed by Washington lawyers to be looking at bringing some cases involving vertical competition questions, where the relationship may be between supplier and customer, rather than the horizontal relationship between two competitors that is involved in the BAT case. Some FTC staff lawyers are also looking for a case that would challenge earlier doctrine on the existence of potential competition. The government can overlook the fact that a merger between two competitors would substantially increase concentration in a particular market if it believes the market to be open to potential new competitors. But current doctrine requires good evidence that someone actually intends to enter the market, rather than just theoretical evidence that someone could easily do so. In procedural matters, antitrust lawyers say the two agencies have been competing aggressively for cases, and the decision on which one should look at a particular merger is being taken later and later in the process. Though mergers in some sectors such as airlines are allocated by law to Justice, the decision is mostly taken at the staff level on the basis of which agency has most expertise in the sector. The FTC generally investigates soft drinks, for example, while Justice takes beer, and the FTC has in the past generally taken tobacco industry mergers. The two fought long and hard for jurisdiction over the big merger between Martin Marietta and Lockheed, with the FTC eventually winning possession. This means that when the case is eventually allotted to the FTC or Justice, the government's lawyers are running out of time to investigate the case in the initial period allowed by the law. They are thus filing more and more 'second requests' for information, which extends the deadline for a decision but also requires companies to produce much more documentation at great expense. When Mr Pitofsky eventually takes office, few doubt that he will carry on the trend to more active intervention in competition questions. In an influential article on antitrust published in a policy compendium presented to Mr Clinton by the Citizens Transition Project just after his election in 1992, Mr Pitofsky argued for an immediate revival of enforcement 'to undo the damage of a decade of trivialising and blaming antitrust'.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Kalon in hostile bid for paints rival KALON GROUP, the West Yorkshire-based paint manufacturer, yesterday launched a hostile Pounds 106.1m bid for Manders (Holdings), the Wolverhampton paints, inks and property group. The eight-for-three all-paper offer values each ordinary Manders share at about 288p. Manders' shares closed up 54p at 291p while Kalon's fell 2 1/2 p to 108p. Mr Mike Hennessy, Kalon managing director, said the offer price represented a 24 per cent premium to the Manders closing price on Wednesday June 10. He said Manders was an 'underperforming manufacturing business', though it also owned the Mander Centre, worth Pounds 57.5m, in Wolverhampton. The combination of Manders' activities had been 'unsuccessful'. Since 1987 it had spent more than Pounds 23m on acquisitions, but 1991 pre-tax profits at Pounds 6.04m compared with Pounds 6.12 in 1988. Manders' shareholders had suffered, he said. The offer would allow them to benefit from Kalon's management strengths. Mr Roy Amos, Manders chairman, said the news of yesterday's bid had 'come out of the blue', adding that the last contact between the two rivals had been five years ago when Manders had bid for Kalon. He described Kalon's move as 'opportunistic' in the light of the current strength of its share price. The 'unsolicited' offer undervalued Manders, which was in a 'major transitional period'. He added that the bid was 'not in anyone's interest, not the employees, not the customers, not the shareholders'. Kalon said the two groups had complementary paints businesses, and expected the enlarged group to have turnover of Pounds 200m. Mr Hennessy envisaged closing one of the enlarged group's four factories - Windeck in Bingley - and reducing the combined workforce by 20 per cent. Kalon was formed in 1985 by the merger of Leyland Paint &amp; Wallpaper with a private paint company and brought in Mr Hennessy in 1988 to oversee its reorganisation. In 1988 pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.72m; in 1991 they were Pounds 9.2m, a growth rate of 36 per cent a year. Over the past four years Kalon's share price has risen 140 per cent relative to the FT-A All-Share Index. Observer, Page 19</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" program] </F>   [Text] The Sakhalin Oblast Agricultural Union recently held  a meeting to discuss the situation that has developed in the  island's agricultural sector concerning the coming spring. Here  is our Sakhalin correspondent Lyudmila Filipova with the details:    [Begin recording] The meeting noted that there was only a  month and a half left before the beginning of the planting  season, and that all agricultural enterprises are in fact  bankrupt at present. That is, they cannot assure supplies of  fuel, lubricants, seed, or fertilizer to begin sowing work, and  only about 25 percent of the equipment is ready for spring field  work. There has never been such a state of affairs in the  history of the oblast. The level of work discipline is very  low, although this is not surprising because wages have not been  paid at some agricultural enterprises since October. The  leading specialists have moved to other industries where wages  are quite a bit higher and where wages are still being paid.    In short, the agricultural industry is collapsing. It was  emphasized that the welfare of the agricultural industry workers  is deteriorating. Even attempts to improve working conditions  and to observe the fundamental rules of equipment safety have  been discontinued. The basic means of production are worn out  and there is no possibility of renovating them. All this comes  at a time when the agricultural department and the oblast  authorities are not taking any effective measures to normalize  the situation. Every agricultural enterprise, it was  emphasized, is struggling with its own troubles on its own. The  loans that the government allocates for the support of the  primary producers do not reach them.    It is apparently not profitable to produce anything under  these conditions, especially livestock products. All  agricultural enterprises, without exception, incurred losses  last year in livestock production due to low prices for products  and tardy payments. The producers were not paid for the  products supplied. The cost of electricity and heating alone has  completely impoverished enterprises in the last two and a half  months. We cannot speak of production when agricultural  enterprises' sales basically amount to approximately 100 million  rubles a month, but they pay more for electricity.    The demands tabled at this meeting -- and which are to be  presented to the oblast administration and the government --  call for the introduction of compensation payments for loans  taken out from 1 January 1994 and a number of other types of  compensation and subsidies. It was also demanded that the  oblast administration take charge of all agricultural enterprise  infrastructures, or pay compensation for expenditures for the  upkeep of housing; set up a regional order for agricultural  products for the current year; and provide a 50-percent  prepayment of their cost in accordance with concluded  agreements. It was also stipulated that extreme measures should  be taken, such as demanding the resignation of the government,  stern criticism of the president, and perhaps even strike  action, if these demands are not met. One more proposal  suggests that it might be more effective if the entire Far East  region made the demands of the government in a concerted way.  [end recording]</p>

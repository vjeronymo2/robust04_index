			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQI INVASION LEADS TO RETHINKING BY NATO, EUROPEAN COMMUNITY;  </P> <P> RESPONSE: WITH THREAT OF SOVIET AGGRESSION EASED, LEADERS DISCUSS HOW TO REACT  TO TROUBLE ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD.  </P> <P> The Persian Gulf crisis is forcing Western European leaders to seek better ways  of taking collective action in support of their national and common interests.  </P> <P> In a week of private meetings and semi-public seminars in Brussels, where both  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Community are  headquartered, officials talked about how to deal with aggressive steps taken  by countries other than the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> High on the program was the crisis touched off by Iraq's invasion of  neighboring Kuwait last month.  </P> <P> As the threat of Soviet aggression has faded in the wake of the revolution that  swept across Eastern Europe last year, NATO, the EC and other international  organizations have focused on how to deal with new possibilities.  </P> <P> The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and the subsequent threat to much of the Western  world, have led defense-minded Western European institutions to re-examine  their positions on when to extend military power and how to develop a consensus  on using that power.  </P> <P> Some Americans have been critical of Western Europe for not doing its share in  the gulf crisis. Most of this criticism has been directed at West Germany,  which has a huge income from exports and a large army and navy but is under  constitutional restrictions as to what it can do outside the NATO area.  </P> <P> But Chancellor Helmut Kohl's pledge to help underwrite the U.S.-led  multinational force deployed against Iraq in Saudi Arabia, through a  contribution of billions of dollars, seems to have satisfied Washington.  Further, Kohl pledged to attempt to rewrite the constitution of a united  Germany.  </P> <P> In part because of the U.S. criticism, NATO is indeed looking for ways to  broaden its charter. Officials in Brussels now agree that it would be legal and  wise to allow NATO to deploy military forces beyond the frontiers of its 16  member states if it were in the organization's vital interest to do so.  </P> <P> NATO was upstaged by the Western European Union, which was quick to offer its  relatively thin services to coordinate Europe's response in the gulf crisis.  </P> <P> The WEU, based in Paris, is made up France, Britain, West Germany, Belgium, the  Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Spain and Portugal. The French are high on it  because it is not directly affiliated with NATO and not dominated by the United  States. It has no military command.  </P> <P> But "with the WEU, you need to create an entire administrative structure,"  strategic analyst Edward Luttwak argued. "This, NATO already has."  </P> <P> Another NATO specialist declared bluntly: "The WEU is something of a joke. They  literally have about seven or eight employees at their headquarters."  </P> <P> And a NATO ambassador had this to say: "The WEU is really a parasite of NATO.  When they want to offer military cooperation advice, they come to us and ask  how to do it."  </P> <P> A few days ago, Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis suggested that the  12-nation European Community form a military component. He said this would be  in Western Europe's interest and would keep the French from worrying about  taking directions from Washington.  </P> <P> But with the EC's attempt to bring about a single market at the end of 1992,  including heated arguments about a European monetary system and a central bank,  few observers here believe the EC could take on military responsibilities very  quickly.  </P> <P> Further, if other nations join the EC, particularly those with a neutral  background like Switzerland, Austria and Sweden, it would be difficult to get  any kind of consensus on quick action in time of crisis.  </P> <P> An Irish diplomat, whose government has adhered to a policy of nonalignment,  was stunned by De Michelis' suggestion.  </P> <P> Still, EC experts do not rule out some kind of defense arrangement, though only  in the very long run.  </P> <P> The difficulty of finding consensus is also one of the objections to another  proposal: creating a defense arm for the 35-member CSCE, the Vienna-based  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. This could provide some sort  of peacekeeping mechanism for all Europe.  </P> <P> "The problem with upgrading the CSCE," Prof. William Griffith of the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology said, "is that it is too big -- like the  U.N. General Assembly. You'd never get a unanimous vote or even a consensus to  act in time to respond to any crisis."  </P> <P> Most European leaders turn back to NATO as the best organization to coordinate  military activities involving member nations within or beyond their frontiers.  </P> <P> NATO seems certain to reduce its force levels and headquarters staff now that  the Soviet threat seems to have disappeared, but many diplomats and officers  here believe it could be rejuvenated by giving it a broader role.  </P> <P> In the view of many people in Brussels, NATO has the advantage -- although some  think it a disadvantage -- of not being entirely European, of having the United  States and Canada as members.  </P> <P> Gen. Manfred Woerner, the NATO secretary general, and other officials point to  NATO's huge integrated military structure, built up over 40 years, and argue  that it would be illogical to dismantle it.  </P> <P> Gen. John Galvin, NATO's military commander, has urged the organization to  rethink its treaty strictures and look farther afield, or "out of area."  </P> <P> One of the top NATO planners is now suggesting that the organization is really  not legally bound to restrict its military activities to the organization's  geographical area, so long as all member nations agree that an outside crisis  truly affects the national interests of all.  </P> <P> And other NATO experts agree that they ought to set their sights beyond the  horizon, but they add that it must be done with sensitivity and caution.  </P> <P> "For instance," one ambassador commented at a NATO dinner, "we want to support  the U.S. in the gulf, not only because of Iraqi aggression but because our  vital interests are affected too.  </P> <P> "But I don't think anyone -- including the U.S. -- would want to plant the NATO  flag on a Saudi Arabian sand dune. We don't want to make it look as if a bunch  of Christian Crusaders have arrived."  </P> <P> Some people at NATO worry about public opinion assuming that the organization  isn't doing enough when needed. But Simon Lunn of the North Atlantic Assembly  pointed out that "NATO can't do what it is not set up to do; you've got to  change the brief."  </P> <P> He said he thinks NATO is doing pretty well in responding under its charter to  the gulf crisis.  </P></p>

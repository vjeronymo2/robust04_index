			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Mandarins restricted to merit increase Britain's senior civil servants will only have pay rises related to their performance from this April, under the review body report on senior salaries accepted yesterday by the government. Only permanent secretaries will receive an overall pay rise of 2.5 per cent. The budget allocated to senior civil servants for performance pay is to rise by 2.75 percentage points to 4.75 per cent. The review body also argued that judges should have the 16-plus per cent increase it recommended two years ago phased in on top of a regular uprating of their salaries to April 1 1999. Mr John Major, the prime minister, has accepted this. Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the Association of First Division Civil Servants, welcomed the decision to accept the recommendations but added that the pay of senior civil servants would still be below that of comparable private-sector positions. The report argued for a larger budget for performance pay for senior civil servants to ensure more 'refined' awards within a wider pay range. A new bonus scheme is also proposed to offer up to 30 high-flyers rises of at least one-twentieth of current annual salary. The report said it was not 'healthy' for senior civil servants' morale and motivation that they should feel they are underpaid. It also recognised that job security had declined in recent years. The review body said it had 'serious doubts' about continuing the rigid pay linkage between the judiciary and career civil servants and military officers. It pointed out that QCs promoted to become High Court judges took a 50 per cent cut in salary.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRANATO SPEAKS SOFTLY, BUT CARRIES A BIG STICK;  </P> <P> KINGS: FINALLY FREE OF INJURY, HE PROVIDED THE GAME-WINNING GOAL IN GAME 3  AGAINST CALGARY.  </P> <P> For Tony Granato, it was the deal that would not die.  </P> <P> When he heard during All-Star game weekend that he had been traded from the New  York Rangers to the Kings, along with fellow wing Tomas Sandstrom, for Bernie  Nicholls, Granato was excited.  </P> <P> But his excitement faded when he kept hearing about it.  </P> <P> In newspapers. On television. From fans.  </P> <P> And from Bernie.  </P> <P> Nicholls went public the day of the trade, calling it, "a dumb deal," and  barely stopped to catch his breath over the ensuing days, blasting both King  Coach Tom Webster and General Manager Rogie Vachon.  </P> <P> "Though Bernie was well liked here, when the trade was made, I thought it was  done," Granato said. "But no one seemed to forget it. Instead of just letting  everyone play, they had to keep bringing it up, how Bernie was doing every day  with the Rangers. I got tired of hearing about it, tired of reading about it.  </P> <P> "People have their own opinions. I wanted to prove to the Kings what I could  do. I was not worried about other people."  </P> <P> Not even Nicholls.  </P> <P> "I met him and he's a good guy. He means no harm," said Granato of Nicholls'  bad-mouthing. "He has nothing against Tomas or me. That's just the way he  approaches things. I don't believe it would be the right way for me, but if he  wants to do it, that's fine."  </P> <P> Granato's frustration was heightened by an existing groin pull. He got into  only one game before being sidelined again.  </P> <P> "What are you going to do?" Granato asked. "(The Kings) were patient and took  no chances. They wanted to make sure I was 100%, so they gave me an extra week.  It was a good feeling."  </P> <P> Soon after the frustration ended for Granato, it began for Sandstrom, who went  out with a facial injury.  </P> <P> Finally, in New York of all places, the line the Kings had dreamed of when the  trade was made skated onto the ice: Granato on one side, Sandstrom on the other  with Wayne Gretzky in the middle.  </P> <P> That line produced eight goals and 14 assists in three games, all victories for  the Kings.  </P> <P> Too good to be true?  </P> <P> Yes, as it turned out when Gretzky took his turn on the injured list, first  because of a groin strain, then a hyper-extended back that sidelined him for 17  days.  </P> <P> But the trio was reunited Sunday night at the Forum for Game 3 of the  best-of-seven opening-round playoff series between the Kings and Calgary  Flames.  </P> <P> Sandstrom, set up by Gretzky, got the first goal. Granato got the game-winning  goal unassisted in overtime as the Kings won, 2-1, to take a 2-1 lead in the  series with Game 4 tonight at the Forum.  </P> <P> With the Kings skating short-handed, Granato stole a pass from Gary Suter,  skated to within a couple of feet of goalie Mike Vernon and shot the puck over  his glove and into the net.  </P> <P> As the red light went on and his teammates jumped on him in celebration,  Granato tried to keep the moment in perspective.  </P> <P> "You can't get too high," he said. "If it had been the seventh game, it would  have been a lot better. You've got to remember, this is only one game. Now Game  4 is even more important."  </P> <P> Does he at least derive some satisfaction at proving that maybe the deal wasn't  so dumb, that the critics might have been too quick to judge?  </P> <P> "That won't be decided for a couple of years down the road," Granato said.  "Right now, I'm just thinking about winning hockey games."  </P> <P> It was what the Kings wanted to hear Monday from Gretzky: no news.  </P> <P> No spasms in his back. No pain. Nothing new from Sunday.  </P> <P> After missing all but one period of the previous 10 games and practicing only  two days, Gretzky played a full game and the 8 minutes 37 seconds of overtime  Sunday against the Flames with no apparent problems.  </P> <P> Gretzky attended a team meeting Monday and then went in for another therapy  session.  </P> <P> "He's feeling fine," Webster said. "He's pretty loose. He's even looking  forward to getting walked on today."  </P> <P> That comment referred to part of Gretzky's therapy, but the King center also  got walked on a bit Sunday, twice crashing to the ice after getting hit by  Flames.  </P> <P> Did that make Webster wince after waiting so long for Gretzky's return?  </P> <P> "I didn't notice," said the coach, grinning. "I was looking the other way. It  was nice to see him able to play and to take some hits. He has responded well,  but that's the way it is with backs sometimes."  </P> <P> </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> The news was not so good for defenseman Tom Laidlaw. Out with a lower back  injury since March 17, the same day Gretzky had played his last full game,  Laidlaw practiced the past week and had hoped to be in the lineup tonight. "He  won't be available," said Coach Tom Webster.  </P></p>

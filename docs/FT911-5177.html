			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Time to sort out who owns what: Eastern Europe's emerging democracies must define property rights if they are to attract western investment Yesterday in London, leaders from 30 countries launched an initiative which they hope will help bind the political and economic systems of eastern Europe closer to the west. With the inauguration of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the nations of eastern Europe have found a vehicle to mobilise western support in reviving their shattered economies. But there is a growing consensus among western governments that the new rulers of eastern Europe will themselves have to do more to assist in this reconstruction. While these governments are looking to the west, and the EBRD, for aid to curb unemployment, maintain stability and get their economies back on their feet, it is only through a large inflow of foreign investment that the basis can be created for sustained economic growth. And in attracting investment, a large part of the problem resides in the east Europeans' own backyards. The twin issues of property rights and ownership are crucial to the economic success of the emerging democracies. But as yet, legislation to define the two has not been enacted in most of these countries. Without putting in place these central planks of the market economy system, eastern Europe is likely to be seeking hand-outs from western donors for a long time. This is not to underestimate what has already been achieved. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania have all moved, or are beginning to move, rapidly towards allowing market forces a much greater role in their economies. All of them have introduced price reforms and scrapped subsidies on food, consumer goods, clothes, cars, housing, and energy - in all cases, at the cost of rising unemployment. They have also made considerable strides towards setting up a legal framework for privatising the large swathes of their economies hitherto owned by the state. As the accompanying table shows, all five governments are now committed - with varying degrees of openness - to privatisation and to attracting foreign investment. Poland is furthest down this road, followed by Hungary and Czechoslovakia. But even Bulgaria and Romania, after a shaky start, are now pressing ahead. Yet so far, all the activity has yielded little investment. Over the past year Poland has attracted a total of Dollars 350m (Pounds 197.7m) in foreign investment, mainly in joint ventures; Hungary about Dollars 1bn. There have been individual rich pickings, such as the Skoda car works in Czechoslovakia (a 70 per cent share in which was bought by Volkswagen of Germany last year), the Tungsram electric bulb group in Hungary (bought by General Electric of the US a year ago), and Zamech, the Polish turbine manufacturer bought by ABB of Switzerland. But overall the flow of investment has been a disappointment. It should not, however, really be surprising after 40 years of communist misrule. The policies of rapid industrialisation pursued by the post-war regimes of the region may have initially helped pull eastern Europe out of its agricultural past, but in the end the lack of competition and investment led to industrial obsolescence: witness the sorry state of the region's physical infrastructure. Since the communists fell, privatisation has come to be identified as the best way of stopping the rot. Western governments and financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, encouraged east European governments to move quickly to sell off state assets as a means of attracting western investment, building the market economy, and breaking the stranglehold of the state bureaucracy. For their part, the governments viewed privatisation as a way of dismantling the economic and political power base of the communists. This was the theme of the election campaigns which swept across eastern Europe last year. The electorate did not vote for radical economic policies as such; it voted against the communist system. Economic policy-making and institution-building would follow. This is part of the problem. Privatisation is being introduced back to front  -without an infrastructure to support it. None of these countries yet has a western-style accounting, banking or capital markets system. Nor does any of them have much of an indigenous property-owning class. Eastern Europe's largely Jewish middle classes were almost completely destroyed by Hitler between 1938 and 1945. The survivors either emigrated or had their property confiscated by the communists. In Poland, Stalin destroyed at Katyn, the cream of the professional class. In Czechoslovakia, the middle classes had all their property confiscated after 1948. Despite the extermination of Hungary's 600,000 Jewish community, the backbone of the country's industrial and cultural class, it probably still has the largest middle class/intellectual elite which can facilitate the transformation. An entrepreneurial class was partially encouraged by Mr Janos Kadar, the former communist party leader, who allowed the expansion of the second economy and small private shops. In Bulgaria, Mr Todor Zhivkov, the former party leader, promoted the rural classes at the expense of the middle classes. In Romania, the 700,000-strong ethnic German community, which formed the backbone of the middle classes after the Second World War, has dwindled to less than 170,000 due to emigration. As a result, eastern Europe is having to create a property-owning class  - in conjunction with foreign investors. But here the new governments of the region are bumping up against another central problem: the near-total confusion about who owns what. Unless they define property and ownership rights, the governments of eastern Europe are likely to put off foreign investors. Investors need to know whether they can buy and sell land - whether for private use, or for the expansion of their business. It is not that there is a shortage of investment opportunities. Among the potentially lucrative enterprises waiting to be tapped are: In Bulgaria, the government is contemplating the break-up of the state tobacco monopoly; In Romania, US, Italian and British companies are seeking advice on how to buy into the country's internationally competitive textile, leather and shoe industries; In Czechoslovakia, NM Rothschild, the UK merchant bank, is advising the government on how to privatise the Transgas pipeline, which carries energy from the Soviet Union to western Europe; In Hungary, Schroder Wagg, another British merchant bank, is advising the Hungarian State Property Agency on the privatisation of Interglob, a transportation and distribution business. In Poland, the consulting firm AT Kearney is preparing the copper mining conglomerate KGHM for privatisation and possible purchase by foreign investors. But in all these cases, buyers will remain hesitant until ownership rights are defined. The problem is another legacy of the communist era. In most east European countries, land, shops, factories, restaurants and hotels were nationalised after the communists seized power in 1948. In others, the prime example being Bulgaria, land remained the property of agricultural co-operatives, which were amalgamated in the 1970s with the giant agro-industrial complexes, or state-run collective farms. Privatisation depends crucially on sorting out the mess. This means addressing many questions: should owners of land and property confiscated by the communists be compensated in kind; should all, or indeed any, confiscated land be returned to their original owners, their descendants, or those who emigrated; how much will the compensation cost? There is no ready-made formula for dealing with these questions. But apart from Romania and Albania, which have yet to define property rights, all east European countries are grappling with the issue: In Poland, the government earlier this month decided not to return to its original owners all property which was nationalised after 1945 because it would be too expensive. Instead, Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the minister for privatisation, said former owners would receive bonds entitling them to buy shares in any newly-privatised companies in compensation for the loss of their property. 'You cannot turn history back. You must take into account the time factor, the budget factor, the need to stimulate foreign investment,' he said. Poland wants to avoid the problems being encountered in east Germany. There former property owners were given the right to reclaim their land, a blanket commitment that has caused legal confusion and slowed the privatisation process. 'If we question the communist acts of nationalisation and land reform, we will question the whole post-war legal structure in Poland,' argued Mr Lewandowski. But his proposals have been criticised by the Association of Real Estate owners, a group of former property-owners, who are demanding the return of full ownership rights to those whose properties were confiscated or nationalised by the communists. In Warsaw alone, 18,000 properties were confiscated in 1945. The government of Czechoslovakia has adopted a different approach. A law passed in February will allow the return of property confiscated between February 25, 1948 (the date of the communist coup) and January 1, 1990. It will apply only to individuals, and will exclude emigres who did not return to Czechoslovakia before that date. The federal government reckons that about 10 per cent of all state-owned property, worth Dollars 10.7bn, will be returned to former owners. But it has not indicated how the restitution of property will be financed. In Hungary, the conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum, the main party in the ruling coalition, is proposing to give expropriated owners first option to regain their old nationalised property if they can provide evidence of title. This could entail legal searches before state property can be sold - a process likely to be complicated by the fact that a third of all Hungarians live abroad. Mr Lajos Csepi, managing director of the State Property Agency (SPA), said last week that the government's plan 'will obviously slow down privatisation. It would be disastrous. Foreign investors do not come because they do not know what is going to happen.' What is more, the process is likely to be very costly. The government has already admitted that returning property and issuing compensation bonds will cost more than the Dollars 940m already already earmarked by the finance ministry. Even so, the proposed law is under attack for not going far enough. The government is under pressure on the issue from the Smallholders party, a junior coalition partner which favours the return of all property seized by the communists after 1945. The bill goes before the constitutional court later this month. In Bulgaria, the communists did not nationalise the agricultural co-operatives which had become a feature of the country's economy before the war. But the government remains reluctant to allow full private property rights for land. It believes this would lead to the break-up of the co-operatives and destroy the economy's agricultural base. Bulgarian nationalists are also concerned that if property rights were freed, the Turkish minority would buy large tracts of land, exacerbating ethnic tensions. All this amounts to another hefty political and legislative agenda for the new governments of eastern Europe. But until they resolve the issues of property and ownership, foreign investors will continue to hang back.</p>

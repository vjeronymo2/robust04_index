			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Mercedes triggers regional rivalry MERCEDES-BENZ this week asked the Department of Trade and Industry for details of UK sites of about 250 to 300 acres which would be suitable for consideration for their proposed new assembly plant. The DTI contacted UK inward investment agencies asking for site details. Among those approached was the Northern Development Company, covering north-east England and Cumbria, which has sent the DTI site details. However, attention also focused yesterday on the West Midlands, where component suppliers GKN, T&amp;N and Triplex Lloyd already manufacture parts for Mercedes. Industry analysts said the proximity of component suppliers will play a leading role in the decision over where to site a plant. The Black Country Development Corporation, which covers the region where many component manufacturers are based, said the 'just in time' production system of companies such as Mercedes meant new plants had to be close to parts suppliers. 'The West Midlands would be an obvious choice because of the car component manufacturing and infrastructure already here,' the development corporation said yester-day. The decision by Toyota, the Japanese manufacturer, to open its main European plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire, could also influence Mercedes, according to local development officials. The Northern Development Corporation, aware of the potential competition, is trying to take matters beyond the DTI inquiry about possible sites. The NDC happens to be holding a seminar for the German automotive industry at the Frankfurt Motor Show on Tuesday. Mr Bridge is hopeful Mercedes-Benz will be attending. The NDC believes the success of Nissan's Pounds 900m Sunderland plant, which has attracted automotive suppliers to the area, is a valuable plus in wooing Mercedes-Benz. 'I'd argue that the north of England has got the most successful automotive and component activity in the UK, on the basis of growth and output through the Nissan plant and the quality of the supply chain,' said Mr Bridge. 'That success derives largely from its newness. It doesn't have the problems inherent in other parts of the country.' He did not think the presence of a large carmaker like Nissan, now employing 4,600 people at Sunderland, could act as a disincentive by arousing fears suitable labour might have been already mopped up. Nissan said: 'Our investment in the north-east has proved very, very successful in establishing the most productive car plant in Europe and one capable of producing cars to Japanese quality standards.' Mercedes-Benz's project could qualify for substantial grants and subsidies depending on the site chosen, even though automatic grants under regional policy were ended in the mid-1980s.</p>

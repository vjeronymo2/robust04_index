			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Malaysian sultans agree curb on rights MALAYSIA'S hereditary sultans yesterday agreed to constitutional amendments that will sharply curtail their legal immunity, AP reports from Kuala Lumpur. Their decision ended a month-long confrontation and helped avert a potential constitutional crisis, the deputy prime minister, Mr Ghafar Baba, announced. The deputy prime minister said that the rulers, who wield limited constitutional powers, reversed an earlier rejection of the amendments and accepted the legislation with some modifications. Government officials said their acceptance means in effect that they could now be prosecuted in court for assault, not paying debts and other offences. The dispute between the government and the rulers had prompted a daily barrage of commentary and articles in Malaysian newspapers. Some of the articles revealed publicly for the first time the peccadillos of the royal households. The government also retaliated by systematically stripping members of the royal families of privileges they enjoyed but which were not specifically provided for in state legislation. Uncertainty about the duration and political ramifications of the conflict had dampened the sentiments of domestic investors in recent weeks, keeping turnover at the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange relatively subdued.</p>

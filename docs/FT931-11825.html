			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / US may reject Bosnia proposals: Washington's approval vital to achieve effective UN pressure on factions THE INTERNATIONAL peace plan for Bosnia, due to be submitted to the United Nations Security Council this week, is expected to receive a cool response from the US administration today. Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the co-chairmen of the Geneva peace conference on former Yugoslavia, are due to explain the half-finished deal, rejected by the three warring Bosnian factions at the weekend, to Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, in Washington US approval is considered vital if the Security Council is to exert effective pressure on the Bosnian Serbs, Moslems and Croats to make the necessary compromises for an agreement. But President Bill Clinton's new administration is reported to have serious reservations about the plan because it incorporates some of the effects of the Serbs' policy of 'ethnic cleansing'. The mediators are also likely to face criticism of their plan for transitional power-sharing arrangements. The plan provides for the dissolution of the present Moslem-led government and its replacement for an interim period by a nine-member transitional body until free elections are held. Although the US administration has not yet taken a policy decision on the subject, it is said to be leaning towards a possible lifting of the embargo on arms sales to the Bosnian Moslems. But such a move is strongly opposed by Mr Vance and Lord Owen, who have stressed that the embargo could not be lifted selectively and would merely lead to an extension of the fighting. If the embargo was lifted for one side, it would be like lifting it for everbody else - 'pouring fuel on the flames,' Lord Owen said in an interview. After presiding over four weeks of intensive negotiations between the leaders of the three factions, the international mediators, who did not want to prolong the talks indefinitely, finally decided to ask the Security Council to endorse the plan. They appear to hope that the fear of possible international military action under a new Council mandate, or the more effective enforcement of sanctions, will persuade the warring groups to conclude a deal. 'We are very close to an overall settlement,' Lord Owen said at Heathrow airport before flying to Brussels for talks with EC foreign ministers. At the last meeting on Saturday, before the talks were adjourned, only the Bosnian Croats signed all three parts of the peace package. Laura Silber reports from Belgrade: Mr Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia, vowed to gain control of a disputed Serb enclave following the successful Croat offensive across UN lines. He warned he would not shrink from using force to restore Croatia's territorial integrity. Negotiators count considerable achievements, Page 3</p>

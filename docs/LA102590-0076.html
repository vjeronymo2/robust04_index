			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BITES  </P> <P> The following are capsule reviews of some of the better restaurants recently  visited by our critics:  </P> <P> Waterfront dining is alive in -- of all places -- inland Ventura County, at New  Orleans West. On the Westlake shore, NOW does best with its appetizers, such as  the tangy chicken fingers, and the more elaborate Seafood Casa Dorata is  certainly full of seafood. At either the patio or the bar, it's a lovely  environment. New Orleans West, 32131 Lindero Canyon Blvd., Westlake Village,  (818) 707-9378. Monday through Saturday 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday 11 a.m. to  10 p.m. Sunday brunch. Full bar, credit cards accepted. Meal for two, food  only, $20 to $50.  </P> <P> The 24-page menu at Jack's Restaurant and Deli offers everything from Mexican  and American to vegetarian and deli food. The beers come in 136 varieties. Try  the sweet, tangy baby-back pork ribs or the Mexican dishes, which are  particularly good. Jack's is in Westlake Plaza Shopping Center, Westlake  Village; 495-8181. Open every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Monday  through Thursday 7 a.m. to midnight; Friday 7 a.m. to 1:30 a.m.; Saturday 7:30  a.m. to 1:30 a.m.; Sunday 7:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. Dinner for two, food only,  $19 to $52.  </P> <P> You can go to Santa Barbara's crown jewel, the Four Seasons Biltmore Hotel, for  more than just the atmosphere or the Sunday brunch buffet. The kitchen is now  among the best in town, turning out wonderful dishes from lobster sausages to a  bittersweet chocolate souffle. Better at dinner than at lunch. Either the  indoor La Marina or the sparkling outdoor Patio makes for romantic dining. The  Four Seasons Biltmore is at 1260 Channel Drive, Santa Barbara; 969-2261.  Serving in the Patio weekdays 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., weekends 6:30 a.m. to 11  p.m. Serving in La Marina weekdays 6 to 10 p.m., weekends 6 to 11 p.m. Lunch  for two, food only, $30 to $48. Dinner for two, food only, $50 to $70.  </P> <P> The pub at Victoria Pub and Restaurant is a lively gathering place for English  expatriates and pub lovers alike. It stays open until everyone goes home, and  the dart games never stop. The more subdued restaurant serves an English menu,  complete with steak and kidney pie, fish and chips and Cornish pasties. The  soups, which are changed every day, are excellent, as is the lamb steak. The  crumble of the day with hot fruit, sweet crumble and cream is particularly  good. Victoria Pub and Restaurant is at 1413F S. Victoria Ave., Ventura;  650-0060. Lunch is served every day from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Dinner is served  from 5 to 9:30 p.m., and the pub is open until 2 a.m. Dinner for two, food  only, $25 to $60.  </P></p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Better service or your money back - Cash compensation schemes have become popular, despite initial scepticism When John Major, the UK prime minister, launched the idea of a Citizen's Charter in March 1991 to raise the standard of public services, politicians, commentators and civil servants were deeply sceptical of the project. Some of the greatest reservations were expressed over Major's desire to pay customers compensation when services fail to come up to scratch. Money paid out to dissatisfied customers was money which could not be spent on improving services, the sceptics argued. Compensation payments to some customers meant worse service for all customers when budgets were constrained by tight cash limits, the argument went. However, many organisations have found that cash compensation schemes offer a relatively cost-effective marketing tool. Apart from providing balm to soothe the wounds of dissatisfied customers, they also symbolise the organisation's desire to respond to consumer concerns. Creating such schemes can help identify sources of customer dissatisfaction and provide incentives for managers to meet customer satisfaction targets. The idea of providing cash compensation has been widely taken up by the privatised utilities, often at the insistence of their regulators. Water and electricity companies, British Gas and BT all offer small sums (typically Pounds 10 or Pounds 20) to customers for failure to keep appointments and for prolonged loss of service. The pioneer of such schemes was East Midlands Electricity which, even before privatisation, offered its 2.2m customers Pounds 10 if the company failed to keep an appointment. 'Our market research told us that we weren't trusted by our customers,' says Nick Akers, East Midlands' corporate relations manager. 'We had a reputation of saying we'd come on Wednesday and turning up on Thursday.' The scheme certainly appears to have been successful in improving the company's image, giving it higher satisfaction ratings than other utilities in the area. Providing such compensation has been relatively inexpensive. With 99.74 per cent of appointments kept, less than Pounds 35,000 was paid out in the nine months to the end of March 1992. 'It provides an internal discipline for the company itself,' says Akers. 'Staff know that they are expected to meet customer service targets, so the company ends up paying out very little.' The scheme has been extended since its launch in 1985 and now covers 16 different service targets. Customers can ask for calls to be within a two-hour time slot or even at a specific time if they prefer. And the basic payment has been raised to Pounds 20. Other public services have followed the utilities' lead in implementing the Citizen's Charter. The Benefits Agency, for example, paid out more than Pounds 1m last year for excessive delays in settling claims for social security benefits and pensions. British Rail spent an estimated Pounds 3m last year on compensating passengers for delayed and cancelled trains. Local councils have also introduced a variety of compensation schemes. Torfaen in Wales pays tenants Pounds 10 for breaches of its housing department customer service guarantee. The London borough of Islington gives free entry vouchers to people using its swimming pools if the water is dirty or not warm enough. Fashionable though compensation schemes have become, care is needed in devising them if they are to improve the organisation's standing, says Sue Bloomfield of the Consumers Association. 'It's a good way of acknowledging that your customers have rights,' she says. 'But most consumers would rather have a good value-for-money service.' Gareth Jones, research director of the customer service consultancy BEM, warns it is important to find out what it is the consumer feels is important. 'People think that service guarantees are a good idea,' he says, 'so long as they apply to things that are important. They are not impressed with guarantees of things they take for granted, such as hygiene or safety.' But at least as important as offering redress to dissatisfied customers is the aim of using cash compensation schemes as a management tool for focusing on customer service, says Brian Hilton, head of the Cabinet Office Citizen's Charter Unit. 'The amount of compensation paid out in different parts of an organisation is a good indicator of how well each part is meeting its individual customer service targets,' he says. 'Top management should use this information to identify and improve weak areas, reward good performance and thus reduce the need to pay compensation at all.' This approach is well illustrated by London Underground, which links managers' performance pay to the amount of compensation paid out under its Customer Charter in their part of the business. With a real incentive to meet customer service targets, they ensured that London Underground paid out less than Pounds 70,000 in compensation last year and hit or comfortably exceeded all its service targets. 'Our Customer Charter is all about delivering a service that makes refunds an exception rather than a rule,' says Denis Tunnicliffe, London Underground's managing director. And that provides the answer to those who worry that cash compensation schemes mean less to spend on improving services. A well-structured scheme should focus the organisation more tightly on service performance targets in such a way as to ensure that customers only rarely need to claim a payment.</p>

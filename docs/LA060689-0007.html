			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Ethiopia's Parliament unanimously endorsed the idea of unconditional peace  talks with rebels in Eritrea aimed at ending the 28-year-old civil war in  northeastern Africa. The government's six-point peace plan was approved by all  750 deputies present at a special session of the 835-member body convened to  discuss the war in Eritrea. Diplomats said it was the first time President  Mengistu Haile Mariam had set no conditions for negotiating with the rebels in  the north. Under the plan, the talks would be attended by international  observers.  </P></p>

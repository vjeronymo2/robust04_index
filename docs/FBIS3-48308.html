Japan donated 1 million dollars in 1992 to help the nearly  quarter of a million refugees who fled to Bangladesh to avoid  ethnic persecution in Myanmar.    The UNHCR is seeking donations totaling 34 million dollars  for the repatriation program.    With Wednesday's repatriation of 28 refugees, known as  Rohingyas, the total number of those returned voluntarily to  Myanmar stood at 52,298.    The Muslim refugees fled to Bangladesh in 1991 and  repatriation began in September 1992.    The Bangladesh news agency BSS reported that about 200,000  refugees remain in 20 camps in southeastern Bangladesh, which  borders Myanmar.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Australian Airlines reveals loss AUSTRALIAN Airlines, the government-owned carrier, yesterday unveiled a fall into net losses after abnormal items of ADollars 48.36m (USDollars 34.70m) for the year to June 30, from profits of ADollars 65.99m the previous year, Reuter reports from Sydney. Mr Ted Harris, chairman, said the result reflected an extraordinary operating environment exacerbated by the continuing impact of the recession on air travel. There had been a 'bizarre discounting war' during the year, driven by recessed economic conditions and a serious oversupply of seats in the domestic airline market. Australian Airlines, to be sold to the government-owned international Qantas Airways for ADollars 400m on September 14, booked an abnormal loss of ADollars 30.16m, compared with an abnormal gain of ADollars 106.60m last year. The abnormal loss in the latest year was mainly due to provisions for employee redundancy costs and diminution of carrying value of certain aircraft engines and spare parts. The airline said an extraordinary expense of ADollars 978,000 was booked for costs incurred in preparation for privatisation. Sales rose by ADollars 140m to a record ADollars 1.52bn. 'The company again was burdened by excessive debt to equity,' the airline said. Interest expense was ADollars 86.8m, down from ADollars 98.72m last year, while the gearing ratio was 85.9/14.1 debt to equity, compared with 81.1/18.9 last year.</p>

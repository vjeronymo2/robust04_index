			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Opt-out schools gain Pounds 150m The Department for Education yesterday announced grants of Pounds 150m to grant-maintained schools that have opted out of local education authority control. Only 70 per cent of the schools which have opted out in the past year will receive capital grants, however, and about a third of these must wait until the educational year 1995-96 before the funds will be available. Last year virtually all newly opted-out schools were offered capital grants. Labour said this showed that the Treasury had applied pressure on the education department to make the funding for opted-out schools less generous. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said: 'The bribes to education department grant-maintained schools are clearly running out.' She accused Mr John Patten, the education secretary, of massaging the figures to make the allocation look generous, adding: 'The truth is, this year there are more losers.' However, teachers' unions continued to object that more funds were being made available to opted-out schools than to those which had remained with local authorities. While the total of Pounds 150m, which is for specific new capital building programmes, would be split between about 700 grant-maintained schools, Labour complained that the 24,000 which have not opted out would receive only Pounds 516m in total. Mr Robin Squire, the schools minister, said that the self-governing sector continued 'to grow and flourish in response to parental demand'.</p>

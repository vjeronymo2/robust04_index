			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE: HIGH FASHION ON MTV  </P> <P> The video: Tina Turner's "Steamy Windows" from the "Foreign Affair" album on  Capitol Records.  </P> <P> The look: Unlike her usual slashed and slit, heavy-leather outfits, Turner  shows up in a classic strand of pearls, a white slip dress and a pair of  spike-heel pumps. She leaves the Mad Max motor bikes behind too; instead, she  struts her ample stuff across a horizon-less plane of white light. Tossing a  mane of bronzed hair, she bares her remarkable legs almost completely, and  manages to twist and shout across the stage with her mini-modestly remaining  intact. It's a high-fashion music video, one of the rare sort associated with  big-name print photographers and high-rent fashion magazines. The simplicity of  the visuals is a test of Turner's ability to hold the screen without the  trappings and costume flappings that lesser chanteuses seem to relish. She  definitely makes the grade.  </P> <P> The stylist: Kim Bowmen, fashion editor of Blitz, a forward British fashion  publication, takes only partial credit for Turner's Ms. Clean look. She passes  most of the accolades along to the video's director, Andy Morahan. "He is very  well informed about fashion; his wife is a stylist. So he was quite succinct  about the fashion content," Bowmen said.  </P> <P> The labels: Turner gives a single-note fashion show in a very short, white  dress with an overlay of pearl-beaded gold net, designed by Paris-based  Azzedine Alaia. Background fashions on supporting vocalists and dancers are  also by Alaia. The men's suits are by Katharine Hamnett with an occasional Jean  Paul Gaultier garment thrown in.  </P> <P> The stores: All the Alaias came from one resource: Tina Turner's closet. "She  lent her own clothes to the models and dancers who worked on the shoot," said  Bowmen. "I don't think I've ever worked with a star who did that." As for the  keynote dress, that was chosen by Alaia and Turner, a team Bowmen called "the  holy duo. They have a language barrier: She doesn't speak French and he doesn't  speak English, so they just gaze admiringly at each other." There is an Alaia  boutique in Beverly Hills. The Hamnett suits and the Gaultier fill-ins were  provided by the Katharine Hamnett boutique in London. In Los Angeles, Maxfield  carries both labels.  </P> <P> The adaptation: Bowmen, who has worked on music videos for Brian Ferry and  INXS, says a common mistake in many videos is to subject the star to the  fashion fantasy. Models and dancers can pull off the look, she says, but very  few others can make the leap into fashion wonderland. Turner recognizes the  difference between screen style and street style. The clothes that cling and  creep up her thighs are reserved for show time.  </P> <P> The payoff: When Turner was 40 years old, she looked better than most  performers half her age. Now that she has turned 50, it still holds true. She  should be an inspiration to anyone who laments the passing of youth. Hers is  the way to age gracefully. GAILE ROBINSON  </P></p>

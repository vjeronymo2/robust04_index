			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PETE WILSON  </P> <P> The article about Sen. Pete Wilson buttressing his environmental image (Part I,  Aug. 10) was typical political doublespeak and evasion. Wilson brags about his  support of a Condor Range and Rivers proposal in the Sespe Mountains, but he  omits the fact that the proposal is inadequate. If the condors are ever to be  reintroduced to the wild, there must be sufficient wildlands out there for them  to soar over. The Forest Service proposal provides too little, and Wilson is  proud of his support of this absurdity.  </P> <P> Even more important is his complete silence on the most important conservation  issue in California: protection of desert areas. Wilson has blocked every  attempt to create wilderness, national parklands, or any other viable  protection of our besieged desert lands. Yet he continues to lay claim to being  an environmentalist -- just like George Bush, our "staunchly environmental"  President.  </P> <P> Keep trying to fool us, Sen. Wilson. You've succeeded to up to now.  </P> <P> BRUCE BARNBAUM  </P> <P> Somis  </P></p>

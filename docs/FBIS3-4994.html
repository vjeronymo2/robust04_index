			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] As the 21 November election of provincial (and  directly administered city) delegates approaches, North Korea is  gearing up its public agitation campaign in order to project the  election as an extension of the theories of socialist  superiority and systemic reinforcement applying such propaganda  as that North Korea's election system is `the most democratic  and people-oriented.'    North Korea, which now elects four-year term delegates in  accordance with the statute [section 134] prescribed in its  constitution following the election of provincial (and directly  administered city) people's assembly delegates in November of  1989, published lists of voters in every election district for  the (district election committee) all over the nation on 6  November and has carried out its agitation campaign for "100  percent participation, 100 percent `yes' vote," mobilizing the  government operated broadcast media, every level of organization  cadre and students/agitators. On 5 November, a Pyongyang  broadcast pointed out that this election was taking place "in a  strained situation in which there were constant schemes to  destroy the our-style socialistic sytem," and emplasized, "We  must demonstrate that our unfailing unified force around the  Party and the President will never be broken by any scheme of  any enemy," relating the election to the international pressure  on North Korea for its nuclear inspection issue.    Meanwhile, KCNA (8 November) was intensifying its drumbeat  calling for the reception of the election "with combativeness to  bring about the shining achievement of increased coal  production" and was urging to commence the battle to accelerate  the all-out march for the our-style socialist system.    North Korea has presented a detailed description of its  regime's election rules such as "general," "equal," "direct,"  and "secret," stated in its constitution (article 6) through  Pyongyang radio in a news commentary titled "Most  People-Oriented Election System Implemented in Northern Half of  Peoples Republic" immediately after the announcement of delegate  election.  <H5>  The First Rule of Election Is "Generality" </H5>   North Korea maintains that all citizens, 17 years of age or  older, have the rights to vote and to run as a candidate for an  election regardless of their gender, national origin,  occupation, length of residency, levels of income and education,  political party affiliation, political opinions and religion  (Article 66 of the constitution), and the working mass do  participate in an election on unlimited basis. As the result,  it further maintains, yesteryear's farmhands, odd laborers and  women, who make up one-half of the entire population, are being  elected to various levels of elective offices of the regime.  <H5>  Artificial Rules of "Equality" for Meaningless "Election" </H5>   However, we can surmise that this rule of "equality" is  nothing more than a statutory clause in the constitution and has  no special meaning in practice of real operations. Because, in  practice, the freedom to vote and to run for an election is not  guaranteed for all "citizens."    In case of the gender issue, it is true that historically  about 26 percent, in average, of the total delegates elected for  local people's assemblies were women. However, this is nothing  but a result of the acceptable safe distribution ratio carefully  designed artificially based on Workers Party of Korea (WPK)  policies not only of women but of various sectors and levels.  We can describe this rule of "generality" as a systemic  mechanism to carry out efficiently the "unilateral control" by  bringing in various sectors and levels of the "citizens" into  WPK one-party dominated political activities, with their  individual freedom of expression effectively restricted, and  mobilize them into puppet plays.    The second rule, "equality" of election, is to maintain that  fairness and honesty are assured for election.    This is due to the idea that the "generality" rule, which  enable all of the working mass to participate in an election, by  itself, could not guarantee the perfect equality. The core of  the "equality" rule is that no voter would have any "special  preferential right" and everyone has one vote, election  districts are based on an equal number of population and each  district elects one delegate.    North Korea's election is a process for one delegate from  each election district with a population of 30,000, which is the  unit basis for the electoral division of the country. We do not  consider North Korea's election, which is an uncontested  election without a multiple candidacy, which is artificially  blocked, an election of "equality" that assures "honest  reflection" of the will of its "citizens," as North Korea  claims. This is because the election is meaningless as far as  the will of the electors is concerned for the election not only  restrict the freedom of candidacy but any candidate once  nominated would certainly be elected as if "winning by default"  because electors do not have the choice of electing one among  several candidates.  <H5>  Political Mobilization To Rationalize Hereditary System </H5>   North Korea describes its one-delegate-for-one-district  election system as "having significance in that each delegate of  a comparable level people's assembly represents equal number of  population and , thus, all electoral votes have an equal  weight." But this is no justification for eliminating a  competitive election with multiple candidates, and the election  is nothing but a systemic device to have particular persons  elected, ignoring the principles of free democratic election  which prescribe the fundamental rule of majority decision.    The undemocratic nature practiced by North Korea in its  election system is displayed clearly further in selection  process of candidates and voting mechanism.    North Korea maintains that candidates for delegate positions  are nominated and selected through free debates and expression  at a "respective resident general meeting" or "work site member  general meeting." However, a candidate selected at a "resident  general meeting" in reality neither has the origin nor a  resident of the district involved. The meeting but performs the  function of selecting a candidate as directed by the WPK  disguising the process as if it was the reflection of the local  residents' will.    The selection of candidates by political parties is carried  out in the same manner. There are such political parties as  Korean Socialist Democratic Party and Chon-dogyo Young Friends  Party as North Korea's constitution in its formality permits a  multiple political party system [Article 67] but they act as  WPK's satellite organizations and, instead of selecting a  candidate on their own, follow WPK's directive pertaining to the  rule of assignment and execute the channelled-down selection  process.    In effect, the instrument called the local people's assembly  is nothing more than a tool for WPK dictatorial rule consisting  of delegates handpicked by the WPK and installed by the regime.    Following official announcement of the election, WPK opened  its so-called election campaign by publicly displaying charts of  election districts and their candidates and reviewing the  rosters of voters in accordance with the administrative rules of  the people's assembly election law.    The election campaign aims at simply stirring up the  environment for election by mobilizing General Federation of  Trade Unions, Agricultural Workers Union and General Federation  of Culture and Art, which are government-mandated hierarchical  organizations, Juvenile Corps and Socialist Working Youth League  which are age-oriented organizations, and Women's League, and  does little to gain actual votes. This is simply because there  is no need to go after a vote in the channelled down single  candidate and uncontested election.    North Korea is boasting about its lowering the eligible  voter's age from 20 as stated in its old constitution (of 1948)  to 17 (the socialistic constitution of 1972) as a proof for  implementation of the "generality" election rule but this was  done in fact, we believe, in order to mobilize student/youth  organizations such as Juvenile Corps and Socialist Working Youth  League as vanguard units for election activities.    And, the "100 percent voting record" has been achieved  through the mechanisms such as having voters go to their voting  place in group formations, rather than individually, under the  direction of the chief of their people's neighborhood unit, and  mobile ballot boxes which an election committee brings to homes  of the elderly and the disabled.    The third rule is direct election and secret ballot.    North Korea continues its propaganda that its election  system  demonstrates the "people-oriented and democratic" nature,  claiming that the "direct/secret" election rule is "in order to  assure an election that accurately reflects the people's will."  This refers but to the window-dressing piece of constitutional  statute designed for external propaganda consumption and, in  real practice, it is a widely acknowledged fact that an election  committtee consisting of representatives of political parties  and socialist organizations plans and supervises a series of  election activities and conducts an open ballot election. The  perfect election record of the past which had shown "100 percent  approval" is the proof of this fact.    North Korea's election system is counter-people oriented in  that it stresses the "100 percent voter participation"  irrespective of constitutional provisions or the free will of  its citizens and is undemocratic in that it manufactures "100  percent approval" ignoring the free democratic election process.  North Korea, which is about to have the provincial (and  directly administered city) delegate election, is unmistakably  proving that its election is a political mobilization scheme to  assure establishment of the hereditary succession system of Kim  Il-song, the father, and his son as its tradition, through its  agitation campaign for unified political ideology centered  around Kim Il-song/Kim Chong-il and linking the election to  fighting against the nuclear inspection pressure it faces and to  such other issues as for increased coal production.</p>

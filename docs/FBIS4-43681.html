			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- The Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]  rejects the introduction of a "voluntary police reserve" and  broader use of the Bundeswehr at home. Corresponding proposals  by the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union  [CDU/CSU] would water down the current division of tasks, FDP  Secretary General Hoyer told journalists in Bonn today. It is  necessary to fill the 30,000 vacant positions among the police  and not opt for "superficial solutions that might turn out to be  dangerous."    After a meeting of the FDP Presidium, Hoyer stressed that  the  Liberals are against a "spare-time police," as suggested by  Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (CDU). The current division  of the monopoly of power must be maintained, according to which  internal threats must be fought by the police and external  threats by the Bundeswehr. "Internal security is too important.  Thus, the citizens must not be put off with makeshift  solutions," Hoyer pointed out.</p>

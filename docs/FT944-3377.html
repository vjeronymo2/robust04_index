			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / French MPs ban corporate gifts to parties The French National Assembly yesterday voted to ban corporate contributions to political parties and candidates, in a move to remove widespread suspicion of corruption in French political life. But clearly hoping to maintain their political life-style, deputies also refused to lower the ceilings on spending by parties and individual candidates. They also demanded that the state should step in to finance the gap which will be created by the ban on company gifts. Mr Charles Pasqua, interior minister, said the government would try to get MPs to reconsider and to lower the ceilings on political expenses during the rest of the debate which will wind up in the National Assembly this week and move to the Senate next week. But the Balladur government is now encountering more trouble from within its parliamentary majority than from the opposition Socialists. But the new outright ban on corporate campaign contributions threatens to 'bring back the bag men with their suitcases of money,' said Mr Guy Carcassonne, a law professor who helped the Rocard government design its 1990 law. This law, together with an earlier piece of legislation in 1988, legalised and therefore controlled companies' gifts to politicians, while also introducing some public funding of political expenses. At the outset of the latest corruptions scandals, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur argued that the allegations that led to the resignation of three of his ministers related largely to events before 1990, and therefore the subsequent legislation should be allowed to work. But public reaction has since forced him into endorsing more drastic action to cut the umbilical cord between business and politics. Mr Pasqua said he was ready to raise from 30 to 50 per cent the proportion of candidates' election expenses that the state was prepared to reimburse, but some MPs yesterday said they wanted this share raised to 70, or even 100 per cent. According to the national watchdog body on political campaign spending, companies gave a total of FFr367m (Pounds 43.5m) to parties and candidates in 1993, more than triple the amount given by individuals. Meanwhile, the Senate yesterday rejected a controversial national assembly amendment that would have made it illegal for the press to publish the results of magistrates' investigations.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andreas Wassermann: "Dresden Kaleidoscope of </F> Colors"]    [Text] Kurt Biedenkopf was fascinated by the Greens at an  early date--at least as a political phenomenon. When other CDU  [Christian Democratic Union] politicians were still demonizing  the alternative party as a threat to democracy and to Germany as  a business location, the former secretary-general of the CDU, in  his book "Zeitsignale," was already openly paying respect to the  Greens: "Most likely it is precisely the radicalness of thought,  this willingness to talk about the need for compromise only when  the need has become evident and the idea as a whole appears to  be unimplementable otherwise, which is the main reason for the  attractiveness of this party among young people."    Nor does the CDU free-thinker want to exclude a party such  as  this. In specific cases, he even sees proximities as far as  content is concerned. And among the Greens, as well, Biedenkopf  is one of the few conservatives who is held in high regard. Also  within the alternative party, the politician [Biedenkopf], who,  after all, was advocating the renunciation of the growth  ideology before the Greens came into existence as a party, is a  much sought after discussion partner.    It is hardly surprising, therefore, that a black-green  coalition following the Landtag election on 11 September is  being discussed in Saxony, of all places--a land governed by  Biedenkopf with an absolute CDU majority since the fall of 1990.  The only thing surprising about this is that it is the Greens  who are the driving force. While at the Federal level it is CDU  politicians, above all, such as Environmental Minister Klaus  Toepfer, for example, who are playing out the black-green card,  albeit without having to take a trick with it, Biedenkopf is  more laid back. He does, to be sure, in this or that meeting  with journalists in Bonn, drop a hint that such a coalition  would indeed have a certain amount of appeal, but officially he  is "only amused" by the discussion. The reason for this is that  the minister-president of Saxony is simply pinning his hopes  untiringly on gaining an absolute majority--despite a headwind  from Bonn and despite poll results, which give his CDU around 40  percent in the free state.    Things are different with the Greens. Werner Schulz,  representative of the Bundestag from Leipzig and whip of the  Alliance 90/Greens group, has been beating the drums for months  for "the enticing project." Although "the CDU is not exactly our  dream partner," thus Schulz during an interview with the Berlin  WOCHENPOST, "from the point of view of the creative  possibilities, the science of colors really is different here in  Saxony." While at the federal level no commonalities can be made  out, he believes that he can "see first signs for a cooperation  with the CDU" in land politics in Saxony.    And it is unlikely that they are more than just first signs.  Also in Saxony, there is more that separates the Greens and the  CDU, contentwise, than what links them. It is true that, with  issues which Biedenkopf views as especially important, the  Greens are often closer to the CDU free-thinker as far as  content is concerned than are his own party friends,  particularly those in Bonn. This is always the case, for  example, whenever "Wossi" [i.e. both Wessi and Ossi] Biedenkopf  wants to discuss the future status of pet West German  possessions. And so Heiko Weigel, chairman of the Greens party  in Saxony and a Schulz supporter, "agrees in some ways" with  Biedenkopf's ideas on the dismantling of the state  administration system, the privatization of public services, and  the reorganization of the social security system. In the  domestic and education policy areas, however, which carry much  more weight at the political land level, also during possible  coalition negotiations, the CDU and the Alliance/Greens are  worlds apart in the free state as well.    The fact that, despite this, Schulz repeatedly calls on his  party's land organization to support the black-green option has  a lot to do with east German peculiarities and federal-level  political considerations. Schulz sees the influence of the  Greens dropping dramatically in the Bundesrat, now that the SPD  [Social Democratic Party of Germany] is able to rule alone again  in Lower Saxony and the traffic-light coalition in Brandenburg  has collapsed. According to Schulz, the Greens must "avail  themselves of every opportunity" to increase their importance  again in that body.    He also feels that, with a black-green alliance at the land  level, the status of CDU reformers at the federal level, such as  former Secretary General Heiner Geissler, Environmental Minister  Toepfer, or Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth, would be  strengthened, and the Union parties' course to the right that  caucus leader Wolfgang Schaeuble is pursuing could in this way  be stopped or at least weakened. In the persons of the Saxon CDU  reformers gathered around Environmental Minister Arnold Vaatz  and Social Affairs Minister Hans Geisler, whose political  molding process took place during the eruption period in the  fall of 1989, Schulz sees possible alliance partners who could  also make possible the success of a black-green coalition. There  is no denying that the Christian Democrats in the free state are  "an unusual conglomeration, personnelwise, the likes of which  one finds nowhere else in Germany," Schulz says.    There are in fact sympathies for the Alliance/Greens within  the Saxon CDU, which on the one hand, as in Vaatz's case, stem  from old attachments in the GDR opposition, and which find their  definition above all in the mutual rigorousness with which the  critical reappraisal of the GDR's past is conducted. Joining  them are unorthodox CDU members in the west who are mourning the  "missed opportunity" for a black-green coalition in  Baden-Wuerttemberg. Interested also are CDU politicians such as  [landtag] caucus leader Herbert Goliasch, who will see their  influence grow in the event Biedenkopf does not govern in a  grand coalition together with the SPD but instead only with a  smaller and less influential partner.    Schulz realizes that the black-green color games could make  or break the land organization of the alternative party, but  this apparently does not bother him. The Greens in the free  state are hyperpragmatic to a man, to be sure. But an alliance  with the CDU would not automatically be approved by a majority  even among the 1,200 party members in Saxony. At the grass  roots, the fact that Biedenkopf, contrary to initial assurances,  does not think much of a politics of "round tables," is deeply  ingrained. The Alliance 90/The Greens, who see themselves as the  legitimate heirs of the civil rights movement in the GDR, would  like to have been involved to a greater extent. And Schulz  knows, therefore, that the Greens "cannot permit themselves to  be sold for peanuts" in a possible governing alliance.    At the Federal level of the Greens, the kaleidoscope of  colors in Dresden is being followed without any great  excitement. Hessen's environmental minister, Joschka Fischer,  allegedly has no objections to an experiment such as this in  "faraway Saxony." And his close associate Hubert Kleinert saw  the value of such reflections already in connection with the  exploratory talks on participating in the government in  Baden-Wuerttemberg: "It brought the ecology party a sizable  increase in public support." However, and of that too Kleinert  is convinced, the lack of emotion with which the party's grass  roots accepted the sounding-out talks following the landtag  election in April 1992 would have "changed abruptly during a  serious alliance discussion."</p>

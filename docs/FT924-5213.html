			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jute output continues to shrink ALL JUTE producing countries except for China will be harvesting smaller crops in the current season. In India, the biggest producer, production is forecast to decline to 1.17m tonnes from 1.62m tonnes in 1991-92, according to Mr RN De, the country's jute commissioner. Bangladesh, which falls within the same climatic zone as eastern India, is expected to have a crop of 828,000 tonnes, down from 949,000 tonnes last season. The Thai and Nepalese crops of kenaf (a jute-like hard fibre) are expected to be marginally lower at 161,000 tonnes and 11,000 tonnes respectively. But Chinese production of raw jute is forecast to rise 7,000 tonnes to 520,000 tonnes. The Dhaka-based International Jute Organisation, which has made these production estimates, thinks falling prices of raw jute are primarily responsible for the setback in output. Jute farmers outside China have reduced the land under jute this season: in India from 2.55m to 2m acres (800,000 hectares); in Bangladesh from 1.45m to 1.24m acres. Thailand's kenaf area has declined to 303,000 acres from 345,000, while Nepal's has fallen from 38,300 acres to 23,500. China's jute area has remained at 741,000 acres. According to Mr De, the shrinking world trade in raw jute has hit the jute economy badly. World trade in the fibre declined from 459,700 tonnes in 1989-90 to 350,500 tonnes in 1990-91 and 327,600 tonnes in 1991-92.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei index eases after week of recovery SHARE prices moved marginally lower on late afternoon profit-taking, but sentiment remained firm amid active trading throughout the day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed down 39.63 at 17,023.78, 4.2 per cent higher on the week, after a low of 16,950.44 and a high of 17,177.69. Active buying by financial institutions and public funds countered arbitrage selling and profit-taking, with share prices falling just before the close on large-lot selling by a foreign broker.

The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 7.01 to 1,298.88 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.16 to 1,058.17. Short sellers continued to cover positions, as speculation continued of an imminent discount rate cut. Comments during parliament by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, dismissing worries of large-lot selling by companies facing redemptions on equity linked bonds, eased fears over a weak stock market ahead of the March year end book closing. Trading in Oji Paper and Kanzaki Paper was suspended in the afternoon session on reports of a merger. After the close the two companies announced that they would merge in October at the ratio of five Oji shares to six Kanzaki shares. Kanzaki rose Y11 to Y615 and Oji fell Y4 to Y871 before trading was halted. Some shipbuilding stocks extended gains on a comment by Mr Miyazawa that the use of doubled hull tankers may become a strict requirement. Hitachi Zosen rose Y11 to Y527 but Mitsui Shipbuilding fell Y6 to Y381 on profit-taking. Nippon Housing Loan rose Y9 to Y289 on reports of a restructuring plan, centring around rate cuts by its creditors. Isuzu Motors, was the volume leader for the third straight trading day, rising Y3 to Y367 on active buying by dealers. In Osaka, the OSE average closed up 133.09 at 18,423.45 in volume of 44.3m shares. Ono Pharmaceutical gained Y100 to Y5,570. Roundup Some bright spots emerged in Pacific Rim markets.

HONG KONG more than halved sharp early losses as bargain hunters returned in the afternoon. The Hang Seng index ended 53.10 lower 5,743.65, down 2.9 per cent on the week.

Leading stocks led the losers, with HSBC Holdings falling HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 60 after Thursday's HKDollars 1.50 decline.

The BSE index nosed through the 2,700 level briefly before closing at 2,680.79, up 35.43 on the day on5.4 per cent on the week.

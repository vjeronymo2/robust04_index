			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Poor buying behind Vivat fall to 'unacceptable' Pounds 0.68m loss MR CHRISTOPHER Burnett, the new chairman of Vivat Holdings, yesterday rebuked the previous management's 'poor buying decisions' and its diversification from the core business. These, he said, were responsible for turning a pre-tax profit into a loss, which translated into losses after tax and extraordinary items of Pounds 12.5m. For the year to December 31 the Lee Cooper Jeans manufacturer, 29.9 per cent owned by Wing Tai, the Singapore clothing company, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 678,000 (profit Pounds 3.65m). This was struck on turnover 14 per cent down at Pounds 89.1m (Pounds 103.7m). Mr Burnett, who took over in October, described the results as 'unacceptable' and said it was a 'sad reflection' on the way the group had been managed. However, he added that the current first-half trading had so far been encouraging, although it was too early to say whether the group would move back into the black. The exceptional item of Pounds 559,000 related to the relocation of the group's headquarters from Paris, where the chief executive and finance director had been based, to London. A further Pounds 11.9m was taken as an extraordinary item. This related mainly to lease obligations to Grant Seward, Vivat's former retail subsidiary sold in 1988 to Chelsea Man which subsequently went into liquidation. The extraordinary item was swollen by the writing-off of two years' payments from sale and lease-backs of trade marks; bank borrowings to Otto Albert, its German subsidiary which was put into receivership, and losses arising from the disposal of a small Spanish subsidiary. This reduced shareholders' funds by Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 15.1m, increasing gearing to 73 per cent. Net borrowings were Pounds 11m at the end of the year. Losses per share emerged at 1.2p (earnings 8.3p). The final dividend has been passed (0.5p), leaving no payment for the year (0.5p).</p>

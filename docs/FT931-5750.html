			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Access to Equity: USM debate shifts focus as deadline nears TOMORROW'S deadline for responses to the Stock Exchange's proposed closure of the Unlisted Securities Market has brought into focus previously ambiguous and often confused arguments about a second market devoted to smaller companies. After years of dipping into a variety of informal markets - from over the counter to Rule 535.2 - participants are now calling for a long-term solution to the public trading of smaller companies. For most, this means the creation of one or more tiers on the official list, excluding the FTSE-350, which would carry less onerous requirements. Yet this argument appears not to have reached the stock exchange in detailed form. The exchange is believed to have received fewer than 50 responses so far and to be disappointed with both the quantity and quality. Two main concerns appear to be occupying those who have responded; first, inheritance tax exemptions for companies on the USM, and second, the costs of moving to the official list. The stock exchange is believed to feel that neither is crucial enough to halt the demise of the USM. The tax concerns have been raised by just 10 USM companies. Nevertheless, the issue will almost certainly have been addressed in the stock exchange's Budget submission. On the second concern, the costs of moving to the main market will be largely eliminated by EC directives on listing particulars and concessions from the exchange itself. Such moves are welcome, yet critics say they fail to address the problems of companies seeking to come to the market for the first time. The issue is made more pressing with the recent stock market revival in smaller companies. The newest lobby group, the City Group for Smaller Companies, argues that the closure of the USM before a viable alternative is hammered out shows a lack of concern for this demand by the stock exchange. Cisco is angling for segmentation of the official list - ie setting up categories according to market capitalisation with appropriate class tests according to size. Although the group has not yet produced an official policy statement on such a move, Richard Balarkas, chief executive, says the most common view is that companies outside the FTSE-350 should be governed by less onerous regulations. Small company brokers, such as Albert E Sharp, tend to agree that a tier system on the existing list is the best possible route. 'There is a certain credibility attached to something governed by the stock exchange,' says Mr Eddie McCutcheon, head of corporate finance at Sharp's. Although the exchange would have to continue its regulatory role, Mr McCutcheon argues that it should be possible to set a 'cut off below Pounds 50m (market capitalisation) where the rules are a little easier'. The stock exchange, for its part, would argue that a two or more tier system is likely to occur through evolution (although it would also say that it would be difficult to ease the requirements at the lower end while maintaining a regulatory role). Plans for the development of a Europe-wide trading facility for the largest companies could leave a national market with little more than those very companies that Cisco wants to highlight. Thus, by default, the stock exchange would be running a smaller companies market. One source close to the exchange described such evolution as occurring through 'the creation of a premier league, rather than the setting up of a fifth division'. Such evolution could take too long for those in the small company sector. Although they are demanding action now, little is likely to come of the recommendations received so far. The best that small company pundits can hope for might be the delay of the deadline for new admissions to the USM until amendments to EC directives take effect. Even that largely symbolic gesture would be welcome. 'I think I would like to see that firmly in place before they pull down the shutters on the USM,' says Mr McCutcheon.</p>

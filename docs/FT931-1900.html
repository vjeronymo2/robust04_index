			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Krupp men yearn for 1988: The restructuring of the German steel industry as part of the upheaval in the sector throughout Europe has elicited widespread protest. FT writers report on the hopes and fears of two communities in east and west Germany DICKMAN Hock, a worker at Krupp Stahl's plant in Rheinhausen, sweats and pants as he moves the wrought iron bollard around and settles it into fresh cement. Behind the green bollard, torn by protesting steel workers from the pavement in front of the state government's seat in Dusseldorf, a handful of his colleagues look on gloomily. Every day since the closure of the plant was announced last month they stand in front of Gate 1 and wish they were back in 1988. Then, Rheinhausen embodied the industrial might of German steel workers. After a six-month sit-in by workers, the management of Krupp Stahl, the second largest steel producer in Germany, reversed its decision to close the oldest steel plant in the Ruhr valley. Today, the days of radical labour unrest in the heartland of industrial Germany are gone. Despite a series of protests workers admit solidarity no longer exists and closure of the plant is unavoidable. With jobs disappearing across the industry, workers say they no longer have the spirit to fight together. Instead, the plight of the steel industry has pitted plants against plants, a situation exploited by management in its attempt to make closure acceptable. Unlike 1988, when closure was announced overnight, Krupp's management unveiled plans last January to shut a whole integrated plant either in Rheinhausen or in Dortmund, 20km away. 'That strategy killed workers' solidarity,' says Karlheinz Ebe, a technician at Krupp's plant. A few weeks later, the axe fell on Rheinhausen. Last night, Rheinhausen inhabitants turned off their domestic lights in a show of support for the steel workers. Tonight, steel workers from throughout the Ruhr region plan to begin a three-day march to Bonn. But with the recession hitting the region hard, protests seem little more than symbolic. Rheinhausen, which is home to the steel plants of both Krupp and Thyssen, Germany's largest steel maker, has an unemployment rate edging 12 per cent. The closure of the Krupp plant in Rheinhausen will put an additional 2,300 workers out of a job and affect 2,000 more who depend on the steel business. Thyssen plans to put off 8,000 workers, mostly in its steel divisions, by the end of 1994. With all plants trimming overcapacity, workers have instead turned their anger at Brussels. 'How can you explain to us that we are closing down when Italian and Spanish steel producers receive massive subsidies?' says Mr Klaus Liebman from the workers' council in Rheinhausen. Driving the bollard in the fresh spring soil, Mr Hock says he will not give up completely, however. 'We have to show Dusseldorf, Bonn and Brussels they can't tell us what to do,' he goes on. 'Tell them once more before we start working in McDonald's' 'Or in hell,' adds Dieter Biesgen, the porter at Gate 2, who has been with Krupp for 37 years. 'It looks like only the blast furnaces there need additional steel workers.'</p>

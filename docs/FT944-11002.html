			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: C&amp;W wins telecoms services deal in US Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecoms group, has been selected by an alliance of small US wireless operators to provide long-distance telecoms services to knit together their proposed networks. C&amp;W's US subsidiary is already an established long-distance US operator, and the contract does not require heavy investment. However, C&amp;W said that if the wireless operators - all small and medium-sized concerns - succeeded in gaining licences for new 'personal communications services' (PCS) networks, the resulting business could be worth 'several hundred millions of dollars a year' to C&amp;W within five years. The PCS licences are due to be auctioned next year by the Federal Communications Commission, the US regulatory authority. The FCC has reserved a proportion of the licences for smaller operators. AT&amp;T, the US operator and equipment supplier, will supply network equipment for the alliance. C&amp;W's US subsidiary had a turnover of Dollars 560m last year.</p>

The Senate unanimously approved the decision made in the  morning by the members of the Appointments Committee, chaired by  Justicialist Party Senator Deolindo Bittel. The Appointments  Committee passed judgment on the proposals submitted by the  executive branch.    The committee rejected an objection to the Lopez record that  was formally raised by trustees of a faction of the National  Railway Union.    The objection alleged that when Lopez served as a judge of  the labor court, he passed a biased judgment, favoring [National  Railway Union leader] Jose Pedraza in an electoral conflict in  his labor union.    The new justices will replace Rodolfo Barra and Mariano  Cavagna Martinez, who resigned their posts in the Supreme Court  in order to meet the terms established in a pact between  President Carlos Menem and [Radical Civic Union president] Raul  Alfonsin on constitutional reform.    During the session, the Senate also approved the promotion  of  Army Colonel Enrique Alberto Grazzini. [passage omitted]</p>

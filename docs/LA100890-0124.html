Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> ASTRONAUTS SING A SONG IN SPACE  </P> <P> After restoring some of NASA's credibility with a successful launch and  deployment of the Ulysses sun probe, Discovery's crew tended to experiments  today and beamed down a birthday greeting for one of the astronaut's wives.  </P> <P> The men sang "Happy Birthday" to Kaye Akers, wife of astronaut Tom Akers. In  lieu of a candle, they held up a reflective plastic stick used aboard the  shuttle as a light source.  </P> <P> Ulysses, meanwhile, raced across the solar system on its five-year roundabout  journey to explore the sun's poles.  </P></p>

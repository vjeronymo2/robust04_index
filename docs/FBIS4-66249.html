			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with economists by GAIGE reporter Hu Shuli (5170 </F> 5289 4539): "Reform in 1994 Expected To Be More Risky,  Difficult"]    [Text] "It is one of the fundamental characteristics of an  individualistic capitalistic economy that it is rationalized on  the basis of rigorous calculation, directed with foresight and  caution toward the economic success which is sought in sharp  contrast to the hand-to-mouth existence of the peasant, and to  the privileged traditionalism of the guild craftsman and of the  adventurers' capitalism, oriented to the exploitation of  political opportunities and irrational speculation."    -- Max Weber, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of  Capitalism    As they ushered in 1994, many Chinese economists were both  excited and a little anxious.    "The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Certain Issues  Relating to the Building of a Socialist Market Economy,"  unveiled a year ago, has been described by the press in a  variety of bold and lofty terms: "a grand design," "a call to  arms." While the man on the street felt inspired by these  necessary comments, economists adept at independent thinking,  having understood the content and implications of the  "Decision," have begun to foresee the grim challenges facing  China as it works to implement the document.    Henceforth, as someone said, China has entered an era when  "reform is an utterly mental exercise." Nineteen ninety-four  happens to be the first year of rational reform.    Rationality--The Soul of the Market Economy    "Speed up reform, speed up development," so says the  "Decision." It is clear what "speed up development" means both  theoretically and practically. That "development is the way to  go" is now deeply etched in the public psychology. But what  about "speed up reform?"    We must realize that reform in China has always been a  gradual process, moving from the countryside to cities, from  special economic zones and the coast to the interior, from the  establishment of individual enterprises, township and town  enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises to the  transformation of the mechanism of state enterprises, and from  the price decontrol of some commodities to the abolition of  command planning. In the 15 years since reform began, there have  been ups and downs, twists and turns, but the upshot is a  miracle that has caught the attention of the world, fueled the  spectacular growth of the economy--and, by spawning a host of  problems that are as distressing as they are stubborn, exacted a  steep price. At the numerous seminars and conferences held in  Beijing in the past half year, economists have enumerated, from  a variety of perspectives, the costs of the current reform with  its dual-track system:    Cost 1: The boom-and-bust economic cycle. When controls are  tightened, life is snuffed out of the economy. When things are  eased up, there is chaos.    Cost 2: The loss of state properties. Rising corruption.    Cost 3: Urban-rural gap widens. Inequitable distribution.    Cost 4: Financial disorder. The "bubble effect."    Look more closely, and you can find the fifth, sixth,  seventh, eighth, and even twentieth costs. An article, perhaps  even a tome, can be written on each one of them.    There is probably not a single economist who believes reform  comes without a price tag. There is probably nobody who  fantasizes writing a cure-all prescription. We hope that in the  future reform does not come with a price. Nevertheless, anybody  remotely familiar with the theory and practice of the modern  market economy knows that economic life characterized by  arbitrariness, corruption, and disorder is not inherent in the  market itself but is exactly the opposite. It is a sheer  misunderstanding to think that a market economy is inevitably a  filthy thing, "every pore oozing with blood from head to toe."  The reason is that at the heart of the modern market economy is  rationality, including the rational activities of microeconomic  organizations and the rationalization and rationality of the  social macro control mechanism and the legal framework.    However, far removed the dual economic structure may be from  the old order, if it fails to complete the transition to the  market system based on the principle of rationality, at best it  becomes an embryonic but distorted version of a market economy.    This is precisely why those clear-headed economists  earnestly  hope and strongly call for reform to be accelerated and deepened  across the board even as they praise the achievements of past  reform without reservation.    Some sharp words have been uttered. Dr. Du Runsheng [2629  3387 3932], the 80-year-old president of the China Land  Institute, for instance, told reporters as early as last summer  that we must start thinking about merging the two tracks of the  dual-track system right now. Not that we do not need the  dual-track system; in fact, it is essential. But there are two  sides to everything in the world, even good things. Today we  must accelerate the transition from the dual-track system to a  market economy conscientiously and purposefully in accordance  with a plan. Any more flip-flops and the masses will have little  confidence in reform.    Then, there is Fan Hengshan [5400 1854 1472], who has a  doctorate in economics and works in the State Restructuring of  the Economic System Commission. Not long ago he spoke to this  reporter with the bluntness and intelligence of youth. "The  negative effects of the conflicts and loopholes of the  dual-track system have now outweighed the positive results of  reform. We have reached the `uppermost limit' of tolerable  reform costs. Whether or not we can swiftly go beyond the  `uppermost limit' has become a choice which we must make without  delay and which will decide the success or failure of reform."    The "Decision" adopted by the 3d Plenum of the 14th CPC  Central Committee and its appendices make up a lengthy document.  In summing up the overall reform mission called for by the  "Decision," economists use a variety of terms: "dual-track  coexistence," "all-round coordinated reform," "reform of key  areas," and "the macro policy environment necessary for the  creation of a market economy." Perhaps more than the stirring  eulogistic language -- "the great bridge," "blueprint," "call to  arms"--used by the press, it is these honest down-to-earth  characterizations by the economists which can better help us  understand the nature of the "Decision" and the arduousness of  the reform facing us. The call to "speed up reform" was made  with the mission in mind. Not for a moment can one interpret it  as an ordinary exhortation.    Well, then, should the new round of reform be the "storming  of a fortified position" or incremental reform?    Some people look at it this way: Reform today still depends  on a stable social environment. Thus the strategy of moving  incrementally in general but going for breakthroughs at specific  points should be continued. At the present stage, however, with  its basic characteristic of "storming fortified positions," an  over-emphasis on incrementalism and stability may cause us to  miss opportunities and artificially lengthen the transitional  period, ultimately making reform more risky and costly. We must  zero in on the key links and grasp the favorable opportunity to  achieve a breakthrough.    Read the "Decision" more carefully and you will come across  this line: "Push ahead on all fronts and go for breakthroughs  where they really matter." Now we know.  <H5>  Over-Heating or Over-Anxious? </H5>   It was a drizzly evening soon after the closing of the  plenary session of the CPC Central Committee. Inside the  professors' building, which is part of the faculty and staff  quarters on the campus of Beijing Normal University, Professor  Wu Jinglian [0702 2417 8834] was at his desk revising the  commentary he had written for ZHONGHUA GONGSHANG SHIBAO. The  title: "Take the First Step and Do It Right."    Wu Jinglian, currently a researcher with the State Council's  Development Studies Center, had just returned from South Korea  four days earlier. As soon as he arrived back in Beijing, he  telephoned Ding Wang [0002 2598], editor-in-chief of ZHONGHUA  GONGSHANG SHIBAO. Even when he was on the road, this economist,  who cares for the nation and the people, was thinking how to  take the critical first step after the "Decision" was unveiled.    The first thing that came to his mind was the economic  climate.    As he saw it, to ensure that reform measures already decided  upon are implemented as planned, the foremost task is to  continue to create a favorable economic climate and keep it that  way, preventing the economy from overheating and inflation from  coming back. Otherwise, the new reform may be derailed as soon  as it is introduced and in the end we may, to our eternal  regret, miss a splendid opportunity to push ahead with reform.    These views were shared by a number of other economists.    Not long ago interested experts from the Chinese Academy of  Science and the State Statistical Bureau jointly conducted a  study to analyze the economic situation and make projections.  According to that study, the "soft-landing" of the economy in  1994 following the tightening of macroeconomic regulation and  control in the summer of 1993 may produce any one of several  possible outcomes:    Outcome 1: The various regulatory and control  measures are applied with the right degree of intensity and are  coordinated from top to bottom, bringing the overheated economy  under control. Inflation begins heading downward and the  economic growth rate drops to 10 percent or so. Even in times of  economic retrenchment, banking reform, fiscal reform, and tax  reform are intensified, nudging state enterprises to enter the  market. After a smooth transition, the economy enters a  prolonged period of steady growth.    Outcome 2: Macroeconomic regulation and control  goes a little too far. Excessive retrenchment decelerates the  economy a tad too much, forcing the economy to "hard land."  Although the scale of investment and price increases are reined  in, we fail to shift the focus of regulation and control to  adjusting the optimizing the structure. In the end, economic  development suffers. Not only that, but the seeds of a new round  of "overheating" have been sown.    Outcome 3: To avoid the disruptions of structural  adjustment and yielding to pressure brought on by the string of  problems resulting from decelerated economic growth, economic  reform is stalled out. There is a lack of firm resolve in the  face of a chorus of complaints from localities and enterprises.  To stimulate an economic recovery, the government hastily adopts  a liberal monetary policy, loosens its grip on the scale of  investment, and boosts the money supply. The result is a  premature expansion of the economy and the resumption of  inflation, forcing the policymakers to readjust again by putting  on the brakes.    In their analysis the experts said that currently Outcome 1  is the desired outcome, Outcome 2 will not materialize in the  near future, and we need to be on guard against a premature  rebound of the economy, which is the last outcome.    Wu Jinglian also said, "The rate of economic growth is  merely  the synergistic result of a variety of factors working together,  such as institutions and policies that constrain economic  growth, and not the cause of changes in economic development. In  China, where idle resources available for retrospective  investment are scarce, the rate of economic growth is directly  proportional to the real gain in productivity. To avoid economic  overheating, we should not use the economic growth rate as the  central indicator to guide our work."    Wishes and expectations, however, are no substitute for  reality. Professor Zhang Zhuoyuan [1728 0587 0337], director of  the Finance and Trade Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social  Sciences [CASS], said after taking a sober look at the state of  the economy, "If the present trends are any indicator, there is  little hope that Outcome One in the above analysis can be  realized in 1994. The likelihood of Outcome 2 materializing is  also slim. In contrast, there is a good chance we may end up  with Outcome 3: the economy taking off again without landing,  finally leading to a hard-landing." He added, "The most likely  scenario is a cross between outcomes 1 and 3. If it turns out to  bear a closer resemblance to 1 than 3, we should consider  ourselves lucky."    Thus it is unlikely the new round of reform will be smooth  sailing.    Needless to say, some economists reject the "overheating"  scenario. At Changchunyuan on the campus of Beijing University  that same drizzly early-winter evening, Xiao Zhuoji [5618 3504  1015], a well-known economics professor, told this reporter  unequivocally, "The fact of the matter is that we need not worry  that the Chinese economy will overheat."    Professor Xiao Zhuoji argued that economic development in  China is cyclical, with each cycle lasting seven years. For  three and one-half years, we have robust growth, followed by  another three years and a half of adjustment. During the period  of strong growth, the economy surges ahead at the rate of 13 to  14 percent, which is both inevitable and normal. When we analyze  inflation, we need to look at the causes behind it. Inflation in  China after 1993 has something to do with the lifting of price  controls and the increase in the business tax, not the  over-expansion of the money supply. Therefore, Xiao Zhuoji said,  we should not exaggerate its danger.    Xiao Zhuoji also produced some data showing that real  household incomes outpaced inflation in the first half of 1993,  when urban and rural household incomes still rose 12 percent and  4 percent, respectively, after adjusting for inflation. With  income rising faster than inflation, the fear of some experts  that "households may have unrealistic expectations" is quite  redundant.    What then would be an appropriate rate of economic growth in  1994? In Professor Xiao Zhuoji's opinion, not lower than 10  percent.    Professor Xiao Zhuoji's opinion has quite a large following.  His supporters say, "Don't worry about slow growth. The worst  thing is standing still. The Chinese economy used to follow a  stop-go pattern. To date it is galloping along, and that is  normal. Moreover, the very concept of `overheating' is less than  clear."    In any case, it is both good and normal for reform-minded  economists in China to disagree among themselves and debate with  one another. All of them rightly wish to push ahead with the  enterprise of economic reform in China. In the end, their  arguments also will be tested in practice.  <H5>  Who Will "Weaken" Reform? </H5>   Economists consider "overheating" in terms of its effects on  the external environment for the next round of reform. But there  is another concern, namely that reform would be "weakened" by  purely internal human factors.    Reform measures must be put into effect by human beings. The  reform measures newly introduced by the CPC Central Committee  directly involve a number of departments in charge of  administration and management, the very same departments most  deeply rooted in the old order. To ask these people to bid  farewell to tradition and take the initiative to advance the  re-invention of the economic system as well as the overhaul of  the functions of their units is no different from asking them to  take up the scalpel to operate on themselves. How can we ensure  that they will make the first cut?    Fang Fenglei [2455 7364 7191], a young economist who is  deputy director of the Investment and Market Research Institute  under the Chinese Academy of Management Science and currently  managing director of the Hainan Sanya Yinjian Company, recently  convened and presided over an international conference in  Shenzhen on banking reform. He summed up the upcoming  macroeconomic reform in one sentence, "The difficulty lies in  maintaining intensity and momentum."    Fang Fenglei said, "It must be admitted that reform has  fallen behind badly in such key areas as banking, foreign  exchange, finance, taxation, and foreign trade. The inertia of  traditional forces is exceptionally powerful. How can we be sure  that people who operated in accordance with standard procedures  under the traditional system will now take the initiative to  spearhead reform in their own units energetically? If the new  reform is stalled out even before it is launched because of some  human factors, the impact on the creation of a market economy as  a whole would be enormous."    He agreed that we should certainly think strategically and  phase in new reform measures gradually in stages. Be that as it  may, the stress should be on the need to firmly implement the  CPC Central Committee's "Decision" and prevent the departments  involved from using all sorts of excuses to undermine the  leadership's resolve in the course of implementation, thereby  weakening the new reform and precluding the realization of the  reform demands already put forward. Alternatively they may keep  dragging their feet in launching the new reform plan. In the  end, the latter may never see the light of day.    Of course, the danger of weakening reform comes not only  from  conservative-minded operatives but also from vested interests  who have benefited enormously and tangibly from exploiting the  loopholes of the dual-track system in the past decade and more  of incremental reform. This is something the experts all agreed  on.    Just open any newspaper or glance at the television and you  can get an idea. Since when has white-collar crime in China  meant cases involving millions, even tens of millions, of yuan?  Since when have white-collar criminals in China been moving in  and out of the country? Since when has white-collar crime spread  all over the land, from north to south, from east to west, from  Beijing to every province? It is impossible to uproot human  greed, but what sort of external environment has given it such a  hospitable breeding ground? Apart from those criminals who have  committed the most flagrant crimes and been punished in  accordance with the law, how many others have so far escaped the  long arm of the law?    Some of the data are shocking:    -- In 1987 alone, the price differential of all controlled  commodities amounted to more than 130 billion yuan, the  interest-on-funds differential totaled about 20 billion yuan,  and the foreign exchange price differential amounted to 50  billion yuan, for a combined price differential society-wide of  more than 200 billion yuan. Since price differentials are on  this mammoth a scale and there are so many institutional  loopholes, the exploiters reaped a windfall of a whopping 10  billion yuan even if they pocketed only 5 percent of the  differential income.    -- Investment loans totalled 2,200 billion yuan or so in  1992. Because interest rates were so low and the demand for  funds was so strong, private kickbacks accounted for 10 percent  of that sum at least. Here alone we are looking at 220 billion  yuan in hidden bribes.    This is only the tip of the iceberg of economic  opportunities  available to the vested interests.    Those who break the law are in the minority, but it is  totally conceivable that all over China there are countless  people who have made a fortune legally or not illegally by  taking advantage of a policy or a law, who started out with  quite modest expectations but ended up making a killing anyway  because the distorted market "favored" them, who got caught up  in the real estate speculation fever or stock market fever and  who always hope to reap a bonanza from the current dual-track  system even thought they have not done so yet...    Referring to this situation, Lin Yifu [2651 3015 1133], a  Taiwanese who holds a Ph.D. in economics and has come to China  from the University of Chicago, made the following comment:  "Reform no doubt entails the reshuffle of the old pattern of  vested interests. But because a new environment of competition  has not come into being even as the old interest structure is  being reformed and shaken up, and because not every individual  or interest group has been put on a level playing field even as  new profit-making opportunities are being created, public  expectations of reform have been skewed. Some people expect too  much, and if their expectations are not met completely, they  become skeptical and hesitant about reform. Other social groups  who don't expect good things from reform may boycott a  particular piece of reform. People in both groups may be tempted  to think and act opportunistically and make a killing, rendering  reform more difficult and risky."    The fact of the matter is that the new vested interests  created in recent years are definitely not limited to a  particular trade, profession, or unit. Nor do they form any  clear-cut interest group. Also, not every person who forms part  of the vested interests joins the forces consciously opposed to  the continuation of reform. However, it is a fact that vested  interests are present from top to bottom, from the coast to the  interior, to varying extents and in different forms. It is also  a fact that vested interests not only exist in industry,  commerce, and the agencies in charge of the economy, but have  also spread to other government departments, to judicial and  political circles, to the world of letters, to the cultural and  theoretical circles, and to the media.    In his analysis of this situation, Wu Jinglian said that by  providing spectacular opportunities for people who abuse their  office for private gain or who take advantage of a malformed  market to reap staggering profits, the prolonged existence of  the dual-track system has enabled corrosive vested interests to  grow. The vested interests and their representatives, therefore,  are not categorically opposed to reform, much less calling for a  return to the old beaten path of the planned economy. On the  other hand, pleased as they are with the dual-track system, they  argue against abolishing administrative intervention and call on  us to go slow with market regularization. Since reform revolves  around the creation of a market system for fair competition,  these people instinctively take unkindly to and oppose such  reform.    This is precisely why, Professor Wu Jinglian reminds us,  that  the vested interests, which are extremely powerful, may work to  distort the new round of reform while holding high the banner of  reform so as to create new opportunities to "trade power for  money," "engage in insider trading," and "play money games." As  a result, reform may become warped and distorted, in the end  departing from the right course. As a matter of fact, similar  things have happened many times in the course of reform in the  past several years.    In an analysis a year ago of the current situation in China,  Ji Si Dao, chief Beijing correspondent for the NEW YORK TIMES,  wrote, "Although things are going well now, it is hard to tell  whether in the future China will become a dragon like Singapore  or degenerate into yet another Latin American amoeba."    Look at the world around us and we can see that after World  War II a number of developing nations have fallen into the  so-called "Malthus trap" and exhibit the "Latin American  phenomenon." In those countries, an embryonic market economy  combined with administrative intervention and bureaucratic  privilege to give rise to a bureaucratic elite composed of the  rich and the powerful who owe their wealth to "rent-seeking  activities." The market economy was never developed fully and in  the end the economy suffered a disastrous decline.    Reportedly a Beijing doctor normally with no interest in  politics blurted out this biting epigram when faced with  bureaucrats who spout fine-sounding slogans but in reality  pervert justice for a bribe, "I see what you mean by socialist  market economy. People who used to have power now have money as  well... that is `socialist market economy.'" As long as a theory  remains empirically unverified, we can only make logical  inferences. The socialist market economy will finally prove that  this and other bitter sarcasms from the masses will not become a  harsh reality.    So far we can still congratulate ourselves on not missing  the  chance to effect the transition from the old system to the new  system smoothly. There is no reason to believe that resistance  by the vested interests can really block our march toward a  market economy. But think more carefully. The inertia bred by 15  years of incremental reform is humongous. So there is indeed a  possibility that the new round of reform may be weakened so much  by human factors that it becomes deformed or stillborn.    Come to think of it, clearly it is not because they have an  identical power of visualization that almost all economists  invariably refer to the coming round of reform as a "battle to  storm a heavily fortified position." As we take the first step  of reform in 1994, we should really interpret "storming a  heavily fortified position" accurately as a scientific  expression and not an example of poetic hyperbole. That way we  will be more determined and firm in our resolve, summoning up  even greater intelligence and courage to face up to the new  reform tasks.  <H5>  Exploring Ideological Liberation, I: State Ownership </H5>   After the "Decision" was made public, I talked to many  scholars, experts, party and government cadres, and  entrepreneurs. Their consensus: "It seems that the difficulties  of implementing the `Decision' cannot be underestimated." Dr.  Fan Hengshan, in particular, hit the nail on the head when he  said "I think the main problem ahead is not that we don't have a  well-defined reform philosophy, but that our thinking is not  liberated."    Ideological liberation is an old topic. Reformers harp back  on it in the face of new reform tasks because they realize full  well that the forces of traditional thinking cast a long shadow  on the road to reform.    Economists link the proposal of ideological liberation not  only to the overall goal of reform as stated in the "Decision,"  which is to create and perfect a market economy, but also  directly to other more specific major issues, which are of  fundamental importance.    Three matters are particularly worthy of mentioning. One is  public ownership, more specifically, the property rights of  state enterprises.    Some economists ask, "With economic reform having gone this  far, what should we concentrate on now so that the new system  can take center stage?" Among the many priorities, the foremost  is the reform of the state enterprise system. And it is the  property rights issue that lies at the heart of the reform of  the state enterprise system.    At long last the "Decision" adopted by the latest plenary  session puts forward a plan for a modern enterprise system and  offers an innovative interpretation of the principle of  upholding the predominance of public ownership, thus  highlighting the issue of modernizing public property rights.  However, the fact of the matter is that the dominance of the  traditional way of adhering to public ownership remains  stubbornly enshrined both on a conceptual level and in practical  terms.    China still had 13,600 large- and medium-sized state  enterprises as of 1992 with a combined output value of 1,350  billion yuan. Two-thirds of these enterprises are losing money,  while the remainder is marginally profitable. What are the  negative effects of this situation on national economic  development and on the overall drive to create a market economy?    Fan Hengshan sums up the four characteristics of the  existing  way of sustaining public ownership:    -- Emphasis on form, not content or result. In other words,  the only thing that matters is whether or not property rights  belong to the state, not whether an enterprise is being operated  in a way that preserves the value of public properties and adds  to such value.    -- We are interested only in the overall size, never mind  the  actual results. That is, what concerns us is that the state  economy accounts for over 51 percent of the overall economy,  never mind whether or not it actually plays a guiding and  regularizing role in national economic life.    -- The emphasis is solely on state properties in the form of  goods and materials, not state properties in the form of money.  In other words, there is a belief that only state properties in  tangible material form are real public properties.    -- There is a preoccupation with the static, with preserving  what already exists, while little is done to encourage fluidity  and value appreciation. The belief is that the only way to  prevent state assets from being lost is to leave them alone.    He calls this a passive way of maintaining public ownership,  the only consequence of which is to reduce existing state assets  to an "empty shell" while weakening the ability to increase  their volume. In the end, state assets will be lost in large  quantities.    After 15 years of reform, whither state enterprises? This  has  become a most thorny issue in the enterprise of reform as a  whole. From the contract system of the mid-1980's to the  proposal put forward two years ago to transform the operating  mechanism of enterprises, state enterprise reformers have  experimented in all sorts of ways within the framework of  delegating power and sharing profits with enterprises and  localities. But they have yet to turn the state enterprises  around. At the heart of their predicament is the failure to come  to grips with property rights.    The time has come, Fan Hengshan says, to clearly define  property rights relations and thoroughly overhaul the fuzzy  public ownership model in which "everybody is an owner but  nobody is responsible." As long as this issue is not resolved,  the mission put forward by the "Decision" of creating a modern  enterprise system will not be accomplished and the reform of  large- and medium-sized state enterprises will only go around in  circles.    Actually, it is not hard to come up with a coherent set of  thinking on resolving the property rights issue. What is hard is  liberating our thought, transcending the limits of traditional  thought, and proceeding from the general goal of establishing a  socialist market economy to understand public ownership and the  nature of the property rights of state enterprises correctly.    It was the night before the closing of the 3d Plenary of the  14th CPC Central Committee. Yu Guangyuan [0060 0342 6678], the  philosopher and economist of the older generation, spent the  evening writing a short article at his home in Beijing. He said,  "I hope reform will become more radical. Not only deeper, but  also faster." He also believed now is the time to make a mighty  effort to "wrestle with the reform of ownership structure."    Reform of the ownership structure--state enterprise property  rights--the modern enterprise system, that is, the company  system. If we conceptually shy away from this fundamental issue,  how can we even begin to talk about moving forward?  <H5>  Exploring Ideological Liberation, II: From "Overtaking" to </H5> Practical    There is another issue which is probably just as  fundamental:  "choosing a development strategy," in the words of some  economists.    There is a small ordinary-looking building near  Xihuangchenggen in Beijing. It is inside this unremarkable  building that some economists seclude themselves in  inconspicuous spots to study the mundane issues of agriculture.    In fact, it is precisely here that a number of brilliant  minds are watching China's future economic development model  from the perspective of agriculture and examining the theories  of development. Bear in mind that there are 1 billion peasants  in China and that to this day China remains an agricultural  country. These economists understand agriculture and hence China  very well.    Winter had arrived in Beijing; a cold front lingered in town  for several days. Braving the snow and the wind, this reporter  went to the small building to interview some of the experts  there and ask them to analyze the difficulties that may be  encountered after the "Decision" was introduced.    It is clear what they think: To implement the "Decision," we  need to liberate our thinking as far as development strategy is  concerned.    Dr. Lin Yifu talked about this in considerable detail. This  young economist, who once studied under Theodore Schultz, a  Nobel Laureate, at the University of Chicago and is currently a  researcher at the rural office of the State Council Development  Studies Center, has been involved in development economics  research for years.    Lin Yifu said, "The `Decision' is a very good document, the  most comprehensive since reform began. In its design of the  macro policy environment, the `Decision' is consistent with the  premises of a market economy. However, if we, in implementing  the document, still cling to old habits and ideologically favor  the heavy-industry-first development strategy, it may be quite  difficult to put the `Decision' into effect."    The "Decision," for instance, calls for establishing markets  for capital goods, allowing the market to set the prices of  funds and raw materials, and decontrolling exchange rates.  However, many industries will not make it if the dictates of the  market are really followed in making choices. After decades of  development, some industries now have existence potential, but a  majority still don't. For some industries whose development is  considered critical, overly high interest rates would be  intolerable. For other industries which need to import equipment  from overseas, excessively high exchange rates would also be a  big problem. To support these industries, should we continue a  coordinated policy of a welfare nature?    Hence the need to change our thinking about development  strategy. In practical economic work, that means jettisoning the  old "overtaking strategy" of emphasizing heavy industry and  embark on the road of development that is suited to China's  conditions. Only thus can the various reforms proposed in the  "Decision" be implemented.    What kind of development strategic thinking, then, should  China adopt? Lin Yifu's answer: the comparative advantage  strategy.    The so-called comparative advantage strategy means fully  exploiting the comparative economic advantage in product  technology and industrial structure at every stage of economic  development as a means of generating fast economic growth. There  is a perfect fit between the comparative advantage strategy and  the macro policy environment described in the "Decision" with  its full-fledged market economy. For instance, since China has a  huge population but is short on arable land and funds, it should  work harder to develop labor-intensive enterprises. Only by  making full use of this comparative advantage--cheaper and  internationally competitive products--can it accumulate funds  fairly and swiftly. When it becomes capital-rich instead of  fund-poor, China can then move onto the development of  capital-intensive industries.    Actually, the post-war economic history of a number of  developing countries speaks volumes.    The economies of India, the Philippines, and Argentina, have  consistently been slow-growth economies. These countries have  one thing in common: In hastening to overtake developed nations,  they have overlooked their own comparative advantage; their sole  preoccupation was to develop a capital-intensive industrial  system against a backdrop of fund shortages. The result: more  haste, less speed.    Although they started out at a lower level than many  countries in South and Central America, countries and regions  such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and other  latecomers like Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia either have  taken off economically or are about to do so. These nations too  have one thing in common: Following the principle of comparative  advantage, they relied on labor-intensive or resource-intensive  industries as the engine of economic growth and devoted  themselves to developing an export-oriented economy. As a  result, they accumulated a wealth of funds, making possible  industrial upgrading.    One other fact must be made clear: It is those very  countries  that made "overtaking" their goal with no regard to natural  conditions that had no choice but to resort to anti-market  policies and management systems. To rely on comparative  advantage, which is more pragmatic, we must create a market  environment that allows full competition.    According to a number of young and middle-aged economists,  China did adopt a development strategy that favored the  development of heavy industry in the early days of the PRC but  rethought its priorities as early as the 1960's, when the  strategy of "agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry"  was advanced. In the dozen years since reform went under way and  the open policy was introduced, even less was ahead about giving  heavy industry priority. In those same years, rapid gains were  indeed made in agriculture and the textile and light industries.  Even now, however, people have not risen above the mentality of  "developing heavy industry first" as part of the guiding thought  for economic work. This is actually at variance with the overall  plan of creating a market economy put forward by the CPC Central  Committee in its "Decision." Thus in thinking about the  development strategy, we should liberate our thought even  further.    One other person has talked about using comparative  advantage  from yet another angle. He is Du Runsheng, who comes from an  older generation of economists and is one of China's most  authoritative experts on rural issues.    I went to interview Du Runsheng just as a debate was raging  within the economics community on the relations between reform  and development. Asked about this, old Du Runsheng said,  "Development and reform... Development is the right thing to do,  but sometimes it should give way to reform. Development should  slow down a little in some years if necessary." Then he said  something very meaningful, "Some things both advance reform and  speed up development. Given the situation in China today, we  must come to grips with one thing, namely employment."    In old Du Runsheng's opinion, China's ample manpower is both  a burden and an opportunity. China should redouble its effort to  develop enterprises which require little capital but provide  lots of jobs, thus creating many employment opportunities. We  should solve the problem of money-losing enterprises without  delay and shift the resources to the development of enterprises  that create many jobs. In the process we also put to use our  comparative advantage. The employment issue lies at the very  heart of the drive to change and develop Chinese society.    While Du Runsheng did not expound on the theory of  development strategy, it is clear he was on the same track as  Lin Yifu and others. As China is perched on the threshold of a  new round of reform, these economists' original but pragmatic  thinking should be an inspiration to us all.    Exploring Ideological Liberation, III: "Weak Government?"  "Strong Government?"    Since last fall a young man and his idea have shaken up the  economics community and caused a good deal of controversy.    The scholar is none other than Dr. Hu Angang [5170 7254  6921], a researcher with the state of the nation analysis group  at the Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS]. The idea is that the  power of the Chinese Government has been in decline steadily.    For over two years Hu Angang and a Chinese scholar in the  United States named Wang Shaoguang [3769 4801 342] conducted a  quantitative analysis and comparative study in the United  States. In a report completed last May on the state of the  nation, they argued that because of the diminished ability of  the central government in recent years to raise revenue, the  Chinese Government has become a "weak government" in name and in  fact.    These young men came back from the other shore and touched a  raw nerve in China: What should be the relationship between the  central government and local authorities? For a while the debate  was most heated, with arguments and counter-arguments flying  back and forth between their supporters and detractors.    As the Year of the Rooster neared its end, the "Decision"  was  published in pamphlet form and found its way onto our desks.  This reporter sought out Hu Angang, who just returned from a  trip to Australia. His frankness was a little startling. "I  believe the major difficulty in reform next year will come from  within the party, quite possibly strong opposition from local  governments over some issues."    He described the "Decision" as immensely significant, a sign  that China has now entered a stage where reform revolves around  institutional innovation. However, the implementation of the  "Decision" is fraught with risk. What is worrisome is the  introduction of the tax separation system in 1994 under the  "Decision." Under that system, localities would still hold their  own as far as revenue is concerned, but the central government  would have trouble collecting taxes. These days every province  or region thinks in terms of local interests, rarely considering  the interests of the state or central government. It is like the  social "beilun" in "Boyilun." Here we have what they call a  "dilemma" in the English language. The boat can take only 15  people. If there are 30 people all demanding to board it, the  ship may well overturn. Thus it is an uphill struggle to put the  "Decision" into effect. It is hard to predict what will happen  next.    In a large country like China, Hu Angang said, the  relationship between the central government and local  authorities has been a problem since time immemorial. This  problem has never been satisfactorily resolved even after the  PRC was founded. During the past 44 years, the fiscal system  affecting both the center and the localities has been  extensively revised 15 times, in addition to several minor  adjustments. The relationship has never been institutionally  regularized and hence stabilized. Certainly the principle has  been to "let the two sides each do what they do best," but there  is still a lot of grey area, their respective jurisdictions  having never been clearly delineated. Accordingly, the  central-local relationship should be written into law explicitly  and in detail.    Survey the world today and take a look at China itself. In  Hu  Angang's opinion, what China needs is a strong central  government based on the market economy. As he sees it, in the  future China should follow neither a system of power sharing  between the central and local governments, nor a centralized  system, but a mixture of the two which would wed the two  principles of unity and pluralism. In this context, unity means  there are uniform macroeconomic policies, primarily financial  policies and fiscal policies. The central government should be  the only player responsible for macroeconomic policy-making;  local governments must be mere executors. Social security must  be integrated, domestic markets, including the markets for  capital goods like funds and manpower, must be unified.  Standards of public service must be uniform, as must the tax  system.    Everything else is pluralistic. In a nutshell, local  governments can do anything not prohibited by the central  government. The central government shall not exercise powers  exclusive to local governments. Local governments have the  authority to oppose regulations and orders from the central  government which are not consistent with the written  constitution.    "This is the vertical checks and balances of power," said Hu  Angang.    Does it therefore follow that it was a mistake for the  central government to delegate power to the localities and let  them share revenue in the past 15 years of reform and openness?  That kind of conclusion is unwarranted, Hu Angang said, noting  however that it is a fact that the contract system is no longer  viable. He said, "The most important thing about central-local  relations is institutionalization and the most ideal form of  such institutionalization is the tax separation system. Research  shows that the existing financial contract system is un-modern,  irregular, and unscientific. Its negative result is the current  weak-center-strong-localities situation." He added, "Ultimately  reform should take us out of the traditional 'power economy' and  'government economy' framework. If all we do is to divvy up  power between the central government and local governments level  after level, that will do nothing to end the bloated bureaucracy  at the local level performing an endless variety of things and  directly intervening in economic life. That is a far cry from  the basic requirements of a market economy."    China should swiftly introduce a full-fledged tax separation  system. That is Hu Angang's proposal.    Echoing Hu Angang's support for the tax separation system  and  his call for an end to the "power economy," a number of  economists nevertheless disagree with some of his basic  premises. One of them is Wu Mingyu [0702 2494 3842], the  well-known economist.    At his home on Liulinguan Nanli in Beijing, Wang Mingyu,  currently deputy director of the Worldwatch Institute, produced  about a dozen charts loaded with data and proceeded to explain  his views to me at length.    He said, "First of all, China has been highly centralized  for  decades. During the past dozen years or so, the central  government took pains to give additional power to local  governments and went out of its way to cultivate their ability  to make decisions on their own, with spectacular success.  Without local initiative, the achievements of reform and  development over the past 10 years and more would not have come  about and the brave new economic world with its special economic  zones, development zones, and coastal open belt would not have  materialized. None of that can be denied. Needless to say, it is  absolutely not enough just to shift power onto local  governments. Ultimately, we must transfer to enterprises such  powers as properly belong to them. Having said that, removing to  the localities some of the power that has hitherto been  concentrated in the hands of the central government is without  doubt a direct achievement of a decade of reform."    Furthermore, what do we mean by enhancing national power?  National power must not be interpreted to mean only the fiscal  power of the central government. What is wrong with "storing  wealth among the people?" What is wrong with "storing wealth  among the enterprises?" What is wrong with "storing wealth among  the localities?" Even before the Cultural Revolution, the  Chinese economy grew as much as 6 percent a year, yet if we look  at the chart for the 1952-1978 period, the line representing the  savings of the masses was virtually flat. By late 1978, their  savings amounted to just 21 billion yuan, a mere 20 yuan per  capita. These days public savings have been soaring, increasing  50-fold by 1992. In October 1993 personal savings stood at 1,400  billion yuan. This is part of national power. Every form of  economic strength is an expression of national power and  government revenue represents only a small part of national  income. In the past dozen years or so, has China become stronger  as a nation? People at home and abroad would all answer in the  affirmative. If China's national power has really diminished, as  indicated by the research of Dr. Hu Angang and others, how can  we explain the exceptional attention Chairman Jiang Zemin  received when he visited the United States as invited?    Besides, the relationship between the central government and  local governments is not exclusively fiscal. It is unscientific  to just look at the share of revenue going into the national  coffers and call it "weak." In China, the central government is  led by the CPC and based on longstanding unified party  leadership. Local elections too must be approved by the central  government. If some local authorities have too much power, the  central government can take it back right away if it wants to.  To suggest that there is now a "feudal economy" in China would  cause unnecessary jitters.    The new round of reform today certainly includes some power  adjustment between the central government and local authorities.  In Wu Mingyu's analysis, right now we must face up to four major  issues:    -- Legislation must be drawn up to spell out the division of  labor between the center and the localities.    -- Both the center and the localities must return power to  enterprises, society, and intermediate organizations. Achieving  this will be much more difficult than the transfer of power by  the central government to the localities in the past 15 years.    -- Take pains to encourage local initiative even as steps  are  taken to augment the regulatory and control abilities of the  center as appropriate.    -- Party-government relations at the local level should be  further adjusted to ensure that policies and orders from Beijing  are carried out.    While revenue-sharing and the contract system, introduced  during the decade of reform, have mobilized local initiative,  they have also bred local protectionism in some respects, to the  detriment of the formation of a nationwide unified market. The  time has now come for the contract system to give way to the tax  separation system. This idea is not a major point of contention  among the economists. However, in what way should the "tax  separation system," put forward in the "Decision," be  implemented? Hu Angang wants to see it carried out "thoroughly"  and "as soon as possible," but there is also a large number of  scholars who advocate a more incremental approach. Wu Mingyu and  others, for instance, propose a "win-win" strategy.    As they see it, the tax separation system involves central  taxes, local taxes, and shared taxes. In the initial period  shared taxes must be handled cautiously, taking into  consideration the local interests formed during the past 10  years and more. Certainly the status quo must not be maintained.  When we talk about the risk of reform in the new year, this is  probably what we mean. A most satisfactory solution is to make  the pie bigger so that the center can take more as local revenue  rises, thus gradually increasing its revenue share. In the final  analysis, of course, the goal is to increase the central  government's revenue-enhancing ability.    When it comes to the relationship between the two poles--the  central government and local governments--in the reform of 1994,  some scholars are most meticulous thinkers. Besides the tax  separation system, they say, other reforms would also disturb  local interests. Nowadays, for instance, specialized banks have  all become commercialized banks, but they remain essentially  branches of banks at higher levels. Should we allow and assist  to localities establish local commercial banks, which is what  Guangdong has been doing? In the months and years ahead,  moreover, the creation of a futures market, the reform of the  enterprise shareholding system, and the issue of shares must  also be approved. In the absence of standardization, should we  also take care to avoid the effects of the old planned economy  when we go about selecting a site and allocating quotas?    The fact of the matter is that reform is an adjustment of  interests. And the new round of reform is precisely the  rationalization of interests at a deeper level. In the course of  this process, the horizontal and vertical conflicts spawned by  the old order for years and years would inevitably manifest  themselves as a host of entangled problems. "Horizontally,"  local protectionism is a cause of concern, while "vertically"  traditional inertia, low efficiency, and rigidity are equally  worrisome. Even more important, as organs of government, both  the center and local governments are faced with the daunting job  of transforming their functions in a fundamental way.    Failing that, Chinese reform will unavoidably suffer major  setbacks, go astray, or beat a retreat to the old path.    The scholars disagreed on specific ideas and emphasis and  argued among themselves heatedly, but they all said that this is  closely related to the deepening of political reform. This is  precisely what makes reform today such a herculean task.  <H5>  Ignorance Is Archenemy </H5>   The last issue I posed to the interviewees was also the  simplest: On the eve of the launching of reform in 1994, how  many people in China really understand the CPC Central  Committee's "Decision?"    As expected, the economists' response was to shake their  heads and sigh. Many pointed out grimly that studying modern  economics has become something of critical urgency to the  completion of reform.    Just think. Suppose we have liberated ourselves from all  traditional ideological shackles. Suppose we are utterly devoted  to the new round of reform sincerely and passionately. We still  have to wrestle with one basic problem: understand the real  implications of all the reform measures.    In New York City, any teenager has a thorough understanding  of things like credit card, shares, and commodities. Provided he  is fairly intelligent and can write reasonably well, an American  college graduate majoring in history can be a columnist for the  Wall Street Journal effortlessly analyzing the stock market  every day. What about China? All our direct experiences with the  market are of the most elementary kind. All our education--never  mind you went to a college or party school offering a solid  education--consisted of political economy that merely described  the early phase of capitalism and taught you the socialist  planned economy. Even among experts in economics theory, let  alone rank-and-file party and government leading cadres, public  employees, people in industry and commerce, or the media, how  many have really mastered modern economics theories?    Ignorance may well turn out to be the worst enemy of the new  round of reform in China. This is because what we are about to  embark on is no longer elementary reform based on intuition and  common sense, but putting up an edifice of an economic system  which is complex and elaborate. After four centuries of  development, the market economy has become a most complicated,  most intricate gigantic machine of resource allocation.  Economics too has blossomed into a science with numerous  branches. To understand the reform plan in its totality, to  create an ideal environment for reform, to implement reform one  practical step after another, and to overcome the barriers to  reform, we really do need knowledge, basic knowledge pertaining  to the theories of the modern market economy.    Fang Fenglei, the young scholar, did not mince his words,  "China has three kinds of illiterates: people who can't read or  write, scientific illiterates, and economic illiterates.  Economic illiterates present the biggest problem. A majority of  the cadres at all levels, particularly leading cadres, who will  actually be in the field carrying out reform, don't know modern  economics. This will create considerable difficulties for the  implementation of the `Decision.' Today we must popularize the  ABC of economics."    In the commentary he stayed up late to write for ZHONGHUA  GONGSHANG SHIBAO, Wu Jinglian made this appeal: "The time has  now come for us to launch a study campaign among the cadres and  masses, exhorting them to study the works of Deng Xiaoping and  learn about the market economy. The market system, we often say,  is the glorious achievement of the human civilization. And the  best way to master this glorious achievement in the shortest  time possible is through theoretical study. Only by standing on  the high plane of modern human civilization, it may be said, can  we grasp the spiritual essence of the `Decision' and establish a  socialist market economy in China without delay."    Related to the problem of widespread ignorance is another  regrettable fact: the shortage of experts in modern economics.    A number of young scholars pointed out that when it comes to  the promotion of cadres in recent years, not enough economists  were given key positions. The breakdown of expertise among  leading cadres does not meet the requirements of building a  modern market economy. Now we should truly put to good use this  group of young talented people based on the actual needs of  implementing the "Decision."    They also cited a suggestion by Gao Xijun [7559 1585 0971],  a Taiwanese scholar who is now an economics professor at the  University of Wisconsin. There are now 50,000 mainland students  studying in the United States, of whom at least 1,000 major in  economics, including as many as 100 who have already earned  their doctorates. China should do what Taiwan did back then,  which was to attract the qualified personnel to come home. They  may stay and work or they may be invited to come to China on  short-term visit. These people would certainly make themselves  very useful.    Thus did China's eminent economists think long and hard and  talk at length on the eve of the launching of reform 1994. For  the past several years these people worked hard to drum up  support for reform, directly or indirectly participated in  designing the overall economic reform plan, appreciated the real  meaning of reform most deeply, and most ardently looked forward  to the smooth sailing of reform. Faced with the risks and  difficulties of a new round of reform, these people now  earnestly point out the challenges that may lie ahead and  suggest possible responses.    Being clear thinkers, they said solemnly, "There is no  romantic song in reform in 1994. The first step will be an  uphill fight."    But who can say that as soldiers of reform they are not full  of confidence and hope about success tomorrow?</p>

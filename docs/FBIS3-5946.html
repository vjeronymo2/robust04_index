			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  people of all strata who truly want independence, democracy,  peace and reunification must unite with each other, irrespective  of ideology, political view, religious belief and property  status, transcending their party interests and strategies, and  their genealogy and affiliation, to fight the colonial fascist  forces, the common target of struggle, stresses NODONG SINMUN in  a by-lined article today.    The cause of independence and democracy in South Korea and  national reunification is a showdown between the national forces  for independence and the aggressive forces and between the  patriotic forces for reunification and democracy and the fascist  forces for division and it requires the unity of all the  champions of independence, democracy and reunification, the  paper says, and goes on:    There is no reason that the forces for independence,  democracy and reunification cannot achieve [word indistinct]  Korea. Workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, urban  dwellers, national capitalists and many other people are  suffering under the colonial fascist rule in South Korea. The  people, except the narrow privileged circles, cannot defend  their vital interests unless the colonial fascist rule is  liquidated. This is an objective condition under which South  Korean people of various social strata can closely unite with  each other under the slogan of independence, democracy and  reunification.    All the South Korean forces for independence, democracy and  reunification oppose the colonial fascist rule and hope for the  establishment of an independent, democratic government.    It is a lawful demand in accomplishing the cause of  independence, democracy and reunification that the South Korean  people launch an all-people common struggle, irrespective of  their isms and principles and their party, political and  religious groupings.    It is important in developing the mass struggle for  independence, democracy and reunification to strengthen the  political struggle of the workers and peasants, while closely  combining it with the students' movement for political freedom  and democracy and waging a common struggle with all other  classes and circles interested in it.    The South Korean patriotic forces for independence,  democracy  and reunification must, for the present, vigorously wage a  massive common struggle to put an end to the domination,  interference and pressure by outside forces and smash the  treacheries, suppression, nonfrontationist [word as received]  and divisive moves of the "civilian" fascist forces and head for  the formation of a united front.    This is the way of rejecting the domination and interference  by outside forces, destroying the fascist dictatorial forces and  winning independence, democracy and reunification.    The South Korean people's righteous struggle for the three  goals will surely emerge victorious.</p>

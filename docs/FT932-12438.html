			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Akzo blames fibres for profits fall A SHARP decline in earnings from fibre operations caused net profits at Akzo, the Dutch chemicals group, to fall by 23 per cent to Fl 157.9m (Dollars 87.7m) in the first quarter of 1993. The company blamed the downturn on lower sales and selling prices for textile and industrial fibres in Europe, a trend that first became apparent in the second half of 1992. Operating profit in fibres plummeted by 79 per cent to Fl 14m from Fl 66m in the first quarter of 1992. Another factor behind the profit decline was an extraordinary loss of Fl 13m due mainly to Akzo's transfer of a 51 per cent stake in its European carbon fibre business to Toho Rayon. However, Akzo said the first quarter results, excluding extraordinaries, represented an improvement of Fl 43m over the final quarter of 1992. Pharmaceuticals, which in recent years has been the main force behind Akzo's profit growth, reported virtually unchanged operating results of Fl 129m, reflecting what the company described as disappointing earnings in Germany. In coatings, results fell by 14 per cent to Fl 24m. Chemicals earnings totalled Fl 121m compared with Fl 123m. Overall, net sales fell by 3.8 per cent to Fl 4.23bn, of which about half was due to lower sales by volume.</p>

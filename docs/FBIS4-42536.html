			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 3 (AFP) -- Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev  said Friday [3 June] he hoped the European Union [EU] would  "finally turn to Kyrgyzstan" and help the former Soviet republic  remain "the Central Asian Switzerland."    Akayev, who arrived in Paris Wednesday for a three-day  official visit, used these terms to define the "island" of  inter-ethnic peace and democracy in an "ocean of hurricanes"  which is running the risk "of being submerged by a tidal wave  without knowing where it will come from."    Speaking to an association of French and Russian  journalists,  he cited Moslem fundamentalism as one of the possible  destabilising elements. He stressed such fundamentalism was not  in the Kyrgyz tradition, but could "infiltrate from  Afghanistan," via neighbouring Tajikistan which is being shaken  by Islamic rebel attacks.    He also mentioned the narcotics business which, he warned,  would turn his republic into the "Colombia of Central Asia"  within a year or so if strong measures were not taken to stop it.    He recalled that Afghanistan is the world's second largest  producer of opium behind Burma and that narcotics arrived in  Paris or London via Tajikistan. He said he had asked the  international community for help in "neutralising this  distribution network."    Kyrgyzstan was once the Soviet Union's major producer of  opium.    Akayev also said he backed the idea of a strong CIS which  could become a "Eurasian Union" modelled on the EU.    Stressing that "Russia is and will remain Kyrgyzstan's main  ally" he said he was convinced that Russia would be "reborn as a  great 21st Century power."    Akayev brushed an idyllic picture of the state of democracy  in his country where press freedom, the freedom of speech and  human rights are scrupulously respected and where inter-ethnic  peace reigns between more than 80 minority groups, including  some very large ones: Russians, Uzbecks, Tatars, Koreans,  Tajiks and Germans.</p>

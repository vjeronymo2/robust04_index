			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CHARGERS FIRING REPORT DENIED  </P> <P> Chargers owner Alex Spanos denied a report that General Manager Bobby Beathard  talked him out of firing Coach Dan Henning after the team lost three of its  first four games.  </P> <P> Beathard also denied the report by Gary Myers on the Home Box Office program  "Inside the NFL" program before it was broadcast Wednesday night.  </P> <P> "Believe me, there is absolutely nothing to it. He (Spanos) has never mentioned  anything like that," Beathard said during the Chargers' practice Wednesday.  </P> <P> "The only thing he said is, 'I want to do well and I hope Dan can pull us out  of it,' but nothing like this."  </P> <P> Spanos, who also attended the practice, was equally emphatic. "This is all  (nonsense)," he said. "I don't know where these things come from. It drives me  crazy."  </P></p>

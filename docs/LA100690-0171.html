			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> LOVERS OF CACTI, SUCCULENTS POINT TO BEAUTY, LOW WATER  </P> <P> In a neighborhood of manicured lawns and well-groomed flower beds, it's easy to  spot Bart and Rosalie Palisi's Anaheim Hills home. Their yard features several  varieties of the cacti and succulents they have nurtured from seedlings.  </P> <P> "We've always loved cactus and succulents," Rosalie explained. "When we moved  to Southern California, it made sense to try to plant something in keeping with  the desert environment. We wanted a yard that was low maintenance, yet  attractive. At the time we planted cacti, we weren't necessarily thinking about  the drought; we simply wanted something to go along with our busy lifestyle."  </P> <P> Planting drought-resistant plants such as farrow cactus, barrel cactus and  yucca makes sense in an era of water shortages.  </P> <P> "In general, most cacti and succulents need only a light watering about every  two days during the summer and no watering at all in the winter," said Lloyd  Garretson, president of the 90-member Orange County Cactus and Succulent  Society. "This is a step in the right direction when it comes to cutting back  on water consumption."  </P> <P> Many homeowners may not be ready to give up their colorful flower beds in favor  of a more prickly display.  </P> <P> Not to worry, according to Garretson. "There are many flowering varieties of  cactus and they bloom at different times of the year. You can have blossoms  year-round if you want," he said. "Some varieties even bloom at night and close  their buds when the sun comes up."  </P> <P> There are more than 2,000 species in the succulent family -- cacti is the  largest group. Other succulents include milkweed, lilies, aloe and ocotillo.  These plants are called succulents because they store water in their leaves,  stems and roots. Succulents are generally the smoother-skinned versions of  their prickly cacti cousins.  </P> <P> "Many people are surprised to learn that hibiscus and oleanders are also  members of the succulent family," Palisi said. "A lot of people who aren't too  crazy about cactus because of the thorns become enamored of succulents.  </P> <P> "In fact, we just finished planting a succulent garden for my mother, who  doesn't care for cactus . . . but she loves succulents."  </P> <P> Like most cactus lovers, the Garretsons' interest in the plants started as a  hobby.  </P> <P> "I've always been a gardener," Garretson admitted. "But most of my experience  was with fruit trees and raising vegetables. Quite frankly, I thought a lot of  cacti were ugly. Then my wife, Toni, started getting interested in cactus  plants and succulents and that got me going."  </P> <P> Today, the yard of the Garretsons' Garden Grove home stands as testimony to  their interest. Cacti grow in their front and back yards, and two separate  greenhouses shelter their ever-growing collection of these hearty plants.  </P> <P> "What many people don't realize is that not all cactus and succulents look  alike," Garretson said. "There are many varieties that don't even remotely  resemble the commonly known images. The ponytail palm and the bursera look like  trees, while the beaver tail cactus produces a large pink flower."  </P> <P> Rosalie Palisi has "what is called a pencil cactus in our yard that has very  thin branches. It's an attractive plant and what has been an extra bonus is  that it attracts hummingbirds who stop and rest on it."  </P> <P> The jade succulent resembles its Oriental cousin. Aloe comes in many varieties.  Still other types of succulents resemble ferns.  </P> <P> "Once you get involved with these plants, it's hard to stop," Garretson said.  His wife's initial purchase of a small gray succulent -- commonly known as baby  toe or living stone because of its smooth, round appearance -- started the  Garretsons' fascination with this species.  </P> <P> The ease of caring for cacti is probably one of its primary attributes. Once it  has been planted, there is little maintenance involved. However, make sure to  leave enough space between the plants since they can grow quite large.  Succulents should also be planted in loose, rocky soil with good drainage. In  keeping with the desert or Southwestern look, many cacti gardeners cover the  ground with pebbles or white stones.  </P> <P> "Other than light watering . . . the only real maintenance is pulling weeds,"  Garretson said. "By scattering rocks or stones, you can better control the  weeds.  </P> <P> "And they had better be pretty hearty weeds," he said with a laugh. "Because  they aren't going to get much water."  </P> <P> Most varieties of succulents grow well together, and Garretson said it's not  necessary to plant only cacti. In his own garden, he has flowers and other  varieties of plants mixed in with the succulents. However, he does warn that  cacti have a dominant tendency.  </P> <P> "If you want to keep your cactus plant small, keep it in a pot," he  recommended. "Also, don't be too hasty in tossing out a cactus that looks like  it's seen better days. Often cactus, especially during the winter months, may  appear dead, when in fact it's just lying dormant for a few months.  </P> <P> "A lot of folks throw away perfectly good plants because they mistakenly  believe it's dead," he said. "Before throwing it out, check very closely for  any signs of new growth. Sometimes the only clue you may have is a very tiny  leaf or clump, but if you look carefully, you can see it. Before you throw it  out, just keep a watch for a while."  </P> <P> Starting new plants is often as simple as breaking off a piece or cluster, and  planting it in a small pot until it forms new roots. When transplanting from a  pot to the ground, be careful not to over-water. Unlike most other plants that  require more watering when first planted, if a cactus receives too much water,  it can collapse and rot.  </P> <P> Cacti also tend to do well in pots, especially if they're outdoors in the  sunlight. Plants in containers should have a fast-draining mix with a large  drain hole in the bottom. Also be aware that plants in containers may require a  little more water than those planted directly in the ground, but the amount of  water needed is still less than that of most other plants.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine planting anything other than succulents," Palisi said.  "Besides, it's easy for friends to find my house. I just tell them it's the one  with the innovative garden.  </P> <P> "Since people are becoming aware of water conservation, more of my neighbors  have been asking me about succulents. When I tell them what my water bill is,  they can't believe it's so low compared to what they pay. I think we're going  to be seeing quite a few more places planting cacti now."  </P></p>

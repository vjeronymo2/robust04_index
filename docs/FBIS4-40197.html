			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Tamara Zamyatina and </F> Vladimir Konoplitsky]    [Text] Blagoveshchensk June 15 TASS -- President Boris  Yeltsin on Wednesday visited the Blagoveshchensk shipbuilding  plant. The workers and managerial personnel of the plant told  Yeltsin about a variety of problems, the main of which is to  find customers for the manufacture of fishing seiners. The  president of russian and Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin  made entries in the visitors' book promising the shipbuilders to  promote a solution to the problem.    Shipbuilders told ITAR-TASS that they have not been  receiving  wages since February. Customers -- the fishery enterprises all  over Far East, acutely need the plant's products but  nevertheless are unable to pay for the completed seiners. This  is why the plant managament sends workers on forced leaves.  With the plant personnel numbering 1,300, the managament has  already sent 1,000 shipbuilders on leave in June.    As of now, the default of payment for completed and building  ships amount to 8,000 million roubles.    The defence and interior ministries owe about 1,500 million  roubles to the plant.    The president toured a small fishing seiner of the latest  make and visited the shipbuilding shop.    During a meeting with the management of the plant, Boris  Yeltsin once again promised to give assistance in the search for  customers for large fishing seiners and suggested making small  boats, which farmers need, on direct, non-state orders.</p>

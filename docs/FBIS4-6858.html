			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Morihiro Hosokawa, who quit  as prime minister Monday, thanked the public for their  understanding and assistance to reform efforts he promoted over  the past eight months. Noting his administration achieved some  reforms that his predecessors could not, including political  reform, Hosokawa said he was grateful to the public for their  "warm encouragement and help."    "It is extremely painful that I have to leave office halfway  through my reform efforts (and) at a time when there are a  number of domestic and foreign challenges...I don't know how to  apologize to the public for that," Hosokawa said in a statement.  But he sought understanding of his decision to resign, saying  he had to take political and moral responsibility for the delay  in Diet budget debate and for his involvement in questionable  financial dealings.    Hosokawa, who rose to power last August, also expressed hope  the next administration will deal squarely with a host of  formidable domestic and foreign policy tasks and "herald a new  era for Japanese politics."    At an extraordinary cabinet meeting earlier Monday, Hosokawa  thanked cabinet members for their cooperation with his reform  efforts and vowed to support the next government as a  legislator, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said.    Takemura, speaking at his last news conference as the  Hosokawa government spokesman, said he felt as if he set sail  for the rough seas when he started working as part of the  Hosokawa administration. "Today, I feel I can come ashore after  so much time," he said, adding he wants to make full use of his  eight-month experience at the center of power and get ready for  an expected political reconfiguration.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jacques Baumel, vice president of the National </F> Assembly Defense Commission: "White Paper: Do We Have the Means  To Carry Out Our Ambitions?"]    [Text] To define our country's defense policy for the next  20 years is a difficult exercise in a period of crisis. This is  particularly the case today, when unforeseen uncertainties and  threats compel us to envisage an entire series of situations  quite different from those of yesterday's cold war.    How is it possible to set new missions for our armies  without  the certainty of guaranteeing them the necessary capabilities  and means in the present state of our finances? Nothing is less  certain! Of course, in 1993 the government temporarily stopped  the decline in our defense expenditures. Does this mean we can  be sure that in the next five years the military planning law  that will come up for a vote in three months will allow the  continuation of large-scale programs already significantly  delayed and the simultaneous manufacture of new types of weapons  necessary for our defense by the year 2010 or 2015, such as  satellites, laser systems and antimissile defenses? Nothing is  less certain, since there is already a shortage of more than 40  billion francs simply to carry out present plans properly,  without even mentioning the difficulty of taking care of the  military planning law, which will amount to at least 600 billion  in the next five years.    Without contesting the credibility of the analyses and  evaluations of the white paper, we cannot fail to note the  serious gap that exists in it between the size of its ambitions  and the precariousness of the financial resources to be  allocated to our armies.    How can one hope to finance the costly means demanded by the  new "all-crisis" missions envisaged in the white paper when it  is presently a fact that a bitter discussion centers on whether  to grant more than 1 percent of the annual growth of the defense  budget, at a time when a growth of 5 percent ought to be  contemplated to face all the needs of our armed forces, and when  below the painful cuts below the 2-percent mark will have to be  made?    Cuts are thus inevitable, even if the more necessary ones  are rejected in favor of the least painful ones that will ensure  easier passage of the law. Courage would consist in not  obstinately continuing to manufacture weapons planned 20 years  ago for cold war conflicts, which will be obsolete when they go  into service after many delays.    Will new programs such as the NH90 helicopters be sacrificed  in order not to stop existing orders? On the other hand, why  preserve--perhaps to cancel it later like the Hades--the  contested M5 missile program, so dear to President Mitterrand,  to equip the new nuclear submarines, and, on land, the obsolete  Albion plateau silos that are increasingly losing their  usefulness because of their vulnerability? And all this to the  detriment of a more flexible second nuclear airborne component?  Can anyone seriously believe that we will remain credible  without nuclear testing, which does not appear in the white  paper, or with an air force reduced to less than 300 aircraft  and ground forces that will have failed to draw lessons from a  Gulf war won through the superiority of intelligent weapons and  real time, communications, and battlefield control electronic  intelligence systems? Is it known that it will be a long time  before France possesses the four intelligent weapons that  ensured an overwhelming victory in the Gulf war, without  mentioning the 3,000 computers used on the battlefield and  linked to some 30,000 computers in the United States? Such will  be tomorrow's war.    Maintaining conscription within the framework of a mixed  army will slow down the necessary reform of the military service  and the increased professionalization of our projection forces,  which are still in great need of transportation, logistics and  intelligence means.    Showing too much prudence, the authors of the white paper  fail to sufficiently stress the need for France to double its  space program so as not to be disqualified in tomorrow's world  vis-a-vis the superpowers. But how can one be present on these  new battlefields without strongly reinforcing our defense  system, an initiative not envisaged in a white paper written by  an "establishment" [English in the text] more sensitive to  continuity and prudence than to innovation and updating?    How is it possible to plead for a European defense--the need  for which is illustrated by the Bosnian tragedy--and not propose  at the same time improved strategic and industrial European  cooperation? Since it is obvious, in light of these needs, that  it is not through the usual budget procedures that the  maintenance of capabilities and the modernization of our defense  will be ensured, why not contemplate other forms of financing,  without shrinking from allocating to our armed forces part of  the significant revenues from privatizations? After all, this  would be just as useful for the future of our nation than to use  such revenues to fill the abyss of the Air France, Bull or  National Railroad Company deficits brought about by their  leaders' disastrous management. It is better to pay for a good  life insurance policy than to undertake Sisyphean tasks.</p>

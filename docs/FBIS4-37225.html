			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi at a </F> banquet held in honor of the visiting presidents of Mali,  Burkina Faso, and Niger in Tripoli on 16 June -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God. I warmly welcome our  brothers and neighbors, the leaders of the African-Muslim  countries: Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso in the same manner as  we welcomed our friend Museveni, the Ugandan president, and  before him our brother Deby, the president of Chad.    The Libyan people welcome and appreciate such solidarity  from  their brothers because it will consolidate the Libyan people's  position in its confrontation with the conspiracy led by three  colonialist-Western countries. [passage omitted]    The Libyan people feels comfortable after the effort it  extended to the neighboring fraternal peoples and deems that the  patriots have assumed power in these countries and the agents  have fallen.    The Libyan people has undertaken numerous responsibilities  toward these peoples. The victory of the will of the peoples of  Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Chad, and the consolidation of  freedom and democracy....[pauses] On the other hand, from the  viewpoint of the Western imperialist countries, what the Libyan  people were doing was considered support for international  terrorism, and considered the training camps for those leaders  and peoples, who were carrying out a liberation war, as  terrorist camps. This pretext has now been exposed, and this  Western propaganda, which they used so frequently in the  aggression against Libya, has fallen. But, it seems that the  colonialists will not let the Third World achieve stability and  build itself in order to progress.    After these national movements won in these countries, we  see  that the colonialist countries work toward creating trouble and  problems for them. The material evidence that condemn the  countries of Western colonialism are obvious. They accuse us of  all untrue accusations and refuse to be confronted with the  facts that condemn them. Regrettably, this will not lead to an  understanding between us.    We all know that these peoples now, in Niger, Burkina Faso,  and Mali, who aspire for stability and construction, are today  the target of a new plot. The role of the old type of  colonialism has been concretely confirmed. This implicit and  flagrant interference in the domestic affairs of these peoples  contradicts the statements and declarations made by these  countries.    In the past they accused Libya of being behind the  destabilization of African states. Yet, it transpired that  Libya was behind the cause of liberation and people's democracy.  Now, the very states who used to accuse Libya are the ones who  are trying fervently to destabilize the African continent.    These are inhuman ethics and a flagrant injustice. The  Western states are constantly pursuing these states; they are  trying to sow instability in them; they deny them a chance to  prove themselves. Psychologically speaking, we feel as if we are  facing groups who are enemies of humanity. We are facing a  mentality used to arrogance and the enslavement of others. This  is not an accusation, but a reality.    Who on earth can belittle a person who happens to have a  black skin? Who in the world introduced the words racial  discrimination to the dictionary? They are the Western  colonialist states.    Regrettably, we are facing peoples who are defying the whole  of mankind. We are in confrontation against arrogant states,  who impose their wrath against us; they use a veto against our  future. When we raise our voice and resist, they accuse us of  being warmongers, and against peace.    What kind of peace are they talking about? They are talking  about surrender and that Third World people should surrender  without making a stand. We have decided, nonetheless, to  resist. A fact that they must understand.    Africa should not be destined to face poverty and misery  until doomsday merely because of its skin, which was God's  creation. They have begun a new flagrant interference.  Regrettably they have meddled with the United Nations, which  used to be the refuge of peoples seeking peace and protection.  They have torn up the UN Charter. They had no right to tear up  a charter that was written by the people.    They have trodden on international law; they have no right  to  do so. It is an international law and not an internal one.  They have been using the United Nations for a purpose  completely different from the one that was intended for it.  They are using the United Nations as a vehicle for  neo-colonialism.    Before, they used the League of Nations to impose their  protectorate on the colonized Third World countries. As soon as  they fiddled with it the League of Nations fell.    Today, the Western powers are accused of working seriously  for the fall of the United Nations. The best proof is the fact  that they have been using the United Nations for their  manipulation; they have transformed it into an instrument in  their hands. They have trodden on its charter.    Today, they are carrying out their own work in the name of  the United Nations. They are using the United Nations outside  its Charter. Thus, they have decided to kill the United  Nations. This attitude is a serious one that can be very  harmful to people of the world. This means that we will face a  new form of chaos. The world will be transformed into a jungle;  and the Western states will be responsible for the outcome.    What is happening these days in a number of Third World  countries is clear proof of what I have just said. They believe  that the Third World is made up of children and duped people;  this is in addition to their inferior attitude toward Africa;  they think that the African people are mere gorillas living in a  jungle; they do not believe that the inhabitants of Africa are  human beings. Even Dr. Barnard, the heart surgeon who succeeded  in performing the first heart transplant operation used to hold  this way of thinking; i.e., black people are not human beings,  consequently, one should carry out tests on them unreservedly.  Consequently, he carried out numerous tests on black people,  like the test performed in the West on mice and rabbits.    After having killed a large number of people and destroyed  their hearts, he succeeded in perfecting the right heart  transplant technique. All this stems from their attitude of  inferiority toward the black race. They think that we do not  understand this.    Their behavior is aimed at undermining our will, our desire  to live, and our right to our land. Now, they are interfering  in the internal affairs of every state; they believe that we are  children and duped to the extent that they create problems, then  they claim that they have to send military forces to solve these  problems.    We are aware that they are the ones who created these  problems so that they have a pretext to intervene and solve  them; they think that we are naive and ignorant and imbeciles to  be fooled by this game. Their mentality is still that of Vasco  de Gama; they think that Africa still resembles the one  discovered by Vasco de Gama when he gave Africans shells and  beads and took raw material and land in return. All Western  states are like Vasco de Gama; they share the same mentality as  that of Vasco de Gama; they still perceive and consider us as  the same people who were discovered by Vasco de Gama. These are  the matters that incite revolution, and force us to accept the  challenge. Why do they not leave Mali alone, and stop their  interference? They should let this poor country rebuild itself  and live. Why do they not leave Niger and Chad alone? All the  suffering of these countries is due to this policy.    They must understand that while we meet at this level we are  fully aware of their conspiracies. It is our right to fight and  we have decided to fight so that they respect us and recognize  that we are people like them, at least like them, even if we  believe that we are better than them because we do not commit  the acts they are committing. Therefore, our mentality is more  noble than theirs. We do not have the mentality of absurdity,  human disdain, race, and color segregation. They take pleasure  in the suffering of the African peoples and laugh at the  backwardness of the African that they imposed on them in the  first place.    They consider Africa as a jungle, a place for hunting, a  source for raw materials, and a garden where you can pick  fruits, but they consider its inhabitants as gorillas. Thus is  the Western culture that led to colonialism, and world wars, and  it is the one we are facing nowadays under various names.    In Libya, they confronted us in the Gulf of Sirte. When the  world condemned them and this problem was over, they invented a  problem called al-Rabitah. When it became clear that al-Rabitah  was a pharmaceutical plant, and the world condemned them and  showed solidarity with Libya, they created the so-called  Lockerbie issue.    In this context, the Libyan people hails your stance during  the OAU [Organization of African Unity] summit meeting. The  Libyan people hails its brothers and neighbors, as well as all  the African leaders who stood with the Libyan people.    The world condemned them in the Gulf of Sirte and al-Rabitah  cases, and is now condemning them in the Lockerbie case.  Despite all this, we hear astonishing things. They say that  Libya is defying the international community. Who is defying  the international community?    For them, the international community means the Western  colonialist countries. As for the others, they are not at the  level of the international community.    The conspiratorial memorandum handed by the United States,  France, and Britain to the United Nations was considered as the  will of the international community. They ignore the will of  Africa.    What do they have to say about the OAU summit meeting held  yesterday in Tunis that expressed support to Libya and the  proposals it made. Are the African countries considered out of  the international community?    The Nonaligned Movement expressed support for Libya, the ICO  [Islamic Conference Organization] expressed support for Libya.  The Arab League expressed support for Libya. The OAU adopted  the Arab League resolution, in addition to the peoples, groups,  parties, and organizations throughout the whole world. Despite  all this, should we listen to them tomorrow, we will hear the  same broken record: Libya is defying the will of the  international community. In fact, they are the ones who are  isolated. They are the ones who are isolated by the will of the  international community. This will is now on the Libyan side.  The international community is now expressing full support and  sympathy for Libya, and condemns the three Western countries.    Despite all this, we can still hear insolent statements full  of disdain to the international community. This is the stubborn  mentality that we are facing.    We recently heard that a Palestinian person admitted  responsibility for causing the explosion of the Pan Am aircraft.  He made this confession before a court. The day after, the  West denied this confession. The world was shocked. How could  this happen? Yesterday, we were looking for whoever was behind  the Pan Am explosion.    We say to the world: Do not be surprised, for the reason is  very simple. This Palestinian is poor. He does not have  millions to compensate the families of the victims. Therefore,  how could one charge him for this act? Libya, however, is rich.  It can pay damages. So, one must accuse it.    This is the reason the world has been laughing at this: How  can one admit [responsibility for this act] only to hear the  West tell him: No, no, it is not you.    As long as the issue is one of compensation, and so that  Libya rids the world of this problem and prevents respectable  presidents coming all the way from their countries to Libya on  foot [as heard], because of this unjust resolution....[pauses]    The world is tired of all the fuss made about Libya. The  embargo on Libya has ruined many countries and even the West has  lost out because it is stupid. In order to rid the world of  this problem, since the issue is about compensation, Libya does  not object to the creation of a compensation fund, for this  would be a humanitarian action. This fund would be used to  compensate the victims' families, including those of Lockerbie,  just for the sake of the world and in order to rid the world of  this tension. There are families of Libyan victims who were  killed by America and Britain. However, the Libyans are perhaps  rich and may not need any compensation. There are also Iranian  families whose relatives were killed by America when the U.S.  Navy shot down the civilian aircraft aboard which they were  flying. It could be that Iran is rich and would not want any  compensation.    There are also the victims of the Italian airliner shot down  by the U.S. fleet over Ustica. There are the Lockerbie victims  and maybe the Americans and the British are poor and would like  damages. We do not object to the creation of a compensation  fund; and let us erase the confessions of that Palestinian and  let us tell him: Keep quiet, we know that you carried out the  Pan Am operation but you have not got any money. This is a good  solution.    The Libyan people are once again, I believe, doubly happy.  Once because their efforts with the neighboring and sister  states would not have been wasted. Nationalist regimes were  established in Egypt [as heard], Sudan, Chad, Niger, Mali, and  Tunisia. Nationalist regimes and popular regimes dear to Libya  were established in these countries. These efforts were  considered as aimed at destabilizing Africa and were regarded as  terrorism, but the result was the triumph of the nationalist  regimes.    When we were working against the lackey regimes they told  us:  You were destabilizing Africa. Now we have united with  nationalist regimes they tell us: This is unity, you have  imperial ambitions. They have been stubbornly against us in both  cases. [passage omitted]    I have one remark to make before I conclude my speech, it is  about our sisterly Rwanda. I would like to draw your attention  to the fact that this is not the first catastrophe that has  shaken Rwanda. We still remember with sadness and bitterness  the tragic massacres of 1959 and 1973. Today we are witnessing  fresh massacres. I am afraid that such ugly massacres will be  repeated. We should, therefore, accept the bad in order to avoid  the worse.    We are aware that the Tutsi tribes immigrated to this region  hundreds of years ago. They might have come from Arab  countries. Problems began to emerge between the original people  and those coming from outside. Like between Palestinians and  Israelis and whites and blacks in South Africa. The situation  in Rwanda is, however, a particular one and should not be taken  as an example for other countries.    Regrettably, the solution I am about to propose is a bad  one,  but it is better than the worse. If we want to stop the  massacres and prevent their recurrence forever, we must separate  the two races, the Tutsi and the Hutu.    What is now called the National Front is in fact the  frontier  of the Tutsis, and the so-called government is for the Hutus.  International forces should now separate the two sides. The  separation should be final between them. In fact, this is the  only solution to prevent these tragedies from recurring.    Dear brothers, I thank you for this visit and this meeting  that provided us with an opportunity to talk about these  important issues, which we discussed today and yesterday.    I once more welcome you in your country and among your  kinsfolk. We are your natural ally, and you can rely on this  ally which will never disappoint you. The struggle continues.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Man in the News: Rocket scientist with a billion-dollar brain - Flavio Bartmann Derivatives, the complex financial instruments which Flavio Bartmann designs and sells, earned his US investment bank Dollars 753m in revenue last year. The trading floor by his office at Merrill Lynch's London headquarters is packed with traders selling forwards, futures, options, swaptions and all manner of financial exotica. Bartman has only one regret about the way his working life has evolved. 'A year ago, I was flying to New York with my boss,' says the 41-year-old Brazilian, 'and he asked me if I could start again, would I choose this job, or being a professor at Harvard? I said I would take Harvard.' As he talks, derivatives traders tap at rows of computers so sophisticated that they are coveted by university mathematics departments. Bartmann, a former assistant professor of statistics at Columbia University in New York, is what old-fashioned bankers call a 'rocket scientist'. They are people with advanced degrees and doctorates in mathematics, statistics, even astrophysics, who have been lured in their hundreds by banks in Wall Street and the City of London. They need mathematical knowledge and ease with computer models because the financial products they sell are so complicated that only mathematicians can calculate the inherent risks. If a bank miscalculated these risks badly, and sold billions of dollars worth of contracts that went wrong, its capital could be wiped out by having to pay the bill. That is not a happy prospect for the world's financial system, given that the failure of any of the large US banks and investment banks which dominate the Dollars 12,000bn derivatives market could drag down others. Central banks such as the US Federal Reserve would probably have to prop up the bank involved rather than risk a chain reaction across financial markets. Derivatives contracts allow companies to swap obligations - for example by exchanging variable interest payments on a loan with fixed ones - or buy or sell a currency or a commodity at a fixed price in the future. This allows them to 'hedge' risks, for example protecting themselves from losses if the currency in which they are selling something falls in value. Worry about derivatives is part of a more general concern that US banks are increasingly using capital to take bets on financial markets. The latest flurry of concern erupted this week when the US General Accounting Office called for the derivatives trading of banks and investment banks to be federally regulated. It said that the risk management systems of banks contained weaknesses, and the US government was ill-prepared for the crisis that could ensue from a large derivatives user defaulting. Yet banks continue to pour money into recruiting rocket scientists to design derivatives. Those that dominate the business make large profits from what are called 'over-the-counter' derivatives - contracts designed by banks for individual customers rather than standard contracts traded on exchanges such as the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe). The most money is to be made from the most bespoke - and therefore the hardest to construct and understand - derivatives. Bartmann estimates that 50 per cent of Merrill's derivatives earnings come from products invented, or combined, in the past five years. The demand for this expertise means that US universities, from which most of the cleverest traders are drawn, have little chance of paying enough to retain them. An average swaps trader in London made between Pounds 140,000 and Pounds 280,000 last year. The best rocket scientists earn far more: at Merrill Lynch about 10 derivatives specialists are thought to have been paid more than Dollars 1m in 1993. They have changed the atmosphere of trading floors. While the archetypal trader of the 1980s was the brash, aggressive bond salesman, they are a quieter, more introverted breed. One investment banker tells of wandering past a room in which derivatives traders were discussing mathematical formulae. 'It was like Re-Union Of The Nerds,' he says. Bartmann, now a managing director and head of commodity derivatives at Merrill, joined JP Morgan, the US bank, from Columbia in 1986. He had degrees in mechanical engineering and applied mathematics from Brazilian institutes, and a PhD in statistics from Princeton. He wanted a change, and knew mathematicians who had been in the first wave to join Wall Street. He joined a five-strong 'think tank' of scientists recruited en bloc by Merrill in 1988. They included Judith Pearlstein, a computer programmer, and Richard Malone, a mathematician. 'I would think up a quick and dirty answer to a problem, Richard would turn it into a solid mathematical solution, and Judith would programme it quick as a flash,' he recalls. Bartmann argues that a lot of standard derivatives mathematics can be understood quite easily, but the size and complexity of the multi-billion-dollar portfolios held by banks require arcane skills. 'I could sit here and in half an hour explain to you how to price a single option, but it is quite different to manage daily risks in large portfolios,' he says. Such risks can only be calculated using mathematical models run on computers. Yet no matter how clever the mathematics it involves, a model is only as good as its assumptions. Many bank regulators worry that an unpredicted financial event - for example a sustained divergence in dollar and sterling interest rates - could undo such assumptions, leaving banks exposed. Bartmann says that most derivatives contracts are safe because banks match one against another. 'If I buy a 10-year swap of a fixed obligation against a floating one, and hedge it with futures, and then tomorrow I go out and do exactly the opposite, there might be trillions of dollars involved, but there is zero risk on any model,' he says. Yet he admits that models can be stretched on the newest derivatives for which underlying mathematics is still developing. He cites the example of a currency swap 'index note' which emerged two years ago. 'When they were first sold, I think that people did not fully understand the risks in them, but in a matter of a few months or weeks, they caught up,' he says. It is not only because banks gain the best profits on these new and untested products that they most excite rocket scientists. They also provide more intellectual interest than standard contracts. 'Sometimes you have very repetitive days doing something very simple, and filling a lot of reports in. I never had to do that at university,' Bartmann says, a little wist-fully. Yet most derivatives specialists who join banks do not return to academia. The financial rewards in derivatives are far higher, and the opportunities to do pure research at universities are growing scarcer. 'People come for the money, and because there are fewer alternatives than before. The budget for academic research in the States is much smaller,' says Bartmann. Money for research is scarcely a problem at Merrill. The intellectual high point of Bartmann's career there was preparing a 200-page proposal for the ratings agency Moody's Investor Services, when Merrill invested Dollars 300m of capital to set up a separate unit for derivatives trading in 1991. He had to persuade the agency that the new unit was so safe that it deserved a triple A rating. The proposal is riddled with mathematical formulae, regressions and charts demonstrating the risks of different portfolios of derivatives under different trading conditions. 'We linked 32 computers together, and ran them for a week to make the calculations,' says the investment banker who sometimes wishes he was a professor. 'Of course, I knew the answer already.'</p>

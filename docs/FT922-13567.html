			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Looking for opportunities This column being written ahead of the UK election result, there is no point in predicting how the UK markets will react. There is a good deal of point, however, in asking what reaction would be logical. On the crucial assumption that sterling will not move much whatever the outcome - for reasons discussed yesterday - it is not clear that the equity market ought to move much either. In fact, it will doubtless shoot all over the place, but that is an opportunity. Large chunks of the equity market, such as oils and overseas earners, are by common consent fairly insensitive to the outcome. The market believes the utilities are highly sensitive, but it could be wrong. There are votes in being nasty to British Gas or BT whoever is in power. It matters slightly to consumer stocks whether Labour raises a net Pounds 3bn extra taxes and redistributes consumers' income, just as it matters slightly to the capital goods and construction industries whether there are mild fiscal incentives to investment. But in the context of an economy dominated by the ERM, that is tinkering at the edges. It is reasonable to suppose that yesterday's close of 2,436.4 on the FT-SE represents a point of equilibrium, if only because the final opinion polls were roughly equal and the big bookmakers were offering the same odds for both contenders. Once the election excitement has died down, the market may have to reconsider that position. Much has been happening in the real world during the election run-up: the further slide in UK property, the collapse of the Tokyo market and the most convincing evidence yet of modest recovery in the UK economy. But in the meantime, the short-term logic is appealing; sell into strength if the Tories win, buy into weakness if Labour does.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report New York arabica COFFEE prices were sharply higher at midday on what traders said was renewed speculative buying, stirred by news of declines in US warehouse stocks. After Monday's close the Green Coffee Association said total US stocks in April fell by 518,000 bags to 9.59m bags (60 kgs each). New York's move helped London robusta prices to break through Dollars 900 a tonne. New York raw SUGAR was broadly lower and on the defensive at midday on what traders said was heavy technically induced commission house selling. Analysts were at a loss for any fundamental reason for the move, which followed Monday's three-year high of 13.26 cents a lb in the July contract. COPPER staged a brief rally in the afternoon on the LME but the move was showing signs of running out of steam by the end of kerb trading as the bearish sentiment on fundamentals reasserted itself. Dealers said news of a 6.7 per cent rise in April US housing starts contributed to the firmer tone, helping to spark some profit taking. However, the overall bearish mood was strengthened by a rise of 4,425 tonnes in LME stocks to a nine-year high of 411,550 tonnes. Compiled from Reuters</p>

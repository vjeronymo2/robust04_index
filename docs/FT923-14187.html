			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Bespak at Pounds 7m after acquisition BESPAK, a maker of valves and other engineering components, increased pre-tax profit by 57 per cent, from Pounds 4.42m to Pounds 6.92m, in the year to May 1. The contribution from the original group was in line with forecast at Pounds 6.2m, while the newly-acquired Tenax Corporation of the US put in Pounds 700,000 since March 10. Mr Bob King, chairman, said Tenax had significantly increased Bespak's presence in the US, where sales were projected to be half of the group's total. As a consequence, the whole US business was being reorganised. Group turnover rose 31 per cent to Pounds 38.8m (Pounds 29.6m), with Tenax supplying Pounds 3.1m. Earnings per share came to 24.8p, against 20.4p after adjustment for two rights issues which raised Pounds 38m net and help turn interest charged of Pounds 823,000 into a credit of Pounds 134,000. The final dividend is 5.5p to make 9p (8p).</p>

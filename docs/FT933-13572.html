			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Russian space stance irks Delhi INDIA has expressed regret at Russia's decision to freeze a Dollars 350m (Pounds 233m) contract to supply cryogenic rocket engines and associated technology for India's civilian space programme but emphasised that it would cause no setback. Foreign ministry officials expressed dismay that Russia has 'yielded so blatantly to US pressure' to go back on its 1991 contract with India but a ministry statement at the weekend avoided direct criticism of the US. 'While India remains willing to co-operate with other countries in the space sector for mutual benefit, it will continue to develop the required technologies indigenously,' it said. Mr Dinesh Singh, India's foreign minister, told a parliamentary committee meeting on Saturday night that, though he did not see 'an overall shift' in US policy towards India, the US's decisions would be based 'on their self-interest as they see it'. Mr Michael McCurry, US state department spokesman, said Moscow's co-operation in blocking the transfer of 'significant' technology to India about which the US 'had concerns' could be 'worth billions of dollars'. Dr Raja Ramanna, former head of India's Atomic Energy Commission, challenged the US position that the transfer of cryogenic technology was a violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). 'Everyone knows that cryogenic engines cannot be used for defence purposes, and I cannot understand why such a powerful country (like the US) should feel so insecure about India getting some knowhow,' he said.</p>

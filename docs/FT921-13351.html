			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Small tickets can lead to big headaches - A look at the OFT's Eurocopy decision SIR GORDON Borrie fired a warning shot across the bows of office equipment leasing houses earlier this week, when he said that unclear documentation would be sufficient cause for swift action from the Office of Fair Trading. The decision not to revoke the consumer credit licences of Eurocopy, the photocopier distributor, was accompanied by a no-nonsense warning that both finance houses and distributors would have to meet 'acceptable standards of behaviour'. Those included providing documentation which was not 'open to abuse in ways similar to those which led to complaints against Eurocopy', Sir Gordon said. Eurocopy, which came under OFT scrutiny following complaints about the sales practices of some of its subsidiaries, has promised it will only deal with leasing houses which provide clear contracts. But there is some scepticism as to how effective Sir Gordon's comments will be within the complex world of small ticket leasing. The fact that suppliers approach customers and then arrange financing through a third party - often unbeknown to the customer - means that misunderstandings are almost inevitable. Some analysts suggest cynically that perhaps the government only took an interest in the practices of small ticket leasing in the run-up to the General Election. 'The CBI has asked the government to consider re-introducing capital allowances,' said Ms Karen Bennett of BZW. 'And Labour has already said that it will re-introduce capital allowances if it gets elected . . . That's bonanza time for leasing companies.' Furthermore, Sir Gordon's comments citing the Consumer Credit Act do not apply to the vast majority of contracts negotiated in the small ticket industry. The CCA covers only those agreements worth less than Pounds 15,000 and with non-corporate clients. This represents less than 7 per cent of Eurocopy's business, for example. Mr Andrew Yeo, analyst with Hoare Govett, said the only real effect would be to put rather weak pressure on leasing companies to clean up their contracts. 'They won't be able to get away with the small print as they have in the past . . . But at the end of the day, it won't make a great amount of difference.' So where does that leave the vast majority of customers? Those with complaints about documentation, like Mr Robin Huttenbach, a director of Nelson Design, an environmental design group, have little comeback. Mr Huttenbach is now faced with a writ of summons from System Rentals Sales Aid, a subsidiary of Sabre Leasing, Union Discount's leasing arm, for non-payment. Sabre, where bad debts were largely responsible for losses of Pounds 7.29m at Union Discount, said yesterday that it had disputes - excluding bad debts  -with less than 5 per cent of its 38,000 contracts. Mr Tony Simkin, who came to Sabre as managing director in a management shake-up last year, said the proportion of those disputes which arose from actual documentation was small. He welcomed Sir Gordon's comments, and said Sabre planned to introduce new contracts on April 1, which 'set out clearly what is expected of us and the lessee'. Yet Sabre's new contract is not the result of the OFT inquiry. Instead, it stems from the industry's own attempts to salvage its image after almost two years of bad press, beginning with Eurocopy. 'All leasing has tended to be tarred with the same brush,' said Mr Harry Hyman, finance director of Baltic Leasing, which operates in the big ticket sector for items such as jumbo jets and property. 'Customers are not making the distinction between the types of equipment leased.' The Finance &amp; Leasing Association, which represents more than 80 per cent of the leasing industry, last week issued its own guidelines and was more than a little upset that the OFT had failed to mention them. Mr Brian Hassell, joint chairman of the FLA, said he was disappointed at the OFT statement. 'The association has been aware of the problems in the office equipment sector for some time and has taken action to deal with them,' he said. Mr Andrew Thompson, secretary of the FLA, said that the association's guidelines - which applied to all agreements with members - could be seen to fill the gap left by the Credit Consumer Act. However, the FLA's only sanction would be a bar on membership. Whether this is sufficient to protect customers is debatable. Perhaps the biggest deterrent to the existence of misleading documentation will be the painful repercussions to Eurocopy of the four-month OFT investigation.</p>

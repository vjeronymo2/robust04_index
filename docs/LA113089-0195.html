			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CITY ATTORNEY IN SAN DIEGO OPPOSES MERGER OF UTILITIES  </P> <P> City Atty. John Witt on Wednesday recommended that the City Council oppose San  Diego Gas &amp; Electric's proposed merger with Southern California Edison  because the deal "is not in the best interests" of San Diegans. The merger  would also have an impact on several South Orange County communities.  </P> <P> In a memorandum circulated Wednesday, Witt suggested that the merger would  eliminate local utility jobs, damage San Diego's civic pride and hurt the  environment. He also maintained that the proposed merger would not produce rate  reductions promised by the utilities.  </P> <P> San Diego Gas &amp; Electric serves about 60,000 customers in the South Orange  County cities of San Clemente, Dana Point, Laguna Beach and San Juan  Capistrano.  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council, which has held five public hearings on the merger,  is expected to take a stand for or against it during a 2 p.m. hearing today.  Utility company representatives have claimed that San Diego Mayor Maureen  O'Connor and council members already oppose the merger.  </P> <P> Executives at both companies Wednesday contested Witt's claim that the merger  would hurt San Diego.  </P> <P> "We continue to believe the merger is in the best interest of the people of San  Diego," said Karen Hutchens, SDG&amp;E's manager of governmental affairs.  </P> <P> "He's wrong," said Edison spokesman Lewis Phelps, who argued that the merger  would bring the promised rate reductions -- and that they would "far exceed"  the negative economic effect of any SDG&amp;E job cuts.  </P> <P> Witt also is seeking City Council approval to start court proceedings to  determine whether SDG&amp;E needs council approval to transfer city-granted  franchise agreements to Edison.  </P> <P> The utilities have maintained that, under state corporation law, the proposed  merger would not constitute a transfer. However, earlier this year, Witt  advised council members that SDG&amp;E needs permission to transfer the  franchises to Edison.  </P> <P> If the city does sue to settle the franchise question, SDG&amp;E might steer  more than $20 million in annual franchise fees to an escrow account "until the  matter is settled," Hutchens said. Hutchens said council members must consider  "the risk to the city if they do (go to court) and have to make up for a $20  million hole in their budget."  </P> <P> While the franchise disagreement will likely end up in court, it could be some  time before any legal action occurs. "It's a matter of timing," Hutchens said.  "And the transfer issue clearly isn't ripe" for legal action, she said.  </P> <P> The establishment of an escrow account would "signal SDG&amp;E's intention to  play hardball," said Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers  Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group. However, Shames, who has  urged council members to oppose the merger, suggested that SDG&amp;E could risk  alienating the public by halting the payments.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Eric Bailey contributed to this report.  </P></p>

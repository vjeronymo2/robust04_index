			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Clock ticks for Air France unions' decision - Rejection of a restructuring plan would mean a referendum Decision time has arrived for the 14 trade unions at Air France. Mr Christian Blanc, the airline's chairman, has given them until 6.00pm to sign a rescue plan which is vital to the company's survival. Union opposition and a wave of violent strikes scuppered the last rescue strategy, put forward by Mr Bernard Attali who was forced to resign as chairman last October. To avoid a similar fate for his own plan - and possibly for himself - Mr Blanc has demanded support from all the unions for his package of measures. So, effectively, has the government, by linking a FFr20bn (Dollars 3.5bn) capital injection to staff acceptance of the proposed cost-cutting and restructuring measures. The stakes are high, both for the state-owned airline and its principal shareholder. Without a significant restructuring, the airline will not be able to stem losses, which last year amounted to an estimated FFr7.5bn. Mr Blanc is proposing a 30 per cent increase in productivity over the next three years, achieved by the loss of 5,000 jobs, a wage and promotion freeze, the reduction of the airline's fleet and a reorganisation of the group into separate profit centres. The problem for Mr Blanc is that months of negotiations, involving more than 2,000 meetings with unions and personnel, have failed to overcome opposition from some quarters. The latest and final round of negotiations last weekend brought some changes to the package; the pay and promotion freeze may now be reviewed after one year, and Mr Blanc agreed to accept alternatives to increased working hours (from 38 to 39 hours per week for ground staff) if they yield the same productivity gains. But for some unions, such changes are inadequate. The strongest reaction has come from the communist Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT), the second-largest union at Air France with 2,100 members out of the airline's 40,000 employees. CGT representatives walked out of the negotiations on Saturday evening and oppose the final version of the restructuring plan which was delivered earlier this week. 'We cannot sign this plan,' said Mr Raymond Besco, the general secretary of the union, adding that a final meeting would be held this morning to confirm the union's position. He opposed plans to cut jobs, freeze wages and extend working hours and described the linking of the FFr20bn capital injection to staff approval of the plan as 'unacceptable blackmail'. According to Mr Besco, 'it is not acceptable for a public company to cut employment in the present economic climate'. He agreed that the airline needs restructuring, but said cutting its aircraft from 166 to 149 over the next five years would weaken Air France in international markets. CGT is the most radical of the unions, and others have been more supportive. Force Ouvriere, the largest union among Air France's employees, has said that it 'does not want to throw a spanner into the works of the package'. It said it was conducting a secret ballot of its members and that the results would be analysed this morning. The Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail (CFDT), the third-biggest union, said that there has been 'considerable progress on certain points, a little on others and none at all on some'. A spokesman said that it was weighing the relative importance of its reservations with the plan and would make a final decision today. Even with support from Force Ouvriere, the CFDT and the smaller unions, however, a rejection from the CGT would ruin Mr Blanc's hopes for unanimous union support. In this case, the Air France chairman has indicated that he will appeal directly to the airline's staff, probably by referendum. 'The document is definitive. If the 14 unions have not signed by 6.00pm then we will have to go to a general consultation,' said a spokesman for the airline. Such an appeal could be expected within the next few weeks, although the terms of the document have not been decided. The strategy behind a referendum would be to isolate opponents of the package. But Mr Blanc is likely to need a comfortable approval margin - above 50 per cent - to proceed with his plan. The unions say they accept the idea of a referendum in principle; in practice, however, it may be a different matter. 'It will depend on the terms,' said Mr Besco; if it is a simple yes/no on the package, then the CGT will oppose it. Without majority support through a referendum, Air France would clearly enter a new, and more dangerous, phase. But risks remain, even with a mandate from the majority of its staff. In particular, the fragmented nature of union membership at the airline provides scope for the disruptive action which proved so damaging last October.</p>

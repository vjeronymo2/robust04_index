			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOWNEY S&amp;L COULD BECOME DOWNEY BANK  </P> <P> Downey Savings &amp; Loan's days as a thrift may be numbered. It could soon  become a bank and leave the woes of the thrift industry behind.  </P> <P> The likelihood of a Downey Bank sometime next year was revealed by Maurice L.  McAlister, the thrift's president, and David L. Boyles, the man who was hired  Thursday to transform Downey's operations into more bank-like services.  </P> <P> "We're seriously looking at whether it makes sense to be an S&amp;L," McAlister  said. "We could convert in a year or so."  </P> <P> Boyles has grasped the regulatory woes quickly: "We're not going to be allowed  to do anything more than what national banks can do, and yet we have to  maintain 70% (of assets) in mortgage lending," he said. "Profitability in that  is low."  </P> <P> Boyles, 41, a senior vice president at Bank of America, was named Downey's  executive vice president and chief operating officer. The appointment fills  long-vacant positions and sets him up as the S&amp;L's next leader.  </P> <P> McAlister, Downey's co-founder who will soon turn 65, said Boyles will expand  the S&amp;L's car-loan and home-equity loan products, promote lines of credit  for small businesses and oversee the thrift's traditional mortgage-lending  operation.  </P> <P> The S&amp;L needs Boyles' commercial banking experience, McAlister said,  because a recent federal law is forcing major changes in the beleaguered thrift  industry -- including healthy S&amp;Ls such as Downey. The new rules caused  Downey to post a $9.4-million loss for the fourth quarter last fall, reducing  its annual profit to $13.6 million.  </P> <P> Industry analysts greeted Downey's hiring of Boyles and its intention to expand  into banking operations -- even possibly converting to a bank -- as a smart  move.  </P> <P> "The basic (profit) spreads on mortgages are small and getting smaller," said  Michael Abrahams, an analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. brokerage  in Los Angeles. "So how do you make money? You go more into consumer loans and  other bank activities."  </P> <P> As a member of Bank of America's senior management, Boyles had been in charge  of consumer markets, consisting of all card services, automobile-dealer  banking, consumer credit administration, merchant services and electronic  banking.  </P> <P> As the person behind McAlister and Downey's chief executive and co-founder,  Gerald H. McQuarrie, 67, Boyles could become the heir apparent to Downey's  leadership. As one insider put it: "It's now his to win or lose."  </P> <P> McAlister said he and McQuarrie hope to spend less time at the helm of Downey  but have no immediate plans to retire completely.  </P> <P> Downey's long-successful business plan was driven by its real estate  investments, and regulators allowed the S&amp;L to hold three times the amount  that other thrifts could hold.  </P> <P> But that plan was derailed by the federal law enacted in August to rescue the  industry's deposit insurance system. Among its mandates, the law requires  thrifts to rid themselves of all real estate holdings that are backed by  insured deposits and to put 70% of its assets in home financing.  </P> <P> With Boyles in place to run daily operations, McAlister and McQuarrie are now  free to work on the sale of the thrift's real estate projects, which numbered  145 a year ago and included 94 neighborhood shopping centers.  </P> <P> The S&amp;L, regarded as one of the best-run shops in the nation, built an  impressive empire with $4 billion in assets on its real estate holdings.  </P> <P> It typically took options on raw land and leased or sold the projects before it  committed itself to buying the properties. Then, by undervaluing the properties  on its books, the S&amp;L gained tremendous hidden value. In 1987, for  instance, the real estate represented only 7.8% of Downey's assets but  generated 27% of both its total revenue and its operating earnings.  </P> <P> McAlister said he expects to sell the S&amp;L's real estate holdings within 18  months. Already, it has sold or has in escrow 11 projects, including six  shopping centers, for a total price of $149.9 million. The gain from those  sales alone is expected to be about $28 million.  </P> <P> James F. Wilson, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco,  estimates that the sales will produce gains of at least $100 million.  </P> <P> In one way, the federal law has played into Downey's hands. From the  acquisition of insolvent Butterfield Savings &amp; Loan in Santa Ana 18 months  ago, the S&amp;L has $95 million in tax credits that it must use this year or  lose.  </P> <P> Abrahams figures Downey will generate $45 million in pretax income this year.  And with the sales of its properties, it should have no trouble producing the  rest of the income it needs to use all of its tax credits, according to  Campbell Chaney, an analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. brokerage in San Francisco.  </P> <P> In addition, Wilson said, Downey has $105 million more available in tax credits  from the Butterfield purchase.  </P> <P> The proceeds also will give Downey a gigantic capital base that will enable it  to do just about anything it wants, including converting its charter to a bank  charter, Downey executives believe.  </P> <P> The S&amp;L already exceeds all capital requirements mandated by federal law  and regulations, and, as of Wednesday night, it had $148.2 million in excess  capital -- the amount above what it would be required to have in 1994.  </P> <P> Downey, however, won't abandon the real estate development business, McAlister  said. It plans to use its real estate subsidiary to borrow money -- probably  through short-term arrangements called commercial paper, which would be issued  by banks -- to resume its property acquisition.  </P> <P> As long as federally insured deposits are not supporting the ventures, he said,  the subsidiary is free to obtain its capital elsewhere and continue operations.  </P> <P> Downey's stock -- it closed at $15.25 a share Thursday, up 25 cents a share  from Wednesday's close -- is considered by the analysts to be undervalued and a  good buy for investors. The market has been treating all S&amp;Ls the same, the  analysts said, and has not been good to the industry.  </P></p>

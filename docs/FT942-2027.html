			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro's chemical interest to double output Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest publicly quoted company, said yesterday Qatar Fertilizer Company (Qafco), in which it holds a 25 per cent stake, is planning to spend about Dollars 500m to nearly double capacity for ammonia and urea production in Qatar. Hydro and Qatar General Petroleum Company (QGPC), which holds the remaining 75 per cent of Qafco, are to expand annual ammonia production capacity to 1.3m tons from 750,000 tons and urea capacity to 1.55m tons from 820,000 tons. The Oslo-based company said it had agreed to become project manager for the expansion project. Hydro said that a technical assistance agreement with Qafco had also been extended for a 10-year period. Qafco and Hydro also signed a 10-year marketing agreement, giving Hydro marketing rights for ammonia and urea in China and East Africa where the Norwegians are upgrading their sales and distribution network to meet increasing demand. 'This expansion and related agreements combine QGPC's policy of increased industrial development of Qatar's vast natural gas resources with Hydro's requirement for a reliable product source destined for the growing fertiliser markets in China and Africa,' Norsk Hydro said. Norsk Hydro said its NKr4.74bn rights issue was oversubscribed, but it did not yet know by how much, Reuters reports from Oslo. 'There is a clear oversubscription. This we can say already,' financial director Mr Georg Stoermer told the agency. The issue totals NKr23.68m ordinary shares at a price of NKr200 per share. The subscription period in Norway was set from June 3-17.</p>

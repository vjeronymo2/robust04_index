			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Brighter outlook at Jones &amp; Shipman JONES &amp; SHIPMAN, one of the UK's few remaining publicly-quoted machine tool companies, yesterday reported a 'quickening in the pace of new order inquiries from manufacturing industry in the US and Canada, as well as the UK.' Mr John Wareing, managing director, said that since early February 'positive interest has grown' in buying the Leicester-based company's computer-controlled precision grinding and honing machine tools. The announcement contrasts with the tone of the company's interim statement in December, and is one of the first indications that the outlook for the UK machine tool industry may be improving. The company fell from profits of Pounds 400,000 to losses of Pounds 2.46m pre-tax in the six months to September 30 and passed its interim dividend, blaming a 'widespread moratorium in investment in manufacturing facilities, particularly in the UK.' Yesterday, Mr Wareing said most of the new inquiries had come from traditional customers in the aerospace, precision tool, electronic component and computer accessory industries. But interest had also been expressed by new customer sources such as manufacturers of medical and surgical equipment, power-tool makers, air conditioning system manufacturers and the diesel fuel injection industry. Mr Wareing was speaking in connection with the company's decision to exploit 'the first signs of a flickering recovery' by exhibiting in force at Mach '92, the UK's largest machine tool exhibition, at Birmingham NEC in May. Mr Wareing's statement will be of interest to many in the UK's hard-pressed machine tool industry. However, a rise in inquiries needs to be followed by an upturn in orders before the industry can say real recovery has begun, and most still believe that will not come until 1993.</p>

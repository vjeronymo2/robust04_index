			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILLIAM BALL STAYS UP AFTER THE FALL;  </P> <P> FOUR YEARS AFTER A CONTROVERSIAL DEPARTURE FROM A THEATER COMPANY HE FOUNDED,  HE'S WINDING UP A ROLE IN 'CHERRY ORCHARD' IN LA JOLLA  </P> <P> If Chekhov, that supreme painter of ironies, is looking down from the heavens,  he is no doubt smiling with quiet pleasure over the casting of William Ball as  Leonid Gaev, whose family loses its homestead and deficit-plagued property in  "The Cherry Orchard" at the La Jolla Playhouse.  </P> <P> It's perfect casting and not just because Ball lost his own cherry orchard of  sorts four years ago. At the time, he resigned amid charges of poor management  of the deficit-ridden American Conservatory Theatre, the San Francisco company  he had founded and directed for 21 years.  </P> <P> Like Gaev, who is endlessly distracted by beauty, the 59-year-old Ball insists  on accentuating the positive, even, some might say, at the expense of truth.  After granting no interviews in four years, there are numerous questions about  the various accusations leveled at him in 1986.  </P> <P> Did Ball -- one of the pioneers of the regional theater movement -- advance his  own salary disproportionately at a time when the theater was in fiscal crisis?  Was the well-publicized fight between him and Cyril Magnin, his longtime  fund-raiser, the beginning of the end? Does he regret the letter he wrote to  the California Arts Council, accusing the organization of "being ineffective  and lacking in integrity" after it cut ACT's grant allocation by 83% from 1980  to 1982? Does he regret leaving ACT?  </P> <P> No, says he, denying it all, down to having the slightest twinge at the loss of  ACT, where he hasn't seen a show since he left.  </P> <P> "I did everything I wanted to do as a producer of a resident theater," he said.  "I produced all the plays I wanted to (more than 300), raised all the money I  ever want to raise. Twenty years at a job is enough."  </P> <P> The only thing he does admit to is an unwillingness to talk about regrets: "The  dark time," he says, "is like putting out the garbage. You don't look at the  garbage."  </P> <P> In a way, it is his continuing belief in himself that propelled his rise and  then kept him afloat after his fall from grace.  </P> <P> "I've always had this sense of being guided," he said recently. Such a hand may  have pushed him to take this part -- the first acting job in 28 years for a man  whom Craig  </P> <P> Noel, executive director of the Old Globe Theatre here, calls "the best Hamlet  I've ever seen." Ball played the role at the Old Globe in 1955.  </P> <P> Guided or not, what in fact happened was that Ball moved to Los Angeles in 1986  to develop feature film and television projects with producer Bud Yorkin;  nothing came of that and he was willing to try something new after four years  of sporadic employment, which included teaching and an ill-fated assignment at  the Odyssey Theatre to direct "Tom and Viv." (Ron Sossi, artistic director of  the Odyssey, told The Times that Ball quit prior to the opening when Sossi  found fault with the leading actor, Scot Bishop; Ball said that he never  formally agreed to direct the piece in the first place.)  </P> <P> Ball acquired a casting agent who, on seeing Ball with a beard (since shaved),  thought he looked Russian and sent Ball's picture to the Playhouse. He didn't  realize that "Cherry Orchard" director Tom Moore had staged many shows for Ball  at ACT, including a lavishly reviewed production of Chekhov's "The Three  Sisters."  </P> <P> Moore and Playhouse artistic director Des McAnuff went to Ball's home in Los  Angeles to discuss the part and Ball auditioned for the role as any other actor  would. "I wasn't quite sure how it would go . . . . But I'm having the time of  my life."  </P> <P> After years of literally and figuratively being the golden-haired boy, Ball,  now balding and gray beneath the blond wig that he dons for Gaev, retains the  charismatic zeal for art that has touched so many artists who worked under him  at ACT: Harry Hamlin, Annette Benning, Michael Learned, Denzel Washington, Rene  Auberjonois and Mark Harelik (also in "Cherry Orchard").  </P> <P> Harelik, who worked at ACT, from 1979-81, says he has never seen Ball work so  hard, or be so happy.  </P> <P> "It was very important to him that the play be successful and his role be  successful," said Harelik, who plays Yermolai Lopakhin -- the character who  purchases the Gaev estate.  </P> <P> "I don't think he really knew what it would be like walking on stage again, in  probably what he considered to be a relatively high-powered company, and with  as demanding a director as Tom Moore, who is an absolute perfectionist. For him  it was something like jumping off a cliff at night.  </P> <P> "There is no sense of having been his prior subordinate," Harelik said. "It's  almost as though during those years as artistic director he wanted to climb up  on stage with us and now he's gotten his chance. He's just in heaven."  </P> <P> Ball is also making a return as a director. Another graduate of ACT's acting  program, Bonnie Tarwater, now the artistic director of the Del Mar Theatre  Ensemble, just hired Ball to direct his own translation of Moliere's "Scapin,"  starring Tarwater and Scot Bishop (of the "Tom and Viv" controversy), for a  July opening in San Diego. She sings his praises: "A lot of his ideas of  heroics and positive thinking, the idea that if you can envision something you  can make it so, has influenced my life in a big way."  </P> <P> Recent hip replacement surgery has left Ball limping slightly and using a cane,  which seems a poignant reminder of the knocks he has sustained. But his  performance as Gaev is extravagant and fine, even though Ball refers to Gaev,  affectionately, as "one of the dingiest characters that ever lived."  </P> <P> "He wants to inspire high principles. He wants to preserve time-honored values,  awaken a sense of the majesty and glory of life," Ball said.  </P> <P> Ball's own theater career started "accidentally." As an undergraduate majoring  in set design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, he was  repeatedly cast in shows, so he switched his major to acting. Later a producer  asked him what he should look for in a director for Chekhov's "Ivanov." The  response impressed him so he asked Ball to take the job. The Obie award earned  by the Off-Broadway production led to a flurry of directing offers.  </P> <P> Then just as Ball was about to leave the nonprofit theater for commercial  opportunities, a 26-page college paper he wrote on his vision of regional  theater was sent to the Rockefeller Foundation, which Ball says made the offer  he couldn't refuse: "Can you make it work? We have a check for $450,000 if you  can."  </P> <P> That Ball made it work in the form of the American Conservatory Theatre is  history. That he made the word "conservatory," which once meant a music  academy, mean a school of theater as well, is a matter of lexicological record.  Benjamin Moore, Ball's managing director at ACT for 15 years, speaking from his  current office at the Seattle Repertory Theatre where he is managing director,  expressed admiration for what he refers to as Bill's "genius. It's thrilling to  see him work again." But, at the same time, Moore expressed reservations about  Ball's Draconian fund-raising methods that ultimately brought down his reign at  ACT and nearly destroyed the company.  </P> <P> According to several sources, Ball's regular approach was to threaten to close  the theater or to move it to another city if he didn't get sufficient money. He  also refused to work with a conventional board structure; Ball instead set up a  national board of trustees that consisted of like-minded professionals and a  California Assn. for ACT, which was a fund-raising organization without any  governing powers.  </P> <P> "So much of what he wanted to do and how he would do it ran so completely  against the grain of a public trust organization," said Moore. "He arrived  almost in the wrong century."  </P> <P> Joy Carlin, who started working with Ball as an actress in 1969 and is now  associate artistic director of ACT, blames the problems on "bad investments,  bad judgment -- he was trying to do it all. Now we have business people taking  care of business.  </P> <P> "He was a genius. It was his inspiration that started the theater. But 20 years  is a long time to maintain that genius or posture. People use the term 'burned  out' or 'worn out' and I think that's what happened."  </P> <P> Others like Rick Najera, one of the stars of "Latins Anonymous" and an ACT  alum, complain of what Najera calls Ball's "cult of personality." Najera was  bothered by Ball's extravagant speeches to the students at ACT about their  being "the best and the brightest," and especially the effect such speeches had  on an actress who knew that she would be cut from the second-year program along  with half of the first-year class -- a customary procedure.  </P> <P> "What do you do when all of a sudden you're not the best and the brightest;  what does that do to an impressionable head?" Najera said. "This girl tried to  commit suicide. It was very tough at ACT."  </P> <P> But Ball does not hear the critical voices. Like Gaev, who found relief from  tension once the cherry orchard was lost, Ball describes the loss of the ACT as  a helping hand that has brought him to where he says he wants to be -- teaching  in Los Angeles, writing, directing and acting again. He follows his own advice.  He takes chances. Maybe he failed big -- even if he won't admit it. But he  continues to take chances. He thinks positively. He has ideas about where  theater is headed in the '90s. He wants to be a part of it. He believes he is a  part of it.  </P> <P> "I feel like I'm beginning a new life," said Ball. "I'm tremendously grateful."  </P></p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Markets expect renewed support for dollar Financial markets were braced last night for further intervention by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan to support the dollar as the US currency drifted weakly against the yen and the D-Mark. The Bank of Japan was reported to have bought dollars for yen to boost the US currency, after Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's new prime minister, sought to calm markets by warning that the yen's recent rise against the dollar was 'undesirable'. Finance ministry officials in Tokyo said the Bank of Japan was ready to intervene in world currency markets through-out this week to support the dollar. The BOJ's move, after an emergency cabinet meeting in Tokyo over the weekend, followed the Fed's rare intervention on Friday to buy dollars for both yen and D-Marks. The dollar yesterday came under pressure against the German currency, as dealers appeared to be testing US resolve to stem the dollar's decline. There were no signs of Fed intervention, and trading was muted, mainly because of the May Day holiday in London and the start of a holiday week in Tokyo. In Japan, markets will close from today until Friday. However, the perception in markets was that the Fed's operations at the end of last week may have to be repeated to arrest the dollar's decline. The dollar has been weak recently against both the yen and the D-Mark because markets believe a lower dollar fits in with the US administration's plans to curb Japan's large trade surplus with North America. The Japanese government is concerned that a further rise in the yen could choke Japan's fragile hopes of economic recovery. Mr Hata said the yen-dollar exchange rate should reflect economic fundamentals. After closing at Y101.2 to the dollar on Friday night in Tokyo, the yen was quoted at the finish of trading in Japan yesterday at Y101.8. In late trading in New York last night, the Japanese currency was at 101.635, down from last week's close of Y101.6. The US currency was trading weakly against the D-Mark at DM1.64735, down from a close of DM1.654 the previous session. The Fed's move to support the dollar against the German currency on Friday came when it touched DM1.645. Concern that the yen's rise might squeeze Japanese export earnings undermined shares in Tokyo, pushing the Nikkei index down 0.8 per cent to 19,570.21.

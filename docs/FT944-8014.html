			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Arts: Purcell's King Arthur - Opera in recital Apart from his one real opera, the seemingly indestructible Dido and Aeneas, Purcell's theatre works sit uneasily on the modern stage, where, to be taken seriously, austerity is more to be prized than frolicsome glamour. Dryden and Purcell's King Arthur has little to do with the stuff of Athurian legend: lacking Camelot, the Lady of the Lake of the Knights of the Round Table, it focuses on Arthur the forger of Britain's imperial destiny and his campaign against the Saxon invasion, culmination in a dramatically feeble though rousing enough glorification of Britain's greatness - an occasion for some of Purcell's most uneven music, veering between the sublime 'Fairest isle' to tub-thumping fanfares. King Arthur demands a lavishness of presentation available to only the most generous of budgets and, if Dryden's play is enacted in full, a comparable stamina from audiences. Concert performances of the music alone are an obvious alternative, yet however wonderful Purcell's music, it does need some kind of broader context for it to make its dramatic impact. A favourite solution - a narration to link the more than 40 musical numbers - was adopted at the King Arthur conducted by John Eliot Gardiner at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Saturday as part of the South Bank centre's ongoing Henry Purcell: the English Genius series (which has already boasted an outstanding Fairy Queen from Roger Norrington - due on CD shortly from EMI). The narration proved a mixed blessing, however. While Dryden's flowery rhetoric certainly has its attractions, its hammy delivery by Edward Petherbridge (replacing the advertised Simon Callow) in tone more appropriate to the Death of Little Nell jarred with Gardiner's polished, fluent, often spirited but generally bland account of the score. Neither the secure playing of the English Baroque Soloists nor the robust delivery of the Monteverdi Choir could hide the fact that for all Gardiner's command of Baroque style there was dangerously little interpretation. Does not Purcell's music need as firm a guiding hand as any other great composer's? Nonetheless, there were some outstanding moments: the Frost Scene with Stephen Varcoe an anguished, eloquent Cold Genius and Nancy Argenta an exquisite, vibrantly reassuring Cupid; and some fresh, ardent singing from Paul Agnew in his tenor solos, including the impossible stratospheric 'I call you all to Woden's Hall'. But on the whole, Dryden's subtitle to King Arthur aptly summed up the general tone of Gardiner's approach: 'British Worthy'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Fabio Villegas, government and interior </F> minister, by Ana Fernanda Valderrama at Narino Palace in Santa  Fe de Bogota; from the "National" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Valderrama] Here is the first reaction by the  national government on today's attack on Rudolf Hommes  Rodriguez, finance and credit minister. Mr. Government and  Interior Minister Fabio Villegas, has the participation of the  Army of National Liberation been confirmed? What steps will be  taken?    [Villegas] It has indeed been confirmed that the National  Guerrilla Coordinating Board [CNG] is at the root of the attack.  We feel outraged, as all Colombians must feel, over this  criminal attack, this murderous action by the CNG. The  government reaffirms its will to maintain its policy of  eradicating these criminal bands from the country.    [Valderrama] A report from the Narino Palace stated that  Economic Development Minister Luis Alberto Moreno resigned. The  name of his replacement is being studied here at the Narino  Palace. What names are being mentioned?    [Villegas] [laughs] You have to ask the president.</p>

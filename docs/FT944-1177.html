			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Extended play for Zantac Pharmaceuticals leader Glaxo forged ahead 23 to 662 1/2 p as good news on its key drug prompted a rush of buying which sent the shares up to their highest level since they were routed back in March. Turnover of 19m shares was at the upper end of the stock's historic daily activity. Zantac, the anti-ulcer treatment which represents around half of the company's turnover, was due to lose its principal US patent at the end of next year. But changes in international patent law as a result of the latest Gatt agreement mean the patent has been extended until mid-1997. Zantac has annual sales in the US of about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) and one analyst calculated yesterday that extension of the patent could save up to Pounds 900m over the 18-month period. However, the bears were not prepared to change their views, arguing that the news did not fundamentally alter the doubts hanging over the company. The long-awaited bid for Portals, the specialist paper group, by bank note printer De La Rue finally hit the screens yesterday and sent the shares of the two companies in different directions. For Portals the agreed bid, which represented a paper and cash offer worth about 1035p a share at yesterday's close, it meant the end of more than 280 years of independence but a good deal for shareholders, whose investments were worth only 760p a share three weeks ago. For De La Rue the offer, carrying a cash equivalent of 1011p, was seen to be stretching the bank balance particularly as, according to some analysts, it went against earlier assurances that there would be no dilution of earnings. Ms Sonia Falaschi of UBS commented: 'It is a pretty full price, but strategically it is the right thing to do.' Portals rose 60 to 1025p, while De La Rue tumbled 34 to 922p. Recently floated TeleWest Communications dipped 1 1/2 to 179 1/2 p following pressure from delayed trades which pushed turnover to 9.2m. A number of securities houses are known to be bearish on the stock, Robert Fleming Securities adding to the gloom yesterday with a sell note that drew attention to the December 30 deadline for the close of TeleWest's stabilisation period. The shares are 2 1/2 p short of their issue price. Much of the selling was said to be coming from Wall Street, where telecoms shares remain out of favour. In contrast, BT added 4 at 379p on 6.7m turnover and Cable and Wireless improved 4 1/2 to 373p for a two-day advance of 11 1/2 . Talk of a possible hive-off within C&amp;W continued to circulate. Vodafone moved up 5 1/2 to 206 1/2 p on 7.2m traded. Dealers in the regional electricity stocks chose yesterday to take profits on several stocks following the recent run. Bid target Northern Electric was among those that retreated on the profit-taking, losing 16 at 1002p. Seeboard registered one of the biggest falls in the sector, ending 22 off at 455p. News that electricity generator PowerGen has agreed to buy between 6.5 and 8 per cent of its own shares when the government sells its 40 per cent stake in the group next February saw the stock up 7 to 521p. Wellcome rose 18 to 696p as some dealers suggested that US group Warner Lambert was interested in making a bid for the pharmaceuticals group. Wellcome has been seen as 'biddable' for some time and there was heavy activity in traded options. ICI improved 7 to 762p as Goldman Sachs raised its 1994 profits forecast to Pounds 515m from Pounds 500m and the figure for 1995 to Pounds 750m from Pounds 710m. Positive press comment boosted drinks group Cadbury-Schweppes by 6 1/2 to 414p. Views in the market on Trafalgar House, which is currently bidding for Northern Electric, were polarised after Smith New Court upgraded its recommendation from a hold to a buy, while NatWest Securities advised shareholders to reduce their holdings. The shares added a penny at 74p. Suggestions that the UK hotel market was continuing to improve saw hotels group Forte harden 4 to 241p. The same market was said to be improving overseas and dealers turned their attention to Ladbroke, which operates Continental hotels and several in Japan. The shares moved forward 3 to 163p. Hopes of improved spending over the Christmas season boosted stocks in the stores sector. One of the biggest rises was seen in Kingfisher, 10 higher at 439p. However, Goldman Sachs remained cautious on the sector, and Mr Rod Whitehead, stores analyst at the US investment bank, believes many companies are likely to come out with disappointing trading statements next month. He said: 'Companies are unlikely to make up the ground lost in October and November. Elsewhere among stores, House of Fraser relinquished 4 at 176p, after a block of 5.1m shares was crossed at 175p, well below the market price. Vickers was easier at 178 1/2 p in spite of the way most analysts found clear favour with the engines collaboration deal between the group's Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary and BMW, of Germany. With 2.5m shares changing hands at 173p apiece as part of a big programme trade, aerospace group Rolls-Royce saw turnover climb to 11m. The shares closed flat at 172p. Taylor Woodrow moved ahead 6 to 130p after a further round in the company's share buy-back programme which mopped up 785,300 shares on Monday. A housebuilding update by NatWest Securities promotes Taylor Woodrow as the stock with the least downside in the sector. Heating and air conditioning hire specialist Andrews Sykes jumped 21 to 158p, triggering a statement from the company that it knew of no reason for the share price movement. Brandon Hire appreciated 7 to 92 1/2 p. Perceived bid candidates in the banking sector of the market shot forward, with Smith New Court jumping 16 to 444p and Kleinwort Benson 13 to 548p. Media conglomerate Pearson fell 9 1/2 to 557 1/2 p on a spate of small negative stories and a line of more than half a million shares dealt at 558 1/2 p. Some analysts have been shaving forecasts after meeting with the company. Composite insurers were victims of their recent strong performance. Commercial Union, which has outperformed the FT-SE-A All-Share Index by 8 per cent over the past three months, fell 10 to 524p as one investor decided enough was enough and lightened holdings.</p>

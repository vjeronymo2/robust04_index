			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Foschini turns in 26% income improvement Foschini, the South African clothing and jewellery retail group, continues to make progress, increasing attributable income 26 per cent to R129.9m (Dollars 35.8m) for the year ended March despite a difficult trading environment, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg. After tax, profits rose by 39 per cent to R143.7m, but were diluted by an extraordinary item of R13.8m, largely related to goodwill and trademark costs following an acquisition. Turnover increased 24 per cent to R1.44bn. Mr Clive Hirschsohn, managing director, said: 'We used aggressive marketing to maximise trading opportunities and were well positioned for the first tentative movements of the economic upswing.' He said turnover had been boosted by an exceptional second half. The company controls Oceana Investments, which has a 36 per cent stake in Etam, the UK retailer.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> RANGERS GET BOOST FROM SHEPPARD  </P> <P> Ray Sheppard, trying to play his way into the lineup, scored twice to support  Mike Richter's strong game in goal as the New York Rangers beat the Minnesota  North Stars, 4-2, at Bloomington, Minn., Thursday night to take over the points  lead in the NHL with 30.  </P> <P> Because the Rangers have 23 healthy players but can dress only 20 for games,  Coach Roger Neilson can't play three men per night.  </P> <P> Sheppard has been one of the odd men out four times, including Tuesday night at  Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Richter made 14 of his 33 saves in the first period for the Rangers, who are  3-0-2 in their past five games.  </P> <P> New York Islanders 4, Calgary 3 -- Brent Sutter scored on a power play with 42  seconds remaining in overtime for the Islanders' first victory in Calgary's  Olympic Saddledome.  </P> <P> The Islanders had been 0-8-2 at the Saddledome since it opened in 1983. Their  last victory in Calgary was a 6-4 victory at the Stampede Corral in October,  1982.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 4, Montreal 1 -- Rick Tocchet and Murray Craven each had a goal  and an assist to lead the Flyers past the Canadiens at Montreal.  </P> <P> Montreal's Brian Skrudland gave the Canadiens their only goal with 10 seconds  left in the second period.  </P> <P> Boston 6, Quebec 0 -- Dave Christian scored twice in a three-goal first period  and Reggie Lemelin recored his 12th career shutout at Boston as the Bruins  handed the Nordiques a club-record 12th consecutive defeat.  </P> <P> Hartford 4, New Jersey 2 -- Rookie goaltender Daryl Reaugh made 29 saves and  Paul Cyr scored two goals to lead the Whalers at East Rutherford, N.J.  </P></p>

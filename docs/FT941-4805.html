			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India prepares ground for flower sales drive - Plans for a dramatic expansion in production and exports India has served notice that it intends to join the ranks of the major flower producing countries in the next few years. Encouraged by the federal government's decision to make floriculture a priority area for development, a large number of established business houses and new entrepreneurs have decided to grow flowers on a commercial scale for the export market. 'Like so many other tropical countries, India should have taken the initiative to grow flowers scientifically on a commercial scale a long time ago,' says one industry official. 'After all India has plenty of land, water and sun to grow a large variety of flowers. But we should be able to make up for the lost time.' The liberalisation of the import of technology and mother stock plants will make it possible for India to grow flowers for the world market, he says. The Agricultural and Processed Food Product Export Development Authority has estimated that of the nearly 34,000 hectares of land under floriculture, only about 10,000 hectares are used to produce cut flowers. Experts believe that it should be possible to commit as much as 500,000 hectares to floriculture in the next few years. By amending the land ceiling act, which allows corporations to acquire large tracts of land for horticulture, the government of Maharashtra has set the trend for the other Indian states. World trade in flowers, estimated at over Dollars 25bn, is growing at a highly encouraging rate of 11 per cent a year. This has enabled countries like Colombia, Guatemala, Brazil, Kenya, Thailand and Malaysia to expand quickly the production base for flowers. In contrast, India's exports of cut flowers, foliage and tissue culture plants amounted to a meagre Rs130m (Pounds 2.75m) last year. But in view of the strong interest of the Indian corporations in floriculture, it is now felt that the flower export target of Rs1bn for 1996-97 'is too conservative'. The locations identified for the development of intensive floriculture are Pune and Nashik in Maharashtra, Bangalore in Karnataka, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, Kalimpong in West Bengal and Shrinagar in Jammu and Kashmir. But except for Pune and Nashik - which are close to the Bombay airport, where APEDA has built cold storage facilities for flowers - the centres identified do not as yet offer 'good international air connections', industry officials point out. The government, which has given a 25 per cent air freight subsidy on flowers is talking to several foreign airlines about securing adequate cargo space for flowers. It also has agreed to create the necessary infrastructure at the major airports in the country for storing and handling flowers. The Indian companies entering the flower business have chosen Europe, south-east Asia and the Far East as their 'principal target markets'. The US is the single largest market for flowers but 'India is not targetting it because of the distance'. 'The most productive flower growing period in India is September to March. This coincides with the peak seasonal demand for flowers in Europe, when little is grown locally. We want to make the best use of this season,' say the industry officials, who at the same time admitted of their many handicaps. 'Our knowledge of constructing ideal greenhouses is limited. We lack good plant materials. 'Without foreign technical know-how, we will not be able to produce flowers for the world market. And our knowledge of flower marketing is practically nil.' But the liberal import of floriculture and tissue culture technologies, greenhouses, mother stock plants and seeds are enabling the Indian companies to make a confident start in flower business. As for marketing, most Indian companies are seeking the assistance of Dutch companies to ensure that their flowers realise good prices at the auction.</p>

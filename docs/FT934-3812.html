			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Lebanon delays plans to raise Dollars 300m for Beirut The Lebanese government has announced a delay in its plans to raise Dollars 300m for reconstruction work in Beirut by issuing Eurobonds, in the hope of obtaining more favourable terms in the new year. The country's first Eurobond offering was due by the end of 1993, but has now been delayed until March or April 1994, according to Mr Fouad Siniora, the finance minister. He refused to explain the delay, other than saying there was no immediate need for the money. He said the projects to be financed by the issue - the rehabilitation of Beirut's mainly Shi'ite southern suburbs and a road network - were not yet ready to go ahead. Market analysts, however, believe the issue was postponed so that the government could assess the reception of the Dollars 650m equity offering of Solidere, a Dollars 1.8bn property company set up to rebuild the centre of Beirut, which closes on January 10. The bonds were expected to be priced to yield between 350 and 400 basis points over US Treasuries, which some market observers described as 'junk bond pricing'. No underwriters have been appointed to arrange the offering so far, but Mr Siniora said that Merrill Lynch, Banque Paribas, Banque Indosuez, and Saudi American Bank had all expressed an interest in the deal. The delay will also give time for a potential breakthrough in the peace talks between Israel and Lebanon, which would boost market confidence, allowing the bonds to be priced at a tighter spread. Elsewhere, the Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society launched a Pounds 150m issue of 7 1/8 per cent 10-year bonds, arranged by UBS. Dealers said demand was rather lacklustre, due to a general slow-down ahead of the year-end. 'There was nothing wrong with the pricing (of 60 basis points over the yield curve for an A1-rated name), but there was nothing to grab investors' interest either,' said one trader. Dealers said that the tone of the sterling bond market remains positive, but investors are focusing primarily on gilts ahead of Wednesday's auction, and with hopes of a further rate cut still strong. By the end of the day, the yield spread had widened slightly to 63 basis points. In the D-mark sector, two more German states tapped the market, using similar structures. Saxony's DM300m offering was billed as a 10-year bond extendible in years 10 and 15, while Bremen's DM200m deal was described as a 15-year deal with a put option annually from year eight; both essentially offer the investor the option to extend the maturity of the bonds. Two Australian companies have tapped the US debt market. CRA Finance, part of the mining and minerals group, raised USDollars 300m via a public note offering in the Yankee bond market and MIM Holdings USDollars 140m through a private placement of senior unsecured notes, writes Nikki Tait.</p>

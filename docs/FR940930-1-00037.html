			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once a document has been purged of any information that could be used to identify a particular individual or that could be associated with a particular person, that document could be shared with LSC, consistent with the rules of professional responsibility. However, the Committee solicits comments as to whether other information than that which would identify a client may have to be withheld pursuant to local rules of professional responsibility. The comments should include specific examples of types of information that would have to be withheld.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event that LSC is investigating a specific complaint involving a previously identified client, unless the specific client has consented to the disclosure, the recipient may be under an obligation to withhold from LSC substantially more of the information provided by the client in order to ensure that secrets, confidences, and information gained in the course of the representation are not inappropriately revealed. Should the information thus provided prove insufficient to permit LSC to fulfill its obligation to ensure that recipients meet the requirements of this part, it is anticipated that the recipient and LSC will work together to devise an acceptable manner in which to proceed. Of course, if LSC is investigating a complaint at the request of a client, the client may consent to the disclosure of the information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1621.4&blank;Complaints About Denial of Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a) is revised to require recipients to establish simple procedures for the timely review of a complaint by an applicant for service regarding a decision to deny service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) sets out the requirements for such procedures, which should include instructions on how an applicant may obtain information on the reasons for a denial of service, including information on the recipient's priorities, eligibility guidelines, statutory restrictions on representation, and a recipient's case acceptance criteria. Case acceptance criteria would include, but would not be limited to, consideration of the merits of the applicant's case and any conflicts of interest that may exist. The Committee would like to hear comments on other items that should be included as case acceptance criteria. The procedures should also contain information on how a complainant can make a complaint and confer with a recipient's director or a member of the grievance committee regarding the denial of service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (c) requires recipients to make reasonable and appropriate efforts to inform applicants about the complaint procedures. What is reasonable and appropriate would vary depending on the resources of a recipient and the volume of its applicants. There are a variety of ways, depending on the circumstances, in which the standard could be met. They include, but are not limited to: (1) Providing written information about the complaint procedure to all rejected applicants whose eligibility is determined in person; (2) providing written notification to rejected applicants whose determinations are routinely acknowledged in writing; (3) using voice mail or other available technology, if appropriate and economically feasible; or (4) providing oral descriptions of the complaint procedures for rejected applicants who express dissatisfaction with the determination. The standard would not include a practice that would overwhelm a program's telephone system or exact too high an administrative cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d) prohibits the recipient from disclosing any information maintained by the recipient regarding a complaint of denial of assistance to the Corporation or any third party in a manner that would violate the attorney-client privilege or the applicable rules of professional responsibility. This paragraph does not require the recipient to maintain a file on complaints of denial of assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although recipients are not required to do so by the rule, they should make reasonable and appropriate efforts to ensure that non-English speaking individuals and those with communicative disorders understand the complaint procedures, have the tools to adequately express their complaints, and receive appropriate explanations of why their applications for service were denied or what actions are being taken in response to their complaints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 1621  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Legal services.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

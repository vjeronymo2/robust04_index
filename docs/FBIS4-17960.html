			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nadein: "Russia's Position Prompts </F> Optimism in West's Financial Big Shots. Aleksandr Shokhin on  the Conference of G-7 Finance Ministers"]    [Text] Washington -- Although a Russian delegation's  participation in the conference of G-7 finance ministers became  a kind of tradition some time ago, our representatives have not  for a long time enjoyed such a cordial, approving, not to say  welcoming, atmosphere as the one that prevailed last Sunday [24  April] at the IMF building in Washington. Ironically  apologizing for using an "excessively Soviet" word, Deputy Prime  Minister A.N. Shokhin said that the support for the present  Russian Government's course was "unanimous."    "I was glad to see so much optimism around the table," U.S.  Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the conference,  commented on its conclusion. For the first time in quite a long  time, Russia contributed its share of optimism to the discussion.    A few days before the conference, to which world financial  circles traditionally attach very great significance, IMF  Executive Director Michel Camdessus had, in several public  statements, imparted pleasant impressions of his prolonged visit  to Russia. Whether he had been too alarmed beforehand by  newspaper reports in which the broad shoulders of V.  Zhirinovskiy overshadowed the country's entire political scene,  or whether the departure of several young reformists from the  government had been seen as a fatal blow to market freedom, in  any case the contrast proved striking, and M. Camdessus' remarks  exuded what in Soviet times used to be called a "sense of deep  pride and legitimate satisfaction." Not only did the "long  hours of talks" with Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin convince the  IMF executive director of the government's commitment to  reforms, but also the meetings in the State Duma, far from  ruining this general impression, actually added to the optimism,  since he recognized that there are some very responsible and  knowledgeable people in the Duma.  <H5>  No Doubts About the Course of Reforms </H5>   "At Sunday's G-7 meeting unanimous support was expressed for  the Russian Government's course," A. Shokhin said at a meeting  with Russian journalists on Tuesday [26 April]. "This was  expressed in the fact that the IMF board of directors granted  the second part of the credit for systemic transformations, and  also in the general tone of the discussion compared with the  meeting at Kromberg in February of this year. At that time the  discussion concerned whether the (Russian) government intended  to continue the course of reforms at all. But this time what  was discussed was pragmatic problems such as providing the  conditions for an influx of private investments into Russia, the  creation of favorable tax and customs regimes for such an influx  of investments, and the problem of insuring investments in  Russia against political risks."    A second group of questions under discussion was connected  with the creation of nondiscriminatory regimes in commodity  markets that are fundamental for us --aluminum, uranium, space  launches, etc. "It is a question of creating a universal legal  base whereby Russia would be seen as a country with a  transitional economy, not a country with a centralized state  system of trade and economy," A. Shokhin explained. "That way  exactly the same criteria would be applied to it as to any other  country."    In this connection the Russian delegation expressed an  "urgent desire" for Russia finally to be freed from the  Jackson-Vanik amendment. Its political aspect consisted in  pressure on governments that do not allow their citizens freely  to leave their country and return there. In A. Shokhin's  opinion, this simply does not apply to present-day Russia. But  the economic aspect of the amendment is that a discriminatory  regime could be applied against our country at any moment. And  that creates an off-putting atmosphere for investors.  <H5>  World Bank for a Plant Kindergarten </H5>   The third of the main questions at the conference concerned  reorienting the package of support for the Russian reforms. The  package was announced earlier, but a significant part of it was  not brought to bear on developing the system of social  protection for the population.    "We discussed a possible mechanism for this switch.  Specifically, it was said that for a transitional period local  budgets should receive specific financial help, and backing  should be given to federal programs such as a program of support  for coal-mining regions," A. Shokhin said. This had been said  before, but the novelty of the vice prime minister's information  was that henceforth, World Bank credits will be applied to such  purposes.    The Russian delegation submitted a number of proposals in  connection with the activity of the so-called Paris Club --  representatives of the group of creditor countries. "At the  moment we have a temporary situation, we are making payments for  1994 in line with the 1993 agreement, which has been extended to  1 May. In the light of our budget's potential, we need a better  agreement than the one that existed in 1993." By "better" the  vice prime minister clearly meant more favorable terms for  Russia, but would the creditors agree to this? "There is an  understanding," A. Shokhin said, somewhat vaguely.    Russia also raised the question of its new status in the  Paris Club as not only a debtor country, but also a creditor  country. "Very many developing countries have debts to us, as  the Soviet Union's successor," A. Shokhin said. "We are the  chief creditor of, for instance, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and others.  In this connection we do not insist on full membership, but,  for instance, observer status. That would be appropriate to  Russia's real position."    A. Shokhin said that, in discussing questions of  collaboration with ministers from the world's seven most  developed countries, "we emphasize in every way that Russia  holds a special position. On the one hand it is, so to speak,  petitioning for support for the reforms and systemic  transformation in Russia, but on the other hand it is a donor --  in particular to countries that were formerly republics of the  Soviet Union. The scale of this aid is vast, and it is a heavy  burden on the budget, and this is done not because of any  imperial ambitions on Russia's part, but for very simple reasons  -- you cannot cut off the gas in winter, you cannot leave those  states without heat or electricity. Therefore, Russia is  obliged to "supply them with relatively cheap and sometimes free  resources." [quotemarks as published]    "In this context we would also like to support a system  proposed by the IMF executive director," A. Shokhin continued.  "What I am referring to is that Russia could offer credits to  the CIS states jointly with other willing countries, but  formally it would be in the form of credits from international  financial organizations. We would thereby clear ourselves of  possible accusations of imperial aspirations, and on the other  hand increase repayment guarantees, because the credits would  have the status of credits from international financial  institutions."    Near the end of the session, a piece of news that everyone  found alarming arrived from Moscow. News agency cables reported  that the Duma, with the government's consent, had increased the  country's expenditure budget by 8 trillion rubles -- such a  substantial sum that the threat of inflation could have spoiled  the good impression that everyone had received of the new  approaches in Russia. "We spent half the day today explaining  what all this meant," A. Shokhin said with a smile. "We  explained to everyone, including Camdessus himself."    "It is true that the budget figures have `changed  somewhat,'"  the vice prime minister noted. But what happened was in the  main a technical adjustment. We decided to release credits to  agriculture -- about 6 trillion rubles -- not through the  Central Bank and commercial banks, which is a long road, and  experience shows that here there are many abuses and improper  use of the credits. The commercial banks make the credits work  for them before directing them to the countryside. And we have  decided to do it in the form of budget appropriations. Overall  monetary emission is not changed, but these credits, being  recorded under the budget heading, increase the apparent budget  deficit, but in principle, this is IMF methodology. The IMF  has long been making us show these concessionary credits in the  budget. Now we can dictate the terms for the expenditure of  these resources."    The Russian delegation set forth its position on attracting  investments to Russia. "Unless, in the next few months, we can  organize this influx, contradictions will arise between a  relatively rigorous credit and financial policy and a deepening  recession in production." A. Shokhin said that the granting of  $1.5 billion for systemic transformations in the near future  does not cause the slightest euphoria in the government, since  this money is "already accounted for in the budget, we have  already spent it" -- because the government was sure of  receiving it. The question of the need to go over to  medium-term payment balances -- otherwise there will be payment  peaks.    "For instance, this year, out of the sum of over $4 billion  allocated for servicing and extinguishing the foreign debt, we  are forced to spend a large proportion on servicing Russia's  debts -- not the former Soviet debts. In this connection we are  actively suggesting to G-7 that the borrowed credits be applied  without Russian Government guarantees. Outlines have already  been drawn up. In accordance with framework agreements signed  in September by the U.S. `Eximbank' and the corresponding  Russian organizations, the Central Bank of Russia and the  Finance Ministry offer so-called comfort terms for foreign  investors. True, at the moment this only applies to the oil and  gas sector. But the comfort is expressed in the fact that  guarantees can be offered against credits, these guarantees can  be sold for rubles, rubles can be converted into foreign  currency, and foreign currency can be repatriated."    Thus, instead of government guarantees, which are expressed  in the formula "if an enterprise does not pay for itself, we  will pay," new guarantees are appearing: You can demand that  the enterprise, the Central Bank, and the Finance Ministry  fulfill quite specific conditions. In particular, the Finance  Ministry must, under this contract, compensate foreign investors  for less favorable taxation conditions or other things connected  with a change in legislation. "Many people are prepared to work  with us on these terms. We are now holding talks with the  Italians and the Germans," the vice prime minister concluded,  clearly satisfied with the results of the conference of the G-7  finance ministers in the U.S. capital.</p>

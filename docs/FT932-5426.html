			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Georgia to drop the rouble Georgia, in the throes of civil war, has become the latest former Soviet republic to announce plans to abandon the rouble as its currency, writes Leyla Boulton. Mr Tengiz Sigua, the Georgian prime minister, was quoted yesterday by Interfax news agency as saying the rouble would be replaced by coupons issued in April to pay wages, pensions and student grants after Russia cut off deliveries of banknotes. He did not say when this would occur. Meanwhile, President Boris Yeltsin yesterday threatened to impose economic sanctions on impoverished former Soviet republics which did not repay their debts to it.</p>

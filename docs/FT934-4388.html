			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (1): Potential for growth is diminished - Previous recessions were like a broken limb, and Japan quickly recovered. But this one is like a disorder of the circulation, which takes longer to cure. The government's medicine has not yet revitalised the patient's system A salutary message has dawned on Japan's industrial companies as they face, in 1993, their fourth consecutive year of profits decline. The message is that this recession, the worst for 20 years, is wider and deeper than other downturns, for several reasons. What used to be the two main growth sectors of Japan's industrial economy, cars and consumer electronics, are entering a probably longer-than-usual period of slow growth. Yet there is no obvious new growth industry to succeed them. Secondly, this recession has exposed overcapacity that many leading companies suspected was there during the previous downturn in 1986, but which was then concealed by the fast rise in consumption - and industrial investment - at the end of the 1980s. They already knew that Japanese-based manufacturing was being made uncompetitive by the yen's rise over the years. They had accordingly started to cut costs and shift production overseas, first to the UK and continental Europe and then to the fast-growing industrial economies of south-east Asia. This year's unexpected fresh surge in the yen suggests that industry might after all be only at the start of relocating production outside Japan, prompting fears of a so-called 'hollowing out' of domestically-based industry. How industry will respond to the shift in production and to the maturity of cars and electronics is the question now being discussed anxiously in Tokyo boardrooms. Companies used to look for guidance on big strategic issues like this to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), the body which was mainly responsible for Japan's post-war success in spotting new growth industries to succeed the old. But today, Miti has no clear answers to these new challenges. Its officials argue that centralised industrial planning is unsuitable for the open market economy which Japan has become, and that the best Miti can do is to help industries to reflect on the future. For the first time, the private sector may have to find its own way to the next phase of industrial development. Finally, previous recessions, unlike this one, were triggered by external shocks, such as the 1973 oil price shock, or the rise in the value of the yen, sparked by the 1985 Plaza accord to curb the appreciation of the dollar. Yet this recession is only partly related to the yen's continued rise. It also has internal causes such as companies' unwillingness to invest - in contrast with their tendency to increase capacity in previous recessions, in the hope of better times around the corner. This time, however, the better times are proving slower to emerge. Japan's economic growth rate has fallen back for nearly four years running. Industry will cut capital investment for the fourth consecutive year in 1994, according to a recent survey by the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. Most economists think that gross national product will stagnate or fall by a fraction of a percentage point this year - the first year-on-year fall since 1974 - after 1.5 per cent growth in 1992. Even the government's Economic Planning Agency, often criticised for being over-optimistic, has abandoned its 3.3 per cent target for economic growth this year. As one senior Japanese securities company executive puts it, previous recessions broke a limb, from which Japan quickly recovered, while this one is like a disorder of the circulation, which takes longer to cure. The government's medicine, including interest rate cuts, and about Y30,000bn of pump-priming measures over the past 13 months, have not yet revitalised the patient's system. The one available measure not yet tried is an income tax cut, and that is likely early next year. There were signs that the economy might pick up in the spring, but since then economists have steadily downgraded their forecasts as a stream of gloomy indicators have shown that spring was a false start. Industrial output is on the slide, down 5 per cent year-on-year in September, for the 24th month running, the longest decline on record. One structural weakness revealed by Japan's recession is the faltering supply of credit. Banks are still scarred by the collapse in asset prices that came with the start of the downturn, a problem highlighted when Muramoto Construction, a medium-sized contractor, sought protection from its creditors early last month with debts of Y590bn, Japan's largest post-war financial collapse. A sharp decline in loan growth which began three years ago shows no signs of easing. Officially, bad debts account for 3 per cent of the leading banks' loans, although the proportion rises to nearly 10 per cent if the more stringent US definition of what constitutes a bad loan is applied, says Ms Alicia Ogawa, investment analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia, the securities house. Banks deny that they are being too cautious. There are clear signs that demand for credit is just as weak as supply, despite the Bank of Japan's decision to cut its official discount rate by three-quarters of a percentage point in September to a record low of 1.75 per cent. Corporate Japan has, as it usually does, reacted to its problems rapidly. The first sign that the industry's response to the downturn had entered a new phase came early this year when Nissan became the first Japanese carmaker since the second world war to announce a plant closure - at Zama, near Tokyo, with the loss of 5,000 jobs over the next three years. Nissan's motives are echoed across Japanese industry. The group had cut costs in previous downturns, 'but then we tended to put on more weight, more fat than before,' when a recovery materialised, said Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, Nissan's president. The Zama closure is part of a plan to reduce capacity from 2.5m units a year to 2.3m units over the next three years. This time, the group will stay smaller, says Mr Tsuji. Industrial cost-cutting entered another important phase in September when NTT, the telecommunications group and a pillar of the industrial establishment, announced that it would shed 10,000 staff, through voluntary retirement, by next year. This was significant because it reduced other companies' inhibitions about cutting jobs, still seen as socially unacceptable in Japan. In the weeks that followed, the Toshiba electronics group announced that it was to cut 5,000 jobs; Honda the carmaker 3,000; and Kawasaki Steel 3,200, to cite just some of the most prominent. However, one taboo remains intact - Japanese companies' reluctance to impose straightforward redundancies. All the job losses announced so far by leading industrial companies will take place over a period of years and will be achieved through methods that appear painless by the standards of US or European competitors. These include cutting down on recruitment, not replacing people who retire, or requiring surplus staff to move to other divisions or affiliate companies, some of which can be geographically remote. This has enabled Japan to keep its unemployment rate low, at about 2.5 per cent. This does not include the estimated 800,000-1.2m employees who are surplus to companies' needs but are still kept on payrolls. One consequence of Japanese industry's relatively gentle approach to job reductions has been to increase the pressure on salaries. Companies' determination to cut payroll costs is underlined by the present negotiations on bonuses, an important part of total salaries. The electronics industry has set the tone by cutting bonuses to the lowest level for 18 years, prompting uncharacteristic complaints from normally compliant unions. Car and steel industries are taking an equally tough line, likely to be continued when Japanese industry embarks on its annual wage round next spring. All this has provoked widespread questioning - by both companies and employees - of Japan's social contract of a job for life in return for complete loyalty to the company. The car industry has already long experience of using temporary workers to increase flexibility and thus cut costs. But now an increasing number of big industrial groups, such as Sony and Toyota, are trying to employ a small proportion of people who are not expected to stay with the company all their lives. The industrial consequence of surpluses in the workforce, the maturity of cars and electronics and the banking system's weakness, is to diminish Japan's growth potential. For the past few decades, Japanese industry has always planned on the basis of fast growth - hence its former reputation of chasing turnover at the expense of profits. In the next few years it can expect economic growth of between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent, roughly a percentage point less than in the 1980s, forecasts Mr Peter Tasker, chief strategist at securities house, Kleinwort Benson, in Tokyo. All this indicates that Japanese industry is on the threshold of what will be a new experience for it: how to switch from the strategic offensive, to adjusting to a slow growth world.</p>

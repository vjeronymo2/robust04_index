			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 12 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The  Constitutional Court of Mongolia, considering the complaints of  the group of Mongolian citizens on the issue about  contradictions of many provisions of the law on relations of the  state and church with the country's Constitution, a number of  international treaties, including the General Declaration on  Human Rights, the International Convention on Civil and  Political Rights, made today a decision, which, as it can be  said, has satisfied the plaintiffs that much the complaints  concerned the articles of the law, which, in view of the  plaintiffs are restricting the human rights on religious  liberty, on holding a prayer freely, spreading their religious  convictions, acting on behalf of church, holding religious  ceremonies; also are discriminating other religions in the  country, except Buddhism, Islam, Shamanism; are violating the  rights of foreign citizens to act on the territory of Mongolia  in accordance with their religious views.    As the Constitutional Court considered, the provision of the  law on leading place of Buddhism is up to the spirit of the  Constitution about the unity of the Mongolian society, national  security, and has just a declarative and symbolic character,  concerning the provision on ban of organizational spreading of  religion from outside, the judges considered that this also does  not contradict both the country's main law and international  rights and duties of Mongolia.    But the Constitutional Court gave a commentary to this  decision, stating that this provision applies only to  reactionary religions and currents.    As far as the provisions of the law, by which a ban is  imposed on spreading, propagating of religions outside church,  except Buddhism, Islam, Shamanism, and also on organization of  any religious actions on the Mongolian territory by foreign  citizens arrived in the country not on the church line, are  concerned, the constitutional judges recognized these provisions  as not corresponding to both the country's Constitution and  international agreements.    The chairman at the court session, after passing a verdict  of  the court, officially addressed the foreign citizens present at  the court examination, gave explanations on some decisions, drew  their attention to the fact that this is not the last word, the  verdict of the Constitutional Court will be considered by the  Mongolian parliament, it was said about a possibility of  revision by law-makers of some provisions, on which the  complaints were made.    The law on relations of the state and church, which was  adopted at the end of 1993, has aroused arguments not only in  the Mongolian society, but, in all probability, had an  international repercussions. Participation of many foreign  citizens in the court examination, who represented in the main  the representatives of Christian churches, and some of whom  arrived in Mongolia specially on this occasion, is indicative of  this fact.    It has become known from the reliable sources that the  ambassador of Great Britain to Mongolia at his recent meeting at  the Mongolian parliament paid attention to the fact that  consequences of this law would affect not only mutual relations  between Mongolia and England, but also the international arena,  as this restricts the human rights and liberties.</p>

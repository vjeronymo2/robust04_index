			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, June 10 (TANJUG) -- British General Sir  Michael Rose, commander of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  for the war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, assessed an overall  one-month truce in Bosnia, which took effect on Friday noon  (1000 GMT), as `the beginning of the end of the war.' Gen. Rose  told the press in Sarajevo that thousands of peacekeepers would  be deployed throughout Bosnia to monitor the four-week truce  signed by representatives of warring sides in Geneva on  Wednesday. Gen. Rose warned that a U.S. Congressional vote to  unilaterally lift an arms embargo on Bosnian moslems, passed on  Thursday, could undermine peace efforts. `I hope it does not  raise false hope in people's minds. You know it has been an  aspiration of the Bosnian Government. Their view that "give us  the weapons and we'll finish the job" is fairly widespread, but  my own view is that it takes a lot more than just being given  equipment to win a war.'    The U.N. Security Council in the Autumn of 1991 introduced  an  arms embargo for Bosnia-Herzegovina, in an effort to contribute  to settling ethnic conflicts there. The Bosnian Moslems,  strongly supported by Islamic countries, have for months called  for their exemption from the arms embargo.    UNPROFOR spokesman Eric Chaperon also on Friday in Sarajevo  said that the intensity of fighting in Bosnia has not been on  such a low level for over a year, as it was a few hours before  the ceasefire took effect. Sporadic artillery fire was reported  in northern and central Bosnia, but the intensity was half as  strong as the previous day, Chaperon said.    According to U.N. monitors reporting, there were only 80  artillery shells fired on Friday on the frontline between  Gradacac and Ribnica in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina, for  example, while the previous day 389 shells were fired in the  same area.</p>

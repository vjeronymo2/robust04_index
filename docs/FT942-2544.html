			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Fund managers offer swop - At a Glance Holders of units in the City of London emerging markets unit trust are about to be invited to swop their units for shares and warrants in a new investment trust being set up by City of London fund managers. The investment trust will, like the unit trust, invest in closed-end single country funds for emerging markets, rather than directly in companies. City of London expects about two-thirds of unit holders to take up the offer, after which new investors are likely to be invited to subscribe for more shares. The unit and investment trusts will be run in parallel, and there may be arrangements for easy switching between the two funds.</p>

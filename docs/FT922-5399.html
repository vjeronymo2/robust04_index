			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: Treasury set to reclaim Pounds 1.6bn A DISASTER it may be for Docklands, but some may be licking their lips at the possibility that the planned extension of the Jubilee Line may be abandoned. The Treasury will insist that the Pounds 1.6bn of government funds allocated to the project must be handed back if it is not used. London Underground and British Rail will nevertheless be keen to apply the cash to other projects. The 10-mile Jubilee Line from central London to Docklands and Stratford is the biggest single infrastructure project in the Department of Transport's budget. The prospect now arises that the Pounds 1.6bn could be made available to undertake one of the many other badly needed transport projects awaiting funds. One contender would certainly be British Rail. Desperately strapped for cash because of the effects of recession on its fare income and property profits, it has recently had to freeze all investment other than in projects already under way. A windfall of Pounds 1.6bn would easily cover the cost of buying a new fleet of trains for Network SouthEast's Kent Coast services (Pounds 700m), rebuilding the entire London-Glasgow line and replacing all its trains (Pounds 750m), or carrying through the massive redevelopment planned for King's Cross (Pounds 1bn). It might even form a contribution to the Pounds 4bn needed to build the long-delayed rail link between London and the Channel tunnel. Perhaps a stronger contender, since the Jubilee Line is a London Underground project, would be London Underground itself. It has several projects awaiting funds. The top priority is the upgrading of the existing network, followed by the construction of two new lines to relieve congestion in central London. They are the east-west CrossRail and the north-south Chelsea-Hackney line. Given any choice in the matter, London Underground would have given all of those higher priority than the Jubilee Line extension. That choice was taken away when the private sector agreed to help pay for the Jubilee Line provided the project was brought forward in the queue. The question now is whether, with the private-sector contribution absent, the 'natural' order of priorities will be restored. A deferral of the Jubilee Line project is quite possible, but the result is unlikely to be a bonanza for other public-transport users for at least two reasons. One is the Treasury's parsimony. Negotiations over the annual public spending round are always tough, but will be even tougher this year, as the Pounds 1.6bn was ring-fenced from other Underground expenditure in being specifically allocated to the Jubilee Line. Even if it were not, it would be unlikely to find its way straight into another transport project. Transport infrastructure is notoriously slow to plan and build. Ten years is the typical span from conception to completion. Much as London Underground and British Rail would like to spend Pounds 1.6bn in the next three years, they could not do so because they would be unable to bring sufficient projects forward at such short notice. The clock, as well as the Treasury, is against them.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            LONDON TRANSPORT FIXED-ASSET INVESTMENT (Pounds m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       1990-91  1991-92  1992-93**  1993-94**  1994-95**                      forecast                      outturn     plan      plan      plan Core business          587       559        732       849        864 Jubilee Line extn       40       101        393       614        454 CrossRail                7         9         74        92         99 TOTAL                  634       669      1,199     1,555      1,417  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures include investment in Docklands Light Railway; ** adjusted using GDP inflator  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / UN forces may quit Sarajevo: Peacekeeping role in doubt as rival Bosnian factions step up violence UNITED NATIONS peacekeepers threatened to pull out of Sarajevo yesterday following several days of heavy bombardment in and around the Bosnian capital. Mr Mik Magnusson, the UN spokesman in the city, said the UN could not go on with its peacekeeping activities indefinitely if this level of violence continued. 'There comes a time when we have to assess the situation. I guess that time comes now,' he told reporters. The upsurge in violence caused the UN on Tuesday night to suspend humanitarian aid flights into the airport for three days. Fighting has intensified as Moslems attempt to break the four-month siege of the city by Serb irregular forces. The opposing sides have thrown tanks, rockets and artillery into fierce battles. The UN warning coincided with increasing confusion inside the US and other western governments about how to end the bloodshed in Bosnia-Hercegovina. President George Bush said yesterday that he did not rule out some form of US military intervention but that he would not commit US forces 'to a battle' until he knew 'what's the beginning, what's the objective, how's the objective going to be achieved, and what's the end'. But Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, said last night the defence forces of Bosnia should be armed and provided with military aid to prevent 'an even greater catastrophe'. Mr John Major, the prime minister, has ruled out military intervention. The US yesterday called for an extraordinary session of the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Commission, to 'examine the dangerous deterioration of the human rights situation in the former Yugoslavia'. The US also said it wanted evidence of any 'war crimes' to be collected and given to the UN Security Council. The US moves follow claims and counter-claims about the existence of Serb, Moslem and Croat detention camps in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, yesterday dismissed as 'propaganda' reports that the Serbs were holding, executing and torturing tens of thousands of Moslems and Croats in concentration camps. But Bosnian Moslems and Croats forced to flee their homes after Serb forces attacked them claim the Serbs run 45 detention camps holding at least 70,000 people. Serbs claim the Moslems and Croats are holding about 40,000 in the same number of camps. Mr Karadzic said the International Committee of the Red Cross was 'welcome at any time' to visit the camps, which he said housed prisoners-of-war.

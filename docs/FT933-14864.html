			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Europa poised to move back into the black EUROPA MINERALS, the UK mining finance house which has been refinanced and restructured, broke even in the opening quarter. And it will return to pre-tax profit for the first time since 1989 in the half year to July 30, said Sir David Hardy, chairman, at the annual meeting. He would not forecast the full-year result and said Europa, which has gold and coal mining interests in Australia as well as drawing royalties from North Sea and Indonesian oil, had a long way to go before paying dividends. Sir David confirmed that consideration was being given to a three-sided restructuring to pull together Europa and Austmin, the small Australian mining company which is Europa's main shareholder with 19.8 per cent, and Burmine, the Australian gold producer of which Europa holds 41.8 per cent. This would result in a group with a market capital of about ADollars 40m, quoted and with interests primarily in Australia but also with a London listing. This would 'make it more simple for shareholders to see what they own.' But Sir David stressed that any restructuring would be very complex to work out, and was 'an idea being explored, no more than that.' An 8 per cent stake in Europa, left with Australian sub-underwriters after a poorly-received rights issue of shares a year ago, was acquired recently by Mt Edon, another small Australian gold group backed by Swiss money. Henry Ansbacher, the merchant bank which underwrote the issue, was left with 12.8 per cent of Europa. Mr Edward Schneider of Ansbacher said it was being treated as a long-term investment.</p>

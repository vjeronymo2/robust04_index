			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Forced resignation clouds Scots agency Just over two weeks before a parliamentary inquiry into the operations of Scottish Enterprise, the economic development network for central and southern Scotland, the chief executive of one of its local enterprise companies has been forced to resign. Mr Charles Fairley has quit his role at Scottish Enterprise Tayside, the local enterprise company based in Dundee, over his links with a company involved in commercial dealings with the Lec. Recently, Scottish Enterprise - set up in 1991 to replace the Scottish Development Agency - has faced heavy criticism, particularly over dealings between Lecs, the employer-led local economic regeneration bodies, and companies in which the Lecs' non-executive directors are involved. Although Scottish Enterprise National, the parent body, has found no evidence of impropriety, these criticisms prompted an inquiry by the Commons Scottish select committee which will begin next month. Mr Fairley's resignation concerns an attempt by Scottish Enterprise Tayside to assist Laser Ecosse, a laser company bought by its management from Ferranti International. The Lec commissioned another laser specialist, Medical Laser Technologies, to assess Laser Ecosse's prospects and later proposed that both the Lec and MLT should take stakes in Laser Ecosse. Although Mr Fairley is non- executive chairman of MLT and had earlier disclosed this to the Lec's board, he did not alert them to the conflict of interest at the time decisions over Laser Ecosse were made. Late last year Laser Ecosse rejected an investment in it by MLT, and later the Lec decided independently not to proceed in association with MLT. Laser Ecosse restarted talks with the Lec excluding both MLT and Mr Fairley. The Lec board called in Scottish Enterprise National, which employs Mr Fairley. On Thursday night Scottish Enterprise National announced Mr Fairley's resignation. Last night Scottish Enterprise said that the case was the first of the many it had investigated in which 'procedural irregularities' had been found. He Mr Fairley is the second chief executive of a Lec to resign. Last August Mr Paul Pettigrew, chief executive of Dumfries and Galloway Enterprise, another Lec, left after an investigation into his management.</p>

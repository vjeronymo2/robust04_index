			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Politicians, Which Have Been </F> Appointed To Assess Feasibility of Various Coalitions, Seek To  Achieve Succinct Government Agreement"]    [Excerpt] De Vriess of the PvdA [Labor Party], Van Aardenne  of the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], and Vis  of the D66 [Democrats 66], appointed by the crown to assess  possibilities for forming a government, are seeking to achieve a  succinct government agreement. This would be confined to  difficult questions which could quickly trip up a "purple" [the  VVD, the PvdA, and the D66] government, a spokesman for the  three "investigators" indicated yesterday.    PvdA leader Kok also called for a "succinct, but solid"  government pact outlining the basic ideas. "We must not be too  restrictive, but we must impede the political parties from using  the government agreement for their own purposes."    Kok wants to see "a unifying line" in the government  agreement in order to "restore confidence in democracy." He  believes there is an urgent need for this due to the  "fragmentation, protest votes, and votes supposedly out of  self-interest" during the elections for the Second Chamber.    De Vries, Van Aardenne, and Vis believe they will be able to  get down to serious negotiations on the formation of a "purple"  government on Thursday [19 May]. Major stumbling blocks will  have to be tackled immediately, such as the future of social  security, the extent of cutbacks, and the situation surrounding  residing aliens.    Moreover, they believe it will be clear within about two  weeks whether there is any chance of the parties reaching an  agreement and therefore if there is any purpose in pursuing the  negotiations.    Beginning this week, the three "investigators" will try to  reach an agreement on the method of working during subsequent  weeks. This involves deciding on the order in which subjects  are to be discussed. Another question is whether the three  party leaders involved in the negotiations can be accompanied by  party experts in particular fields.    Yesterday, the "investigators" discussed this with party  leaders Kok and Bolkestein (VVD); today they are to meet with  D66 leader Van Mierlo.    Kok has recommended first assessing all the problems. He  finds that methodology better than always taking one subject at  a time and sticking with it until the end. He sees the most  important question as being the promotion of job opportunities  "at a social cost which is fairly distributed." He has also  cited the environment and law and order as major subjects.    The VVD party has decided to set up two working groups that  will provide negotiator Bolkestein with files on subjects to be  discussed at the negotiations. One working group will  concentrate on financial and economic affairs, and the other on  remaining matters.</p>

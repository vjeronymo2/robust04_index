			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 9 Feb (AFP-NA) -- After introducing a  controversial amendment, the Brazilian Senate today gave final  approval to a quadripartite agreement with Argentina, the IAEA  (International Atomic Energy Agency), and the ABAC  (Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of  Nuclear Material).    The document was approved after inclusion of the  supplemental  adjustments [ajustes subsidiarios] that already had been  negotiated by Itamaraty and IAEA, which were imposed by senators  who even threatened to reject the project.    The adjustments will preserve Brazilian technological  secrets, but will permit special ABAC and IAEA inspections of  any nuclear materials produced by Brazil.    Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who was fully satisfied with  the agreement, will be able to travel to Bonn -- he will leave  on 21 February on an official visit to Germany -- without  fearing that his interlocutors may threaten to adopt retaliatory  measures, which would have been likely had Brazil failed to  ratify the agreement.    A report indicated that ABAC is making an inventory of  Argentine and Brazilian nuclear facilities and materials, and  the IAEA will make an inspection in the two countries within the  next 60 days.    For Brazil, the ratification was something totally new  because the country had never ratified a nuclear safeguard  agreement.    The quadripartite agreement is broader than the Tlatelolco  Treaty, which includes all Latin American countries. The voting  on the ratification of this treaty had been postponed (perhaps  for today or a date after Carnival).    Today's debate, which lasted more than two hours, developed  after a Senate request for an amendment, which was finally  approved and establishes that "all changes to supplemental  adjustments will be approved by Congress."</p>

The new year 1994, which all our people have greeted with  faith and optimism, is a meaningful year that will be recorded  as a brilliant page in the annals of our revolution and  socialist construction.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught in his New  Year's  address: The new year 1994 is a revolutionary turning point  when our country's socialist construction will enter a new  developmental stage, as well as a year of worthwhile struggle in  which the entire party, the entire Army, and all the people will  be mobilized to effect a great revolutionary upsurge in all  fronts.    All our party members and working people are now faced with  the honorable and responsible task to make the new year 1994 a  historical turning point for our country's revolution and  construction by upholding and vigorously struggling to implement  the militant tasks presented by the great leader in his New  Year's address.    The road ahead is bright, but rough, because we have to  overcome many obstacles and difficulties. The international  environment for our revolution is very complex and tense and we  are now building socialism in acute confrontation with the enemy.    Thus, we should further increase the country's political,  economic, and military strength by completely implementing the  revolutionary line of independence, self-reliance, and  self-defense and by vigorously carrying out the three  revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- in  accordance with the prevailing situation and the demand of our  developing revolution, as the great leader elucidated in his New  Year's address.    The complete implementation of our party's revolutionary  economic strategy is more important than anything else in making  this year a revolutionary turning point for our country's  socialist construction to enter a new developmental stage.    Our party's revolutionary economic strategy presented at the  21st plenary session of the party's Sixth Central Committee held  last year is the most just and most revolutionary line for  consolidating the country's independent economic base and for  improving the people's living standard in accordance with the  demand of socialism.    When we completely implement this strategy, we can  demonstrate the might of socialism of our own style more  vigorously and can occupy a new attack position to reach a  higher ground of socialism. It is important for us to adhere to  the agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first  policy this year. Above all, we have to concentrate great  efforts on developing agriculture.    This year is a meaningful year, which marks the 30th  anniversary of the presentation of the socialist rural theses.  We should vigorously carry out the struggle to fulfill the  historic tasks of the rural theses so we can make a new turning  point in developing our rural economy. To achieve this, we  should consolidate results of irrigation and electrification in  rural areas, realize mechanization and scientization at a high  level, and completely implement the chuche farming method. By  doing so, we should develop all agricultural sectors, including  grain production.    The working class should produce more farming materials --  such as tractors, trucks [chadongcha], modern farm machines,  chemical fertilizer, and agricultural chemicals -- and send them  to rural areas.    Cooperative farmers and all agricultural working people  should do farming work in a frugal and tenacious manner with an  attitude worthy of masters who are responsible for the country's  rice supply so they can achieve the party's high goal of grain  production without fail.    It is also important for us to direct efforts to develop  the light industry. We must adopt positive measures to improve  and reinforce light industry factories, modernize them, and  increase the production of chemical fibers, synthetic resin, and  other materials for light industry. In this way, we should  operate all the light industry factories at full capacity and  maintain a high and steady rate of production. These are  important militant tasks for the light industry this year.    The heavy industry, by thoroughly carrying out militant  tasks  arising before them, must produce various kinds of consumer  goods in large quantities, increase their variety, and improve  their quality radically.    Increasing foreign trade is one of our important tasks. In  order to adapt foreign trade to the changed circumstances and  develop it, we must cultivate new foreign markets in every  possible way and build up an unquestionable reputation. We must  strengthen the bases for the production of export goods in many  sectors of the national economy, increase their production, and  improve their quality. All sectors and regions must further  boost exports by exploring and using the resources for exports  and also develop improvement trade [kagong muyok].    In order to mark this year as a revolutionary upturn in  construction and revolution, it is very important to give top  priority to the coal and electric power industries, and rail  transport--the leading sectors of the national economy--and to  consistently develop the metal industry.    In order to develop agriculture and light industry and to  accelerate the country's overall economic construction, we must  put efforts into the coal, electric power, and metal industries  and find a better solution to the problem of rail transport.    In order to triumphantly implement tasks of the economic  construction to mark this year as a revolutionary upturn in  construction and revolution, all economic sectors and units of  the national economy must launch a vigorous campaign for  increased production and conservation as a mass movement. All  economic functionaries must organize economic work and direct  production efficiently in accordance with the party's economic  strategy. Upholding our party's policy of cultural revolution,  our intellectuals must strive devotedly to make new advances in  all fields of developing socialist culture. This year, too, we  must put efforts into strengthening the country's defense power  by upholding the leadership of our supreme command leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il.    What is most important in vigorously pushing ahead with  construction and revolution is all the more strengthening the  single-hearted unity among the leader [suryong], the party, and  the masses and highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and hard struggle.    Our single-hearted unity is firmly hardened behind the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. All party members and working  people should uphold, safeguard, and protect the leader  [yongdoja] with the faithful single-hearted unity, acknowledge  the justness of the leader's [yongdoja] idea and lines, and  thoroughly carry them out under any circumstances. By doing so,  the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks will be  cemented rock-solid under the leadership of the party and, with  its might, the cause of the socialism of our own style will be  vigorously pushed ahead.    The spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle is a  traditional struggle spirit for our people who are doing  revolutionary work and a revolutionary banner of triumphantly  building socialism of our own style. "Let us vigorously  accelerate the general march of socialism in the revolutionary  spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle," this is the call of  our party and the militant slogan our people must uphold today.  Only when we march forward with this slogan can we resolutely  safeguard and protect the socialism of our own style, smashing  the imperialists and reactionaries' all sorts of maneuvers of  obstruction and challenges. We can also solve the problems  arising in the socialist construction with our own power under  all difficult conditions.    We, as in the days of the great Chollima upsurge after the  war, should effect a new upsurge in the socialist construction  by overcoming difficulties, upholding the revolutionary spirit  of self-reliance and hard struggle. In doing so, we should  brilliantly adorn this year as a year of revolutionary upturn in  which our country's socialist construction enters a new  developing stage.</p>

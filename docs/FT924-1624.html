			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour leaders pressed on Europe PRESSURE ON the Labour leadership to take a more overtly pro-Europe stance came last night from 85 of the party's MPs who urged 'the rapid completion' of the Maastricht treaty's ratification. The move by senior figures, including Mr Neil Kinnock, the former leader, will increase the pressure on Mr John Smith, his successor, not to take any action that would block or hinder the treaty's progress when it returns to the Commons next year. It was designed to counter the tactics of a significant minority of anti-Maastricht Labour MPs and other Labour Euro-sceptics. Other signatories of the pro-Maastricht 'early day motion', included Mr Roy Hattersley, former deputy leader, Mr Gerald Kaufman, former shadow foreign secretary, and Mr Peter Mandelson, the party's former communications director who is now MP for Hartlepool. The carefully worded motion notes how the European socialist leaders' meeting in Edinburgh last weekend backed 'the rapid completion of the ratification of the Maastricht treaty and its implementation'. That, the motion says, is 'in accordance' with Labour policy and it calls on the government to endorse the social chapter in the treaty, 'so that passage of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill can receive the wholehearted support of both sides of the House (of Commons) at the earliest opportunity'. Meanwhile, the party's post-election revamp took a further step forward yesterday when the ruling national executive agreed to cut headquarters spending by a third and to set up an independent 'social justice commission'. Mr Smith will announce today the membership of the Social Justice Commission, dubbed the 'new Beveridge', which will report on Britain's tax and benefit system. It comes as Mr Smith received a warning from Mr Hattersley that Labour had to develop policies to excite the electorate  - and not depend on the government's continuing misfortune. The commission will be chaired by Sir Gordon Borrie, former director-general of fair trading, and run by the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research. Not all its members will be Labour supporters. The national executive committee discussed the commission only briefly yesterday but spent much of a five-hour meeting debating spending cuts forced by the fall in party membership and in donations from unions. A report by the party's finance committee was not formally approved but a Labour official said the NEC had agreed the thrust of its recommendations: that spending on day-to-day running of the party will have to be cut by 30 per cent in 1993 to about Pounds 8m. Numbers employed at Labour's headquarters will fall from a peak of 120 to 90. Many of the jobs have already gone since the general election but the NEC wants a review of the party's management structure and has not ruled out compulsory redundancies. There are also to be consultations on proposals to cut the number of Labour party regions in England from nine to either six or seven. Meanwhile, Mr Hattersley said Labour should stand by its commitment to creating a more equal society. It should not shy away from advocating an increase in income tax for those with above-average earnings, he said. While distancing himself from recent criticism within the party of Mr Smith, Mr Hattersley said the time had come to open a second front. He warned that Labour would not win the next election by relying on a combination of dissatisfaction with the Tories, the class-interest of the lower income groups and support for the party's new-found political responsibility.</p>

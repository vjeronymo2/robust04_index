			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Urban inflation rate at 17% as retail sales rise 25.4% SURGING retail sales and accelerating cost of living increases have underscored the need for China to take urgent steps to cool an overheated economy. Economic data released yesterday, two days after China raised interest rates in an effort to calm activity, show that in April urban inflation touched 17 per cent on an annualised basis and retail sales leapt by 25.4 per cent compared with 1992. The April cost of living figures, which confirm that inflation has entered a strong upward spiral, are certain to strengthen the hands of those in the Chinese leadership arguing for tougher measures to bring the economy under control. This week's ominous news for China's leaders also coincides with the release at the weekend of trade figures for the four months to April which show imports up 24.7 per cent, while exports rose just 7.7 per cent. China's trade deficit swelled in the first four months to Dollars 1.77bn, reversing an almost unbroken sequence of monthly surpluses since 1990 in the wake of the 1988 tough import curbs. The 17 per cent inflation figure recorded in China's 35 larger cities to April compares with 15.7 per cent in the first quarter. Western economists in Beijing say that the leadership cannot afford to ignore dangers posed by the strengthening inflationary trend. Some officials are sceptical about measures adopted thus far, including the less than 1 percentage point increase in bank lending rates announced on Friday.</p>

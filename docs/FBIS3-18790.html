			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Threadbare Over Europe"] </F>   [Text] Exciting things were happening in Brussels  yesterday. Austria, Finland and Sweden having agreed membership  terms last week, the pressure from foreign ministers of the  European Union [EU] was on Norway to overcome its remaining  objections. As those difficult negotiations continued, Poland's  foreign minister joined Hungary's in announcing that his  government would shortly be applying for membership of the EU.    Set beside these stirring events, Douglas Hurd's speech in  the Belgian capital was that of a European minimalist. True,  the Foreign Secretary made plenty of valid points. The EU must  be careful not to over-legislate and must keep the principle of  subsidiarity in the foreground: pretty rich advice from a  Government that is not only strong on legislation but happy to  usurp the role of local government. There was much emphasis on  strict financial controls and the prevention of fraud; and,  finally, a not-so-ringing conclusion that true European vision  in 1994 lies in having a truce on rhetoric, making a success of  what has already been agreed, and extending that success to  other parts of Europe.    The explanation for Mr Hurd's approach is simple. He was  engaged in the impossible task of sustaining Britain's place "at  the heart of Europe" while placating the right wing of the  Conservative Party, a circle that cannot be squared. What he  said was intended to sound constructive, yet at the same time  sternly critical. Above all, it was an implicit attack on those  who maintain that the EU must be constantly adapting its role  and its institutions as the world changes around it.    Coming as it did at a moment when future change was the  topic  of the hour, his argument seemed politically wrong in tone as  well as intellectually threadbare. When the union is facing  enlargement to 15 or 16 members, and coming to terms with the  importance of admitting East European applicants earlier than  previously envisaged, there is little logic in suggesting that  consolidation and good management are the top priority.    If Mr Hurd's speech, coupled with Michael Heseltine's recent  attack on "Euro-sclerosis," provide an accurate sample of the  Conservative platform for elections to the European Parliament  in June, the omens for Tory candidates are not good. Once again  the party will be seen to be cool towards the EU's institutional  framework. The result is likely to be not just lost seats but  -- to Continental eyes at least -- a further distancing of the  Government itself from the whole European enterprise.    That kind of marginalisation weakens Britain's voice within  the EU, and so diminishes this country's perceived weight in the  eyes of the world -- and especially in the United States and  Japan. If John Major genuinely wishes Britain to achieve its  full diplomatic potential within the councils of Europe, he must  decide which is more important: Britain's clout in the world,  or appeasing the Europhobe wing of his party.</p>

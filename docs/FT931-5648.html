			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Bundesbank ignores appeals and leaves rates unchanged THE Bundesbank yesterday ignored foreign and domestic appeals for help to escape recession and left its important short-term interest rates unchanged. Despite more gloomy economic news and complaints from Germany's 16 regional economics ministers, the central bank council decided it was too soon for more cuts. The decision not to ease policy surprised some foreign exchange dealers, and the D-Mark made small gains against European currencies. The French franc fell below FFr3.40 to the D-Mark at one stage yesterday, closing in London at FFr3.398. A month ago the Bundesbank cut the discount and Lombard rates to 8 per cent and 9 per cent respectively after new turbulence in the European exchange rate mechanism put the Danish krone under pressure. In the absence of similar pressures this time the council reverted to its usual caution. It may have been influenced partly by a government announcement of an increase in oil and petrol taxes, notionally to fund the restructuring of the railways. Inflation, currently 4.2 per cent, remains the bank's principal concern. Its medium-term aim of bringing the rate of price increases down to 2 per cent, aided by several modest wage agreements this year, is now being hampered by government policy. Import prices, which have fallen steadily in the last few months, are now 2.2 per cent lower than a year ago, the statistics office reported yesterday.

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Japanese employees find it pays to stop smoking JAPANESE companies have found the perfect way to persuade workers to stop smoking - pay them. Even though Japanese are among the heaviest smokers in the industrialised world, some companies have found their employees are ready to stop the habit in return for a little extra cash in their pay packets. The Ministry of Health and Welfare is so impressed with the results that it has published a report praising the companies' efforts and encouraging others to follow suit. The ministry's star performer is Yoshioka Kogyo, a machine tool company, which started its no-smoking campaign in 1968 after the chairman fell seriously ill and decided to stop smoking himself. None of the 44 staff now smokes at work or anywhere else. They receive bonuses of between Y7,000 (Dollars 56) and Y40,000 (Dollars 320) a month. The payments increase with seniority, perhaps because older workers are considered to be under greater pressure than younger colleagues. The company says four or five people went back to smoking about six years ago. But their co-workers persuaded them to stop. Nabitasu, an engineering company with 124 employees, found that monthly bonuses of Y3,000 a head were not enough. So last December it introduced a Y100,000 one-off payment to any smoker who signed a pledge to give up cigarettes. Half the 50 smokers immediately put away their Mild Sevens, Japan's most popular brand. Only one went back on his word and had to return the money. Chuetsu Tekko, a building company, introduced its bonus last year. It offered to pay Y10m towards any project chosen by the 60 employees if they gave up smoking. All but eight stopped and Chuetsu is now building a company holiday house. Companies say they benefit from the schemes as much as their workers. Nihon Densan, a maker of electrical machines, obliges employees who have signed the pledge to wear 'no-smoker' badges once they give up. It says that as well as improving the health of its staff, the no-smoking campaign has cut the risk of fires and boosted the company's image. So-called 'image-up' measures are important to Japanese companies, particularly small businesses and others which find recruitment difficult. A no-smoking campaign may be just enough to catch the eye of a potential recruit. Some 36 per cent of adult Japanese smoke, but the Japanese are health-conscious and anti-smoking campaigns are slowly gathering force. Last month ministers gave up smoking during cabinet meetings for a week to mark a World No-Smoking Day organised by the World Health Organisation. However, they were not paid for their self-discipline.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Algoma seeks capital for CDollars 500m upgrade Algoma Steel, saved from collapse in mid-1992 at the height of the recession and now solidly profitable, plans to recapitalise to pave the way for a CDollars 500m (USDollars 373m) investment programme. Algoma wants to complete modernisation before the next cyclical steel downturn arrives, said Mr Allan Hopkins, president. Mr Hopkins said the recapitalisation would focus on Algoma's preferred capital, debt structure and future sources of external finance. He would not comment on industry suggestions that Algoma's seamless tube plant may be put up for sale. Algoma, based in Sault Ste Marie, Ontario, specialises in sheet, tube and plate. It was formerly controlled by Dofasco, Canada's leading steelmaker, but is now widely held. The employees, in return for pay concessions in 1992, will own 60 per cent of the existing equity by 1997. In the first half Algoma earned CDollars 49.2m, or Dollars 1.87 a share, on revenues of CDollars 528m.</p>

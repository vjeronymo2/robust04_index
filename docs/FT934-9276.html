			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Why we cannot just 'go it alone' My articles attempting to persuade people that there is more danger of deficient than of excess demand have contained one deliberate omission. They have not called for slashing reductions in interest rates, irrespective of what other countries do, and irrespective of what happens to sterling. Instead they have concentrated on the need for a change of priorities at the international level in both the 'summit' Group of Seven countries and the European Community. As far as UK domestic policy is concerned, they have focused on the case against taking risks with the recovery by piling on net tax increases over and above the quite large imposts already left behind by the former chancellor, Norman Lamont, for implementation next year and beyond. This emphasis has been there partly because the main sources of deficient demand are outside the UK - they are particularly to be found in continental Europe and Japan. There is an unnecessarily large gap between output and capacity in most places. But it is at least possible that in the UK the gap may be near to stabilising, while in other areas it is getting wider all the time. Another reason for not joining the ultra-cheap money bandwagon is that its members exaggerate the extent to which an individual medium-sized country can 'go it alone' in interest rate policy and ignore the consequences for the exchange rate. Nothing could be more misleading than the belief of the Tory loony wing that the price of sterling is no more important than the price of tomatoes. While a big change in the price of tomatoes might at most lead to related changes in the prices of lettuce and cucumbers, the exchange rate is the main link between one country's price level and that of its trading partners. It is true that the 1992 British devaluation, following the departure from the ERM, had a smaller inflationary impact than many analysts expected and that the UK has since had a faster rate of growth than its European partners. But these events may have given a highly misleading impression of the scope for a single country to decide policy on purely domestic criteria. The 1992 devaluation was a one-off event, taking place when downward pressures on inflation and activity were exceptionally severe worldwide. Indeed the governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, came to the conclusion that, at the original ERM entry parity, the UK 'might have actually had falling prices'. Instead the UK has had an underlying inflation rate of 3 per cent, which will show an upward blip in coming months, but which the Bank hopes will return to 3 per cent by 1995. What applies to a single devaluation in exceptionally favourable circumstances would not apply to a policy of repeated depreciation. Even in the present depressed world economy, it will not be possible to absorb nearly as much of the effects of another devaluation in importers' margins, or in the margins of foreign goods competing with British ones in international trade, as it was last time round. There is, moreover, a tendency to exaggerate the scope for purely national interest rate policies, even under a regime of flexible exchange rates. Short-term real interest rates are then indeed freer to vary between countries for temporary periods. But this is much less true of long-term real interest rates or even of average short-term ones over a period. The fact is that, in a world of free capital markets, real long-term interest rates tend to converge. This is a more fundamental sense of 'not being able to buck the market' than Lady Thatcher had in mind in her famous remark after she stopped her chancellor shadowing the D-Mark in 1988. In a single free capital market, there will be one prevailing long-term real rate of interest. This long-term rate can be regarded as either the prevailing long bond rate or the expected average of short-term interest rates, appropriately discounted. These two measures must be consistent with each other; otherwise there would be easy profits to be made from moving from short to long-term fixed interest securities, or vice versa. In practice, nominal bond rates in different countries are not, of course, identical. But an individual country's can differ from the going international rate - default risks apart - only by a currency premium or discount, reflecting the expected appreciation or depreciation of the currency against other main currencies. The expected movement of a currency will, over a sufficient period of years, in its turn mainly reflect expected inflation differentials. Thus, long-term interest rates in the UK can only be lower than those in Germany if the expected inflation rate is lower. This is clearly not the market's expectation. UK 10-year bonds yield nearly 1 percentage point more in the UK than in Germany, despite all the British base rate cuts. French bond yields have, however, virtually closed the gap with German ones. It is true that US bond yields are about half a percentage point lower still  -more likely reflecting market belief in a temporary undershooting of the dollar than that US inflation will fall behind that of France and Germany. The country where nominal bond rates are decisively below the international average is Japan - which reflects optimistic expectations both about yen appreciation and Japanese inflation. What flexible exchange rates permit is temporary variations in either direction in real short-term rates. In some circumstances, this may be a valuable degree of freedom; but it is, of course, limited. For a country, such as the UK, trying to stabilise its currency after decades of inflation and depreciation, the choice is illustrated in the first chart. If it could carry out a successful domestic monetary policy, the result might look like the line marked 'successful floating'. There would be periods - say during domestic recession - when real short-term interest rates would be lower than elsewhere. There would be other periods, say after a burst of credit liberalisation such as the UK experienced in the mid-1980s, when its rates would be higher. There would be corresponding fluctuations in the exchange rate; but over the long term there would be little trend one way or the other against the currency of a country with stable prices. Even if those in charge of monetary policy never looked at the exchange rate and only at domestic monetary variables, success in their policies would ensure that the exchange rate followed a horizontal trend, despite short-term variations on either side. A flexible rate can thus provide no more than an opportunity for a temporary deviation from the international real interest rate norm. For instance American short-term real interest rates could be well below those of western Europe in 1992-93 because the dollar was regarded as depressed and likely to recover. This temporary deviation may have been useful, as was the UK move to lower short-term interest rates after September 1992. But there was no way either country could indefinitely run a programme of real interest rates below prevailing international levels. If you look at the gap between US and German real interest rates over the years, the differential went first one way and then the other, with a tendency to balance out over the years. The risks of going it alone should now be pretty clear. For in the situation shown in the chart it would be terribly tempting for the UK - or another European country suffering from go-it-alone temptations - to let its exchange rate slide just that fatal bit too long (as in the mid-1980s). Its rulers are unlikely to know enough about monetary relationships to tighten up in time. But a consequence of delay in taking corrective action is that inflationary expectations become reinforced, and high costs entrenched. After that the transitional output and job costs of bringing the exchange rate up to the horizontal line will seem to be (and will be) too high. Thus there will be strong pressures to tread the path of inflation and depreciation shown by the diagonal line. A more constructive, if at present unfashionable, route to a monetary policy for non-inflationary growth would be through resumed international co-operation. The most hopeful path is neither to go back to reconstructing the ERM and constructing Emu as if nothing had happened. Nor is it to build co-operation around inflation targets alone, as the Bank of England sometimes hints. A better path would be to have a concerted policy towards nominal demand, at least at a European level, and preferably taking in the G7 as well. By far the best place to begin would be with the European Monetary Institute due to start in January in Frankfurt under Alexandre Lamfalussy. The official British desire to confine and limit the role of the Institute is narrow-minded and counterproductive. If Europe is to be less dependent on a single anchor country such as Germany - which is now less able to play that role - the EMI is its best bet, whether it develops into a European central bank or has to settle for something less glamorous but still playing a vital role.</p>

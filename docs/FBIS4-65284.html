			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Josef Joffe editorial: "The Chancellor's Informal Address </F> for `Boris'"]    [Text] Which memories can be merged? The blending in the  melting pot of goodwill is not all that simple, as both Helmut  Kohl and Boris Yeltsin have had to find out. The chancellor was  not invited to Normandy by the three Western powers to celebrate  the 50th anniversary of the invasion. And the Russian president  is not allowed to celebrate the withdrawal of his troops in a  joint ceremony with the three protecting powers in Berlin.    Kohl has made a wise decision regarding the Berlin question  -- same day, same place: yes; together: no. And that is right,  since the Russians must not be lumped together with the  Americans, the British, and the French. Admittedly, they all  liberated Germany from the Nazis -- and for the Russians this  involved enormous sacrifices -- but afterwards the Western  powers and the Soviets played such different roles that honoring  them in a joint ceremony would be "revaluing all values."    The Red Army brought freedom to the Germans, the Europeans  --  and shortly afterwards it took it away again from those in the  East: There, brown [Nazi] totalitarianism was replaced by the  red variety. The Western powers protected freedom -- in West  Germany and West Berlin at least. What would have become of  West Berlin if the West had not counteracted the blockade (which  ended almost exactly 45 years ago) so courageously? If the  western part of the city had been incorporated into the Soviet  zone, European history would have taken a different course,  although not a better one.    Noting this difference instead of covering it up has nothing  to do with discrimination or downgrading, but with the  self-confidence of a state that is committed to freedom. And  with gratitude: Yeltsin's predecessors were the occupiers, the  Western powers were the defenders, and they will remain our  allies. To honor these two in a joint ceremony would be just as  doubtful historically and morally as would attempts at  fraternizing in Normandy, where one side remembers its victory  and the other its defeat -- unless a German chancellor can make  himself celebrate the event as the beginning of liberation,  without any ifs or buts.    Not all memories blend well, and anyone covering up the past  will be unable to cope with the future. And the future of  Germans and Russians must be dealt with today -- before the last  occupier has left the country. The German-Russian past was not  a good one: When they were not getting at each other's throats  -- see World Wars I and II -- they very often made deals with  one another at the expense of their neighbors -- see the various  divisions of Poland, Bismarck's help against the Polish uprising  of 1863/64, [the Treaty of] Rapallo, and the 1939 Hitler-Stalin  Pact, which made it easy for Hitler to start World War II.    Relations were hardly ever stable, but what is needed now  are  relations characterized by responsibility. Strategically  speaking, things are easier for the Germans now than they have  been in 50 years: They are "surrounded" by friends only,  separated from the Russian military force that no longer camps  in the heart of Europe, but 1,500 kilometers to the east. And  the GDR pressure spot, which warned Bonn not to misbehave for  decades and strained its Western connection, has also  disappeared.    Today, Germany is freer vis-a-vis Moscow than ever, but it  is  not free from responsibility. Russia is as much a burden on  Europe as ever, but the problem is no longer expansion, but  explosion. Yeltsin's demand to be addressed formally by the rest  of the world shows an almost paranoid insecurity. Of course,  politics cannot be reduced to psychiatry, but this is where  Germany's entirely new difficulties start.    To treat a partner as a patient will hardly promote his self  respect; also, you cannot psychoanalyze a nation. What is  getting Russia down -- such as the catastrophic 25 percent fall  in production -- has reasons that are entirely homemade and  which cannot be cured by injecting further billions. On the  other hand, it is not in the West's interest, not to speak of  Germany's, to see the Russian empire go the way of the Hapsburg  and the Ottoman Empires, whose disintegration paved the way for  World War I.    What can be done? Symbolic gestures always help when  self-confidence is down. These include the grand style in which  Bonn has treated "Boris," also the chancellor's friendly,  informal way of addressing Yeltsin, the wise compromise on the  troops' farewell, the installing of a "hot line" between the two  countries, which resumes the famous metaphor coined by Bismarck  who said that the "line to St. Petersburg" must never break off.  If this helps Yeltsin stand up to the Rutskoys and  Zhirinovskiys at home, all the better.    But a responsible German policy must go beyond niceties. "On  the other hand," the chancellor said quite rightly, "we and our  Western partners are expecting Russia to cooperate  constructively in overcoming European and international crises."  This is a warning and a compliment at the same time. The  warning is that Russia should not use its weakness as a stick,  as it used to do with its strength. And the compliment is that  the West wants to have, and honors, Moscow as a partner.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Three infantry battalions for the new army have  already completed training. A ceremony was held in Boane today,  marking the end of the first phase of infantry training. The  ceremony coincided with the close of the course for the third  battalion that had been undergoing training for the past six  weeks. The ceremony was chaired by Tobias Dai and Herminio  Morais, head of the government and Mozambique National  Resistance delegations to the Joint Commission for the Formation  of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, respectively. Also  present at the event was British Ambassador Richard Edis and  other officials. The two other battalions were trained at the  Manhica and Dondo centers. Sources close to the training of the  new army say the new training phase will begin shortly [words  indistinct] before the October elections.</p>

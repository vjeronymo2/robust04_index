			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["International Forum" by Dong Ming (0392 2494): "Sensible </F> Reflection"]    [Text] It seemed to some outsiders that the distortion of  history by Nagano, former justice minister of Japan, was just a  short episode. On 3 May, Shigeto Nagano, who had just taken  office in the new cabinet, openly asserted that the Nanjing  Massacre was a "fabrication," and Japan's aggression against the  Asian countries was aimed at "liberating the colonies." After  such remarks aroused strong protests in the neighboring Asian  countries and also evoked condemnations inside Japan, Nagano was  forced to renounce what he had said, offer an "apology," and  resign from office on 7 May.    Although the Nagano incident came to an end, the discussion  caused by this incident are continuing in Japan. Not only will  the responsibility for this event be further affixed by the  Diet, but the general public in Japan is also reflecting on the  incident. Public opinion around the Nagano incident encapsulates  Japan's attitude toward the historical issues:    First, although the war was over for more than half a  century  ago, people deeply influenced by militarism still exist in a  certain number. Such people have an abnormal mentality. They  are discontented with the current situation and still indulge in  the memory of the "brilliance of the empire" in history.  Although they may openly express repentance, when getting tipsy  they tend to express their true feelings. Nagano was a typical  case.    Second, over a long period of time, Japan regarded its  historical responsibility as "taboo." It did not dare nor want  to touch this issue. A history professor said that Japan was  just trying to evade its responsibility for the war. Only when  it was facing external pressure and international condemnations  would it do something perfunctory to free itself from the  trouble. Some people questioned when Japan would move out of  the cycle of "cabinet members distorting history--Asian  countries protesting--the Japanese Government saying sorry and  the cabinet members resigning." Because Japan cannot face  history squarely, events hurting the feelings of other Asian  peoples happened from time to time. This found expression in  the fact that some war criminals could even become key  government officials in the 1960's as well as the textbook  incident in the early 1980's and the incident of the memorial  ceremony attended by leading government officials in 1985 at  Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine.    Third, some people of insight pointed out: Japan is trying  to seek an "honorable position" in the world, and the key lies  in whether it will win the trust of other Asian countries that  were previously victims of its aggression. The necessary  precondition for winning such trust is Japan's correct approach  to its history. It is now the time that Japan should "totally  repudiate" its past, not only in word but also in action. So  far, Japan's reflection on the war remains "self-centered." It  only stresses that Japan itself was the victim of the war, and  seldom faces squarely the fact that Japan was first of all the  party that did harm to other Asian nations. Yamasaki, author of  the film "Home Watching," said that in order to understand the  feelings of other Asian nations, Japan should show other  nations' films about the Japanese invasion so that the Japanese  people may be educated properly.    On many occasions, Prime Minister Hata recently expressed  the  need to make profound self-criticism of Japan's past. He said  that Japan should be actually aware of the unbearable pain and  misery caused by its aggression and colonial rule, should  correctly approach its past, and should use a correct outlook on  history to educate the younger generations in order to prevent  the repetition of the history. This shows the foresight and  insight of the politicians of the new generation.</p>

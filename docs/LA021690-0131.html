			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SYKES DROPPED FROM BASKETBALL TEAM  </P> <P> John Sykes, Cal State Fullerton's starting center at the beginning of the  season, has been dropped from the team, Fullerton Coach John Sneed said  Thursday.  </P> <P> "John Sykes is through for the year," Sneed said. "He missed the team meeting  yesterday and hasn't been attending study hall."  </P> <P> Sykes had missed six games this season because of disciplinary suspensions or  illness, and had not been expected to play any more this season even if he was  with the team.  </P> <P> "I gave him the benefit of the doubt but he hasn't turned his ways around,"  Sneed said.

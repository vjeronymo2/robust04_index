Among the best-known personalities excluded  are Vittorio Sgarbi, who will however be standing in two other  constituencies, and Berlusconi's spokesman Antonio Tajani.  Berlusconi has expressed his "great displeasure" at being  turned down in Puglia (where he had good hopes), also because,  he admits, "this is due to our technical mistake." But at the  same time Segni's Pact, already drastically reduced in number,  is leaving illustrious victims on the field: In Turin his list  will be unable to participate in the proportional vote for the  lower house, and for this reason will not include former mayor  Giovanna Cattaneo Incisa and Anselmo Zanalda, who was  responsible for the reform of the Popular Party. Also out of  the running, in the race for the Senate, is the "League for  Piedmont" formed from Northern League dissidents. The Communist  Renewal also had reason to be displeased: In Eastern Sicily the  list headed by Secretary Fausto Bertinotti will not compete for  the proportional vote (though Bertinotti himself is also  standing in Rome and Turin). In the meantime the League is  announcing an appeal to the regional administrative tribunal to  have the elections suspended because its appeal against Lazio's  exclusion from the list has been rejected, in its view, "without  motivation."    Forza Italia's failure in Umbria is due to a delay in  informing the Interior Ministry of the substitution of one of  the persons appointed to file the list with the Court of Appeal.  Bitter, because they were convinced they would be readmitted,  are the five excluded candidates: Paolo Cicchini, Sergio  Filipponi, Lanfranco Rosati, Torquato Terracina, and Francesco  Trio. In Puglia, the Forza Italia list was excluded because  more than 750 signatures were reported on "irregular" forms,  that is on paper on which the National Alliance heading had been  struck out by pen and replaced by Forza Italia. In vain,  Berlusconi's representative produced new documents which are in  order: the Court of Appeal stated that "new documents" had to  be "of a clarifying or corrective" nature and not substituting  those judged invalid.    Sgarbi took the decision philosophically; "the only thing  which displeases me is that I will be unable to visit the  splendid monuments in Puglia, and then I am a fatalist, and  hence I do not hide a little bit of relief." Tajani, too, does  not make a drama out of this: "This means that I will carry out  better my job as Berlusconi's spokesman," he observed. On the  other hand, Nicola Colaianni, PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]  deputy and author of the anti-Forza Italia statement, was  delighted: "I was sure," she declared, "because the fraud was  obvious. There were two witnesses ready to confirm that the  signatures had been obtained by the National Alliance and that  the correction had been made afterwards. Moreover, this  demonstrates that the electoral campaign does not live on  advertising spots alone."    On the other hand, Berlusconi's list has been readmitted in  the Marches, for the uninominal constituencies for the lower  house, though candidates must all present themselves under the  Forza Italia symbol, whereas candidates from the CCD [Christian  Democratic Center], the Sgarbi for Italy list, and from the UDC  [Center Union] all disappear. Other persons back again in the  lists, apart from Sgarbi (who is also present in Calabria), are  neurologist and political commentator Antonio Guidi (a frequent  host of the Funari broadcasts of Berlusconi's TV programs),  former CNR [National Research Council] Chairman Luigi Rossi  Bernardi, and industrialist Stefano Clementoni, known as the  "puppet king." In the Marches, on the other hand, appeals were  rejected from the three League members Paolini, Tirabassi, and  Savarese, as well as from Sassaroli (Pannella list) and Giausa  (Communist Renewal).    In Trentino Alto Adige four appeals were rejected, and one  only accepted, that of the ADA (Autonomous Democratic  Aggregation), which had presented too many signatures. The  Court of Cassation wisely considered that the decree  substantially reducing the number of signatures had been  introduced to make life easier for those presenting candidates,  and therefore related only to the minimum number. Which is  probably also why seven out of the eight lists which failed to  make it in Veneto 2 have been reinstated: League, Forza Italia,  PSI [Italian Socialist Party], PPI [Italian Popular Party], the  Communist Renewal, the Autonomous League, and the Pannella List,  whereas the Rete, which had few signatures, has remained outside.    In Trentino, on the other hand, appeals by the progressives  and the AD [Democratic Alliance] were rejected. For the  Democratic Alliance, Marina Salamon has not been allowed onto  the proportional list (too few signatures). Nor has progressive  Maurizio Zeni, whose certificate of registration in the  electoral list arrived too late. Rejected, too, were the appeals  by the Pannella List and the liberal nationalists of the Freedom  Party [Freiheitliche], as their signatures were presented after  the deadline. All the appeals coming from Sardinia were  rejected.</p>

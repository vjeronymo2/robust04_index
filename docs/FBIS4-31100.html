			<p>CSO     [Text] The joint venture initiating the Magyarsat program  will have a starting capital of $50-60 million, which will be  supplemented by international loans. The feasibility plan  anticipates an income of $200 million during the satellite's  11-year life span.    The joint venture founded by the Antenna Hungaria Company  plans to start a satellite program called Magyarsat, we reported  yesterday. The Hungarian regional telecommunication satellite  could insure comprehensive and unified broadcasting and  telecommunication in the region.    According to the plans, the light telecommunication  satellite  of the Amos family, weighing less than 1,000 kg, would be  launched by the French carrier rocket Ariane. Currently in  Europe, apart from international programs, two or three  countries have their own national satellites. There is great  demand on the market for free channels, largely because recently  Eutelsat attempted to launch two new satellites, but the devices  were destroyed. Magyarsat will be insured, so that investors  would suffer no loss because of possible errors in the system.    The range of Magyarsat would completely cover Mid-Central  Europe. Apart from broadcasting satellite television programs,  it would aid business communication. Moreover, because it would  cover the entire country, it could also alleviate telephone  problems in areas which are hard to reach by cable. The control  center of the satellite would be in Hungary, and Hungarian  specialists would be in charge of its technical supervision.  Viewers could receive the television programs using a satellite  dish with a diameter of 70-90 cm.</p>

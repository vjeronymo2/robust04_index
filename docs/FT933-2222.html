			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / UK warns France over threat to EC farm trade agreement THE British government threatened yesterday to block French initiatives in the European Community unless Paris drops threats to veto the Blair House agreement on farm trade. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said in speeches and interviews in Tokyo that French opposition to the agreement was 'wrong and dangerous'. Officials said Mr Major was 'extremely concerned' about the possibility that the Uruguay Round talks on the general agreement on tariffs and trade might unravel if Paris succeeded in reopening the agreement, which sets out a common EC and US position on agricultural trade. France remained resolutely opposed to the US-EC Blair House agreement, threatening to veto the deal unless its EC partners agreed that negotiations would be reopened. 'The EC cannot conclude any Gatt agreement without a unanimous decision of its members,' said Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the French government spokesman, after a meeting of cabinet ministers called to discuss today's negotiations in Brussels. A statement issued by the office of the French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, said: 'The so-called Blair House pre-accord is incompatible with the reform of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy.' As a result, the statement said, discussions must be launched on a new basis between the EC and its partners, particularly the US. Mr Major's comments set the scene for a fierce argument over the agreement at a meeting in Brussels today of EC farm, foreign and trade ministers. The conflict is causing growing worries in Bonn that the UK government may take almost as intransigent a position in defence of the Blair House agreement as the French government is taking in attacking it - thus precipitating deadlock. 'The British seem to see this as a good way of undermining the Franco-German alliance,' a senior Bonn official said at the weekend. 'They are taking a very hard line in rejecting any attempt to help the French government.' Germany's position has been that it is not ready to 'renegotiate' the Blair House accord, but is prepared to try to 'reinterpret' it to soften the blow for French exports. Privately, UK officials used much stronger language. A senior aide to the prime minister said the UK was 'determined to stop the French wrecking the Uruguay Round'. Britain is understood to be drawing up a list of EC issues on which life could be made 'difficult' for France. The top priority is likely to be blocking French ambitions for the proposed European Monetary Institute. Hopes rising that deal can be saved, Page 3 Steelmakers meet, Page 3</p>

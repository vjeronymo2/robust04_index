			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: by Nikolay </F> Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze stated that four  UN member-states had agreed to send their troops to Abkhazia on  a UN peacekeeping mission. He did not tell the Georgian  parliament which particular countries were meant, but noted that  their number might increase.    He told Interfax that the Georgian parliament's decision to  dismiss the Abkhazian parliament was somewhat hasty and not  quite justified from the tactical point of view. "However, in  principle, it does not contradict the political context of the  situation," he said. IF Note: The Georgian parliament ruled  that pending parliamentary elections in Abkhazia the functions  of the Abkhazian parliament will be performed by the Abkhazian  Council of Ministers which will be granted the status of a  temporarily evacuated body. The resolution also says that all  the laws, adopted by the Abkhazian separatists, shall be  considered invalid.    Chairman of the Abkhazian parliament Vladislav Ardzinba told  Interfax that the talks on settling the Georgian-Abkhazian  conflict would not be continued until the Georgian parliament  annulled its resolution. He also said that the peace-making  process was interrupted through Georgia's fault.    On Tuesday, the Abkhazian parliament circulated a statement  which says that no further talks would be held on peaceful  settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict.    The Georgian parliament's decision to dismiss the Abkhazian  parliament and to put the Abkhazian deputies on trial  "illustrates that Georgia has put the stake on military solution  again," says this document.    The Abkhazian parliament qualified the Georgian parliment's  revolution as illegal, because Abkhazia, it said, is an  independent state, not part of Georgia.    The statement also says that if the Georgian parliament  reviewed its decision, the parliament of Abkhazia would continue  the search for a peaceful settlement of the conflict.    Russia's Foreign Ministry expressed concern about this  situation and about a real threat of armed clashes.    To quote Grigoriy Karasin, the head of the Russian Foreign  Ministry's Department for Information and the Press,  "Georgian-Abkhazian relations have deteriorated, producing a  real threat of an armed conflict." At the final stage of the  talks in New York, Georgia openly threatened to step back onto  the path of war if Abkhazia did not unconditionally recognize  Georgia's territorial integrity and agree to accept all Georgian  refugees," he said.    He announced that Russia was making urgent steps to prevent  armed clashes in Abkhazia and interruption of the talks. "It  will also support UN or UN-apporved peacekeeping operations in  Abkhazia, based, if necessary, on a Russian military  contingent," said Karasin.</p>

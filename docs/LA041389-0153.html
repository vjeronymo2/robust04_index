			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECALL ATTEMPT IS FOOLISH  </P> <P> How could a travesty like this happen to a man of such obvious honesty,  compassion and integrity?  </P> <P> Assemblyman Jack O'Connell has a proven record of excellent work and superb  responsiveness to the community.  </P> <P> We must not allow the shortsightedness of a special-interest group to undermine  one of the finest legislators anywhere in recent history.  </P> <P> Jack O'Connell of all people should not be a victim of this foolish recall  attempt. He would be the first one to care about the people in the so called  "Freedom Coalition" if they were to become sick, old, homeless or otherwise  forgotten.  </P> <P> We must not allow this fine man to be persecuted.  </P> <P> JANET R. SEREGELY  </P> <P> Fillmore  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Soldiers from the 1st Corps of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army carried out a successful military  operation today by liberating the Nisici plateau, north of  Sarajevo, and a part of the occupied territory between Sarajevo  and Olovo. Velid Djindo reporting from Olovo.    [Djindo] The aggressor's plan, named Zvijezda 94, was  thwarted by a well-planned and coordinated operation by units  from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's 1st Corps. More important  positions have been liberated in a brilliant counterattack and a  10-kilometer-wide part of the front line was pushed between 1  and 5 kilometers forward.    Our units have captured the villages of Milovac, Dovorine,  Orahak, Karacici, Dalja, Brda, Zicki, and Citlucki Zalik as well  as the Bukva, Kosijenci, Mali Hum, and Veliki Hum hills. New  areas are being captured. Our soldiers have seized large  quantities of weapons, ammunition, and military equipment and  the enemy suffered considerable losses in manpower.

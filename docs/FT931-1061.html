			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Elections '93: RPR battles Mitterrand for supremacy FRENCH conservatives stepped up their efforts yesterday to curb the influence of Mr Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist president, over the government which they will form after Sunday's second round of parliamentary elections. Mr Jacques Chirac, head of the neo-Gaullist Republican Rally (RPR), which emerged as the biggest single party in the first round last Sunday, challenged Mr Mitterrand's claims on policymaking. He said in an interview with Le Figaro newspaper that the conservatives 'did not intend to share power with defunct socialism, but would exercise their responsibilities to the full'. The RPR leader, who has this week led conservative calls for the president to resign, is anxious to avoid a repetition of the last cohabitation between 1986 and 1988, when he was prime minister and Mr Mitterrand repeatedly outmanoeuvred the conservatives. Mr Chirac said the conservatives planned to control areas of policy traditionally deemed to fall to the president, notably defence and foreign affairs. He said this could involve France taking a more active role within Nato. Meanwhile, Mr Mitterrand, who has fiercely rejected calls to resign, has begun protecting his position. A number of French newspapers yesterday published leaks from the president's staff of comments by him at the last socialist cabinet meeting on Wednesday. He is reported to have said he would not allow the conservatives to 'isolate me, lock me up in a rat-trap, or slit my throat in the dark' and to have warned that the return of the right would herald social chaos. 'When the suburbs go up in flames, you will see riot police hitting young people,' he was quoted as saying.</p>

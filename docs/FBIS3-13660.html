			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Prime </F> Minister Yitzhaq Rabin with unidentified reporters at the White  House; in English -- live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Rabin] Mr. President, the  vice president, secretary of state, dear friends. It was  important and worthwhile to meet today with the President and  his team to know and appreciate what we have known for a long  time: The friendship and trust between our two countries are  profound and are as good -- if not better -- than they have ever  been. We could not ask for more. For this, Mr. President,  please accept our gratitude. It is good to know that a great  nation, blessed with values and democracy, stands with us for  the greatest battle still to come -- the battle for peace.    Mr. President, a few months ago I stood here with you and  many others at an historic occasion. We arrived at the  beginning of the end of the bloody struggle that has lasted for  100 years. It was clear from the beginning that in spite of the  goodwill on all sides, it would be difficult to bridge in days  or in months differences in positions, perceptions, points of  view, and hatred that have devastated and grown over so many  decades. But we shall overcome these difficulties and reach the  day of peace. We shall remain determined in our goal.    In our talks today I told you, Mr. President, that in my  view  we were near the finish line of the talks with the Palestinians  on the first stage of the Gaza-Jericho First. Some problems and  details have yet to be solved. I am sure that we shall find the  right solution once the negotiations are renewed. We will not  let the extremists derail the peace process.    On behalf of the State of Israel, I condemn the terrible  terms of the killing in Hebron. I repeated this today in our  conversation. Since that time, the Government of Israel has  taken tough measures that are unprecedented in Israel. We will  implement them with determination.    But, Mr. President, we are also victims of terror -- whether  organized or spontaneous. Our women and children have lived in  the shadow of terror for decades. Not a week passes that we  don't have to bury our dead. And if only for this reason, we  don't think it appropriate to raise new demands after every  terrorist attack. Security is a two-way street. Real leadership  must rise above the realities of the day, even if they are  painful and bloody, in order to arrive at our strategic goal.  Peace is not a tactical option but a strategic objective which  takes precedence over everything else.    With you, Mr. President, I call on Chairman 'Arafat of the  PLO to resume talks immediately and act like me: to fight  terror as if there were no negotiations and conduct the  negotiation as if there was no terror.    We have to complete the negotiations so that in the spring  or  early summer hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of  Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho will at last be able to conduct  their own affairs. We don't seek to rule them any more.    Mr. President, there is no time to waste. We feel that the  window of opportunity that opened after the Gulf War is narrower  than we thought. Time is running out. Therefore, 1994 has to  be the year of great decisions in the peace process. In this  framework, we spoke of the options that can be presented to  President al-Asad in order to achieve peace with Syria. I hope  that President al-Asad will respond appropriately, and we shall  be able to sign a peace treaty by the end of this year.  President al-Asad said that Syria had made a strategic choice  for peace with Israel. That was encouraging. Peace with Syria  has always been our strategic choice. We recognize the  importance of Syria to a comprehensive peace in the area. We  are ready to negotiate peace with Syria that takes account of  our mutual needs and interests. There must be give and take on  both sides. We know that as we engage in serious and  authoritative negotiations, the point will come where painful  decisions will have to be made. The promise of peace and its  genuine benefits for all Israelis justifies making such  decisions vis-a-vis Syria. We will not compromise on our  security, but we will stand ready to do what is required of us  if the Syrians are ready to do what is required of them.    At the same time, we would like to promote and advance the  negotiations with Jordan, as well as with Lebanon. We are  hopeful that with them, too, treaties of peace can be achieved  this year. All of us know that time for the Arab boycott of  Israel -- a remnant of a period of hate and rejection -- should  be lifted.    Mr. President, prime ministers of Israel had come in the  past  with impressive shopping lists. On my list today I have one  item alone: the pursuit of peace. As Passover -- our feast of  freedom -- is approaching, let me take the opportunity to remind  all of us of the fate of the Israeli soldiers missing in action  and prisoners of war. I would like to thank the President for  the United States' support in this regard and express the hope  that Passover will also be a time of redemption for them. Mr.  President, thank you very much.    [Unidentified correspondent] Prime Minister, you said that  security is a two-way street. What do you plan to do to wipe  out the acknowledged double standard in the treatment of the  Palestinians, and also, if you are willing to make peace with  Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, now why don't you make the quantum  leap and go for permanent negotiations on peace with  Palestinians, instead of the step-by-step, very slow struggle of  the peace process that means more strife?    [Rabin] First, about the second question. You have to refer  to the letter of invitation to the Madrid peace conference.  This letter of invitation served as the basis agreed on by all  the parties that were invited to the Madrid peace conference and  the negotiations that followed this conference. What was  written there? That the purpose of the negotiations with the  three neighboring Arab countries beyond Egypt would be to  achieve peace treaties, and with the Palestinians to move by two  phases. Phase number one: Something that was never offered to  the Palestinians in the past, not by Jordan when Jordan was in  occupation of the West Bank, not by Egypt when Egypt was in  occupation of the Gaza Strip. We offered them self-rule, to run  their own affairs, to have a Palestinian council, self-governing  authority, as an interim agreement. What was agreed in signing  between the PLO and us? In the Declaration of Principles [DOP]  that was signed on the lawn of the White House we divided the  phases by agreement to Gaza-Jericho First, then to create the  overall arrangement, and not later than two years after the  completion of the implementation of Gaza-Jericho First to start  negotiating a permanent solution. I believe that sometimes what  might look the shortest way is the longest and the one that will  not lead to a change in the realities. Therefore, we are  committed to the letter of invitation to the Madrid peace  conference; we are committed to the Declaration of Principles  that were signed here between the PLO and Israel; we are  committed to the Cairo agreement that was reached between the  PLO and Israel, and I believe, to be committed to agreements  that were reached is a basic precondition for the efforts to  reach more agreements in the past. [as heard]    Second, you talked about different situations. Let's face  it, most of the terror attacks are aimed against Israelis. We,  the Government of Israel, in accordance to the international  law, are the sovereign to military government of the  territories. It's our responsibility for the safety, the  welfare of all the residents, Jews and Palestinians alike. This  government, as a result of the terrible tragedy that took place  in Hebron, has taken measures that are unprecedented in Israel  vis-a-vis those who violate the law, but we are a lawful  country. I can give you an example. I use my responsibility as  a minister of defense: orders for administrative detention of  two Israeli residents, not [from] the territories, but in  accordance to our laws, they had to be approved by a president  of a district court. I ordered administrative detention for  three months. The president of the district court reduced it to  six days. I cannot violate verdicts of the court. Whatever the  government does comes under the supervision and decision of our  courts. I believe that many people in Israel believe that  [what] we have done almost encroaching the line of the law, but  we are determined to do within the law whatever is needed to  fight terrorist from whatever direction it will come.    [Unidentified Israeli reporter] The two most sensitive  issues, Jerusalem and settlements, are now de facto on the  table. Do you agree that they should wait until the final  stage, or should you tackle them right now? I am asking both of  you, Mr. President and Mr. Prime minister. [passage omitted]    [Rabin] My answer is basically simple. We signed here in  Washington the Declaration of Principles. It is written very  clearly there that issues that have to be settled once we'll  negotiate a permanent solution will not be dealt with now, and  it is written very clearly, as examples for this kind of issues:  Jerusalem, settlements, borders, refugees, and others.  Therefore, by agreement with the PLO, these issues will be  dealt with when we'll negotiate a permanent solution. [passage  omitted]    [Unidentified U.S. correspondent] I am wondering if you  could describe what your view is of the concrete measures that  you mentioned earlier on in your remarks that should be taken to  keep peace in Israel, and whether or not you would support the  PLO idea for a police force in Hebron? [passage omitted]    [Rabin] Allow me first to make it clear, in the agreement,  once it will be reached and signed, there is a building [as  heard] -- in the past it was 8,000 to 9,000 men -- the  Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho. If by now  agreement has been reached, by now there would have been  8,000-9,000 Palestinian policemen in Gaza and Jericho. The more  negotiations are postponed, the longer it will take them to  come. Second, even if there will be some Palestinian police,  and there were in the past, at least 900 Palestinian police in  the territories were Palestinian residents of the territories in  Hebron and in Ramallah and in Nabulus. They resigned because of  the intifada. As long as ours is the overall responsibility for  the territories under the military government, using our Civil  Administration, their presence will not relieve us from our  overall responsibility. Therefore, we have to look at it in the  context of what is our international and practical  responsibility. We, as long as agreement will not be reached  that will cover all these areas with the PLO, we will remain  internationally responsible to the security of all those who  reside there. If there will be or will not be part of any  Palestinian police, they have to come under the control of the  government there, and the government is the military government  of Israel. Therefore, you can't have separate armed groups.  There must be one chain of command of those who have to keep  and maintain law and order. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, do you think  that Jews should exercise their right to reside in the middle of  Arab cities, and Mr. Prime Minister, could you also respond to  that?    [Rabin] What?    [Clinton] What was the question?    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you think, should Jews  exercise their right to reside in the middle of Arab cities in  the West Bank? Should they live in Hebron, for instance?    [Rabin] I don't understand the question.    [Unidentified correspondent] Well, there were ideas of  evacuating Jews from the middle of Hebron, for instance.    [Rabin] Again, as part of the DOP that we signed with the  PLO, it is said very clearly that the settlements remain there  for the interim period. I am not saying it; it is written very  clearly in the DOP. Therefore, since it was agreed, I don't see  at this stage as a condition for anything even to discuss this  issue. [sentence as heard]    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, I wonder if you  could tell us, and Mr. Prime Minister, the extent to which you  have discussed the Jonathan Pollard case again, and how much, if  at all, the Ames investigation has interfered with action on it  that was presented as imminent several months ago? [passage  omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] Could the prime minister answer  that?    [Rabin] In today's meeting, the issue was not brought up.  Thank you.</p>

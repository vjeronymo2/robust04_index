			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Her War-Like Posture"] </F>   [Text] Benazir Bhutto's first tenure as the Prime Minister  of Pakistan was noteworthy for the keen interest she took in an  amicable settlement of her country's problems with India. Her  second term which began three months ago is more than likely to  be different altogether. What is under way currently is in fact  her creeping metamorphosis into the stereotyped Pakistani leader  obsessed with enhancing Pakistan's military might. The virtual  rejection by Islamabad of the very idea of keeping up a serious  dialogue with India after the recent talks between the two  Foreign Secretaries is thus not accidental. It seems to be a  part of a strategy hardly distinguishable from that of all the  past military rulers of that country. Its main emphasis is on  warlike talk most of the time and war-like preparations all the  time. Benazir has already said much to convince Pakistan's  military elite that both of them are on the same wavelength. Her  belligerence on Kashmir and her bid to deflate the notion of a  dialogue with India have amply served this purpose.    Benazir Bhutto is now unfolding the second part of her  policy, viz, to appease the military top brass in more concrete  terms. This paper's correspondent in Davos in Switzerland has  shed light on the Pakistan Prime Minister's shopping mission in  the European arms bazaar. Apparently, a deal for the acquisition  of one or more submarines from the Swedish shipbuilding company,  Kockums, is on the cards. She has taken care to keep up an  anti-Indian tirade even as she participates in the World  Economic Forum in Davos, and keeps herself busier with less  publicised arms negotiations.    Such activities become significant especially in the  background of an increasing pressure on Benazir Bhutto's  government for a sharp hike in the defence budget. Air Marshal  (Retd) Ayaz Ahmad Khan has just called for raising the defence  expenditure from 90 billion to 150 billion rupees "to achieve  numerical and qualitative military balance with Pakistan's  foremost enemy." He wants that Pakistan must have more infantry,  armoured artillery and air defence formations "to correct the  two-to-one Indian advantage in troop strength." The so-called  imbalance to Pakistan's disadvantage can be easily seen to be a  myth when it is remembered that the percentage of its military  spending relative to its gross domestic product is far higher  than that of India and any Western democracy. But it is not just  tell-tale figures of expenditure that are involved here.  Pakistan's political system, some democratic trappings  notwithstanding, is essentially a military dominated one. Time  was when Benazir Bhutto wanted a full-fledged democracy with the  generals having no political role to play. Of late, she seems to  have found it expedient not to insist on the soldiers going hack  to the barracks. What seems to be going on is militarisation  under civilian aegis. The military-civilian confrontation is  yielding place to collusion. Another "historic compromise" ?</p>

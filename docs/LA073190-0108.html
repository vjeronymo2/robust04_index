			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> DELAY IN RETRIAL OF JUDGE AGUILAR  </P> <P> A respiratory infection caused a two-day delay in the retrial of U.S. District  Judge Robert Aguilar on corruption charges.  </P> <P> The trial judge, U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle, granted the delay after  ordering an examination of Aguilar, 59, by a doctor other than his own. Aguilar  was charged in 1989 with eight counts of using his judicial office to influence  other judges in handling cases involving Aguilar's friends. The first trial  ended May 19 with acquittal on one count of conspiracy and jurors deadlocked on  the seven other counts. The second trial has been trimmed to four counts.  </P></p>

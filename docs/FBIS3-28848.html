[passage omitted]    Dr Mahathir said this when asked by reporters to comment on  the possibility of NATO military intervention in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. "It (NATO) won't attack... I don't believe  that NATO will launch any strikes... it will wait for the 10-day  deadline to pass and then come up with an excuse that the Serbs  regret their action and promise not to do it again. After this,  the Serbs will continue with their ethnic cleansing," he said at  the Science, Technology and Environment Minister Datuk Law Hieng  Ding Chinese New Year open house here today [10 February].    Asked about Russia's suggestion that Sarajevo be  administered  by the United Nations, Dr Mahathir said Russia should first of  all tell the Serbs to withdraw. Only after this could there be  discussions on such a topic, Dr Mahathir said. "What is  important is for the Serbs to stop the attacks. But I don't  believe that the Russian or NATO's warning would compel the  Serbs to stop their policy of ethnic cleansing. "Everyone knows  -- NATO knows, the Americans know -- that when they issue a  threat they will not carry it out... and so the Serbs will  continue with their killing," the prime minister said.

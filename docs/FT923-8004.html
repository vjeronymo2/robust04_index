			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Career man taking care at State MR Lawrence Eagleburger, known to all as Larry, does not exactly fit the popular image of a US secretary of state, forever on shuttle diplomacy, smoothly speaking in subtle nuances, and frequently at war with thenational security adviser in the White House. He is 61, overweight, a chainsmoker afflicted by circulatory and respiratory ailments, and walks with a cane. He is also blunt, funny and, above all, a professional diplomat. He is the first career foreign service officer to have become deputy secretary of state, albeit after having left to work for Henry Kissinger and Associates from 1984-89. Mr Eagleburger has not been a member of the inner circle of advisers to President George Bush and Mr James Baker, who have formulated US foreign policy. His main role as deputy has been day-to-day departmental management, with a special focus on subjects in which Mr Baker was known to be less interested, such as Haiti and, as often as not in the last year, Yugoslavia. He joined the foreign service in 1957 and became Dr Kissinger's right hand in the White House of President Richard Nixon's first term before rising to the ambassadorship to Yugoslavia in 1977-80. The intertwined connections with Dr Kissinger and Yugoslavia are the most controversial aspects of Mr Eagleburger's career. His closeness to Marshal Tito and the Serbian political hierarchy is seen as one reason why the US was slow to wake up to the profound, now tragic, changes in what was Yugoslavia. He recently admitted that he misjudged the character of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian strongman. His appointment now as acting secretary, through Mr Baker's move to head the White House staff, means he will not be subject to Congressional confirmation. The Bush campaign had made no secret of its wish to avoid, before the US presidential election in November, hearings on what was Yugoslavia. As caretaker, however, his chances of making an independent mark are limited, with Mr Baker still in effective control from his new perch.</p>

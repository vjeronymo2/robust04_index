			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce plans Chinese move ROLLS-ROYCE Motor Cars is planning to appoint a distributor in China later this year, and will open a dealership in Moscow later this month, as part of an export sales drive to return the Vickers subsidiary to profit. Higher sales in export markets beyond western Europe are offsetting this year's steep decline in continental European new car markets, leaving the Crewe-based luxury car maker on course to return to profitability by the end of this year, the company said yesterday. Rolls-Royce has been drastically restructured over the past two and a half years, with its workforce reduced from 5,500 to less than 2,500 and its production break-even level halved to 1,300 cars a year. However, last year's output totalled only 1,258 cars. And with restructuring still going on during the first half of 1992, Rolls-Royce incurred a trading loss of more than Pounds 20m. Retail sales world-wide fell by 20 per cent to 1,378, from 1,713 the year previously and more than 3,300 at the end of the 1980s. Production is now being increased by about 25 per cent, partly for seasonal reasons - Rolls's second-half sales are traditionally higher than in the first - and partly to cater for the higher export demand. Even so, the company's output was down a further 14.2 per cent in the first four months of the year, at 359 compared with 418 in the 1992 period. On this basis, an output increase of more than 25 per cent would be needed to exceed the 1,300 breakeven figure.</p>

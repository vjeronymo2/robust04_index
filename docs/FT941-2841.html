			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Viacom hires Sony Pictures executive Mr Jonathan Dolgen, who has a reputation as one of Hollywood's shrewdest deal-makers and toughest managers, is quitting Sony Pictures Entertainment to head a new film and television entertainment group being formed by Viacom following its Dollars 10bn takeover of Paramount Communications. The appointment is a key one for Viacom, because Paramount's Hollywood operations have had a lacklustre record in recent years, even though they were the main prize in the recent bitter takeover battle for the company. Viacom needs to improve sharply its results to justify the high price it paid for the business. Mr Dolgen's move, announced by Viacom yesterday, is a fresh blow to Sony Pictures Entertainment, which owns the Columbia and Tristar studios and has suffered in recent years from a very mixed box office record and considerable senior management upheaval. Mr Dolgen, 48, was president of Sony Pictures Entertainment's motion picture group, where he had responsibility for the business side of the group, rather than creative operations, and was renowned as a cost-cutter who reined back its once lavish expenditure. He has a reputation as an intimidating manager, with a confrontational style: his office at Fox Inc, where he worked before joining Sony, was nicknamed the 'house of pain and suffering'. His move comes at a time when Japan's Sony, which paid Dollars 3.4bn for Columbia in 1989, is exploring the possible sale of a minority stake in its motion picture operations to a strategic investor, such as a telephone or cable company. Mr Dolgen will be chairman of Viacom Entertainment Group, which will oversee Paramount's film and television business and incorporate Viacom's own substantial television production, distribution and broadcasting operations.</p>

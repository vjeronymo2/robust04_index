			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Arts: ENO acquires the Coliseum The English National Opera has acquired the freehold of its London home, the Coliseum, for Pounds 12.8m. The money comes mainly from the Government, Pounds 10.8m, with the remaining Pounds 2m supplied by the Foundation for Sport and the Arts. For its part ENO will shortly launch a public appeal for around Pounds 17m to raise the capital to refurbish its property. The money will be spent on back stage and front of house improvements, and could involve a closure for up to a year. All the parties were in a congratulatory mood yesterday. The Minister for the Arts, Tim Renton, was happy that his department had secured Pounds 10.8m from the reserves on the last day of Parliament; Peter Jonas, entering his last year as general director at the ENO, was pleased that a fast approaching crisis in the affairs of the Coliseum - the ENO's current lease expired in 1996 - was now permanently resolved; and the owners of the property, Stoll Moss, was satisfied with what it described as a 'realistic' price. The recession in the property market, and the fact that the Coliseum is a listed building, made the purchase price much lower than anticipated a few years ago. The ENO will use its immediate annual saving in rent of Pounds 350,000 - it acquires the building on March 31  - to pay the legal fees of all involved. The co-operation of the Foundation for Sport and the Arts was vital. The Government would have been reluctant to provide the whole sum. The Foundation, financed by the football pools companies in an effort to ward off a national lottery, is proving a good friend to the ENO. The Pounds 2m grant is its largest donation to the arts and comes from the Pounds 20m it has set aside this year for arts causes. Earlier this month it gave the ENO Pounds 400,000 for a new computerised box office.</p>

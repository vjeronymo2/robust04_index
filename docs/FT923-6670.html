It opened at the day's low of 15,294.56 and posted firm gains on short-covering and small-lot buying by investment trusts, dealers and foreign investors. Volume rose to 430m shares from 300m, above 400m for the first time since May 14.

Reports that the government had decided to postpone the sale of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shares also encouraged sentiment. A leading business daily also reported that the ministry of finance was requesting the ministry of transport to postpone the listing of JR East, one of the former railway operations of Japan National Railway.

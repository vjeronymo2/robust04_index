			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Technology: Chicken and egg vaccine An automatic system for injecting eggs is rapidly replacing the traditional practice of vaccinating chicks by hand in the US poultry industry. Its commercial introduction in Europe is expected next year. Embrex - a company based at Research Triangle Park, North Carolina - launched its Inovoject system in the US last year. Fifty machines are already in operation, each capable of injecting 20,000 eggs per hour. The Inovoject machines are currently vaccinating about 20 per cent of the 100m eggs produced every week by the US broiler chicken industry. Analysts expect the level to reach 50 per cent next year. The machine first punches a tiny hole in the shell at the large end of the egg and then injects vaccine through the hole into the chick embryo. Injecting the eggs by machine is much cheaper and easier than employing people to grab newly hatched chicks and vaccinate them by hand. Embrex says the process also leads to healthier chicks because immunity can start to develop earlier. David Baines, managing director of Embrex Europe, says net savings are at least 1 cent per chick - a significant amount in the broiler industry, where margins are wafer thin. The system is being used first in the US to vaccinate against Marek's disease, which causes nervous system tumours in the birds. In Europe, the poultry industry is most interested in a novel vaccine against Gumboro disease, which destroys the birds' immune system. The Gumboro vaccine could not normally be administered so early in the chick's life because it is too virulent. But Embrex combines it with Viral Neutralising Factor, an antibody which binds to the virus in the vaccine and then releases it gradually into the chick. Embrex scientists say VNF technology could possibly be applied to make virulent vaccines safe for early use in other animals - even humans.</p>

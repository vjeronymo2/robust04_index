The Deputy Director, Xie Zhiqiang, of the Tarim Petroleum  Prospecting and Development Directorate, announced that during  four years of prospecting in northern and central Tarim,  covering an area of over 30,000 square kilometers, over 95,000  kilometers of two-dimensional digital seismic prospecting, and  2,200 kilometers of three-dimensional prospecting have been  completed, 169 exploratory wells have been drilled, totalling  970,000 meters of drilling footage, and industrial-grade oil and  gas flows have been found at 81 wells. Six oil fields that have  been confirmed or basically confirmed and ready for exploitation  are the Lunnan, Sangtamu, Donghetang, Jilake, Jiefang Qudong,  and Tazhong-4 oil fields. Three hundred million tons of oil  reserves and about 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas  reserves are basically confirmed and under control. What is  especially satisfying is that the Tazhong-4 oil field, which has  130 million tons of reserves, has the resources to assure the  construction of a 5-million ton crude oil production capability.  This year, the Tazhong-10 and Tazhong-6 wells have each produced  high-output flows of oil and gas, demonstrating that central  Tarim is an area of large-sized oil fields.    Important gains have also been made in development and  construction. Construction of crude oil production capabilities  of 1.4 million tons was begun at Lunnan, Sangtamu, and Jiefang  Qudong oil fields last year. The production capacity of  Donghetang oil field was expanded from 750,000 tons to 2.15  million tons last year. One hundred and sixty five kilometers of  the 230-kilometer Taklimakan desert highway have been completed,  and it is expected to be open to the Tazhong-4 oil field by the  end of June next year; 140 kilometers of the oil-field pipeline  have also been completed this year.    Petroleum exploration will be further accelerated during the  next three years. It is estimated that by 1995 confirmed and  controlled petroleum geology reserves will be 800 million tons,  and in 1996 the annual output of crude oil will be 5 million  tons.    The US$500 million loaned by the Xinjiang Branch of the Bank  of China for petroleum exploration and development in Tarim will  be used over the next two years to buy facilities, precision  instruments, and desert transportation vehicles needed for the  oil field.</p>

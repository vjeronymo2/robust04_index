He told Russian Deputy Premier Yuriy Yarov, who met him at  the airport, that he hoped his one-day visit would serve to step  up Polish-Russian cooperation.    A senior Polish Foreign Ministry source who asked not to be  identified told Interfax Pawlak's trip was unexpected to many in  Poland. Even President Lech Walesa told the Polish news agency  PAP on Monday that he had known nothing about Pawlak's plans to  go to Russia, the source said.    He said the main purpose of the visit was to end the  present-day stagnation in Polish-Russian trade and economic  relations, primarily caused by the red tape of officials in both  countries. The premier hopes to solve some key problems that  have not been tackled for two or three years, namely, he wishes  to reach agreement with Russia on the mutual cancellation of  debts and terms for trade and economic cooperation. Warsaw will  be satisfied with the visit if, during it, deadlines are set for  the solution of five or six major economic problems and specific  officials are put in charge of the work, the source said.    He said Poland did not attach prime importance to a package  of accords ready to be signed in Moscow, which includes  agreements on antimonopoly measures and on regulations on the  employment of Russian citizens in Poland and Polish citizens in  Russia.    On Tuesday, Pawlak will meet Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin and will be having talks at the Finance and  Agriculture Ministries and the Committee on Industrial Policy.  He will return to Poland the same day.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (5): Heavyweight champion of the world - Electricite de France FRANCE'S state-owned electricity company, Electricite de France, which produced a fifth of Europe's electricity in 1991, is France's 17th largest exporter and claims to be the world's biggest power utility. It is also a nuclear power in its own right, with 55 operational nuclear plants which supply 72 per cent of its total output. Its growing capacity surplus has been used by the French government to entice foreign business to invest in France and to sell EdF power abroad at rates foreign companies cannot match. In 1991, EdF exported approximately 14 per cent of all the power it produced, bringing export sales to a historic high of Ffr12.1bn (Pounds 1.2bn), 22.6 per cent more than the previous year. The leading purchaser was Britain, followed by Switzerland, Germany, Benelux and Spain. At the same time, EdF cut power imports by almost 30 per cent. Britain will not long remain the largest foreign customer, however. The cross-Channel contract between EdF and the National Grid is up for renewal on April 1, 1993. But it could fall victim to Britain's fast-growing overcapacity of generating plant. Most EdF export contracts are long-term, often for 10 years or more. On the basis of such contracts, Delaporte has projected that its export balance will continue to expand until 1997, after which it is likely to stabilise at around 70TWh/year for five years. However, if cross-border transmission capacities are increased, exports could reach 80TWh by the year 2000, and would then represent about 15 per cent of total EdF production, and an estimated Ffr17bn (Pounds 1.725bn) or more in sales. But there are clouds on the horizon. The company's usually robust nuclear performance has started to falter, (down from a projected 78-80 per cent of total production in 1990 to only 72 per cent in 1991, due to ageing in both the 900MW and 1300MW plants). Hydroelectricity has also been cut by four years of drought. The two problems have led to a sharp rise in EdF coal purchases, cutting potential profitability. A more insistent problem is that of nuclear waste: despite improved salvaging of spent fuel, France is accumulating over 5,000 cubic meters of very long-term highly radioactive wastes, and attempts to find a deep burial site have raised hackles throughout the country. On the EC level, Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan and his staff have issued a series of Directives aimed at breaking up utility monopolies like EdF and its twin, Gaz de France. By decreeing that other independent utilities may transport and distribute electricity over EdF networks, Brussels is threatening the highly profitable captive domestic market on which EdF's transfrontier aspirations are built. On the other hand, the EC's anti-monopoly Directives also allow EdF to sell its power more easily to individual foreign companies. Even if it were to increase foreign sales up to the level envisioned by Delaporte, EdF will be hampered by the technical maximum of 300-400 kilometers over which power can be transmitted. Thus Britain, Benelux, southern Germany, the Po Valley, Switzerland, and northern Spain remain the company's physical transmission limits. However, Delaporte says EdF has 'no intention of becoming the powerhouse of Europe'. French public opinion, which tolerates nuclear production, was unlikely to tolerate sales of French nuclear power to other nations reluctant to produce it themselves. The alternative was to increase income by direct investment in foreign facilities and markets. The most enticing market remains Eastern Europe, formerly serviced largely by the Ukraine, which with its network of Chernobyl-style nuclear plants produced almost as much power as France. Although Eastern Europe lies beyond EdF's 400-km transmission range, it can be reached by relay sales, whereby, for instance, EdF would sell to Switzerland which would then transfer some capacity eastward. Before such east-west interchanges can take place, however, the transmission/distribution networks of Eastern Europe must be upgraded to western standards and voltages. One means of doing so would be to transform alternating into direct current (at a cost of Pounds 100m for 1,000 megawatts - the output of a standard nuclear reactor). Another would be to upgrade the electrical facilities of Eastern European countries. In concert with the German utilities Bayernwerk and PreussenElektra, EdF is moving aggressively into Poland,where the three are in early stages of modernising the Dolna Odra power plant so that it can ship power west to Berlin. They are also active in Hungary, and are overseeing the construction of the Mochovce nuclear plant in Slovakia. With another partner, the Belgian Tractabel, EdF is planning another Polish power plant in lower Silesia. EdF is also involved in upgrading nuclear plants, such as Bulgaria's Kozloduy and Czechoslovakia's Bohunice and Dukovany. With perhaps the world's most advanced distribution and tariff systems, EdF has also been selling its know-how to cities such as Warsaw, Krakow, Lodz, and Moscow.</p>

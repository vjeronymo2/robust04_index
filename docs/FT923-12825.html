			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: TRW net result surges to Dollars 60m TRW, the US automotive, space and information services group, yesterday posted a 48 per cent improvement in second-quarter operating income to Dollars 158m from Dollars 106m. The company was boosted by strong gains from its automotive operations offsetting declines from its space and defence business. Sales advanced 9 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 2.15bn from Dollars 1.98bn. The company's net profits were muddied by special items in both years. Including one-time items, TRW had second-quarter net income of Dollars 60m, or 93 cents a fully-diluted share, against Dollars 24m, or 39 cents, a year earlier. In the 1992 quarter, after-tax earnings were lifted by Dollars 4m, or 7 cents, from the sale of an investment. A year earlier, the company took an after-tax charge of Dollars 18m, or 29 cents, on the divestment of a European automotive business. Wall Street reacted enthusiastically to the results, marking TRW's shares Dollars 1 3/8 higher to Dollars 56 3/8 at midday. Mr Joseph Gorman, chairman and chief executive, attributed the company's earnings improvement to cost-reductions and higher sales volume on the back of investments in air bag and steering systems. For the first half of 1992, TRW lifted net income to Dollars 101m, or Dollars 1.58, compared with Dollars 59m, or 96 cents. Sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 4.19bn from Dollars 3.90bn while operating profits advanced 35 per cent to Dollars 295m from Dollars 219m. TRW's automotive business brought in operating profits of Dollars 88m on sales of Dollars 1.21bn in the second quarter, compared with Dollars 31m on sales of Dollars 1.02bn a year earlier. The space and defence segment saw operating profits slide to Dollars 55m from Dollars 62m last year on sales which edged 3 per cent lower to Dollars 742m from Dollars 764m.</p>

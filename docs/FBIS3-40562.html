			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zahid Hanif: "Why Is the U.S. Worried Over </F> Pakistan's Defense Preparations?"]    [Text] Pakistan has been independent for 46 years now.  Pakistan was not discovered by a Columbus; it was established  after two million Muslims had sacrificed their lives. They left  their ancestral homes, sacrificed their forefathers' memories,  and left their graves just to attain the goal of establishing  Pakistan. They irrigated Pakistan with their blood. However,  reading or hearing about the U.S. attitude gives the impression  that Pakistan was leased to us for 50 years only and this lease  is about to expire. The United States appears to be watching  Pakistan all the time. What are all these pranks about `do not  do this' or `do not do that'? The United States sometimes  imposes economic restrictions on us and other times stops the  sale of F-16 planes to block our defense program. Is not  Pakistan an independent nation? Does not this nation have its  borders? Do not humans live here? Our neighbor India waged  surprise wars on us three times. Cannot we make preparations to  defend ourselves from a country five times bigger than us? India  has openly blasted a nuclear bomb in 1974, and even today it is  making weapons round the clock in its four ordinance factories  to burn Pakistan; however, the United States cannot see this  all. Instead, it is ready to declare Pakistan a terrorist nation.    Whenever the United States provided aid to Pakistan, it took  full advantage of it. It used Pakistani shoulders and Afghani  guns to destroy the superpower that was the Soviet Union. The  Soviet Union was a country with expansionist designs. It wanted  to destroy Afghanistan to reach warm water ports and the oil  wells in the Gulf. At the same time, it could have become equal  to the United States in Asia. It could have aimed at New York  and Washington easily from here. Even today, the United States  is very interested in Siachen and China, and the protection of  its interests are behind these efforts. It can keep a close eye  on the Central Asian (Muslim) nations and on China from here.  The whole world is aware of the U.S. dichotomous policies. If it  is sympathetic to humanity, then it should put out the fires in  Bosnia. It should punish Hindu imperialism for its ugly crimes  against humanity just like it attacked Iraq. When Pakistan was  helping it stop the progress of its greatest enemy, the Soviet  Union, the United States viewed Pakistan as a principled nation.  Now that we are trying to stop the progress of our enemy, it is  looking at us suspiciously and calling us a terrorist nation.    However, thank Allah, Pakistan was able to survive without  U.S. help in the past and will continue to survive proudly  without it until the end of the world. A new problem has started  now. They [the U.S. Government] say that drugs are smuggled from  Pakistan to the United States. According to it, 156 important  Pakistani people are involved in this trade. It is asking for  their extradition as criminals. Pakistan is an independent and  respectable nation. It also has courts and jails, as well as a  justice system. Therefore, we can try people right here.    Now the question is who is protecting this ugly and  abominable trade? In which countries is heroin manufactured? How  is it smuggled into an alert country like the United States?    The truth is that every country in the world has its own  jails. It proves that every country has its share of rotten  eggs. Pakistan also has some people like that. New York is  considered top most on the list of cities in the world with a  high rate of crime. The latest example is the loss of hundreds  of thousands of dollars worth of equipment by a deputation led  by Philippines President Fidel Ramos during its five-day trip to  the United States. A television camera worth $74,000 belonging  to the state television network was stolen in a motel lobby.  Later a large bag containing the guests' wireless equipment and  batteries for the cameras also disappeared. It was not the fault  of the United States, and we are not blaming it because these  vile acts were committed by some criminals. Similarly, Pakistan  has some stupid and poor people. They open suitcases full of  dollars and are dazed. They dream about becoming rich overnight,  and join this ugly trade. This epidemic is hurting our nation.  How can we like this trade? The government arrested hundreds and  sentenced them to be flailed. The Americans, however, come here  and tempt them again to become involved in this trade. The  Government of Pakistan is fully focused on this problem,  therefore, the United States need not worry about it.</p>

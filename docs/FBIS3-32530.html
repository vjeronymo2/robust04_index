As the  institution charged with protecting national security and  sovereignty, we are determined to help consolidate the  democratic process and guarantee the preservation of  institutional order, the minister said. In Guatemala, the  government and the Army are working to dispel the crisis that  other sectors have provoked. The Army is also committed to  preserving democracy. It is our duty to support every effort  toward that end, he said.    The Army cannot comment on the results of the popular  consultation because we are outside political activities, but  our support for democracy and President De Leon is firm, the  defense minister added. All sectors, not just the government,  are responsible for confronting and ending the institutional  crisis. Nevertheless, the government and the Army have  mistakenly been blamed for everything wrong in the country, and  that is unrealistic.    The government has again and again been blamed for human  rights violations, but the fact that the rebels have also  violated these elementary rights has been overlooked. It is  very easy to make accusations, particularly as we approach the  Geneva Summit, which will discuss the human rights situation.  Some sectors try to aggravate the crisis and have blamed the  Guatemalan Government.    Instead of marring the country's image, those sectors should  strive for a solution to Guatemala's crisis. The Army is  determined to support the democratic system, hence our support  for President De Leon remains firm, Enriquez conclude.</p>

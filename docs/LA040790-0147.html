			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAPISTRANO VALLEY FORCED TO FORFEIT SWIM VICTORY AGAINST MISSION VIEJO  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley High School has had to forfeit its South Coast League boys'  swim victory against Mission Viejo, Mission Viejo Principal Robert Metz said  Friday.  </P> <P> The Cougars defeated the Diablos, 79-77, on March 10.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo officials lodged a protest, claiming Capistrano Valley had  violated the closed-book procedure.  </P> <P> Under the U.S. Swimming Federation guidelines, a team cannot change swimmers  after receiving the lineup from an opposing team. Tom Anthony, Capistrano  Valley principal, said the Cougars had changed swimmers in the 400-yard  freestyle relay and 200 individual medley relay after lineups had been  exchanged.  </P> <P> In a meeting Friday, league principals voted to award Mission Viejo the  victory.  </P> <P> Anthony said he has appealed the decision to the Southern Section. Anthony, who  attended the meet, said he was unaware of the protest at the time and was not  informed of it until the next day.  </P> <P> A Southern Section official said a ruling on the appeal would be made next  week.

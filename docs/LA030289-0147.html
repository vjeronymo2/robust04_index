			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WALL OF WATER, SAND SWEEPS STORM DRAIN WORKER TO DEATH  </P> <P> A construction worker sealing the inside of a 36-inch storm drain in Newport  Beach was killed in a freak accident Wednesday when a nearby water line  ruptured, releasing sand and water that swept him 200 yards.  </P> <P> "It was a rush of water and it washed him down," said Manuel Montero, 32, of  Corona, another construction worker who said he was in a hole around the  opening of the drainpipe when he heard the gushing water and had time to get  out.  </P> <P> The coroner's office identified the victim as Romulo Lopez, 52, of Perris, in  Riverside County. He was pronounced dead at Hoag Hospital.  </P> <P> The accident occurred shortly after noon at the Promontory Point Apartments  near Bayside Drive. The construction project, which included the storm drain  and street curbs, was being done by Byron L. Crume Inc. of Corona, Newport  Beach police said. The company was under contract by the city of Newport Beach,  officers said.  </P> <P> Montero said he heard the worker scream as the water entered the pipe and swept  him away. Montero entered the storm drain at the bottom of the hill through a  manhole and tried to find his co-worker in the water, mud and sand. At one  point, he said, he was able to touch Lopez's arm, but he was lifeless.  </P> <P> Police, firefighters and city life guards arrived, Montero said. About 30  minutes after the pipe broke, he said, lifeguards in wet suits brought the body  up.  </P> <P> A Police Department spokesman said the construction company was laying sections  of the drainpipe when a backhoe drove over a buried 8-inch city water line  above the storm drain. The backhoe was digging a trench where the drain pipe  was to be laid.  </P> <P> Police said a "rush of water" washed the worker down the pipe. "When he reached  the bottom of the hill he was unable to get out of the drain pipe," an officer  said.  </P> <P> When the water main ruptured, much of the mud and sand around the opening of  the storm drain washed down the pipe, along with pieces of wood and braces used  for laying the pipe and sealing the 8-foot sections together. The construction  workers had been at the site laying the pipe and putting in curbs for several  weeks. The work was part of a city project to improve drainage from the top of  the hill.  </P> <P> Montero said Lopez had worked for the company for several months. Company  officials were unavailable for comment. The coroner said Lopez is survived by  his wife.  </P></p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Rentokil's majority holder reduces stake to 52.4% RENTOKIL, the environmental and property services company, said a total of 40m of its shares had yesterday been placed with institutions. The shares closed 2p down on the day at 209p. Its majority shareholder, Sophus Berendsen, sold 29m shares, reducing its holding from 55.4 per cent to 52.4 per cent, or 510.6m shares. The Danish conglomerate said it would use the proceeds of approximately DKr580m (Pounds 53m) to reduce short-term liabilities and strengthen its debt to equity ratio. Separately, the KG Anker-Petersen Will Trust sold 11m shares, reducing its holding from 4.2 per cent to 3 per cent, or 29.6m shares. Rentokil said arrangements had been made for both sales to be co-ordinated. Sophus Berendsen has maintained a majority stake in Rentokil since it went public in 1969. It said yesterday's sale did not mark a change of strategy and gave a firm undertaking not to sell any further shares for at least 12 months. Rentokil accounts for about 60 per cent of Sophus Berendsen's sales - up 8.5 per cent at DKr4.2bn at its half year. Rentokil's interim pre-tax profits were up 30 per cent at Pounds 67.1m. The Danish group said in August that its full-year result would be significantly influenced by two important investments earlier this year  - Rentokil's acquisition of the Securigard Group and the Berendsen industrial division's acquisition of the Lucas Fluid Power group.</p>

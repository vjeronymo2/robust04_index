			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace While the chairman is the very public face of a company, it has been clear for some time that Mr Cahill has not been the prime mover of events within BAe. The limits to his time in the UK must have curbed his effectiveness, while the wild goose chase for a regional jet deal in Taiwan absorbed much of his concentration. Sadly, his contribution does not merit the kind of payment he has, in the end, collected. But that was the contractual bind to which BAe committed itself in its darkest hour. An expensive divorce settlement is better than continued misery. Judged on their results, the reforms introduced to BAe's ailing businesses must be considered a success. The company has dealt with many of its worst problems, such as regional jets and its turboprop leases, while creating financial flexibility through new banking lines and the sale of corporate jets and Rover. Those changes will bring out the underlying value of BAe's businesses, and whatever the local turbulence, the share price recovery has further to go. The task now is to turn all this to the advantage of the defence business. Mr Dick Evans, the chief executive, has proved himself as a salesman, but he still has much to demonstrate as a manager. The presence of Mr Bob Bauman as a heavyweight non-executive chairman should reassure the City that the company has a ring-master capable of containing Mr Evans. Having had such a poor track record with its chairmen, however, the company remains on probation. It must demonstrate that there is not a defence mafia which resists reform.</p>

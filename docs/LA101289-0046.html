			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGER NOTEBOOK: SPANOS, ORTMAYER WILL MEET TODAY TO DISCUSS BANKS SITUATION  </P> <P> Charger Owner Alex Spanos will meet today with Steve Ortmayer, his director of  football operations, and one of the subjects scheduled for discussion is what  the team plans to do about linebacker Chip Banks.  </P> <P> Banks has been troubled with drug problems and drug-related arrests over the  past 18 months, but the NFL cleared him to play last week. Banks' attorney has  said Banks would like to return.  </P> <P> But Spanos has said on more than one occasion that Banks will never play for  the Chargers again.  </P> <P> "The owner's position has not changed on that," Ortmayer said again Wednesday  night. Banks is under probation for a conviction involving cocaine possession.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Ralph Cindrich, the agent for unsigned running back Gary Anderson,  again expressed anger at what he perceives is the Chargers' continued refusal  to negotiate on a new contract for Anderson.  </P> <P> "Ortmayer thinks Gary Anderson will come crawling back after the (Tuesday)  trade deadline," Cindrich said. "But I'm going to see that Gary Anderson  carries this thing through."  </P> <P> Said Ortmayer: "I've quit thinking about those guys. Those guys have made a lot  of statements. It seems to me they're a little bit uptight."  </P> <P> Talk about sending a little man to do a big job.  </P> <P> When Rod Bernstine went down with a bruised knee in the Chargers' 16-10 loss to  the Broncos in Denver last Sunday, Dana Brinson had to be one of those least  likely to replace him at H-back.  </P> <P> At 5-feet-9 and 172 pounds, Brinson is six inches shorter and 66 pounds lighter  than Bernstine. Like Lionel James, the player he beat out to make the club, he  is a combination wide receiver, running back and punt returner.  </P> <P> But a guy that small at H-back?  </P> <P> "That's what they tell me," Brinson said Wednesday. "I think a running back and  an H-back are pretty much the same thing."  </P> <P> Actually, Brinson will not assume all of Bernstine's duties Sunday when the  Chargers meet the Seattle Seahawks at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Tight end  Chris Gannon will play when blocking is an obvious requirement, and running  backs Tim Spencer and Victor Floyd also figure in Coach Dan Henning's revised  plans.  </P> <P> But Brinson will be an H-back when he is in the game on offense, and the rookie  from Nebraska is excited about the opportunity.  </P> <P> In five games, Brinson has carried nine times for 48 yards and caught seven  passes for 49 yards. He also has returned five punts for 95 yards, including  one for 52 yards against the Broncos.  </P> <P> "This is what I've been looking forward to, my first real chance to play a  lot," Brinson said. "I've been more of a receiver, but now I'll be running the  ball quite a bit, too."  </P> <P> Bernstine has been in Bryan, Tex., for the funeral of his stepfather. He is  expected back today but has little chance to play Sunday. He is listed as  doubtful on the Chargers' injury report.  </P> <P> Quarterback Jim McMahon looks upon the near-miss against the Broncos as an  indicator that the Chargers still don't qualify as contenders.  </P> <P> Asked if they were almost there, McMahon said, "Well, you get there by winning  close ballgames like that. Until we do that with regularity, we're not going to  arrive.  </P> <P> "We had a chance to tie for the lead (with Denver in the AFC West), and we blew  it. We've got to win games like that from now on, and maybe the last game of  the year (against Denver at home) will mean something. Until we do, we won't  get respect."  </P> <P> McMahon likened the Chargers' current position to that of the Chicago Bears  when he joined them in 1982.  </P> <P> "We were terrible until the last part of '83," McMahon said. "Then we won five  of our last eight (actually, five of six) and ended up 8-8. At that point, we  realized we were a pretty good ballclub, and the next year we played for the  conference (NFC) championship."  </P> <P> Asked if he was 100% after being troubled by nagging minor injuries, McMahon  said, "I'll never be 100%. I'm too old for that stuff."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Cornerback Sammy Seale (shoulder) and wide receiver Quinn Early (knee) are  questionable for Sunday. Coach Dan Henning said, "I'd say Seale was 62 1/2(-37  1/2), with the arrow pointing up, and Early is probably 45(-55). Early felt a  twinge in his knee today. He tried it, and it didn't respond." . . . Probables  on the Chargers' injury report are quarterback Jim McMahon (back), wide  receiver Darryl Usher (hamstring), tight end Arthur Cox (foot), tight end Joe  Caravello (hip), tackle Brett Miller (knee), tackle Joel Patten (knee),  linebacker Cedric Figaro (ankle) and safety Lester Lyles (ankle). . . . The  Seahawks' injury list is short but serious. Wide receiver Tommy Kane (knee) and  linebacker M.L. Johnson (eye) are out.  </P></p>

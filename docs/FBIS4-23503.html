			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, has again  called on Nigerians to use the forthcoming constitutional  conference to reinforce their belief in the unity of the  country. He was speaking in Abuja today when the Idoma  Traditional Council, led by the Ochi Idoma, Dr. Abraham Ajemi  Okpabi, paid him a solidarity visit.    Gen. Abacha said that the nonpartisan nature of the  constitutional conference was deliberately designed to provide  all Nigerians with the opportunity to present all their views  and interests for consideration at a national forum.    He reemphasized the need for Nigeria to draw up its own form  of democratic peculiar to its culture and political aspiration.    Earlier, the Ochi Idoma had pledged the loyalty of the  people  to the present administration. Dr. Okpabi appealed to all  Nigerians to support the government's transition program and  work toward the promotion of peace and stability in the country.</p>

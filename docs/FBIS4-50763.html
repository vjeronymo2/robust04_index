			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ['Round-Up' by Li Guorong: Rao's Visit Improves Ties With </F> U.S.]    [Text] New Delhi, May 21 (XINHUA) -- Indian Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao returned here today from a six-day visit to the  United States, which improved the atmosphere of bilateral ties  between the two countries.    The visit resulted in the two countries overcoming their  reservations and establishing a durable framework for building a  new partnership despite continuing differences over many issues.    U.S. President Clinton has emphasized that the United States  has a high stake in improving its relationship with India.    Indian Prime Minister Rao said that his discussions with  President Clinton convinced him that India and the U.S. can  develop a bilateral relationship of maturity and strength that  can contribute not only to mutual good but also to the world as  a whole.    During his visit, Rao has successfully put India back on  Washington's economic agenda and conceded nothing on issues like  the non-proliferation, human rights and its position on the  Kashmir problem.    The bilateral dialogue will continue as Washington remains  unconvinced by the Indian argument that it can not sign the  "discriminatory" nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    On the Kashmir issue, the U.S. position is now closer to the  Indian stand as U.S. President B. Clinton said that it is for  India and Pakistan to get together and resolve it, without  mentioning the will of the Kashmir people this time.    Adding to the happiness of the Indians, President Clinton  said that he has an open mind on the possibility of India  acquiring permanent membership of the U.N. Security Council --  something the Indians have long been seeking.    A distinct possibility of defence relationship including  joint exercises has emerged following discussions with U.S.  Defence Secretary William Perry.    India's emphasis on the positive aspects of the economic  relationship was also endorsed by Clinton when he said that  India's important reform plan will be the engine of growth in  the relations between the two countries.    U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown is to visit India in  November to discuss how to promote growth in trade and  investment.    It has been agreed to revitalize the Indo-U.S. joint  commission of 1974, to establish regular foreign office  consultations between the two countries as well as to upgrade  cooperation in science and technology.    The revitalization of the Indo-U.S. joint commission to be  chaired by the Indian foreign minister and U.S. secretary of  state is viewed here as U.S. recognition of the potential for  building a positive economic relationship with India.    The commission is to have four sub-commissions on education  and culture, science and technology, agriculture and economics  and commerce.    The revival will begin with a meeting between finance  secretaries of the two countries before the end of the year,  according to Indian Foreign Secretary K. Srinivasan.</p>

The company placed the contract for the steel jacket with Highland Fabricators of Nigg, Ross-shire, and for the deck with Trafalgar House of Teesside. The 25-month construction begins next summer. The value of the UK's North Sea oil reserves fell by 7 per cent last month because of declining oil prices and a stronger pound, the Royal Bank of Scotland said yesterday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A news conference has been held at the Council of  Ministers and our reporter Aivars Tiltins was there. He is in  the Afternoon program studio.    [Tiltins] Yes. So it happened that, just one hour apart,  news conferences on one and the same incident [detention of two  Russian generals on 10 January] were held by both the Council of  Ministers and the Saeima. But this only shows the seriousness  of the incident.    Participants in the press conference at the Council of  Ministers were Valdis Birkavs, Foreign Minister Georgs  Andrejevs, and Internal Affairs Minister Girts Kristovskis. All  the speakers began with apologies, because the incident  undoubtedly dented relations between Russia and Latvia.    Foreign ambassadors took part in the news conference and  both  Valdis Birkavs and Georgs Andrejevs stressed that the incident  and the action by Andrejs Rucs and his sympathizers had nothing  in common with the government's and the Saeima's policy, and  that Russia and other foreign countries would understand that.    We have already spoken about the decisions which the Council  of Ministers took at its session last night. So then, Andrejs  Rucs was dismissed and the Prosecutor's Office started a  criminal case. At present Rucs' location is unknown. He is  being sought. At least Girts Kristovskis said so.    The main thing which is to be carried out now is to  determine  the accountability and duties of each structure. The structures  in question are the home guards and the municipal police. The  National Security Council is also working on just that.    Girts Kristovskis also noted that the Vidzeme municipal  police will today hand over weapons to the Ministry of Internal  Affairs. Rucs, however, is not taking part in that procedure.    One of the most important issues in perceiving the  seriousness of the situation is Russia's reaction at the time of  the incident. It would be worth listening to what Georgs  Andrejevs said.    [Begin Andrejevs recording] I will just explain what the  president personally heard from both General Mayorov, commander  of the Northwestern Group of Forces, and President Yeltsin's  office. Those two sources clearly said that an order had been  given, first of all to Defense Minister Grachev to carry out any  necessary [word indistinct] measures, that is President  Yeltsin's order. Then, obviously, the army commander also gave  an order to place in combat order several divisions, including  air force and airborne divisions, stationed near Latvia. Such  information was not received in Latvia in written form. But  there are no grounds to doubt this information. And quite a few  occasions are known from inter-state experience that it has not  been even necessary to use such physical violence against  officers of such high rank for some superpower to begin without  prior (?warning) an attack against the aggressor [words  indistinct] who was guilty of such violence. I would (?simply)  like to tell you that it was much more dangerous for Latvia that  General Mayorov practically gave Latvia half an hour to find out  where the generals were, and threatened countermeasures here in  Latvia. It seems to me that there is big enough here, the  Russian army is stationed. [sentence as heard]    So then, if anything had happened, if anything (?even worse)  had happened when transporting those generals, with an armed  conflict beginning between units which would have tried to stop  the transport and guards who had an order from Rucs, he himself  affirmed that, to shoot at anyone who would have tried to  (?defend) and stop the transport, in that case it would have  been difficult to foresee the consequences, because if the  Russian Army had moved out of its quarters it would  understandably have also encountered resistance from the Latvian  side [words indistinct]. [end recording]    [Tiltins] In conclusion I would also like to stress the main  opinion expressed at the news conference: That this incident  does not correspond to the policy laid down and carried out by  the government and the Saeima. Foreign ambassadors were invited  after the news conference to a brief meeting at the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs.</p>

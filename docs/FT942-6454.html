			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: US data and Buba hold key to dollar - Currency Markets The dollar will again be the focus of attention when traders return to their desks tomorrow, with central bank activity and US labour data likely to be foremost in their thoughts. The dollar took a tumble last week when comments from senior Bundesbank officials left the impression that the pace of German interest rate reduction was likely to slow. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, has since said that he was referring to official rates, so the repo auction on Wednesday is likely to be closely watched. The main focus, however, will be the release of US economic data - particularly the labour market statistics on Friday - but also the purchasing managers' index on Wednesday. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS in London, said that if the data supports the belief that growth in the current quarter is going to be above 4 per cent, then the market will start speculating about another monetary tightening. Whether shifting interest rates will be sufficient to support the dollar must be doubtful. The currency has failed recently to benefit from interest rate differentials moving substantially in its favour. In the short term the dollar is more likely to be led by developments in Japan. The announcement last week that US-Japan trade talks would resume should have been dollar positive, but its effect was evident for less than 24 hours. A possible wild card would be a lowering of short term interest rates by the Bank of Japan. Consumer inflation figures, released last Friday, showed inflation was still very low, at only 0.8 per cent in the year to April. Sceptics are still predicting a softer dollar. Swiss Bank Corporation, in its latest currency commentary, recommends clients to 'sell US dollars for a renewed test of the historic lows.' SBC says a rally to Y106-7 will not arrest the downward trend that will take the dollar to Y98-95. In Europe attention will revert to the drachma and the escudo, both of which have been under selling pressure recently. Traders are predicting that the escudo will be in the firing line again, while the Bank of Greece's intention to lower interest rates could put the drachma under renewed pressure.</p>

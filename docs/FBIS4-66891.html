			<p>BFN     [Text] The UN Commission on Disarmament opens for a session  in New York on 1he 18th. In this context the Russian spokesman  in the commission, Igor Sherbov, said that the Disarmament  Commission of the United Nations is a major body in the system  of multilateral talks in this sphere. Nearly all the states,  members of the world community, work in it. At its coming  session the commission will consider recommendations for the  process of nuclear disarmament within the framework of  international peace and security. The agenda also includes the  drafting of recommendations to regulate international shipments  of conventional armaments and the prevention of illegal trade in  arms. This primarily concerns the so-called crisis regions and  prevention of the delivery of arms to international terrorism.    What objectives will the Russian delegation pursue at the  session of the UN Disarmament Commission? Igor Sherbov notes  that first of all one should try and call the attention of the  commission to the priorities of the country in the field of  multilateral disarmament. What is meant is ensuring a consistent  fulfillment of agreements already reached, raising the  effectiveness of the mechanism of talks on disarmament. The  delegation will see to it that the session approve documents  reflecting such a key issue as a complete and comprehensive ban  on nuclear tests. It is important to consolidate the progress  already made in this sphere by the Geneva conference. The  commission should also call attention to the need of increasing  the effectiveness of the Nonproliferation Treaty, which expires  in the year 1995.    Russia is interested in having all achievements in science  and technology used first of all for peaceful purposes.  Interest is shown in making universal regimes in the system of  export control of dual-purpose technology and preventing an arms  race in qualitatively new systems of weapons. Achievements in  science and technology should be used for a collective  development of control instruments and for technical assistance  in the realization of agreements on disarmament. This would  make it possible to reduce expenditure on international control  of action on agreements on the limitation of arms and  disarmament, said Igor Sherbov.</p>

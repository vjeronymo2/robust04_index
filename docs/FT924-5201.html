			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Series of sad stories from Japanese OTC  -A depressing two-year trend High risk, high return has been the sales pitch for the Japanese over-the-counter market (OTC), but investors have seen more risk than return recently with the OTC index 72.5 per cent off its peak in 1990. Most companies listed on the OTC market have fallen victim to the downturn in the economy, the two-year slide in the stock market and the bursting of the real estate bubble of the late 1980s. This, compounded with inadequate disclosure at many OTC companies, has driven investors away. A downward revision of forecasts by leading OTC companies such as THK, the ball bearings maker, and Jafco, the venture capital company, seem to sum up the woes of smaller companies. THK, which originally forecast a 36 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits, now expects earnings to plunge by 89 per cent. Jafco also initially saw a profit increase, but has revised projections to a fall of one-fifth at pre-tax level. Smaller companies, which rely on a 'niche' market, lack the breadth of business and are more vulnerable to an economic downturn. Last year's failure of Maruko, an Osaka-based condominium developer specialising in one-room apartments, symbolised the troubles at OTC companies. Maruko, the first company listed on the OTC to become bankrupt, expanded aggressively in the late 1980s. However, when interest rates started to rise and demand for its one-room condominiums fell, the consequent liquidity crunch forced the company to file for court protection with liabilities of Y285.8bn (Dollars 2.3bn). Royal Construction, a contractor of golf resorts and condominiums, followed Maruko. The company filed for court protection last July with outstanding debts of Y19bn. Disclosure problems of companies have also heightened the risks of investing on the OTC market. The Japan Securities Dealers Association (JSDA) recently admitted that it needed tighter disclosure rules, following criticism over the bankruptcy of Ipec, an operator of educational institutes and supplier of educational material, and a false data claim attributed to TSD, a computer software company. In October, the failure of Ipec highlighted slack disclosure measures at smaller companies. According to the company lawyer, liabilities at Ipec totalled Y18.6bn, with some Y8.7bn in off-balance sheet borrowings. While Ipec may be an isolated case, allegations that the company did not make itsoff-balance sheet liabilities clear at the time of listing discouraged OTC investors. Investors were also shocked by an announcement by TSD, earlier this month, that it had presented investors with false information concerning clinical tests of its HIV vaccine. The JSDA announced last week that it would produce a guideline for information disclosure by the end of the year. Mr Yoshiro Nao, senior managing director of Ichiyoshi Securities, a broker specialising in OTC companies, points out that small companies often lack the auditing systems within the organisation to check irregular practices. OTC companies do not feel the pressure to disclose more information and rarely face scrutiny from the media, or from analysts. The press club at the Tokyo Stock Exchange once rejected the Japan Securities Dealers Association's request for a forum for the OTC companies to announce their results. The surprises have not all been unpleasant. Mr Kenzo Tsujimoto, president of Capcom, a video game equipment and software maker, apologised to investors after revising up the company's profit forecast for the second time since the beginning of the fiscal year in April. The company said that it had not foreseen the surge in demand for its new video game software, and now projects annual sales to March to rise 72 per cent, and pre-tax profits to double. Seikagaku, a pharmaceutical company specialising in geriatric drugs, was another of the few companies which saw a steady rise in interim profits. The company is expected to post double digit increases in both profit and sales thanks to 'Alz', an arthritis cure. But with the OTC index failing to respond to the recent rise of the Nikkei average, the few positive earnings forecasts have been ignored. Traders admit that the OTC market will remain a risky and speculative market for some time to come. The JSDA requires retail investors to sign an agreement acknowledging the risks before placing orders on the OTC market. And Nomura Securities, the industry leader, says its that sales staff are guided not to allow inexperienced individual investors to participate in OTC trading.</p>

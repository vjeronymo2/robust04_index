			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Detailed excerpts" of "exclusive interview" with Guangdong </F> Governor Zhu Senlin by unidentified WEN WEI PO reporter in  Guangzhou, 10 June: "Governor Zhu Senlin Answers WEN WEI PO  Reporter's Questions"]    [Text] [WEN WEI PO] Please talk about Guangdong's  economic development since the reform and opening up.    [Zhu Senlin] In 1979 the central authorities decided to  adopt "special policies and flexible measures toward Guangdong"  (setting up special economic zones on a trial basis and  implementing a new economic management structure), calling on  Guangdong to carry out reform and opening up ahead of others.  In 1988 the central authorities again designated Guangdong as  China's comprehensive test region for reform and opening up and  called on it to boldly explore reform and opening up. Over the  past 15 years, Guangdong has unswervingly implemented the  central principles and policies, brought into full play its  advantages in being close to Hong Kong and Macao and having many  of its nationals abroad, energetically pushed forward various  market-oriented reforms, and made great efforts to open wider to  the outside world, thus enabling the province's national economy  to enter the best historical period since the founding of the  People's Republic. With an average annual growth rate of 13.8  percent GDP, it doubled and quadrupled the 1980 figures in 1987  and 1992 respectively. In the course of development, the  industrial structure has also been optimized, with the  composition of the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries  readjusted from 30:46:24 to 20:46:34. Guangdong's comprehensive  economic power has substantially increased and the people's  living standards have markedly improved.  <H5>  Guangdong Has Considerably Increased Its Economic Power </H5>   Since the early 1990's, encouraged by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's  important talks during his trip to southern China and by the  spirit of the 14th Party Congress, we have seized the opportune  moment to formulate a (draft) development program for the next  20 years and, with the establishment of a socialist market  economy in mind, advanced reform, opened wider to the outside  world, and quickened the pace toward the goal of basically  achieving modernization in 20 years. In the three years between  1991 and 1993, we scored substantial achievements.    1. Rapid GDP growth. During those three years, Guangdong's  annual GDP grew at 17.3, 22, and 21 percent respectively,  surpassing the 12.9 percent annual growth rate laid down in the  (draft) development program for the next 20 years. The 1993 GDP  was 314 billion yuan and the per capita GDP was 4,830 yuan. It  is estimated that Guangdong will octuple the 1980 GDP figure in  1997 and thus attain the 7,200 yuan per capita GDP quota set for  the year 2000 ahead of time.    2. New developments in the export-oriented economy. During  those three years, Guangdong's foreign trade volume grew by  29.6, 34.7, and 11.8 percent respectively and its proportion of  the nation's export volume rose from one-fifth to one-quarter.  There was an even bigger increase in the actual use of foreign  capital with over 40,000 registered foreign-invested enterprises  and over 30,000 enterprises engaging in the three forms of  import processing and compensation trade. The export-oriented  economy has become an important pillar of the Guangdong economy.    3. Major steps taken in infrastructural construction. To  gradually shake off the backward situation in infrastructural  construction which has restricted Guangdong's development, we  concentrated our forces on the development of communications,  energy, telecommunications, and other infrastructure. The last  three years has seen the largest investment scale and the  fastest rate of construction since the founding of the People's  Republic. In 1993 alone, Guangdong increased its generator  capacity by 3.88 million kw, accounting for 27 percent of the  nation's newly increased volume, and built or rebuilt 1,349 km  of first- and second-class highways. The continued improvement  of the infrastructure has created good conditions for  Guangdong's future development.    4. Marked improvement in the people's living standards. The  rapid economic growth has brought increased material benefits to  the people. In 1993 the wage level of workers and staff members  rose further and, on the basis of a 24.8 percent increase in the  1992 payroll, grew by another 32.8 percent; the peasant per  capita net income was 1,675 yuan, an increase of 367 yuan over  the previous year, which had seen an increase of 165 yuan over  1991. After allowing for price rises, the income of urban  residents and peasants rose by 10.1 and 6.1 percent  respectively. The balance of savings deposits by urban and  rural residents has grown by about 40 billion yuan annually over  the past three years.    New Developments in Introduction of Foreign Capital    [WEN WEI PO] What is the current situation regarding the  introduction of foreign capital to Guangdong? What does  Guangdong plan to do in the future?    [Zhu] Since the early 1990's, Guangdong has seen an  unprecedentedly good momentum in the use of foreign capital.  The amount of foreign capital actually used has risen by a  large margin annually. According to statistics, it was $2.583  billion in 1991, an increase of 27.7 percent over the previous  year; $4.861 billion in 1992, up 88.2 percent; and $9.652  billion in 1993, up 98.6 percent. In those three years, we  actually used $17.096 billion, more than the sum total for the  whole of the 1980's. This has effectively made up for the  shortfall in Guangdong's construction funds and played an  important role in the development of Guangdong's national  economy.    Since the early 1990's, Guangdong's use of foreign capital  has shown the following new features: First, the flow of  foreign capital has become more rational and the investment  pattern has further optimized. Foreign investment has spread to  the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, involving all  trades and professions. There are energy, communications,  telecommunications, and other infrastructural projects, as well  as crop farming, aquaculture, intensive processing of farm and  sideline products, and other agricultural development projects;  technological transformation of old enterprises, new and high  technology, and capital-intensive projects; and information,  technological development, engineering design, property agency,  real estate, advertisement, decoration, insurance, and other  tertiary industrial projects. The flow of foreign capital to  communications, energy, and other infrastructure, as well as  tertiary industry, has markedly increased in recent years.  Second, the investment scale has expanded and the number of  large foreign enterprises and consortia investing in Guangdong  has increased. For example, foreign investment accounts for 40  percent of the total investment in Plant C of Shajiao Power  Plant, which comes to $1.965 billion; it accounts for 474  million yuan of the 1.6 billion yuan in total investment for the  eastern section of the Shenzhen-Shantou Expressway; and it  accounts for 40 percent, or 2.32 billion yuan, of the total  investment in the eastern lane of the Guangzhou-Zhuhai  Expressway, which comes to 5.8 billion yuan. The U.S.  consortium, A.G. Corporation, has invested $250 million in the  Huizhou-Heyuan Expressway; foreign investment accounts for 45  percent of the total investment in the Zhuhai Power Plant, which  comes to $1.18 billion. These investments have all been made in  recent years. Third, the sources of foreign capital are varied.  The foreign businesses investing in Guangdong are not  restricted to Hong Kong, Macao, and a handful of countries but  cover nearly 50 countries and regions in the whole world. A  pattern of pluralistic sources of investment is gradually taking  shape. Fourth, the work of using foreign capital in mountain  areas or underdeveloped areas has developed rapidly. These areas  are rich in natural resources. With the constant improvement of  the investment environment, plus the relatively low prices of  labor and land, these areas have now become new hot spots for  foreign investments. According to statistics, the six cities  situated in mountain areas, Shaoguan, Qingyuan, Zhaoqing,  Heyuan, Meizhou, and Shanwei, actually used a total of $380  million in foreign capital in 1992, an increase of 150 percent  over the previous year. The use of foreign capital reached a  new high in 1993, reaching $801 million, an increase of 110  percent over the previous year.    Now that Guangdong is forging ahead toward the grand  objective of basically achieving modernization in 20 years, it  needs to import large amounts of construction funds and  technology. It has decided to take the following measures:    1. In light of the economic development level in the  different areas of Guangdong, we will match the work of using  foreign capital to the conditions in the special economic zones,  the open cities, the coastal open economic zones, and the  mountain regions, bring their advantages into play, and advance  comprehensively. As regards the method of using foreign  capital, we shall use both tangible funds, such as capital and  equipment, and intangible funds, such as patents, trademarks,  techniques, and technologies; the channels of using foreign  capital can be varied, such as direct investment, loans by  international financial organs and foreign governments, and  securities investments. The localities and enterprises using  foreign capital should use capital not only from Hong Kong and  Macao but also from other countries and regions. In particular,  they should use as much capital and technology as possible from  large enterprises and consortia in other countries.    2. Boost and accelerate adjustment of the industrial  structure with the introduction of foreign capital. On the  basis of doing a good job in evaluating assets and registering  property rights, some state-owned enterprises and foreign-funded  enterprises can sell some of their interests to foreign  businesses. In accordance with the state's industrial  preferential policy, we will offer corresponding preferential  treatment to foreign investments which conform to the state's  industrial policy. Under the present circumstances, we  particularly encourage foreign businesses to directly invest in  high and new technology industries, energy projects, ports and  wharves, highways, airports, and local railway construction  projects, as well as petrochemical, automobile, electronics,  metallurgical, construction materials, and other pillar  industries. Moreover, we shall also systematically absorb  foreign investment in banking, commerce, communications,  tourism, and other tertiary industies. We will strive to set up  more branches of foreign-funded banks and Sino-foreign joint  venture banks in Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Foreign businesses are  welcome to invest in and operate real estate and to gradually  move from the coastal to the interior mountain areas. In  tourism, we will absorb foreign capital for the development of  tourism resources and the construction of tourist and holiday  resorts. Therefore, there are very broad prospects for foreign  businessmen to invest in Guangdong.    Improve the Environment To Attract Foreign Businesses    3. Create a more favorable soft and hard environment for  foreign investment. We should step up the construction of  power, ports, wharves, expressways, modern telecommunications  and information networks, and other infrastructure and strive to  improve the work efficiency and service quality of customs,  border inspection, commodity inspection, and transport  departments, raise the benefit of imported projects, and  maintain a good debt repayment capability. At present,  particular attention should be paid to the following two  aspects: First, keep on improving policies. While  comprehensively pushing ahead with various reforms to establish  a socialist market economy, in light of the new developments and  problems that have cropped up in the course of reform and in  coordination with the actual situation in our province, we  should promptly formulate support policies and establish a  perfect set of rules and regulations involving foreign investors  so that foreign businesses can have rules to go by when  investing in Guangdong and their legitimate rights and interests  can be protected. Second, energetically develop a foreign  investment service system in society as a whole. Further  efforts should be made to establish and improve, within foreign  economic relations and trade departments at all levels in  Guangdong, the foreign investment service establishments which  practice enterprise-style management, focus on services, charge  rationally, and win the trust of foreign businesses through  high-quality service. Foreign investment service establishments  set up in the departments in charge of major industries will  coordinate with the service establishments set up in foreign  economic relations and trade departments. With the coordination  of the associations of foreign-invested enterprises in the  province and cities, these establishments will form a service  network crisscrossing the province and providing policy and  legal consultancy as well as other services. We will set up  more enterprises serving foreign-invested enterprises like the  Shenzhen Capital Goods Service Center.    4. Constantly improve the planning and initiative in the  work of inviting investments. The Guangdong Provincial  Investment Invitation Bureau has been set up. Its principal  task is to synthesize and coordinate the province's work of  inviting investment, act as a go-between for foreign businesses  investing in Guangdong, and provide foreign businesses with  efficient services, such as organizing trade talks, arranging  for investment spots, and examining and approving projects.  <H5>  Smooth Progress in Various Reforms </H5>   [WEN WEI PO] What is the main direction of your attack in  the year of storming heavily-fortified positions in reform?  What are the measures?    [Zhu] This is a crucial year for comprehensively deepening  the reform. It can also be called a "year of storming heavily  fortified positions in reform." In line with the state plan to  "make breakthroughs in some key areas and press ahead with the  whole project," we will conscientiously do a good job of reform  in seven aspects: Fiscal and tax, banking, foreign trade,  enterprise, social security, urban housing, and government  institutions. Viewed from the practice during the first five  months of this year, the reforms in our province have made  smooth progress and have been well coordinated. This has  boosted Guangdong's national economy. In the first four months  of this year, Guangdong's total industrial output value was  125.34 billion yuan, an increase of 22.5 percent over the same  period of last year; export volume was $11.467 billion, up 115.4  percent; the foreign capital actually used was $2.187 billion,  up 37.6 percent; the balance of bank savings deposits was  273.584 billion yuan, an increase of 25.202 billion yuan over  the figure at the end of last year; financial revenue was 8.445  billion yuan, up 46 percent, which includes a 49.5-percent  increase in industrial and commercial tax income; and the rising  trend of prices has been curbed. These show that the central  measures for pressing ahead with the various reforms to  establish a socialist market economy are correct. In deepening  various reforms, we should make great headway in three aspects:    1. Speed up the change of enterprise operational mechanism  and establish a modern enterprise system to lay a good  foundation for the establishment of a socialist market economic  structure. Do a good job of the various basic tasks for the  establishment of a modern enterprise system, focusing on  continued implementation of the "PRC Law on Industrial  Enterprises Under Ownership by the Whole People" and the State  Council's "Regulations on the Change of Operational Mechanism in  Industrial Enterprises Under Ownership by the Whole People" and  earnestly put into effect enterprise decisionmaking powers in  operation and management. We should comprehensively implement  the "General Rule on Enterprise Finance" and the "Criteria for  Enterprise Accounting" and establish an enterprise financial and  accounting system in keeping with international practices.  Guangdong has selected 250 enterprises of different types to  experiment with the establishment of a modern enterprise system  and then to gradually popularize the experience we have gained.  Starting with clarification of property rights, we will launch  in 1,200 enterprises the work of reappraising the stocks and  assets, defining property rights, assessing assets, authorizing  capital, and registering property rights and strive to explore  the method of diversifying the composition of state-owned  enterprise property rights. Meanwhile, we should establish and  perfect a system for managing state-owned assets and an  effective system of operations to ensure the preservation and  increase of the value of state assets. In keeping with the  provisions of the "Corporate Law," we will systematically  implement a corporate system among existing enterprises in light  of different conditions and reorganize them into joint-stock  companies, limited liability companies, and sole corporations;  all new enterprises should practice the corporate system. The  process of implementing the modern enterprise system should be  closely combined with improvements in enterprise quality and the  promotion of enterprise development.    Use Considerable Force To Reform the Fiscal and Tax  Structure    2. Do a good job in reforming the fiscal and tax structure  to ensure that enterprises can compete on an equal basis and  that the government macroeconomic regulation and control  capability can be increased. We started reforming the  tax-sharing system and the financial management system in 1994.  That is to say, in line with the division of authority between  the central and local governments, we have rationally defined  the scope of financial expenses at different levels and, in line  with the principle of combining authority which controls  enterprises and undertakings with financial power, uniformly  divided the tax categories into central tax, local tax, and tax  shared by central and local governments and established the  central tax collection and local tax collection systems.  Meanwhile, we have also conducted reform of the tax system. Its  main contents include: Establishing a unified personal income  tax; unifying the income tax of domestically funded enterprises  as of 1994 and, as the next step, unifying the income tax of  domestically funded and foreign-funded enterprises; reforming  the circulating tax, which consists of the value-add tax,  consumption tax, and sales tax and is uniformly applicable to  both domestically funded and foreign-funded enterprises, and  abolishing the industrial and commercial consolidated tax  imposed on foreign-funded enterprises; and imposing the land  value-added tax (not implemented for the time being), securities  transaction tax, and estate and gift taxes.    Due to the strong force of the current fiscal and tax  reform,  which involves a wide-ranging area, some enterprises were unable  to adapt themselves at the beginning and some foreign businesses  had misgivings. Through publicity and explanations by the  relevant government departments, large numbers of enterprises,  cadres, and people have a fairly comprehensive understanding of  the new fiscal and tax structure, thus ensuring the smooth  implementation of the new structure. Some aspects of the fiscal  and tax reform have yet to be improved and coordinated in  practice and detailed rules and regulations have yet to be  worked out on certain issues. In short, in conducting this  reform we should not only expand the financial sources but also  arouse the enthusiasm of all quarters.    3. Steadily push forward banking reform to promote the  benign cycle of economic construction. We should vigorously  organize implementation of the state's banking reform program  and, in light of the state-defined credit scale, ensure the  correct flow of capital and increase its use efficiency so that  economic construction can run smoothly. It is necessary to  bring into fuller play the advantages of existing local banking  institutions in flexible operations, such as the Guangdong  International Trust and Investment Corporation and the Guangdong  Development Bank, and develop overseas business while stepping  up management. We must speed up the development of Guangdong as  a financial center and establish a unified and standardized  financial market across the province. Further efforts should be  made to improve the Shenzhen Securities Exchange and the  Guangzhou Nanfang Securities Trading Center and increase the  number of listed securities. We should strive to list more  companies in the securities markets outside the border and  energetically raise fund for the construction of infrastructure  in Guangdong.    To ensure the smooth progress of various reforms, we should  also speed up implementation of a new, unified social security  system, establish and improve a system for the socialized  supervision and service of social security, continue the  comprehensive implementation of the "Provisional Regulations of  Guangdong Province on Social Endowment Insurance" and, where  conditions permit, experiment with an endowment insurance system  in the rural areas which relies mainly on individual reserves  and accumulation with a community assistance subsidiary.</p>

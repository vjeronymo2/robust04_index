			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Insurance gripes ensure busy future for ombudsman: An old watchdog's influence is set to be narrowed but its workload may not shrink The manner of Mr Julian Farrand's departure from his post as insurance ombudsman at the beginning of this month will not have made his successor's task any easier. His valedictory comments highlighted what he found unsatisfactory in the reducing remit of the insurance ombudsman. Mr Farrand said that he had resigned as insurance ombudsman after a long period of 'disillusionment' over the office's future. He was particularly critical of the new watchdog set up to protect the private investor, the Personal Investment Authority, which he said was undermining the ombudsman's position with its scheme. He had spent some months searching for new appointments before being confirmed as the new pensions ombudsman from the start of next month. 'I preferred the challenge of being in a developed and enlarged role to remaining in something with a diminishing significance,' he said. From the perspective of the existing insurance ombudsman scheme, there are certain difficulties arising from the establishment of the PIA. At the very least there will be a contrast with the apparently inexorable growth in the ombudsman's workload since the scheme was set up in 1981 on the initiative of only three insurance companies. First, the existence of a new, compulsory PIA ombudsman scheme is bound to mean a smaller area of responsibility for the insurance ombudsman, since the PIA ombudsman will deal with cases relating to the marketing of regulated financial services. Second, there is uncertainty about how much more than the minimum will be transferred to the PIA ombudsman. For example, an insurance company can choose to leave problems relating to administration - as opposed to the sale of a life policy - with the insurance ombudsman. Many may decide, however, to take advantage of the further, optional element in the PIA ombudsman scheme and transfer all cases on life business to the PIA scheme, leaving the insurance ombudsman with cases relating only to general insurance. Third, there is the question of the maximum award payable by an insurer. Mr Farrand has made no secret of his concern that while the maximum payout the insurance ombudsman can insist on is Pounds 100,000, the maximum compulsory award in the PIA ombudsman scheme will be only half that amount. The new arrangement stems from the report by Lord Ackner, a former law lord, on the establishment of a PIA ombudsman. He said the new scheme should be concerned with breaches of the rules rather than to a more discretionary system of what was fair and reasonable. With different ways of working, it makes some sense for the two types of ombudsman scheme to be separate, despite the risk that some issues may fall between the two schemes. It is not yet clear whether the lower limit for a maximum award under the new scheme will turn out to be a severe constraint in practice. Only one financial services dispute settled so far this year has ended in an award of more than Pounds 50,000, and none has exceeded Pounds 100,000. While the PIA ombudsman can recommend a review of the maximum award, the ceiling is unlikely to rise much, if at all, because of the extra difficulty this would cause for independent financial advisers in obtaining professional indemnity insurance. More generally, Ms Barbara Saunders, chairman of the insurance ombudsman council and a PIA board member, insists that the PIA scheme does not undermine the work of the insurance ombudsman, even though financial services work currently makes up more than one-third of the case load. Some staff are transferring to the PIA scheme, and Ms Saunders says that the recent confirmation that transfer of undertaking regulations will apply has removed some doubts about what this might mean. 'Job insecurity is no longer an issue,' she says. She admits, however, that some months of uncertainty do lie ahead over what matters go to the PIA on the voluntary basis. With the process of admitting companies to the new regulator still under way, Ms Saunders believes it is unlikely that the arrangements for financial services administration cases will be finalised before the beginning of next year. Companies will have to tell their customers what arrangements have been made, but the prospect of confusion looms large. Even if - as seems most likely - the insurance ombudsman loses jurisdiction for all new financial services disputes, the workload for the new ombudsman  -who is expected to be announced next week - and supporting staff will not be reduced drastically overnight. The office will continue to be responsible for dealing with a wide range of general insurance cases - from the one-week travel policy to household building and contents cover. 'By the end of this year, the number of general insurance cases we will have dealt with will be the equivalent of the total number of life and general insurance cases in 1992,' says Ms Saunders. If the future of the insurance ombudsman scheme is safe unless there is a massive rise in customer satisfaction with insurance companies, it looks as though it will remain securely in place for a long time to come.

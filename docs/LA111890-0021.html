			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> BACH: "ITALIAN" CONCERTO; FRENCH SUITE NO. 5; FRENCH OVERTURE, BWV 831.  </P> <P> Andras Schiff, piano. Omega OCD 1014. Schiff's Bach playing can seem  two-dimensional to the Gould-touched listener. Here, Schiff subverts all detail  to the melodic line, which he explores in a calm, singing style, always  avoiding overstatement. Coloristic shadings and varied articulation, too, are  eschewed. Yet these undemonstrative readings are engaging in their own way, as  a study in Bach's flowing melodicism. TIMOTHY MANGAN  </P></p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (1): A time for fresh ideas - The airlines and their corporate clients both believe that the business travel budget will be spent more carefully in the 1990s than in the high-spending 1980s. They must either push for cheaper seats or implement a more radical change THE recession has splintered the conformist world of business air travel. It has drained first-class and business-class cabins of serious fare-payers and filled the seats with frequent flyer upgrades. Deprived of high-paying passengers, the airline industry is losing money fast - Dollars 10bn in the past three years. At the same time, the tide of aviation deregulation has divided airline executives over which strategy to adopt in order to return their business to profit. Should they follow accepted wisdom learned during decades of growth before the recession? Or has the world changed, demanding fresh thinking? The debate is yet to be resolved, but at stake is a large chunk of more than Dollars 150bn a year spent by Europe's businesses on travel and entertainment. Among the airlines, the protagonists fall into three camps. There are the traditionalists such as British Airways, American Airlines and Swissair. They continue to raise standards, even though this means maintaining high prices and perhaps frightening off cash-strapped customers. The logic is simple. Regular surveys of business passengers' preferences by the International Air Transport Association (Iata) show that seat size is the top priority. This year's survey, just published, says that more than 88 per cent of travellers in business and first class rated the size of their seat as their 'preferred aspect of business-class travel'. They ranked physical discomfort as by far the worst aspect of long-haul travel. Knowing what their customers wanted, airlines have charged an ever-widening premium for the privilege of space. Even after two years of recession, a first-class return between London and New York on British Airways costs Pounds 3,870; business class costs about Pounds 2,100. By contrast, the Apex economy fare is Pounds 399 and in this spring's price war a ticket can be had for Pounds 259. Even on short-haul routes, some airlines consider they can sell higher-price tickets on the basis of providing more leg-room. Swissair is building separate business-class cabins for short-haul services and charging appropriately for the privilege of sitting there. On most short-haul flights, business-class passengers sit in the same size of seats as economy-class passengers. Their ticket buys a faster check-in, bigger baggage allowance and slightly better food. The traditional airlines strive to maintain their premium prices for heavily-advertised products. But they are occasionally forced to follow the moves of the second group of airlines, the old-style entrepreneurs such as British Midland and KLM, the Dutch carrier. Old-style entrepreneurs want to sell on price competition, even though this puts at risk the perceived quality of their product and hurts revenues per seat. It is a high-risk strategy, however. Several old-style entrepreneurs have in the past few weeks launched products aimed at the budget-conscious business traveller. On short-haul routes in Europe, for example, British Midland, in which Scandinavian Airline System (SAS) has a 40 per cent stake, cut many of its fares. It was followed rapidly by KLM, the Dutch flag carrier, Aer Lingus, the Irish state airline and Air France, normally one of the traditionalists. Finally, this month BA cut its fares to match its rivals. These cuts come on top of the general price lowering effect of old-style entrepreneurs. On London-Frankfurt routes there are just two traditionalists flying, BA and Lufthansa, and both charge more than Pounds 350 for a standard business-class return. The return business-class fare for the slightly shorter London-Amsterdam route, on which four airlines including British Midland an KLM compete, is Pounds 218. Long-haul has seen price cuts, too. Singapore Airlines and Qantas have been battling it out on routes between Europe and south-east Asia. The price of a London to Singapore business-class return ticket fell this winter from Pounds 2,200 to about Pounds 1,500. Finally, the third group of airlines is the radical entrepreneurs such as UK carrier Virgin Atlantic Airways and Continental of the US. In the battle against the high-investing big guns, they are prepared to abolish the traditional class structure of aircraft and try to sell something entirely new. These two carriers offer, for example, a combination of a first class-size seats and business-class levels of service. The strategy is not wholly new. Since 1984, Virgin has been selling its Upper Class with first class-style sleeper seats at business-class prices. Upper Class does not offer many of the luxuries, such as second helpings of caviar or Krug champagne found on other carriers. Nevertheless, it has been successful enough for Virgin to launch its Mid-Class service last summer with business class-sized seats selling at the price of a standard economy fare. But Virgin is a relatively small airline. Rivals did not feel a need to match it, until now. In January 1993, Continental, the US carrier which is operating under the protection of Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy laws, launched Business First. The strategy, like Virgin's, was to abandon first-class fares. Continental's business-class fare-payers now get first class-style sleeper seats and a crew-to-passenger ratio of 1:6, compared with a typical 1:10 ratio on most north Atlantic business-class routes. Why are there such diverse responses among the airlines to a simple fall in demand? One reason is that the phenomenon is new. Every year since the Second World War until 1991, global air traffic grew. With the growth came a culture of discounting to attract economy-class passengers and luxury at a price for business and first class. As Air France puts it: 'the people at the front of the plane paid for those at the back.' As the flow of profits from the front has dried up, many big-name airlines found it hard to run economy class for profit. Their losses have been embarrassingly high, compared with the performance of some budget carriers that have always run economy for profit. Two airlines that caught the envious attention of their big brethren by making money from cheap seats are Dallas-based Southwest Airlines and Corse Air in France. Even the most traditional of airlines now admits that it may eventually have to turn to radical solutions. They acknowledge that the high profit margin, super-luxury product they have been offering may no longer be appropriate. 'Some airlines may follow Continental (and drop first class). Some seem to be holding on for recovery but nevertheless concede that there is a chance they will reduce the number of first class seats,' says Mr David Coltman, vice-president of US carrier United Airlines' Atlantic division. Some airlines want to keep a top price product but are repackaging luxury as something more businesslike. Air France is one: 'In the past we have marketed Concorde as lavish and unobtainable. We now want to market it as a business tool, perhaps as a westbound flight combined with an overnight return in first class,' says the airline. Air France's desire to make Concorde more accessible is clear in its fare structure: its Concorde return trip from Paris to New York costs little more than a first-class ticket - and is about Pounds 2,000 cheaper than BA's Concorde flight from London. A solution which can be more widely adopted is the running of classes as separate profit centres. If this were to happen, the subsidy that business-class passengers effectively paid to economy passengers should shrink. Instead of lifestyle marketing, they could be on the receiving end of more discounting and special offers. Some travel agents are already preparing for such changes. Thomas Cook, for example, this month launches itself as a cost-cutting agent for companies. It will charge a fee based on the savings it makes for companies rather than as a percentage commission on the price of the ticket from the airline. The airlines recognise this heightened cash consciousness among their business customers. 'Companies are now having to take a more disciplined approach to spending,' says Mr Chris Gilbert, UK sales manager of American Airlines. Both the airlines and their corporate clients believe that the business travel budget will be spent more carefully in the 1990s than in the high-spending 1980s. They must choose whether to push for cheaper seats to cut industry's costs, or to implement a more radical change away from air travel as a luxurious experience to its use as part of a business, more like the car or the computer.</p>

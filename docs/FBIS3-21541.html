			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A briefing held yesterday at the Ukrainian Foreign  Ministry assessed the publication with a pretentious heading --  commander in chief disclaims responsibility for safety of  nuclear missiles in Ukraine -- published by the newspaper  IZVESTIYA on 22 February 1994 as a regular attempt of specific  circles in the Russian Federation to exacerbate  Russian-Ukrainian relations. Our correspondent Ihor Bak was  present at this briefing.    [Begin Bak recording] First of all, I would like to clarify  the matter for those who had not read this article. It says  that Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander in chief of the  Russian Strategic Missile Forces, disclaims responsibility for  the safety of nuclear missiles deployed on Ukrainian soil. He  reported on his decision in an official letter to the Russian  defense minister. IZVESTIYA cites this letter and the facts  which, as IZVESTIYA puts it, can cause social explosion in the  missile units deployed on Ukrainian territory and produce  unforeseeable consequences.    Therefore, at the briefing, Colonel General Ivan Bizhan,  Ukrainian deputy defense minister, refuted all the figures and  facts cited by IZVESTIYA. He admitted as trustworthy only the  information on the number of launchers for SS-19 and SS-24  missiles which remained in combat readiness. Ivan Bizhan deemed  as an invention claims that the commander of the 43d Missile  Army Uladymir Mikhtyuk was forced to swear the Ukrainian loyalty  oath. He is commander of the Army in which the prevailing  majority of officers and warrant officers had voluntarily sworn  allegiance to Ukraine. Moreover, history [as heard] makes  officers -- who for some reasons do not want to do it -- swear  loyalty to Ukraine. Due to the fact that they are specialists  needed by Ukraine, nobody dismisses them from their positions.  The officer strength level in the Ukrainian Missile Forces  stands at over 85 percent and not at 60 percent, as IZVESTIYA  reports. There are no reasons to make a fuss concerning the  nuclear weapons in Ukraine, stated Ukrainian Deputy Foreign  Minister Borys Tarasyuk, at the briefing. At the same time, he  drew the attention of the journalists to the fact that IZVESTIYA  had more than once published texts of coded messages and other  classified documents. Therefore, this newspaper violates the  agreement on state secrets signed by CIS states. [end recording]</p>

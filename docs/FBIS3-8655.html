			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A statement issued by the Foreign Minister  expresses serious concern regarding the continuing incident with  the Bulgarian vessel the Khan Kubrat. Despite the initial  promises of assistance made by the responsible Serbian bodies  and their assurances that the vessel and its cargo were under  control, the fuel cargo is being discharged from the Khan Kubrat  barge train.    The Foreign Ministry insists that the unloading operation  should be stopped immediately and the ship returned to Bulgaria  together with its cargo and crew.    The commander of a military patrol launch belonging to the  Western European Union has reported to the State Navigation  Inspectorate in Vidin that at about 2200 hours [2000 GMT] this  evening the Khan Kubrat vessel is expected to arrive in the port  of Vidin together with its crew. The monitoring bodies have  made arrangements for the reception of the vessel.</p>

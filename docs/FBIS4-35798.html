			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement from the Presidential Office in Heliopolis, Cairo </F> on 6 June -- read by announcer]    [Text] The Arab Republic of Egypt looks with deep concern  and sorrow at the serious escalation of military operations in  sister Yemen over the past few days; the escalation that has  expanded the scope of war and intensified its repercussions and  negative reflections. The situation is no longer restricted to  bloodshed and the annihilation of lives; destruction has now  extended to economic institutions and oil foundations. This  involves dire risks that undermine the interests of the Yemeni  people, both in the north and south, and further complicates the  regional situation.    It is strange that this regrettable escalation should occur  in spite of the numerous assurances Egypt has received from the  Yemeni leadership, which pledged not to touch the oil  foundations or economic institutions. These institutions belong  to the Yemeni people and are crucial to secure their livelihood  and develop their present and future resources. Accordingly, no  one has the right to tamper with them or use them as a  bargaining chip or instrument to put pressure.    Egypt regrets the continued and intensified bloodshed in  spite of the Arab League appeals, the efforts it exerted, and  the issuance of UN Security Council Resolution 924 which calls  for an immediate cease-fire.    Appealing to officials in sister Yemen to avert further  deterioration and to sincerely comply with the resolutions of  the Arab household and the international legitimacy, Egypt  denounces any action that would lead to the continuation or  escalation of warfare.</p>

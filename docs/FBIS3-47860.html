			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prince Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime minister, has  said that relations with Malaysia and Indonesia are vitally  important since Cambodia never has any problems with those  countries. Meeting with reporters, the prince said that the  kingdom has received the credentials of ambassadors from 55  countries. Some are not residing in the country yet and have  carried out their duties from various other cities, such as  Bangkok and Beijing. Somehow, the diplomatic ties between our  Cambodia and those countries have been reinforced and expanded.    The prince added: Our country is considering the possibility  of establishing an embassy in Malaysia, since the good relations  between the two countries have continued to improve. As for the  ties with Thailand, they have progressed, but recently we have  had some problems with the Thais. We still have border  demarcation problems with Thailand and Vietnam. Among our  neighbors, Laos is our best friend. For this reason, we have  permitted the Lao to use the port in Sihanoukville while they  have allowed us to use their airport in Vientiane. What we have  done is in the interests of both countries.    The prince also said that the creation of a border committee  proposed by Thailand represents the position of the Royal  Government of Cambodia [RGC]. The only way to solve the border  problems is to adopt the Cambodian map of the 1960s, which  indicates that Cambodia has an area of (191,055) square  kilometers. International observers should use the map to  establish the borders and to draw up a report concerning the  matter for their headquarters in New York.    Answering a question about the problem of illegal  immigrants,  the prince said the government has never persecuted immigrants,  especially the Vietnamese. Rebutting a Vietnamese human rights  group charge that the RGC has committed human rights violations,  the prince said: Instead we have ensured security for them  (?for humanitarian reasons). He added that illegal immigrants  do not consist of only Vietnamese but also Thais, Chinese, and  other people coming from various regions, and that this issue  will be completely settled after the National Assembly adopts an  immigration law in the near future.    Commenting on the concerns of foreign investors, the prince  said the RGC has no intention of revising contracts concluded  previously. The RGC, however, will review those transactions.  The prince also said: The issues concerning (?business deals)  and a floating hotel have already been settled once and for all.  We only want to legalize their businesses with appropriate  contracts.</p>

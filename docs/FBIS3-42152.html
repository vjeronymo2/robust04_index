			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent William Waack in Berlin] </F>   [Text] Germany is prepared to renounce its nuclear  agreement with Brazil, suspend any transfer of high technology  (including that for submarines and space exploration), and  withdraw its support for the Brazilian candidacy to a permanent  seat in the future UN Security Council unless the Brazilian  Senate ratifies those treaties whereby Brazilian nuclear  activities are subjected to international inspections and  controls. The governments of Brazil and Germany are concerned  about the Senate's position, which could markedly undermine the  visit Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim will make to Bonn  late this month.    The main items on the agenda of Brazilian-German relations  --  including technological cooperation to be implemented by the  private sector -- now depends on the position of the Brazilian  Government on the subject of nonproliferation of nuclear  technology. In Bonn, the seat of the German Government, there  exists the conviction that the overall credibility of the German  foreign policy -- especially in the eyes of its western  counterparts -- would be jeopardized if it does not discontinue  every form of cooperation on advanced technology with Brazil  should the Brazilian Senate fail to ratify two treaties: One  containing amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty (which bans  nuclear weapons in Latin America and establishes controls) and a  quadripartite agreement signed by Brazil, Argentina, the  (Vienna-based) International Atomic Energy Agency, and by the  recently created joint Brazilian-Argentine agency (which  establishes comprehensive inspections and controls on nuclear  activities by the two countries, which are described as "full  scope safeguards." [given in English]    German laws require, irrespective of which party is in the  government at the end of this year (general elections are  scheduled for 16 October), that the Brazilian-German nuclear  agreement signed in June 1976 be renounced. Through this  agreement, Brazil gained access to various stages of the nuclear  fuel cycle, in addition to obtaining technological transfer and  to reaching a commitment to build two large nuclear reactors  (Angra-2 and Angra-3). The German Government cannot cooperate  with a country which is not a signatory of the Non-proliferation  Treaty (NPT) -- which is the case of Brazil -- or which has not  agreed to another international control regime. Unless it is  rescinded by either of the two parties, the agreement will be  automatically renewed at the end of 1994 for another five years.    To maintain its credibility, the German Government is  prepared to go as far as shouldering the financial consequences  of reneging the contracts to build the Angra-2 plant, which is  guaranteed by the Hermes insurance company (that is, German  taxpayers may lose hundreds of millions of marks).    There is adequate parliamentary support for the government  to  take such a decisive course of action. An influential group of  Social Democratic deputies has been campaigning since last year  to get the nuclear agreement renounced on the grounds that  Brazil has failed to join the NPT and that it refuses to submit  its activities to international inspection. Most conservative  deputies of the ruling German party (the Christian Democratic  Union) firmly believe that "if the price to pay to secure a  permanent seat for Germany on the UN Security Council is to  support irresponsible countries like Brazil or Nigeria, it would  be a very high price to pay," as a leading spokesman for the  Christian Democratic bloc recently put it to a ranking Brazilian  counterpart in Bonn.    The German reaction to the Brazilian Senate's behavior has  been unanimously conveyed by several German circles, the private  sector included. "Brazil will not receive a single screw from  Germany if the Senate fails to ratify these treaties," is a  widely repeated phrase. The campaign on the nuclear issue has  already had an impact on other sectors: A visit to Germany  scheduled for February by a Brazilian delegation has been  canceled without clear explanations. This delegation was to have  studied the impact of Brazil's proclaimed decision to join the  Missile Technology Control Regime (its English acronym is MTCR)  on Brazilian-German space exploration projects, which is being  partially implemented by a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz.  According to a high-placed source in Bonn, Siemens executives  have also voiced concern about the fact that the Brazilian  Senate is provoking a situation which in practice will preclude  any advanced technology transfer to Brazil.    Brazil is on the "H list" (from which Argentina has just  been  excluded), which forces any German exporter or supplier of  sensitive technology item to Brazil to obtain special  authorizations before concluding any deal. It has been stated  in Bonn that if the Senate fails to accept international  controls on Brazilian nuclear programs, the above requirement  would also be applied to projects such as the transfer of  technology for building conventional submarines. Yet, if the  Senate ratifies these agreements, the German Government would be  willing to consider building a nuclear powered submarine -- a  major project of the Brazilian Navy -- as "a borderline case"  not explicitly banned by the Tlatelolco Treaty or by the  quadripartite treaty. This project may thus be continued.    There has been wide speculation and conjectures in Bonn  about  the existence of "skeletons in the closets" of the military;  that is, about whether international inspection teams may yet  find undisclosed atomic projects in Brazil. The German  Government speculates as to whether the reasons behind  non-ratification is prompted by the Brazilian Senate's failure  to understand that this is a far-reaching subject that it has  many implications, or whether there are "other motives" for its  reluctance to agree to the international inspections. In  official and unofficial remarks, German officials have noted,  however, that they have no indication to conclude that Brazil is  running undisclosed parallel atomic programs.    The German Government is both perplexed and scared by  Brazil.  It has been openly contended here that a few powerful people  are hurting the interests of the Brazilian nation in the name of  "things of the past and of outdated positions," an argument that  is often used to refer to the Brazilian Senate. Officially, the  German Government is not supporting any country in the  reorganization and (expansion) process of the UN Security  Council. Informally, however, it is known that Bonn would  support Brazil at the United Nations. Yet, this will  fundamentally depend now on the nuclear issue.    German perplexity does not stem from the behavior of the  legislature -- which is marred by corruption scandals -- alone  but also from that of the executive branch. In Bonn, no one  knows for sure whether the construction of Angra-2 will be  completed. Wishing to conclude the project, the Germans have  expressed desire to supply additional credit and even to finance  Brazilian counterpart funds (nearly $750 million), arguing that  it would be cheaper to complete the 1,300 megawatt plant now  than to cancel the entire project. It is not known, however,  what President Itamar Franco will decide. In 1978, Franco  presided in the Senate a congressional investigating committee  on the Brazilian-German nuclear agreement.    Another problem that scares many people in Germany is the  fact that Brazil is having difficulties in obtaining agreement  with the IMF, a condition for reaching an agreement with the  Paris Club, which encompasses all of Brazilian governmental  creditors. Germany is the main trade partner of Brazil within  the European Union and it is the second leading investor of risk  capital in Brazil, second only to the United States. The German  Government is thus concerned about the constitutional revision  because it believes foreign investors in Brazil are treated  differently from or worse than domestic investors.    It has been noted in Bonn that German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel touched on all these topics during his visit to Brasilia  in October. The Brazilian foreign minister's visit, which seeks  to strengthen German-Brazilian relations, which was described as  strategic for both countries (during the Geisel administration)  could be seriously undermined if the Senate does not change its  position. It is feared that Amorim may come to Bonn only to  hear complaints, without being able to give any kind of  explanation.</p>

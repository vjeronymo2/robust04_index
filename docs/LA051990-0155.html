			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOME DESIGN;  </P> <P> UPS, DOWNS OF STAIRWAYS  </P> <P> Patty Mickey is not one to take no for an answer.  </P> <P> Her Costa Mesa PMA Design Group had created an unusual stair rail design for  Lee West's elegantly appointed condominium on the Lido Peninsula. Several  carpenters said it couldn't be done, but interior designer Mickey persisted.  </P> <P> What was it about the design that made carpenters reluctant to try?  </P> <P> The wooden handrail had unusual curves and no corner support post at the top  where the rail was to curve up as if doubling back on itself. Instead, the  handrail's curving shape would provide the support.  </P> <P> Double beveled glass panels that had to be individually measured and cut were  to be used instead of balusters. Mini-lights were to be installed at the bottom  of the panels and a bridge repeating these materials was to connect the  upstairs landing with the master bedroom.  </P> <P> Then Mickey found master cabinetmaker Tres Converse of Laguna Beach. Even  Converse was reluctant at first, but rather than being stumped, he welcomed the  project as a challenge.  </P> <P> To create the handrail, he had to do forms and layouts for the exact curvature  and then create it on site by heating, bending, clamping and laminating  together thin strips of white oak. The result "really comes off like a piece of  sculpture," Mickey says.  </P> <P> Why go to all this trouble for a stairway?  </P> <P> "It's incredible what a strong statement a stairway and its design make in a  home," says Veronica Lorman, a Newport Beach interior designer.  </P> <P> "It's a really powerful piece of architecture and really sets the tone or helps  to set the tone for the interior design," she says.  </P> <P> "It really is important that (a stairway) blend with everything else that  you're doing in terms of finishes and details with the windows and the moldings  and baseboards," she adds.  </P> <P> Several things need to be considered when designing a staircase, according to  Andrea Holte Hymer of Hymer Design Group in Orange.  </P> <P> Important considerations are: the shape of the staircase, whether it is to be  simple or intricate in design, selection of materials, traffic patterns,  whether a staircase should be solid or made so that it is open and provides a  view of the rooms beyond and whether it should be dramatic or blend passively  into the background.  </P> <P> Materials selection, Hymer says, is based on a house's interior and exterior  style. Materials can be weed, brick, glass, plaster or drywall and metals such  as wrought iron or aluminum dipped or painted with faux finishes.  </P> <P> Hymer worked with homeowner Nadine Tardie to create a charming stairway for her  custom Victorian in Orange. Though Tardie jokingly refers to the stairway as "a  plain Jane," it really sets the tone for her home because it's the first thing  you see when you come in the door. Tardie decided on the style of the stairway  after looking at a parts catalogue for stairs.  </P> <P> The handrail and the treds are oak. A wool carpet with a burgundy background  and a ribbon and flower motif in mauves and gray blues runs up the center of  the steps. The delicate-looking turned balusters are painted white and an  adjoining wall is painted a rose color.  </P> <P> The stairs run straight up to a landing and then make a 180-degree turn up to  the second floor, where a matching railing runs parallel to the stairs. Tardie  says the treds, railing and carpet totaled about $6,000.  </P> <P> Stairways are such an important design element, according to Lorman, that  remodeling an existing stairway can give an older home a whole new look. She  recently completed a project in a 1960s-era condominium in Corona del Mar that  she says was quite unattractive when she started.  </P> <P> The existing stairway had treds that were painted dark brown and had a carpet  runner. There was a metal structure to hold the handrail, which was a  rectangular piece of wood painted brown. And there was an odd open space under  the stairs that served no purpose.  </P> <P> Lorman set out to change this dated look. She had the odd space enclosed for  storage and had a carpenter create a simple new rail system using molding  pieces instead of stock handrail parts. "Once you find the molding, you can put  it together to create this shape as opposed to having to mill something that  would have the kind of detail that's in this," she says.  </P> <P> This neoclassical design features a whitewashed oak handrail atop a series of  groupings of three square posts followed by a small separation before repeating  the grouping. The posts are painted white and the handrail matches flooring in  the entry. The stairs are now covered with a soft gray carpet. "It just turned  out so well," says Lorman. "It made the biggest difference in this space, I  cannot tell you."  </P> <P> Some homeowners who want to remodel stairways are tackling the job themselves,  according to Todd Skinner, general manager of the Hardwood Center in Santa Ana,  which sells oak and paint-grade stair parts and other finish materials such as  moldings and doors.  </P> <P> "There's this growing trend toward people doing it themselves," Skinner says.  "In fact, we give classes two or three times a year on installing a stairway."  He says he gets at least one customer a day who plans a do-it-yourself stair  remodel.  </P> <P> Most people, he says, just want to change a handrail to give a home an updated  look. Skinner says there's sometimes "sticker shock" when he tells them that  materials for basic handrails and posts or balusters average $60 a linear foot.  That means $60 times two for each linear foot, because there are two sides to  most stairways.  </P> <P> He says hiring someone to do installation will at least double that cost and  that's why a lot of people decide to try it themselves.  </P> <P> How hard is it?  </P> <P> "It's really not that difficult," Skinner says. "We tell people it's just  something you can't rush into and expect to get it done because it's a  structural project. . . . It's not something you can just screw together and  put down real quick." And, he admonishes, do-it-yourself stair remodelers  should have "a basic knowledge of woodworking" and need to check on city  building codes regarding stairways.  </P> <P> Handrails, for instance, usually are required to be around two inches wide so  that they are easy to hold on to and balusters usually must be "six-inch on  center," which means that there is no space between them where a six-inch  sphere can fit through.  </P> <P> Some homeowners who are opting for stairway remodels are not interested in  do-it-yourself. Rod Bradfield of Bradfield Manufacturing, Inc. in Santa Ana  says that between 10% and 15% of his work is remodeling old stairways and 80%  of his business is residential. Bradfield's company manufactures and installs  metal handrails and circular metal stairways with all steel construction.  </P> <P> Accessories available for metal stairs include bronze, marble or wood pieces  that can be laminated to handrails or treds. The price range for these welded  creations is "somewhere between $2,000 and a hundred grand," according to  Bradfield.  </P> <P> An example of a $2,000 stair would be a spiral stair that is five feet in  diameter and might be used outside from a second-story deck to a patio deck. A  $100,000 stair might be 12 to 14 feet tall, with glass panels and solid  stainless-steel handrails, all polished to a chrome sheen and marble treds,  according to Bradfield.  </P> <P> Remodeling a stairway may include changing a handrail or even removing wood or  metal stairs and installing a whole new metal stairway.  </P> <P> "Curved stairs can buy you a lot of space if they are done right," he says.  "You gain more space a lot of times if you take out a straight stair and put in  a curved one." He says the extra space can then be used to enlarge an entryway,  bedroom or bathroom.  </P> <P> All rails and stairways are done on a custom basis, he says, because the  measurements in each house are different. Parts may be forged or cast and then  welded together.  </P> <P> And metal stairs are not just for contemporary homes, according to Bradfield.  He says texturing and casting items can create even English or French  provincial stylings on the metal.  </P> <P> Randy Sims is a partner with his brother Bob Sims in American Ironcraft in  Orange, which manufactures and installs spiral metal stairs and handrails. He  says he also does a fair amount of remodeling.  </P> <P> Sims says sometimes he needs to remove an old stair railing and add some design  features to it "and reinstall it or, in some cases, we've taken out their  existing rails and started from scratch and built new ones."  </P> <P> The cost of removing stair rails and replacing them with a new metal ones  ranges from $15 a linear foot, for each side of the stair rail, to $400 a  linear foot and more, according to Sims.  </P> <P> Existing metal rails can be enhanced by adding detail such as forged S scrolls  or by welding on pre-made designs of aluminum on to the old rails. Sometimes,  he says, this can be done without even removing the existing rails.  </P> <P> Metal stair rails and stairs are usually painted a color to match the interior  or another contrasting color. Bradfield says: "Painting iron black is a thing  of the past, hopefully. It sure made a lot of it ugly when it could have been  nice. Black paint also covers up a lot of sore spots. Lousy craftsmanship is  easily hid with black paint."  </P> <P> Craftsmanship and careful planning do seem to be the key to a successfully  executed stairway.  </P> <P> Patty Mickey says the original plan for West's stairway called for a basic wood  turned-post stair rail. "We thought it was too traditional and a little too  ordinary" for this home, she says.  </P> <P> As a result, West got a stairway that dramatically sets the tone for a house  with such appointments as a refrigerated wine cellar tucked beneath the  stairway and a powder room with walls and ceiling hand-painted in a richly  textured faux ostrich skin finish.  </P> <P> "It's basically what I was looking for," West says of the stairway. "I wanted  something unique and totally different. I love the fact that the lights are in  it. . . . The lights light up the beveled glass and it's just gorgeous at  night."  </P></p>

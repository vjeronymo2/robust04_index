			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Catalan leader Jordi Pujol by </F> David White; place and date not given]    [Text] Barcelona -- Mr Jordi Pujol, the Catalan leader,  wants "substantial agreements" on economic, labour and regional  policies as a condition for continuing to prop up Spain's  minority Socialist government.    In an interview, he expressed confidence in the  determination  of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's embattled government to tackle  corruption. But he warned that if it failed to take effective  action "we will have to withdraw our support."    Mr Pujol is the guarantor of the government's survival as Mr  Gonzalez tries to overcome a serious crisis brought about by a  succession of corruption scandals involving members of his  administration, including a former central bank governor and a  former head of the Civil Guard.    Mr Pujol, who is president of Catalonia's regional  government  and of the Catalan nationalist party, Convergencea i Unio, took  a calculated gamble last week by reaffirming his backing for Mr  Gonzalez in the midst of the political crisis.    As long as his party's 17 deputies vote with the socialists,  Mr Gonzalez is assured of a narrow majority in the 350-member  parliament. Mr Gonzalez also received a pledge of support from  the Basque Nationalist party, which is similarly conservative in  its economic views and has five seats.    Mr Pujol set out four priorities:     -  Further measures to  support industry and exports, through tax policies. This would  include backing for research and development and special  assistance for small- and medium-sized companies;    -  Labour  deregulation. Mr Pujol left open the question of whether  additional measures would be needed after the government's  current package of labour reforms, due to be implemented  shortly. "We have to see how it works in practice," he  said.    -  Transfers to Catalonia. Mr Pujol said he did not want to  renegotiate the agreement reached last year under which 15 per  cent of the income tax normally raised by the central government  in Catalonia is remitted directly to the Catalan regional  government. But he had specific demands on arrangements for  financing the region's health system and the building-up of its  own police force.    -  Stemming corruption. Mr Pujol said he had  demanded that the government "do everything to control  corruption" and added: "I think it is doing it."     He made clear that, despite his renewed support for the  government, he would not consider joining a coalition. Mr  Gonzalez said last week that a coalition -- such as he tried to  form after last year's general election -- would provide more  stability than a parliamentary pact. However, Mr Pujol said  that being part of the government would leave his party with "no  capacity for manoeuvre."    "The truth is that we can be more useful outside the  government than inside it," he said.    He would not set any time-frame for his alliance with the  socialists.    The two parties will confront each other in municipal  elections next spring and in elections for the Catalan regional  government in 1996.    "In two years we do not know what will happen," Mr Pujol  said.    Mr Gonzalez has, meanwhile, secured backing from his party  to  place one of his moderate allies, Mr Joaquin Almunia, as its new  parliamentary leader, replacing the former economy minister, Mr  Carlos Solchaga who resigned last week.    Mr Almunia was labour and civil service minister in previous  Socialist governments.</p>

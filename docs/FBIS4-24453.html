			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Christine Chan] </F>   [Text] China's securities regulators and police have  jointly issued an order to check increasing market violations  amid the bearish markets which threaten to impinge on social  stability.    The order warns of increasing disputes, suicides and  malpractice in the stock markets and calls for more  professionalism and tighter control over shareholders' meetings.    The move comes as mainlanders see their investments dipping  by the day on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, with no  recovery in sight.    Because of the slump in the market, some investors have been  unable to endure their losses and have committed suicide;  brokers have turned to insider trading or used public money to  speculate on stocks, and there has been an increase in disputes  between investors and securities departments.    Published in China Securities News by the Shanghai Public  Security Bureau, the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of  China and the Shanghai Securities Administration Office, the  order says that last year and in the first quarter this year the  authorities discovered 49 cases of speculation with public money  totalling 91.66 million yuan (about HK$81.71 million).    To address the three problems, the order calls for better  control of information, promotion of better understanding among  the public of investing in stocks and a complete ban on  unauthorised information and illegal stock publications.    It urges more professionalism among stockbrokers, an end to  fraud and imposters trading shares belonging to other people,  and a ban on trading on credit.    Last month, China's legal authorities uncovered rampant  stock  market violations by brokers, bankers and even regulators.    An investigation by the Supreme People's Procuratorate  reportedly found violations to be common, including brokers  cheating investors, market officials taking bribes and managers  using company funds to trade shares. Two weeks ago, Shanghai  People's Procuratorate confirmed that Ma Yue, deputy-general  manager of Shanghai Haitong Securities, was under criminal  investigation on unspecified charges.    Analysts say fraud is not uncommon in fledging securities  markets, where necessary legislation is passed as the market  grows.    The problem has been compounded in China where the  government  hierarchy is complicated.    "What I'm afraid of is insider trading, because companies  are  all state-owned and brokerage houses are all state-owned as  well," an analyst said.    "Regulators have to look through malpractices such as  insider  trading. This is particularly important for B shareholders who  do not have much influence on companies."    The order says firms holding public shareholders' meetings  must inform the police five days in advance with information  including the date, time, place, content, the number taking part  and planned security measures.    "If incidents such as the smashing of cars, illegal marches  or demonstrations, attacking (Communist) Party or government  buildings happen, firm steps must be taken to prevent them and  stop matters from getting out of hand," it said. One recent  shareholders' meeting saw the board of directors yield to the  demands of minority shareholders who are suffering from the  falling stock market.    Examples of changes to boards' payout plans include Bao An  Enterprise, Shenzhen Gintian Industry, Shenzhen Konka  Electronics and China Vanke. All are Shenzhen-listed companies.    Concern has been raised over the power of shareholders  during  meetings and whether changes to payout proposals should be  backed by rational and reasonable justification.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] A new political row has blown up between China and  Hong Kong -- this time over plans to dump sewage in Zhuhai  waters. China said the Government had acted irresponsibly and  had misled the public over the $12 billion sewage treatment  project. It said the project should not have been given the  go-ahead without consultation with the Sino-British Joint  Liaison Group (JLG).    A Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office official said, if it  went ahead, the urgent task of solving the territory's worsening  water pollution would run into trouble. "We have already  demanded the issue be discussed at the coming JLG full meeting,"  he said.    "The British side said they can go ahead with phase one of  the project that will be completed before 1997 and will only  discuss with us the second phase that straddles 1997.    "But does that make sense? The project cannot be cut in two.  It should be considered as a whole."    "We are not trying to block the project. We do want  immediately to do something to stop further pollution of the  waters in Victoria Harbour. The worsening pollution has not  only caused red tide in Hong Kong but also poisoned aquatic  products in the Pearl River Delta region," he said. "Government  officials were misleading the public when they said we had no  dissenting views on the project," the official said. Rather, he  said, the Chinese were surprised by the decision of the  Government to launch the project with the recent award of a  contract involving hundreds of millions of dollars.    The Government said yesterday that China had not been  formally consulted on the project because a preliminary survey  was being carried out with the help of mainland authorities to  see whether the project was technically feasible and  environmentally acceptable. "We are not yet in a position to  apply to the Chinese side for construction of the second phase  of the project," said Principal Assistant Secretary for  Environment Chang King-yiu.    If the Government could confirm that there were good grounds  to go ahead with phase two of the project, it would officially  apply to the Chinese side to conduct a joint environmental  impact study. Under the strategic sewage disposal scheme, the  Government expected the facility to extend beyond the southern  side of Hong Kong waters. "The final alignment has yet to be  decided," she said.    According to the mainland official, the project envisaged a  huge marine underwater pipeline with a total length of dozens of  kilometres to be built linking Stonecutters Island with  Tangangdao in Zhuhai. At least several hundreds of tonnes of  sewage would be discharged into the waters off the Tangangdao.  "Some people in Hong Kong have already criticised that as an  unethical project. Discharging the sewage water in your  neighbours' place is simply unreasonable," he said. According  to international law, a government wanting to build a pipeline  in another country's waters has to seek that country's consent.    The official said the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office has  organised a team of researchers to examine the issue including  the hydrology of the Pearl River Delta. Some basic studies on  the treatment of sewage in the territory have already been  completed, he said. The official claimed that the Chinese  Government proposed in August last year the issue of conducting  a detailed feasibility study on the sewage project and the  corresponding assessment on its environmental impact be put on  the agenda of the JLG. He said the British side agreed to do so  only early this month, but soon granted contracts for the  project.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Blagov] </F>   [Text] Hanoi, 22 Apr -- We are eager to see accords on a  Bosnian settlement, including those reached with the active  involvement of Russian diplomacy, applied in practice. This was  stated in an ITAR-TASS interview today by Ukrainian Foreign  Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, who is here on an official visit. We  would like peace and tranquility to return to that region as  quickly as possible, he said. If good will is shown and the  warring parties and all interested states display a willingness  to cooperate, a political solution to the Bosnian question can  be found. A cease-fire is, unquestionably, the key to this.  This must be followed by the continuation of peace talks  involving international organizations, the Ukrainian foreign  minister said.    We will do our best to facilitate a political settlement of  the Bosnian problem at the United Nations, the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe, and other international  organizations, Zlenko stressed. Ukraine is also prepared to do  its utmost to promote an international meeting on a Bosnian  settlement. We believe that the Bosnian problem poses a threat  not only to the peoples of the Balkans.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Judging the judges THE ANATOMY OF THE NUREMBERG TRIALS by Telford Taylor Picador Pounds 25, 703 pages IT IS unfortunate that this book did not appear earlier. Telford Taylor, a lawyer and historian whose Munich (1979) remains the most exhaustive treatment of that fateful conference, was a member of the American prosecuting team at the Nuremberg trials in 1945-6. Repetition has dulled the impact of the revelations which shocked the Nuremberg judges, who viewed the first showing of the concentration camp films. But such moments of high drama were rare. The actual proceedings were tedious and repetitive, and Taylor's judicious and measured approach to his subject further deadens whatever sense of drama might be derived from an insider's view of what was, after all, an extraordinary occasion. For Nuremberg broke new legal grounds, and the precedents set in trying 'crimes against peace' and 'crimes against humanity' were debated fiercely during the Vietnam war and are pertinent to the conflicts in Kuwait and Yugoslavia. Taylor is at his best when discussing the background to the trials, and the in-fighting and personal vendettas among the Allied representatives. Nuremberg was very much an American show. It was they who wanted the trial. The British, recalling the fiasco of the post-first world war trials, favoured summary execution of a selected list of Nazi war criminals. Twenty-three American lawyers addressed the tribunal, more than twice the combined British and French legal teams and more than twice the number of Soviet jurists. Supreme Court justice Robert Jackson, the American chief counsel for war crimes, was instrumental in setting the terms of the indictment and primarily responsible for making the charge of conspiracy to plan and wage aggressive war the centre of his case. In this rather hostile portrait, only Jackson's passionate and eloquent statement, the unique and necessary reminder of the moral dimensions of the trials, compensated for the justice's administrative incapacities and poor showing as his country's chief prosecutor. Jackson's bungled cross-examination of the unrepentent Goering allowed the court's most important defendant ample opportunity to outwit his interrogator. Taylor has thought hard about what was done and accomplished at Nuremberg but is cautious in his judgments. He has reservations about the way the defendants were selected and, in some instances, sentenced. With most of the major surviving Nazi leaders in their countrymen's hands, neither Sir Hartley Shawcross nor Jackson paid sufficient attention to their better-informed advisers as to who should stand trial. Taylor underlines the gap between the western and Soviet conceptions of justice, yet admits it probably had only a limited effect on the verdicts. It was somewhat ironic that it should have been Soviet prosecutors who, along with the French, concentrated on 'crimes against humanity' and insisted on including the Katyn massacres in the indictment as a German war crime. It was left to the Soviets to present the evidence of the Nazi persecution of the Jews and the mass executions in the death camps of Poland. The French prosecutor made only a passing reference to the Jewish question while the Americans and British concentrated exclusively on crimes against the peace. Although troubled by the ex post facto nature of this latter category of charges, the grounds for convicting 12 of the 24 defendants, Taylor argues that Nuremberg has established the criminality of initiating aggressive wars and has provided the legal basis for present and future national and international action. One wishes that this general question had been explored more fully. The Nuremberg trials were, above, all, trials of the defeated by the victors, some of whom were not entirely guiltless of war crimes in the Nuremberg sense. One can understand why the Allies should have wanted to bring the Nazi criminals to justice. It is harder to establish how far these trials actually advanced international law. Many historians and legal theorists have judged what was done at Nuremberg in far harsher terms than suggested here. It is surely not without significance that, in spite of repeated violations of the Nuremberg principles since 1946, no similar new international tribunal has been created. Readers deserve a more persuasive conclusion than Taylor's. MORE BOOKS PAGE XVII</p>

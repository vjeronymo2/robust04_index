			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / United Biscuits braced to lift crumbling US profits: Initiatives to strengthen Keebler subsidiary MR Eric Nicoli, chief executive of United Biscuits (UB), Britain's fourth biggest food manufacturer, would never admit it publicly. But this week he must be reflecting that adversity has its compensations. The resignation on Tuesday of Mr Tom Garvin after 15 years as president of Keebler, UB's troubled US subsidiary, has cleared the way for top management to get to grips with a business that has often seemed intent on operating at arm's length from the rest of the group since it was acquired in 1974. The autocratic and combative Mr Garvin has been replaced by Mr Brian Chadbourne, head of McVitie's biscuits, UB's biggest division. A trusted lieutenant of Mr Nicoli, the 40-year-old Mr Chadbourne has won praise for maintaining McVitie's UK profits in recession while knitting together a series of recent acquisitions in continental Europe. Mr Garvin's departure has seemed likely since UB reported last September a 57 per cent fall in Keebler's first-half trading profit to Pounds 12.1m - sharply reversing a steady recovery in the company's margins after they were savaged by the US 'cookie war' in the mid-1980s. The debacle, which cut group pre-tax results by 17 per cent, was a big blow to Mr Nicoli and his team of youthful top managers. Since Lord Laing's retirement in 1990 after 17 years as chairman, they have made profitable international expansion a strategic priority and a test of their management credentials. The main cause of Keebler's latest problems was another bout of severe price-cutting in a weak market to which the company, the second largest US cookie and cracker producer after Nabisco, was slow to respond. However, Keebler also bungled the launch of several products on which it had been counting to maintain market share. At UB's urging, Keebler has already moved to repair the short-term damage. Since last autumn, it has closed a bakery, trimmed management and begun controlling trade and promotional spending more tightly, while going all-out to recapture market share. A more disciplined approach is also being brought to the introduction of products. Although Keebler is a prolific innovator - its 'Sweet Spots' cookies were the second most successful new supermarket product in the US last year - it has been repeatedly handicapped by technical and production difficulties. Although Mr Nicoli says there was little improvement in Keebler's profits in the second half of last year, he says he is confident of 'a considerable recovery in 1993, even without any price increases'. The biggest challenge facing Mr Chadbourne, who has spent the past two months preparing for his new job, is to find a way to achieve sustainable profits growth over the longer term. Mr Nicoli believes a 10 per cent operating margin is attainable. However, Keebler's margin has not exceeded 7 per cent in the past decade and sank to 2.4 per cent in the first half of last year. By contrast, Nabisco, whose US cookie sales are three times higher than Keebler's, has regularly earned a margin of about 14 per cent. Frito-Lay, the US market leader in salty snacks, in which Keebler also competes on a small scale, boasts a margin of more than 20 per cent. Part of Keebler's problem is that although it serves a nationwide market it has a revenue base far smaller than those of the market leaders, so its marketing, sales and distribution costs - at about half of gross sales - are high by industry standards. Many industry observers blame Keebler's expensive 'store-door' delivery system, which distributes products to retailers. Carrying relatively low volumes, one analyst likened it to 'a Rolls-Royce without a VIP to transport'. Mr Nicoli, who recently completed a review of Keebler with the aid of McKinsey, the management consultants, says UB is looking at ways to manage the delivery system more efficiently. However, he believes the biggest scope for cost savings lies in targetting marketing spending more effectively. Another priority is salty snacks, a fast-growing market in which Keebler has never made a profit. Mr Nicoli believes the key lies in pricing policy, which is receiving close attention. 'It is clear that we have the manufacturing and new product development capacity. We should be able to market effectively and make money,' he says. But UB's biggest and boldest initiative to strengthen Keebler is its entry into own-label cookie manufacturing through the Pounds 47m acquisition this month of Bake-Line, the leading US specialist in the sector. UB began manufacturing own-label biscuits for UK retailers 20 years ago and it today accounts for almost 40 per cent of McVitie's output. The company believes its experience can be profitably applied in the US, where own-label's share of the market has increased rapidly in the past few years. 'Own-label in the US is where it was in Britain 15 years ago,' says Mr Nicoli. 'It is still relatively low-quality, cheap and unattractively packaged. But as US retailers increase their marketing effort, they will want to improve the quality of own-label. The business is bound to grow.' Not everyone in the industry agrees. Mr David Johnson, president of Campbell's Soup, which owns Pepperidge Farm cookies, thinks the growth of own-label in the US is mainly because of recession. He also doubts that American food retailers can match the success of their UK counterparts in building the strong brand image that has enabled them to present own-label products as quality items. With Keebler accounting for a third of UB's sales, and its performance offering a particularly visible test of the group's management, much rides on whether the vision of the future shared by Mr Nicoli and his colleagues turns out to be the right one.

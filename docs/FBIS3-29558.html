In addition to this, the country must also  follow the example of many countries, among them Thailand, who  do not allow foreign ownership of land and buildings.    There are legal systems which can be put in place which will  preserve the interests of this nation and will still be  acceptable to foreign investors.    In making this call, Son Sann, the Dean of the Members of  the  National Assembly, said in a statement: "The great misery  endured by this nation dates back to 1970. Then, we witnessed  the ruthless exploitation of our natural resources without  profit or gain for our people."    "As such, there is a necessity in establishing an investment  code. This code would reflect a reasonable degree of liberalism  being based on mutual profit to encourage foreign investments  but would also act to preserve our national interests."    "When I said the preserving of our national interests, I  specifically meant to preserve our present interests which still  remain to be preserved, as well as those of future generations,"  he said.    He added that it was within this perspective that he  proposed  (while waiting for an investment code reflecting a reasonable  liberalisation, conceived with good consensus by the Royal  Government and the National Assembly, with the present and  future interests of our nation at heart) some necessary measures  of precaution.    "Contracts not approved by the Supreme National Council or  by  the Royal Government should be cancelled or reviewed again. The  occupation of certain economically important regions such as  harbours, must be of a limited duration."    "We must make provision in these zones for a privileged zone  to be reserved for locals and also a zone to be managed  primarily by the Royal Government and, therefore, to be kept for  future generations."    "With new friends and new accords currently being made, the  Royal Government will certainly be able to obtain better  conditions for our nation," Son Sann pointed out.    He added that with regards to oil exploration, fisheries and  electricity, it would be desirable in the negotiations to have  the collaboration of neutral and competent specialists, in  particular well known local specialist residents in France or  elsewhere who are current in their respective fields of research.</p>

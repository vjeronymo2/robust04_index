			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading REPORTS OF a late surge in support for the Conservative party in yesterday's general election triggered a strong advance in stock index futures in a volatile session, writes Joel Kibazo. Trading in the June contract on the FT-SE opened firmly and it rose 5 to 2,444 within minutes. But June soon went into retreat after a leading institution began executing a sizeable order, sending the contract falling to 2,438. Further selling, in spite of sporadic buying from independent traders, saw June move lower in the morning. But buying interest returned in the afternoon as talk of a Conservative party lead increased. A firm Wall Street and a late burst of panic buying as independent traders filled short positions saw June recover ground lost earlier. June closed at 2,476, up 38 from the previous session and around 19 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 22. Turnover reached 7,391. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was particularly active in the session. The traded options market also witnessed a busy day. Turnover rose to a healthy 41,847 lots. Hedging in the FT-SE options was the main feature, with 22,334 contracts dealt by the close.</p>

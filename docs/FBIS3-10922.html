			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 13 Mar (EFE) -- It was announced today, 13  March, that Counterterrorism Directorate [Dincote] personnel  dismantled a Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA)  communications center in Trujillo, 570 km north of Lima.    Citing sources close to Dincote, the Lima press reports that  Dincote troops have seized powerful radio transmitters and  modern communications equipment used by MRTA leaders in Trujillo  to communicate with their subordinates in the tropical forest  region of Upper Huallaga.    This operation, which took place some days ago and  culminated  with the raid on the center, is another harsh blow to the MRTA.  The terrorist group received yet another setback this past week  in the same northern city -- the capital of La Libertad  Department -- when six MRTA leaders, including an Italian woman,  were arrested.    The sources state that the communications center was  frequently visited by Nestor Serpa Cartolini, alias "Evaristo,"  the current top MRTA leader following the arrest of Victor Polay  in May 1992.    Serpa apparently just missed being captured -- he was at the  communications center just before the operation was mounted. No  arrests were made during the raid.    The Dincote report states that one of the two vehicles  seized  when the six MRTA members were caught belongs to Serpa.    Lima EL COMERCIO today reports that the Italian citizen -- a  member of the MRTA who lived with a terrorist called "Perseo" --  has been identified as Maria Gabriela Geronino or Gabriela  Guarino, allegedly a journalist.    In another operation, four Shining Path members were  captured  in the Province of Cajabamba, in the northern department of  Cajamarca.    The sources report that the MRTA has been practically mopped  up, although there are still some scattered pockets that Serpa  is trying to reorganize.</p>

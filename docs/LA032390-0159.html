			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO REVERSE S&amp;L RULING;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO TRIES TO SPEED UP SENATE CONFIRMATION OF ITS  CHOICE FOR CHIEF S&amp;L REGULATOR.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, warning that delays in seizing insolvent savings and  loan associations could cost taxpayers millions of dollars, asked an appeals  court Thursday to uphold the government's takeover powers.  </P> <P> The Administration said a lower court action Wednesday, blocking the seizure of  an Illinois thrift, "may irretrievably disrupt the government's regulation of  the thrift industry." U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth barred the  impending takeover of Olympic Federal Savings &amp; Loan of Berwyn, Ill., on  the grounds that the former chief federal thrift regulator, M. Danny Wall, was  not constitutionally confirmed by the Senate.  </P> <P> The government asked the appeals court Thursday for an emergency order blocking  Lamberth's action. The government asked the appeals court to require that all  briefs be filed by Monday and that a decision be made as quickly as possible.  Federal regulators fear that a swarm of other ailing S&amp;Ls will sue to avert  takeovers.  </P> <P> At least one challenge to a seizure has already been mounted. On Thursday,  Imperial Corp. of America, former parent of San Diego-based Imperial Savings,  won a promise from regulators to delay imposition of a receivership on the  thrift until a court hearing next week determines whether the takeover was  legal.  </P> <P> Imperial Savings had been placed into conservatorship by the government on Feb.  23. But the temporary agreement with regulators means the government cannot  force the S&amp;L into receivership, a final step that would allow regulators  to wipe out ownership in the thrift and sell its assets.  </P> <P> Meanwhile on Thursday, the Administration officially submitted to the Senate  the nomination of former Labor Department official T. Timothy Ryan Jr. as chief  thrift regulator, moving much faster than expected because of the confusion  generated by Lamberth's ruling. The Ryan nomination was undergoing the lengthy  clearance process required for high-level appointees. But the White House now  wants rapid action to get him confirmed, thereby avoiding additional legal  challenges to regulators.  </P> <P> The confusion and uncertainty should be temporary, predicted Rep. Henry B.  Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Banking Committee.  </P> <P> "The impact of the (Lamberth) decision should not be exaggerated," Gonzalez  said. "The regulatory sky is not falling. High fliers in the thrift industry  should not break out the champagne with the thought (that) the opinion suddenly  frees them" from the controls of the S&amp;L law, he said.  </P> <P> The S&amp;L legislation gave the government the power to spend an estimated  $285 billion over the next 30 years to close or sell insolvent S&amp;Ls and pay  off depositors. Deposits are insured by the federal government up to $100,000.  </P> <P> The law also eliminated the Federal Home Loan Bank Board as overseer of thrifts  and replaced it with the Office of Thrift Supervision. Wall, chairman of the  Bank Board, was appointed OTS director without undergoing new confirmation by  the Senate.  </P> <P> Lamberth said Wall's appointment was unconstitutional and casts a legal shadow  over the powers of his office. Wall has since been replaced by Acting Director  Salvatore Martoche. But Lamberth said the unconstitutional appointment of the  OTS chief means the agency can't take control of Olympic Savings.  </P> <P> Since the thrift bailout became law Aug. 9, the government has seized 137  thrifts with $97 billion in assets. Twenty-two of the 35 thrifts in California  operating under government supervision were seized since then. And about 65  thrifts in the state now fail at least one of the three new federal capital  requirements, making them possible candidates for a federal takeover if they  are unable to replenish their capital.  </P> <P> The largest California thrift that appears vulnerable to a seizure is Santa  Barbara Savings. Its plan to raise additional capital was rejected by  regulators in February, a move generally regarded as tantamount to a regulatory  death sentence.  </P> <P> Since then, the thrift has been placed under some of the most severe operating  restrictions available short of being seized, including such things as a  prohibition against making new loans, a freeze on salaries of employees who  make more than $50,000 a year and strict rules governing transferal of assets  or entrance into leases.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the thrift's parent, Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara,  declined to comment on whether the institution plans to file a suit similar to  the one filed by Olympic Federal.  </P> <P> One former thrift owner closely monitoring the Illinois case is the New York  investment firm of Castle Harlan Inc., which owned Western Empire Savings &amp;  Loan in Yorba Linda. When the thrift was seized Feb. 23, the company threatened  to sue regulators for what it called their "unconscionable abuse of power" in  reneging on previous agreements and taking the thrift illegally.  </P> <P> "We have not filed suit yet, but we very likely will soon," said Rob Wages, a  Castle Harlan executive who was a Western Empire director. "We're watching all  the legal developments. The judge's ruling (in the Illinois case) is important  and indicative of how sloppy Congress put this (S&amp;L bailout) law together.  Now we have an agency that has run amok."  </P> <P> At the end of 1988, Castle Harlan put up $15.8 million in cash to rescue a  failing Western Empire Savings without any government assistance. Regulators at  the time approved the company's business plan, which called for a heavy  reliance on junk bond trading.  </P> <P> Robert A. Rosenblatt reported from Washington.

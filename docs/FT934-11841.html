			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / US group cuts 200 jobs in Ayrshire ABOUT 200 workers in Ayrshire will lose their jobs at the end of the year when Conner Peripherals, the US disk-drive maker, stops production at its assembly plant in Irvine. The plant has been operating for only 3 1/2 years. Another 100 employees will stay on to run the site as a distribution and service centre. The California-based company blamed competition from non-European countries, which it said enjoyed lower costs and duty-free access to the European market. Recently it reported a loss for the third quarter of this year. The company said it would review its manufacturing requirements annually. Conner once claimed to be the fastest growing company in US history. When it started operations in Scotland it spoke of investing Pounds 50m and of creating 1,500 jobs. Employment at Irvine peaked at 415 in 1991.</p>

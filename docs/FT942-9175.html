			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Electronics behind jump at Diploma A surge from its electronics division was behind a 42 per cent advance in interim profits at Diploma, the electronics, building components and special steels group. Pre-tax profits for the six months to end-March were Pounds 11.5m, up from last time's Pounds 8.1m which was struck after a Pounds 1.1m provision for reorganisation of a subsidiary. Operating profits were ahead 27 per cent at Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 8.5m). The electronics division, which accounted for 70 per cent of group turnover, increased operating profits by 36 per cent to Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 5.5m). Total turnover increased by 22 per cent, from Pounds 74m to Pounds 90.1m. Mr Christopher Thomas, chairman, said that trading conditions for most of the group's divisions were more favourable than they had been for several years. He described the increase in the personal computer market as 'the significant engine of growth' for Macro and Nortronic, the electronic components distribution subsidiaries. The semi-conductor market was now at a good stage in its cycle, he said, with further growth likely to emerge from the increasing use of electronic gadgetry in cars. He stressed the group's commitment to providing top quality service, and said it had won market share by continuing to invest through the recession. It now employed more than 20 electronics service engineers, compared with six at the start of the recession. The building components division increased operating profits by 22 per cent, from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 3.3m, on turnover of Pounds 23m (19m). IG, the steel lintel maker, benefited from an increase in housing starts, recording a 20 per cent rise in both volume and profit. Mr Thomas said he was optimistic that 'goodish conditions' would continue. The specialist steel division saw further decline in demand from the oil industry, but this was offset by general engineering demand and profits were ahead 20 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 10.7p to 13p; the interim dividend is increased from 3.5p to 4p. COMMENT Good conditions in the semi-conductor market helped Diploma to come in slightly ahead of expectations. There are firm indications that conditions in the building components market are also improving. The common factor linking the businesses is strong cash flow, and the strategy seems to have worked well so far. However, turnover from electronics distribution is smaller than that of other groups which concentrate on the sector, so the group could face difficult questions as vendors look for fewer distributors and manufacturers seek to increase market share by squeezing smaller companies. Full-year profits are likely to be above Pounds 25m, giving a prospective multiple of about 18, which looks attractive.</p>

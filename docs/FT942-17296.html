			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / World Trade News: US tries to melt the ice with India - Minister is in New Delhi to repair chilly relations Early in the last century, US trading relations with India amounted to the transport of ice by clipper ships from Boston to Calcutta. These days the trade flow is reversed, but the ice remains - in relations between the two countries. Mr Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of state, is in India today to 'underscore the importance we attach to the relationship', according to a Commerce Department spokesman. But his task will not be easy. With India identified as a trade and investment target, US officials are scrambling to counter a series of diplomatic blunders. The Clinton administration, after 15 months in office, has yet to send a permanent ambassador to India. Former congressman Steven Solarz was nominated months ago but never made it through the confirmation process. Mr Frank Wisner, a top Pentagon official, is in line for the job but has not been nominated officially. Meanwhile, Ms Robin Raphel, an assistant secretary of state, who caused an uproar by referring to Kashmir as a disputed territory, was in New Delhi last month trying to clear up 'misunderstandings'. The US, she said, had only one goal in Kashmir: to persuade India and Pakistan to negotiate a settlement to end fighting that has killed more than 8,500 people in four years. Mr Jeffrey Garten, Commerce Department undersecretary for trade, acknowledges that the US is trailing its competitors in India. Officials from Britain, Germany, Spain, Singapore, Russia and the Netherlands have visited New Delhi, often accompanied by large business delegations. But visits by Mr Garten and his boss, Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, remain at the planning stage. Much is at stake. The US is India's largest export customer, but tariffs protecting India's domestic market are among the world's highest. 'Bureaucratic delays continue to hinder implementation of many infrastructure projects and block approval of foreign investment proposals,' says Mr Garten. Inadequate legal protection of intellectual property and the weak enforcement of existing laws are also key concerns, he says. US investment in India was Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 738m) last year, more than twice the 1992 level. Mr Garten believes US exports to India could rise by as much as 10 per cent a year, from Dollars 2.8bn last year to Dollars 5bn-Dollars 6bn a year by the end of the century. US aircraft and air traffic control exports, now running at Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m a year, are likely to expand. US aircraft and engine manufacturers are bidding in Air India's Dollars 1bn aircraft procurement programme. Telecommunications companies are seeking paging and cellular licences and approval of large investments. Other US companies are bidding for Indian railways, locomotive and telecom network modernisation contracts. Other opportunities are seen in the expansion of India's power generation, at a cost of several billion dollars in the next six years, and petroleum exploration. The Commerce Department predicts that three-quarters of the growth in world trade in the next 20 years will occur in the developing countries, with most of the expansion in 10 'big emerging markets' of which India is one. But the potential for US trade with India is being jeopardised by the frosty diplomatic relations between the two countries. President Bill Clinton's emphasis on human rights and his criticism of abuses in Kashmir have deeply offended New Delhi. As with China, he may have to choose between foreign sales - key to his domestic economic policy - or domestic moralising.</p>

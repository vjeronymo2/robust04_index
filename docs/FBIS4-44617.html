With the product development phase now  completed, this device (model HTI4) exhibits the following  performance: operating temperature range is 20-30 C, rated  power is 90[? (figure blurred)] mW, typical threshold current is  60 mA, maximum threshold current is 90 mA, typical operating  current is 250 mA, maximum operating current is 350 mA, typical  operating voltage drop is 1.5 V, maximum operating voltage drop  is 2.5 V, minimum operating wavelength is 1.46 m, maximum  operating wavelength is 1.49 m, parallel emission angle is  25, and perpendicular emission angle is 30. These  values are comparable to current international standards.  Qinghua University has incorporated the device in its EDFA  certified in December 1993.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alex Fishman] </F>   [Text] Any forcible evacuation of Hebron Jews will involve  bloodshed. This is a basic given the Army has been  contemplating ever since conditions for implementing the Gaza  and Jericho First agreement began maturing. After that  agreement, the Jewish Hebron turning point is bound to arrive.    No one is preparing any military plans for such a move.  Whenever the matter of security in Hebron is raised at the  meetings of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee  and at cabinet meetings, the chief of staff focuses on the  astronomical numbers of troops deployed to protect a few hundred  Jews living in the heart of Arab Hebron, but he says nothing  else.    Political sensitivity is at its peak. The voices which  emanated from the cabinet concerning the possible evacuation of  Hebron after the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre were received  in the Army with perfect clarity. The only two questions left  are how and when. The second given is that when the Army  receives the orders, it will carry them out.    When the Army is asked for its opinion on how to evacuate  the  Hebron Jews, it will present two options. The first: a  one-swoop evacuation of all the 400 Jewish inhabitants, which  may take several days. Such a move is liable to provoke  bloodshed and leave deep social scars for generations to come.  Nevertheless, such a one-stage evacuation is supposed to  eliminate the undisputable center of friction, which is liable  to deteriorate when the Palestinian police enter Hebron,  enabling the political process to continue undisturbed.    The second way is a prolonged, gradual evacuation, which  limits the possibilities of bloodshed. This option offers  greater flexibility to select the politically appropriate time,  permits greater elbowroom for a dialogue on a quiet, voluntary  evacuation of most Jews, and may reduce the risk of trauma among  the public and Army personnel.    This option has another advantage in that it conveys a  message to the Palestinians concerning the evacuation of Jewish  settlers during the interim period: Settlement evacuation is  not a sweeping action; it is done case by case on merit, and  Israel does not intend to renounce sites held sacred to Judaism.  The disadvantage lies in the continued existence of this center  of friction, albeit a reduced one. The Army can be expected to  recommend the second option. In any event, any evacuation  decision should be kept secret, thereby preventing the settlers  from anticipating the event.    The Jewish quarters in the heart of Hebron are composed of  four areas centered around the Old City market and casbah. Bet  Hadassah and Bet Shneorson are one residential block. The  central bus station and the Avraham Avinu installation form the  second block. The central bus station building is inhabited by  yeshiva students.    The third block is the Cave of the Patriarchs area, which  abuts on a yeshiva and a settlers' restaurant. The restaurant,  as well as the yeshiva, are slated to move to Bet Romano, which  is being renovated. The fourth block, Tall al-Rumaythah, is 500  meters away from the Jewish compound as the crow flies. It  consists of a few campers in an Arab neighborhood situated on a  site perceived as the ancient, historic Hebron.    The evacuation of two of the four blocks -- the yeshiva and  Tall al-Rumaythah -- seems easier. The yeshiva is composed of  students, youths who are not Hebron inhabitants. Next year,  their parents can be expected to refuse to send them to a school  situated in a permanently life-endangering district. The  students live in the central bus station, daily commuting to and  from the yeshiva -- a several-hundred-meter distance -- which  requires an Army escort at all times. If the yeshiva is not  artificially filled with students from Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza  next year, it will probably either stop operating altogether or  radically cut down its operations.    Tall al-Rumaythah is a different block requiring separate  protection. Protecting settlers walking inside the city to the  Cave of the Patriarchs and the Jewish zone is particularly  problematic. Tall al-Rumaythah was the last site to be settled,  and is the first one that should be evacuated. From all  viewpoints -- both in terms of security and tradition -- there  is justification to evacuate this block to the central Jewish  location at the central bus station, in place of the yeshiva  students currently housed there. The evacuation of the Tall  al-Rumaythah settlers might satisfy the world and the  Palestinians as a first step.    The problematic blocks are those located at Bet Hadassah,  Bet  Shneorson, and Bet Avraham Avinu. The Jewish population there  utterly believes it has been chosen by God to live in Hebron.  Some of them are willing to die for this belief. An immediate  and forceful evacuation could lead to horrible sights such as a  settler torching himself on a rooftop, or a settler opening fire  on soldiers. Some of them actually believe that a confrontation  with the Army is a necessary prelude to the messianic age. The  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is construed by them as an army of a  secular entity, a sort of mercenary force which has a certain  role to fulfill in the messianic saga. It is not an essential  part of the local scene, and the fanatics among the settlers  have no qualms about opening fire on such a mercenary force.    The halakic rulings of rabbis such as Goren, Shapira, and  Li'or -- calling for a forceful opposition to evacuation --  strengthen the support for the not-so-large nucleus of fanatics.  At the same time, the Hebron settlers have supporters in France  and the United States. It is not inconceivable that such a group  of supporters barricade itself in a Brooklyn house and threaten  suicide. Such a situation would greatly embarrass the Israeli  Government vis-a-vis other governments.    If the government opts for a one-swoop evacuation, it is  preferable that the police and border police directly deal with  the settlers. In such a case the Army will clamp a curfew on  Hebron and a closure on Qiryat Arba', and will declare the  entire Hebron district and the roads leading to it a closed  military zone. The burden of enforcing these measures will fall  on the regular infantry brigades, which will have to deal with  the outer circle of settler supporters who will try to reach  Hebron. Problems in the Army regarding willingness to implement  the evacuation are expected only in the low ranks, and this can  be dealt with beforehand by appropriate treatment at the company  level.    Soldiers who will declare beforehand they do not intend to  participate in the evacuation can be quietly left in base.  There are not likely to be too many of them in any case. This  is how the Army currently deals with the handful of soldiers --  mainly reservists -- who refuse to serve in the territories.    A prolonged, gradual evacuation -- which will start out with  the evacuation of Tall al-Rumaythah and the yeshiva, to be  followed approximately two years later by the evacuation of the  other Jewish quarters -- offers the influential rabbis an  opportunity to come to their senses and issue appropriate  halakic rulings. The sane Jewish population will also  understand that the historical period of Jewish settlement in  Hebron is over. A period of two years will also provide ample  opportunity for removing the dangerous and fanatical elements  from the area. If the government therefore decides to evacuate  the Jews of Hebron, it will probably opt for this second option.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DAY-CARE DILEMMA' WAS ACCURATELY TOLD  </P> <P> I read with special interest "Day Care Dilemma" (Nov. 1). You accurately  depicted a problem with which the County of Los Angeles is successfully coping.  The county is a major employer in Southern California. As such it has the same  concerns as any other major employer in assisting its workers to meet their  family obligations.  </P> <P> Thus far the county has: opened two day-care centers with a licensed capacity  for 156 infants and preschoolers (East Los Angeles, Sylmar); developed plans  for opening four additional centers (Torrance, Downey, Alhambra, Civic Center);  provided leadership and networking opportunities to businesses, labor and the  community through the Child Care Advisory Board and the child Care Resources  Committee; implemented telecommuting and alternative work schedules; instituted  flexible benefit plans which allow employees to set aside up to $400 per month  tax free to pay for dependent care services.  </P> <P> Issues of recruitment and retention of a skilled work force and productivity  are of great importance in the public sector.  </P> <P> BEVERLY CAMPBELL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

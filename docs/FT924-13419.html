			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Engen rises 18% despite lower refinery margins ENGEN, the energy group in South Africa's Gencor group, performed in line with market expectations to record an 18 per cent rise in earnings per share for the year to August. Turnover advanced by 7.6 per cent to R6.6bn (Dollars 2.3bn) from R6.1bn, while operating income rose by 3.7 per cent to R393m from R379m. Mr Rob Angel, chief executive, said the operating performance, which was affected by lower refinery margins and a six-week shutdown to complete an expansion programme, was 'gratifying'. Taxable profits rose by 26.6 per cent to R533m from R421m reflecting the benefits of the R1.1bn rights issue in May 1991 which boosted net financing income to R140m from R42m. A lower tax bill of R107m, compared with R134m, helped lift net income to R429m, a 50 per cent increase over the 1991 figure of R286m. The larger number of shares in issue restricted the earnings per share increase to 18 per cent - up to 275 cents from 233 cents. The dividend was raised by 18.5 per cent to 137.5 cents a share from 116 cents. Mr Angel said sales in South Africa during the year had risen by about 2.6 per cent, with lighter products at the 'top' of the barrel (petrol, liquid petroleum gas and jet fuel) increasing, while sales of products from the 'bottom' of the barrel (diesel, bitumen and lubricating oils) had fallen. He said there was good potential for the petrol market, where industry sales grew by 4 per cent during 1991-1992. Mr Angel said a livery change from Mobil to Engen was proceeding well, with average volume increases at the 16 changed stations of about 10 per cent. Exports grew by 80 per cent during the year - up by 500 per cent in the last three years. Exploration spending was up to R36m during the year from R20m.</p>

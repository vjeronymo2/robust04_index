			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAUGHERTY SCORES 34 AS CAVALIERS EVEN SERIES WITH 76ERS;  </P> <P> NBA PLAYOFFS: CENTER IS ALMOST PERFECT IN 108-96 VICTORY. 76ERS WILL TRY TO WIN  SERIES AT HOME.  </P> <P> Anyone wondering why the Cleveland Cavaliers struggled early this season need  only glance at Brad Daugherty's line in Thursday night's box score.  </P> <P> Daugherty, who missed the first half of the season because of complications  after foot surgery, was nearly perfect. He went 12 of 15 from the floor, 10 of  12 from the free-throw line and scored a team playoff-record 34 points as the  Cavaliers beat the Philadelphia 76ers, 108-96, tying their Eastern Conference  quarterfinal series 2-2.  </P> <P> The deciding game will be Saturday in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> "We shot the ball poorly, and Brad Daugherty had a career night,"  Philadelphia's Charles Barkley said. "We've got to do something to shut him  down. We didn't double him tonight and he's too good not to double. We've got  to go back to the drawing board."  </P> <P> Cleveland was counting on a strong playoff series from Daugherty, who appears  to be hitting his stride after sitting out the first half.  </P> <P> "It felt like last year a little bit," Daugherty said. "The foot is really  coming around. I'm starting to get my strength back in it. But I think I'm at a  disadvantage, too, because I think I'm behind everybody else. I was in the  hospital two months."  </P> <P> Daugherty made 10 of his first 11 shots from the field. Mark Price set a  Cavalier playoff record with 18 assists. Daugherty also grabbed nine rebounds.  </P> <P> "He must have made four or five jump shots when we were helping pick up Price  on the drive," Philadelphia Coach Jim Lynam said. "Daugherty had a great game."  </P> <P> The two teams split their four regular-season games, each winning once at home  and once on the road. Each has won its two home games in the playoffs.  </P> <P> The Cavaliers shut down the 76ers in the fourth quarter, outscoring them,  22-14. The 76ers went scoreless from the field for seven minutes as Cleveland  widened an 89-84 lead early in the quarter to 97-85 with five minutes left.  </P> <P> Daugherty finished off the 8-1 flurry with a short hook shot and two free  throws.  </P> <P> As has been the case in all four playoff games, the Cavaliers got off to a  quick start, leading 34-23 after one quarter and 60-50 at halftime.  </P> <P> Cleveland let two halftime leads slip away in Philadelphia, but made the next  two stand up at home.  </P> <P> Barkley scored 23 points and had 11 rebounds. Hawkins scored 22, but only two  in the fourth quarter.  </P></p>

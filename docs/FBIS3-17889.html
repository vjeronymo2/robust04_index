They have proposed using  toxic agents as raw materials for the production of materials  needed by the national economy. In particular, the Volga  scientists plan to obtain arsenic from lewisite. They have  managed to organize the production of medicines and household  chemical products here.    However, the funding of research work in the destruction of  lethal weapons is proceeding poorly. Last year, just 17 million  rubles were allocated for this purpose. The chemical workers  are bewildered. How can this be?    For several months now staffers at the institute have not  received their wages and the enormous collective has been forced  to take administrative leave without pay. How can there be any  talk of getting rid of weapons when there is no money to pay for  their destruction?</p>

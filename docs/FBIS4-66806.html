			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, March 28 (UNI)--Prof Rajendra Singh, the  new Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief has said demands for  restoration of Hindu places of worship all over the country were  bound to crop up as long as the "three most sacred places of  Hindus" are not handed over to them.    Referring to the Hindu Munnani's agitation in Pondicherry,  demanding that a cathedral be handed over to Hindus as it was  originally a temple, Prof Singh said "Such things are bound to  happen."    He, however, said he was not justifying the Munnani's  actions  and added that there were hundreds of institutions and places of  worship in the country which originally belonged to Hindus.    "We had, therefore, said that if you give away the three  most  sacred places (Kashi, Mathura and Ayodhya), then the Vishwa  Hindu Parishad (VHP) would, in all probability, be able to  mollify the Hindus and tell them not to worry about the other  places," he said.    "If there is delay then some such unforeseen problems would  crop up. It is the delay which, I think, is responsible for the  escalation," Prof Singh said in an interview to ORGANISER, the  RSS mouthpiece.    Asked to spell out how he proposed to resolve such problems,  Prof Singh said, "You can't say. In one place you find that the  facts are very clear and so strong that the government is trying  not to do anything."    "If you (government) don't satisfy the Hindu society in  these  matters, which are of great relevance and importance to us, then  the question of thousands of mosques standing on Hindu temple  sites will be raised and there will be nobody to douse the Hindu  anger," he felt. "Today, the VHP is a formidable body. They can  say that they have decided to press for the three holiest of  holy places and that they would not ask for more. This will be  symbolic," he stressed.    "But even if such a symbolic gesture of goodwill is not  appreciated, then certainly your voice loses the power of  persuasion. You cannot tell the Hindus to keep quiet. You can't  tell them not to start new problems," he observed.    He accused the government of trying to gag the voice of the  VHP by banning it. He pointed out that the supreme court had  decided the case on the Jamaat-e-Islami and not the VHP, though  both were simultaneously banned.    Asked to comment on the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]  describing Hindutva as its "ideological mascot," the RSS chief  avoided any direct comment. "It is for them to say what they  like about their policies. At the same time, how can one forget  that they (BJP) have opposed GATT and the Dunkel proposals?" he  asked.    On the present Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samajwadi Party  (SP-BSP) government, he said it was a passing phase, "not a very  significant phenomenon" and which may not have a lasting effect  on the nation's political equations. It was difficult to say  long that government would last, he added.    "But the mutual contradictions between them (SP-BSP) and  their internal dissent are so acute that unless they exercise  extreme caution, they would not be together for long," he  predicted.    The RSS weekly wanted to know its chief's comments on the  BSP  general secretary, Ms Mayawati's statement to "finish off  Gandhism" and her pitting Gandhiji against Dr Ambedkar.    He said the BSP had not vowed to finish Gandhism. "Strangely  enough, earlier, its leader, Kanshi Ram, had criticised Dr  Ambedkar. In Maharashtra, he had said Harijans would not make  any progress unless they denounced Dr Ambedkar," he pointed out.    "His (Kanshi Ram's) argument was that whereas he treats the  Dalits as equal partners, Dr Ambedkar made them beg for their  rights. In his own style, he tried to belittle Dr Ambedkar. But  when he realised the tremendous work done by Dr Ambedkar and the  admiration he commands among the backwards, Kanshi Ram had to  change his tracks," he added.    "Now the same people--Kanshi Ram, Mayawati and company--are  keen on projecting themselves as followers of Ambedkar. This is  something new," he noted.    The RSS chief alleged that Mr Kanshi Ram had accumulated  funds which, according to him, confirmed his "foreign, American  and Christian connections."    Prof Singh felt that Dalit politics could never take deep  roots in Uttar Pradesh as it had in Maharashtra.</p>

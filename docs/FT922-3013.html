			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Gardening: Rocket and rolls at the opera - Gardens to Visit COSI Fan Tutte: These Things All Women Do . . . according to Mozart, they flirt stupendously as soon as their fiances' backs are turned; they have the morals of a butterfly; serving maids are even worse, and neither maids nor ladies can resist a compliment. In Mozart's view, all these things happen in the 18th century when fiances appear to go off to war. His opera lives in the mind, but I have just had my idea of it turned upside down. It has been turned upside down by Glyndebourne. It is more than a matter of the set and direction: anything goes nowadays, and I suppose that a Mediterranean liner in Edwardian times is as good a setting as any other if you decide to ignore Mozart's own intentions. It is perhaps bad luck that, this year, the two fiances look decidedly like the Maxwell brothers in disguise. The upheaval, in my case, went further than the setting: it extended to the modern meaning of the title. Ladies, perhaps, still have butterfly morals, but at Glyndebourne these are not the Only Things All Women Do. So far as I could discover, they do not flirt. Instead, they sit on ground-sheets and swap little bits of salmon on rye bread; after act one, they produce chicken legs in aspic from plastic containers; and they try to stop the icing looking lop-sided on the designer pudding of the week. Before and after the first act, they dispense a corporate picnic for menfolk and such clients as can be persuaded to leave London in a dinner jacket in mid-afternoon. What Women Do, when their husbands have risen high enough in the corporate army, seems to be to hold a sort of Tupperware party for oldies on a grass lawn between rose beds and a herd of Sussex cows. It is 30 years since anyone last invited me to see this British spectacle. Naturally, there have been changes. In the 1950s, bridge rolls were still in evidence and people might be wearing suede shoes under their dinner jackets. In the 1990s, halting French is spoken on picnic rugs to make European clients feel at home. 'Et puis,' I heard, 'le moteur dans le bateau was en anglais on dit conked out.' Communications have improved drastically for anyone who regrets leaving home before bedtime. I eavesdropped while a father dialled his son on the cordless telephone to check that he had survived the first day of the common entrance exam, which was designed to waft him on to a public school. There was also the matter of the garden. Thirty years ago, there was vastly less of it, but it looks as if there will be even more in another five years. The mowing is extending ambitiously past the open water and out beside the cow fields; irregular beds have been filled for the moment with white foxgloves; music is the focus of the evening but the garden is not a poor second fiddle, losing its pitch gradually. It has to be run collectively, and its upkeep must always influence change. Individual touches of eccentricity are laborious and inappropriate: it needs to loom elegantly through the evening light while the picnics are balancing an hour or two's attention to a high-class score. Along the terraces, ruby-pink valerian and violet-blue geraniums keep company with quartered roses in old-fashioned shades of pink and white. Colours tend to be segregated. The walls of the opera house are a weathered background for fine climbers; no other theatre has such a floral setting for enjoyment between acts. As I picked my way through the Highland rugs, I admired it, but found it curious. In this difficult year, there are few weeds and even fewer flopping roses, but the effect strikes a chord from an earlier era. Never before have I felt that gardens, too, have age bands. At Glyndebourne, the colours and planting suit the profile of the audience: middle-aged, proven performers not deterred when exposing their finery to an evening in the rain. Perhaps it is the ruby-pinks and violet-blues, and perhaps it looks quite different in August. Like most of the ticket-holders, the borders have roots in the early 1960s: the picture is suited by its frame, corporate Tupperware among pastel planting as the light fades and the cows stay their distance behind a wavy fence of Sussex post and rail. Inside and outside, the sense of period varies. If an ocean liner in a Mozart opera strikes you as rum, there is always the garden in the interval to reassure you that your generation still is true to its tone. Last week, I envied a superb orange-yellow fremontodendron, that wall-climber with rough leaves which tend to make admirers sneeze. Up one wing of the opera house, it is out of reach of noses and is flowering as if at home in its native California. At a lower level, the winter has been kinder to Glyndebourne's large-leaved erodiums than to mine, all of which have died. The star turn there is the one called pelargonifolium, which has white flowers, dark markings and leaves like a geranium. By now, the roses round the opera must be looking their best and we could all copy the casual presence of white foxgloves through borders which are starting to make a mark. For my money, however, the star of the evening lay elsewhere. Through many of the borders, the Glyndebourne gardeners have scattered the simple White Sweet Rocket, that wonderful filler for the early June gap. Anyone can grow it from packets of seed, sown outdoors now in order to flower next year. It flourishes in half-shade, even beneath hedges, where it will reach a height and width of about 2 ft. Seedsmen tend to sell mixtures of the purple-and-white varieties, but pure hesperis alba or White Form is the only one you want. It is no use asking me for ideas about a picnic or how to scrape mayonnaise off a rug. My lesson from the evening is that sowing White Sweet Rocket is one of the things that all of us, male and female, ought to do.</p>

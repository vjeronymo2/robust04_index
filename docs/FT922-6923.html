			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report ALUMINIUM closed ahead on the LME after three-month metal hit stiff resistance around Dollars 1,360 a tonne. The overall steadier trend was prompted by a constructive close on Tuesday and by speculative interest. TIN came under profit-taking and technical selling in the afternoon, prompted by the failure of three-month metal to test Dollars 6,300 a tonne after hitting a new 18-month high of Dollars 6,290 in the morning. But the selling was well absorbed, with underlying interest evident below Dollars 6,250. PLATINUM held at Dollars 361 an ounce on the London bullion market after earlier falling on reported Middle East sales and a technical correction to Tuesday's rally. Analysts said the market had been overbought on its rise to Dollars 364, but sentiment was bullish on Nymex, where platinum futures were higher at midday, again outperforming Comex gold and silver. Optimism that economies worldwide are recovering sparked buying. Analysts also cited continued concerns over the availability of supply in the physical markets. Comex GOLD futures were weaker at midday on selling by players disappointed at the failure to surmount resistance levels on Tuesday. Compiled from Reuters</p>

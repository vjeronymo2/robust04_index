			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai at a Hanoi </F> Investment Seminar on 17 March -- recorded, in Thai fading into  Vietnamese translation]    [Text] Dear friends: As has already been reported, the  prime minister of the Kingdom of Thailand, Chuan Likphai, now on  an official friendship visit to Vietnam, attended and delivered  a congratulatory speech at the opening session of the seminar on  environment and investment opportunities in Vietnam held in  Hanoi this morning by Vietnam's State Commitee for Cooperation  and Investment. He said:    [Chuan] It is my great pleasure and joy to have the honor of  attending the seminar opening today, held in an atmostphere of  cooperation between Vietnamese and Thai businessmen, who have a  very important mandate to promote bilateral cooperation and  investment.    Thailand and Vietnam are two close neighbors with historical  ties of friendship. Now that the situation has changed and has  become much better than in the past, the two countries must  bring about improvements to achieve closer ties, especially on  the issue of investment and trade cooperation on the basis of  mutual benefit.    I would like to compliment Vietnam for the economic growth  it  has achieved since the introduction of its renovation policy in  1987. Its economy has achieved tangible development. I believe  that with their abundant natural resources and their  determination, the Vietnamese people can achieve rapid national  growth through economic development. The Thai Government is  ready to cooperate with Vietnam in achieving that goal. The  establishment of the Thailand-Vietnam Cooperation Committee  provides a fine basis for the development of cooperative  bilateral relations. This cooperation committee has met twice  and its latest meeting was in November 1993. This reflects the  goal of both countries to develop increasingly durable and  closer ties. In the area Thai-Vietnamese trade relations in  particular, the Thai Government has totally supported and  encouraged the development of free bilateral trade. The volume  of bilateral trade has increased from 2.876 billion baht in 1990  to 4.916 billion baht in 1993. In addition, the two countries  have reached a consensus that they will set up a trade  subcommittee under the cooperation committee to promote  bilateral trade. The Thai Government has agreed to provide  long-term credit for Vietnam, to begin from December last year.  All this shows that trade cooperation has become ever closer  and has enjoyed opportunities for development, particularly in  terms of investment.    Thai investors are showing increasing interest in Vietnam.  From 1987 to 1991, Thai investors had 27 investment projects  with a total capital of over $6 million licensed. This ranks  them 12th in the list of countries with investments in Vietnam,  and shows Thailand's growing interest in Vietnam.    As far as I see it, my exchange of views with His Excellency  Vo Van Kiet yesterday has helped to create confidence for  increased bilateral trade ties. The Thai Government has tasked  its investment committee with the duty of creating favorable  conditions for Thai businessmen wishing to invest in Vietnam.  In 1992, the Thai Investment Committee and the Vietnamese  Committee for Cooperation and Investment signed an agreement on  investment cooperation. The Vietnamese Committee for  Cooperation and Investment has cooperated with Thai Government  agencies in various areas in the past. It has on several  occasions welcomed many Thai delegations seeking investment  opportunities and disseminated information on investment. I  would like to emphasize here that it is the goal of the Thai  Government to encourage Thai investors to invest in Vietnam on a  mutually beneficial basis in line with the socioeconomic policy  of each country.    On this occasion, allow me to thank his excellency the  minister of state in charge of Vietnam's State Committee for  Cooperation and Investment for having created opportunities for  Thai investors to invest and do business in Vietnam. I also  hope to have Your Excellency's support and attention for the  period ahead to create confidence in Thai investors wishing to  invest in Vietnam. I hope this seminar will help promote the  rapid growth of bilateral cooperation and investment.    During my exchange of views with His Excellency Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet, we also stressed the need for the two  sides to create conditions for the development of bilateral  cooperation and investment. I also briefed his excellency the  prime minister on the difficulties Thai investors now face, and  expressed the hope that the Vietnamese side would create  conditions for the quicker development of bilateral cooperation.    During my meeting with General Secretary Do Muoi, I also  exchanged views with him. The general secretary said he would  pay attention to creating the conditions for and help resolve  the problems that have been held up.    It is hoped that investment and trade cooperation between  Vietnam and Thailand will develop further.</p>

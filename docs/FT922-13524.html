			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Rolls-Royce wins Tupolev engine deal ROLLS-ROYCE will provide engines for a new Russian passenger aircraft under an ambitious manufacturing deal concluded yesterday which could bring the UK aero-engine manufacturer about Pounds 490m worth of business over the next decade. The agreement, signed in Moscow by Robert Fleming, the UK investment management company, with Russia's Tupolev design bureau and Aviastar, the country's biggest aircraft plant, creates a joint stock company to produce and market a 200-seat twin engine passenger aircraft. The aircraft, known as the TU-204 in its existing Russian-only form, will be fitted with Rolls-Royce RB211-535 engines and western avionics. The avionics supplier has yet to be determined. The pioneering deal not only gives a foreign company a direct stake in the Russian aviation industry but represents a badly-needed victory for the Russian government's campaign to attract foreign capital despite the obstacles facing potential investors. The British-Russian Aviation Corporation (Bravia) will be 50 per cent owned by a subsidiary of Fleming's Russian investment fund, with Tupolev and Aviastar holding 25 per cent each. The deal seeks to marry Russia's manufacturing capacity and cheap labour force with western know-how to produce a low-cost aircraft which can compete with western counterparts. Its nearest western equivalent is the US Boeing-757, which is powered by the same engine. The engines are to be paid for with foreign exchange earnings from the sale of the aircraft either outside Russia or to airlines inside the country once they have access to hard currency. The first two engines, for a test aircraft, are due to be delivered to Russia in May. Although Rolls-Royce will not hold a stake in the company, it will have a seat on the board of directors.</p>

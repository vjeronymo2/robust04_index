			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Irish row over firing of telecom chairman A POLITICAL row is brewing in Ireland over last weekend's dismissal of Mr Brendan Hynes as chairman of Telecom Eireann, the state-run tele-communications company, writes Tim Coone in Dublin. Mr Hynes was sacked by Ms Maire Geoghegan Quinn, the transport and telecommunications minister, just six months after having been appointed to the post with a brief to carry out a thorough review of the company's operations, and, it is thought, to prepare it for privatisation within two or three years. No reason has been given for his dismissal, although deep differences over the company's direction between Mr Hynes and other board members are thought to lie behind the decision. Ms Geoghegan Quinn is due to make a statement to parliament today. Opposition leaders are to press for an explanation. Questions are also expected about the inquiry into a property deal for a new corporate headquarters, which resulted in the resignation of the previous chairman, Mr Michael Smurfitt, last September.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: The cost of being dedicated to money - Summer fiction THE LAST WORD by Paul Micou Bantam Pounds 14.99, 252 pages CROSSING THE RIVER by Caryl Phillips Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 237 pages REMEMBERING BABYLON by David Malouf Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99, 200 pages AMERICA IS where it all happens, religion-wise, and nowhere more so than in Gawpassat, a prosperous little New England town. Here Uncle Ian Richmond, the mystical central figure of Paul Micou's latest novel, has set up the Institute of the Word, a tax-free organisation dedicated to making money and peddling religion, in that order. So successful is Uncle Ian that the fruits of his labour include a large mansion, a nationwide TV show, Dollars 70m in cash, and a canary yellow helicopter in which he flits from airport to home to yacht club on the Lord's business. Not bad for a failed lawyer. But Ian has a problem, one that will not go away. He is going to die soon - the date of his death, preordained by God, has been predicted in one of his many best-selling books on the Word - and he has no successor, no heir to the Richmond empire. Enter his nephew, Matthew 'Top' Richmond, a shiftless traveller whose only claim to fame is that he once climbed Mount Everest in the company of a black man. Matthew soon discovers what is expected of him. Discovers too that there is much more to Uncle Ian than he had ever imagined . . . It is a nice little satire, neatly crafted, gently poking the subject in the ribs without ever drawing real blood. Micou is not a man for the jugular when a simple nudge will do. He has an original mind, and a quietly cerebral sense of humour. Rather more sharply etched is Crossing the River, by Caryl Phillips, a thoroughly absorbing novel which continues a theme dear to the author's heart, namely the 18th century slave trade and the African diaspora thereafter. The book begins with the sale of two brothers and a sister into slavery, and in four disparate pieces traces the fortunes of some of their descendants. It sounds unpromising on paper, but is rather better than that in practice. Phillips was recently identified by Granta magazine as one of Britain's 20 best young novelists, in which capacity his work has been condemned by fellow writer Julie Burchill as absolute crap. But if La Burchill can find anybody to read the book to her, she will discover in fact that it is actually pretty good. The first piece deals with a freed American slave, sent back to Liberia by his indulgent master. The slave is supposed to be taking religion to his less fortunate brethren, but when his master follows him he finds that the slave has regressed under the influences of Africa and is living little better than . . . well, a savage. The second deals movingly with the plight of an elderly American negress, hoping against all the odds to be reunited with her daughter, sold away from her when the plantation was auctioned. The third recreates the log of the 18th-century ship which transported the original slaves, and the fourth tells the story of a wartime Englishwoman who has an affair with a black GI and bears his child, which is given away for adoption. On the face of it the four stories appear to have little in common, but they are all united by a strong narrative and a very high command of the English language. The author is a rapidly maturing talent, and Crossing the River is unquestionably his best book to date. Good too is Remembering Babylon by David Malouf, a tale of the Australian outback in the last century, when much of the continent was unexplored. The story is seen through the eyes of a teenage castaway, washed ashore on the coast of Queensland and rescued by a tribe of aborigines. He lives with his rescuers for the next 16 years, until the first white settlers arrive and he gets a chance to rejoin his own kind. The book begins with his return to civilisation and the difficulty he has in adjusting to a very different environment. He is taken in by a Scottish family, which regards him more as a cuckoo in the nest than as one of themselves. Other whites are wary of him, particularly when they catch him talking to a couple of abos. If the idea sounds vaguely familiar, that is because Malouf has covered similar ground before in his earlier novel An Imaginary Life. Remembering Babylon is in part a reworking of the same theme, a reflection of Malouf's abiding interest in nature and the great outdoors.</p>

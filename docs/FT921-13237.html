			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / United Tech to cut 14,000 jobs UNITED Technologies announced yesterday that it would cut its workforce by almost 14,000 over the next two years, close or consolidate more than 100 facilities around the world and take a Dollars 1.275bn (Pounds 709m) fourth-quarter pre-tax charge against earnings. The US aerospace and building products group has been hit hard by recession in the US, lower American defence spending and turmoil in the world civil aviation industry. It is the latest in a long list of blue chip US companies to announce severe cuts. The group's businesses include Pratt &amp; Whitney, the aero-engine maker, Sikorsky helicopters, Otis elevators and Carrier, the air conditioning company. UTC said the restructuring charge, together with a Dollars 256m pre-tax charge to increase its reserves for environmental issues, produced a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 1.22bn, or Dollars 10.33 a share. That compared with net income of Dollars 168.8m or Dollars 1.24 a share a year earlier. The company said the shake-up should produce annual cost savings of Dollars 1.1bn by 1994. It is aiming for an 18 per cent return on equity by that year compared with 15.1 per cent in 1990. The package involves cutting about 7 per cent of the group's workforce, including a 12 per cent drop in executive jobs, which will save about Dollars 440m a year. The plant rationalisation will reduce manufacturing capacity by 16 per cent, saving Dollars 260m annually. Mr Robert Daniell, chairman, said UTC also planned improvements in its design, engineering and manufacturing processes to save about Dollars 380m a year. UTC would become 'leaner and tougher minded', he added. Mr Daniell won wide praise after he took over as chairman in 1986 for reducing UTC bureaucracy and cutting costs, but Wall Street's enthusiasm has waned over the past year, because of a decline in profits, the uncertain and intensely competitive market facing Pratt &amp; Whitney and continuing poor results at Carrier. The biggest restructuring will be at Pratt &amp; Whitney. It will shed 5,000 jobs, or 11 per cent of its workforce, shrink manufacturing space by 30 per cent and cut manufacturing suppliers from about 500 to less than 250. In the fourth quarter, Pratt saw operating profits before charges dip from Dollars 252m to Dollars 138m, because of lower engine volume and spare part sales. For all of 1991 UTC reported a loss of Dollars 1.02bn, or Dollars 8.91 a share, compared with income of Dollars 750.6m, or Dollars 5.53 a share in 1990.</p>

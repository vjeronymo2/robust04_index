			<p>BFN     [Text] Concerning yesterday's passage by two chetnik tanks  on the Pale-Mt. Trebevic-Trnovo direction with the permission of  and escorted by the UN Protection Force, Brigadier General Vahid  Karavelic, commander of the 1st Corps, has issued the following  statement. It reads as follows:    At the news conference General Rose said that this had been  agreed between Akashi and war criminal Karadzic, and did not  represent a violation of the cease-fire. The chetniks said that  our offensive activities were in preparation on the Mt. Igman  and Mt. Bjelasnica fronts and were therefore asking for  permission to transfer the tanks.    [word indistinct] says that the chetniks could engage on  these fronts forces of the strength of one division in order to  divert the attention of the international public from the  concentration of manpower and equipment around Brcko and Olovo.    Today at 1530 the chetniks issued orders to all the units in  Trnovo to be at full combat readiness. This is said in the  statement by Brigadier General Vahid Karavelic.</p>

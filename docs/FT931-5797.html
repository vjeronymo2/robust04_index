			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Technology: A blurred vision of the future - Louise Kehoe looks at moves in the US to establish high-definition television standards Couch potatoes take note. The technical standards that may determine the quality of the television pictures you can watch for the next several decades are about to be decided in Alexandria, Virginia, a suburb of Washington DC. This is the site of tests conducted by the Federal Communication Committee's advisory committee on advanced television. For the past year it has been a hive of activity as four industry groups have competed to display the clearest and brightest television pictures. While the task facing this panel has been to select technical standards for the US, it appears their decision may also strongly influence high-definition television standards in Europe, in the wake of the disintegration of European Community efforts to develop a home-grown version of HDTV. Exhaustive - and, according to participants, exhausting - tests of five proposed versions of HDTV (two from one of the groups) have not yet produced a clear winner. Last week, the FCC panel, which represents the biggest companies in US television, deferred a decision, urging three of the four groups involved to unite in an effort to set a 'world-leading standard' for HDTV. The panel concluded that each of the proposed systems had some shortcomings. One system, from NHK, Japan's public broadcasting corporation, was ruled out because it uses analogue technology. The FCC had already indicated its preference for a digital system, which will transform the TV set into a multi-purpose display for TV and computer images. Richard Wiley, chairman of the advisory committee, said a 'grand alliance' of the companies competing to set the standard would combine the best elements of each one's technology. Already, two of the three groups - General Instrument with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Zenith with AT&amp;T - have agreed to share royalties if either side wins the competition. A third consortium comprising NBC, the US television station, Thomson of France, Philips of the Netherlands and David Sarnoff Research Centre and Compression Labs of the US, has the choice of competing or collaborating with other participants. Drawing the industry groups together will be a delicate process, because they have been contestants in the first round of the competition to establish industry standards. However, Wiley said that FCC panel members will help to negotiate an agreement between the groups. An agreement to merge may be imminent. They face a deadline of March 15 to decide whether to continue to compete or work together. The pressure to form a broad alliance is intense in this 'winner takes all' race. A merger would also rule out appeals from losing parties that could delay the implementation of HDTV standards. A 'grand alliance' of the competing HDTV systems 'might more effectively and rapidly advance the establishment of an HDTV broadcast standard,' Wiley said. The advisory panel's decision is now likely to be postponed for several months. This could delay the FCC's timetable for the final selection of an HDTV standard. The agency had hoped to make a final choice by the end of this year. However, a decision could come much earlier if the four competing systems are consolidated as now appears likely. Talks are under way among the groups that could lead to a combination, according to participants. Forming an alliance may be easier than agreeing on technical standards, according to participants. While the business arrangements of such an agreement can be worked out, each group has 'religious faith' in its technology. Pragmatism appears likely to prevail, however, and the consensus is that it will be possible to blend the best aspects of each proposed system. Despite the delays, US TV watchers can look forward to viewing HDTV in their homes by mid-1995 or early 1996. They will, however, have to be prepared to pay about Dollars 3,000 to Dollars 3,500 for the pleasure of sharper picture quality. Those prepared to wait another couple of years may be able to jump on the bandwagon for a mere Dollars 1,000, according to industry projections - only two to four times the average US price of a standard TV set. According to the FCC's current plans, today's standard broadcasts and the new HDTV signals will co-exist for about 15 years.</p>

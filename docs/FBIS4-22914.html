The determinations were  carried out in the region of Orsha, Mogilev and Rechitsa  townships above and below the population points. It was shown  that the water content of petroleum products and phenols  exceeded the maximum permissible concentration. In respect to  petroleum products, the most contaminated river segment was in  the vicinity of Orsha. The phenol content in water was higher  downstream from Orsha and Mogilev. It was noted that during the  past years the concentration of SAS in the Dnipro river water  increased in the vicinity of Orsha and Mogilev. Figure 1;  references 9.</p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STREET CRIME DEATH TOLL EXCEEDS 20 FOR WEEKEND  </P> <P> Over the three-day Memorial Day holiday -- a weekend usually punctuated by  tributes to the nation's war dead and tallies of highway death statistics --  law enforcement officers in Los Angeles County were investigating more than 20  homicides.  </P> <P> The dead included a man shot over a drug deal; a security guard gunned down in  a parking lot, and a West Hollywood man who died at a hospital after being  found wandering the streets with slash wounds.  </P> <P> Most of the weekend incidents were gang-related, law enforcement officers said.  But as is often the case, innocent victims also got in the way of feuding  rivals.  </P> <P> "There were a lot of people who died," said Sheriff's Deputy Gabe Ramirez,  reading from a long list of shooting reports that sheriff's detectives were  investigating. "It's a real shame."  </P> <P> In one incident, David Lesperance was shot early Sunday after an alleged drug  deal apparently went sour at Aliso Village housing project in East Los Angeles,  officers said. He drove his car several blocks before crashing into a building,  and died at the scene.  </P> <P> The security guard was shot in the parking lot outside a Whittier Boulevard  night club about 10:30 p.m. Friday, deputies said. There were no suspects.  </P> <P> A 9-year-old boy was critically wounded Friday night while was playing ball in  front of his home in South-Central Los Angeles. Police did not release his  name, but they said he "apparently got in the way of a bullet meant for a gang  banger."  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Sgt. Chuck Brown of the 77th Division in the South-Central  area of the city said that between 6 p.m. Friday and noon Sunday, there were a  dozen reports of shooting incidents in the area, resulting in three deaths.  </P> <P> "But the count doesn't surprise me," he said tiredly. "It's like that any night  of the week."  </P> <P> Gang members were thought to be responsible for two of the deaths Saturday  night, Brown said. At about 8:45, two men standing near 70th and Hoover streets  were shot by assailants in a passing car.  </P> <P> Five minutes later, the same suspects drove by a group of people at 80th and  Hoover streets, killing another man and wounding three others, police said.  </P> <P> In a third incident in the area, an unidentified man was shot to death Saturday  night in in the 4500 block of Van Ness Street.  </P> <P> Deputies were also investigating the gang-related stabbing deaths Saturday  night of two youths. Ricardo Hernandez, 16, and Jesus Coronado, 15, were  stabbed during a party in East Los Angeles on Friday night. A companion was  hospitalized with wounds.  </P> <P> A man identified as Alvaro Ortega, 26, of Willowbrook, died early Sunday at  Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center after friends brought him into the  emergency room with numerous gunshot wounds in the neck and torso. He had been  shot in front of a home in Lynwood, officers said.  </P> <P> In La Puente, an assailant opened fire with a semiautomatic weapon at 1 a.m.  Sunday, killing Phillip Juarez, 20, of Valinda. Three other men were wounded,  deputies said.  </P> <P> An unidentified West Hollywood man was found by deputies after they received an  emergency call complaining of a man exposing himself on the street. When  officers arrived, they found a dazed man, who had slash marks on his wrists.  The man died later at a local hospital. Deputies said they could not determine  his cause of death until an autopsy was conducted.  </P> <P> Other incidents included:  </P> <P> * A 23-year-old man killed by automatic-weapon fire early Sunday in Maywood.  </P> <P> * A 21-year-old man killed in a drive-by shooting in mid-city Los Angeles early  Saturday.  </P> <P> * Warren Pena, 18, of Compton, killed in a drive-by shooting early Saturday.  </P> <P> * Roberto Nunez, 21, killed in a street shooting in West Los Angeles Friday  evening.  </P> <P> * Aaron Hernandez, 23, killed in Sepulveda. A suspect was later arrested, but  police did not disclose a motive for the shooting.  </P></p>

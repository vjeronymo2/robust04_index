			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FCC HAS TO REVISE ITS DEFINITION OF 'EFFECTIVE' COMPETITION AS THE CABLE  INDUSTRY MATURES  </P> <P> Perhaps the 1987 deregulation of the cable television industry hasn't been a  benefit to consumers, as deregulation of many other industries has. The Times'  balanced article ("Rising Rates Bring Cable Firms Static From Public," March  19) cited the rising costs and stagnant services. But at least where the Los  Angeles metropolitan area is concerned, I believe one major factor in consumer  complaints was overlooked in the story: If reception quality is at all  important, most people probably have little choice but to become cable  subscribers -- and therefore particularly frustrated with the industry's  vagaries.  </P> <P> The Federal Communication Commission's standard for deregulating cable service  in a community is the existence of at least three over-the-air television  signals serving the same area. But in the many places I've lived in Los Angeles  and Orange Counties, I've never had effective over-the-air reception. And for  the large and ever-growing population of apartment dwellers, rooftop antennae  are not an option. I doubt I am alone in subscribing to basic cable service  simply for quality reception. The FCC should revise its definition of  "effective" competition.  </P> <P> DAVID CRAIN  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

Russia should be given the greatest credit.    On February 9, NATO, while keeping Russia in the dark, sent  an ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs, requesting them either to  withdraw heavy weapons from the 20-kilometer exclusion zone or  face air strikes.    Russia promptly responded to NATO's move. Moscow launched a  strong media offensive against possible NATO air strikes, which  it said could only help escalate the war and damage the peace  process. It said NATO had no right to make any decision on the  Bosnia issue on behalf of the U.N. Security Council.    On the other hand, Russia started an all-out diplomatic  campaign to keep the ultimatum from being materialized.  President Boris Yeltsin led the mission personally to explain  to the leaders of the Western countries Russia's proposal: to  demilitarize Sarajevo and put it under U.N. control. He also  called for urgent U.N. meeting to cope with the worsening  situation.    On February 17, three days before the deadline, Yeltsin sent  his special envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, to  Sarajevo with his letter. The special envoy promised the ethnic  Serb forces that Russia will deploy peacekeepers in the Bosnian  capital. In return, the Serb side agreed to implement the  ultimatum.    The crisis was eased for a while, and everybody sighed a  breath of relief.    Local news media commented favorably on Moscow's mediation,  describing it as a good show of Russia's independent foreign  policy, which might help Russia strengthen its position and its  influence on the world stage.    The Balkan region had been a sphere of influence of the  former Soviet Union. Russia, the legitimate heir of the Soviet  empire, wants to keep it away from the finger of NATO, its  flirting friend and hereditary foe.    Moreover, if NATO had launched air strikes, it would have  been its first military action on territories under the tutelage  of the former Soviet Union.    The Russian newspaper "PRAVDA" commented that it would have  meant that NATO, the overpowering international military group  of the time, was broadening its sphere of responsibility, and  that it would harm Russia's strategic interests.    From the geopolitical point of view, Russia wants to retain  its interests in the Balkan region and in the meantime  strengthen its big-power image in the world. The Russian Army  newspaper "KRASNAYA ZVEZDA" said that if the West really wants  peace in the Balkans, it ought to treat Russia as a big power  and an equal partner. Peace could be achieved in former  Yugoslavia and Bosnia only when the interests of various sides,  including Russia, have been taken into careful account, it said.    In Russia, political parties and government branches are  unprecedentedly united in objecting to NATO's air strike threat.  Yeltsin's tough stance on the issue will surely moderate the  anti-air strike sentiment at home and strengthen his leadership.    Moscow's success in persuading ethnic Serbs to end their  23-month siege of Sarajevo has pushed one step forward the  process of politically settling the Bosnia conflict. Kremlin is  winning in its diplomatic campaign.    On February 21, after the deadline passed peacefully,  Yeltsin  phoned German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, putting forward three  major tasks for an ultimate solution to the Bosnia crisis:    -- Entrusting Sarajevo to U.N. management;    -- Taking measures to strengthen other "security zones" in  Bosnia; and    -- Urging the three warring sides to sign an agreement on a  peaceful settlement of the conflict.    Observers here predict that Russia will seek to play an  increasingly independent role in the making of peace in the  war-tattered former Yugoslavia.</p>

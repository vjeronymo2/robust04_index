			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Man in the News: Fixer who may come unstuck - Dan Rostenkowski It is the best of times and the worst of times for Mr Dan Rostenkowski. The burly Chicago Democrat has been in his element, bullying and cajoling his congressional colleagues towards a deal on President Bill Clinton's budget. As chairman of the Ways and Means committee of the House of Representatives, Mr Rostenkowski is, as always, central to tax negotiations. But he remains the target of a two-year criminal investigation by federal prosecutors who have requisitioned a dozen years of his cheques, bills and campaign documents, and subpoenaed his staff, his friends and his daughters. Last week, Mr Robert Rota, the former House of Representatives postmaster, pleaded guilty to three misdemeanour charges, including aiding 'Congressman A' to embezzle at least Dollars 21,300 between 1985 and 1991 by giving him cash in exchange for office expense vouchers made out for stamp purchases. The amounts and dates of the vouchers filed with the court match those listed in separate House records for Mr Rostenkowski. Mr Rostenkowski last week reaffirmed that he was 'innocent of any wrongdoing', and no charges of any kind have been filed against him. But Mr Rota's plea has made many in Mr Rostenkowski's two home cities of Washington and Chicago conclude that it is only a matter of time before he faces indictment, and with it, under Democratic Party rules, removal from the Ways and Means chairmanship. His critics have often dismissed him as a typical Chicago machine politician, and indeed, like his mentor, Mayor Richard Daley, who brought the system of patronage and political favours to perfection in his rule over the city from 1955 until his death in 1976, he has always known the importance of getting his supporters' streets swept and finding jobs for their nephews. In his 20s, when trying to make it as a professional baseball player, he trimmed his name to Rosten, but regained the -kowski when he entered politics, aged 24, following in his father's footsteps as a member of the Illinois state legislature. He still lives in the house where he was born,in a Polish-American community on Chicago's north-west side, and keeps only a sparse, one-bedroom flat in Washington. His wife, LaVerne, does not come to Washington. He still delivers for Chicago, winning the city regular federal money for roads, transit systems and public housing. Mr Rostenkowski is also defiantly old school in his way of doing business, which involves a mastery of the art of compromise, backed up by endless loyalty and considerable courage. meaning what precise He is unmatched in his ability to read the mood of the House, to sense the exact combination of concessions and bullying that will be needed to strike a deal. His legislative monument is probably the 1986 tax reform, which lowered income tax rates in exchange for the elimination of a host of deductions and loopholes. The measure never commanded much popular support, but Mr Rostenkowski manoeuvred it through a reluctant House making concessions only to members who would promise to back the bill. It finally put paid to Mr Rostenkowski's earlier reputation for political laziness ' for being quick to shoot down a bill that he judged would not pass the House, but slower to do the hard work needed to get tough measures into law. As chairman he demands the same from members of his Ways and Means committee, which has jurisdiction over almost all the revenue legislation and almost half of the spending that passes through Congress. He has little patience for the Senate, whose convoluted procedural rules he finds impede the constructive work of legislation, and none at all for senators who retire in frustration. 'You don't quit. You fix the machinery,' he says. He has no time at all for members of Congress who condone public criticism of their institution, reserving particular scorn for those who seek to curb their own pay. 'Sure there are perquisites that come with the job. But you know as well as I do that perks can't make up for the birthdays, ballgames, holidays and meals that we miss,' he says. Making no secret of his belief that he is worth a great deal more than his congressional salary of Dollars 133,600 a year, Mr Rostenkowski lives a lifestyle that systematically exploits these perks. Travel, often to golfing events, is paid for by business and lobbying groups; and meals by Mr Rostenkowski's campaign fund or his political action committee, which raises money to support other candidates. Blurred lines between political and social activities are not unusual in Congress. But few can match the chairman of Ways and Means in his ability to reap the rewards of office. Indeed, Mr Rostenkowski's skill at stretching his perks to the limit is the reason why many colleagues find it hard to believe that he would have gone beyond those limits. Why would he embezzle small change from the House post office when he could legally have pocketed more than Dollars 1m from his campaign fund if he had retired last year, under a law which left longserving members of Congress subject to older, looser campaign finance rules. The question hangs unspoken over the conference room in which House negotiators, led by Mr Rostenkowski, argue with their Senate counterparts over a compromise budget bill and complaining about the 'do-nothing' Senate's inability to pass anything with even the slightest grain of controversy. For all the reformism of the last 20 years, in which clean politics has come to outweigh good policy with US public opinion, it has often seemed over the last week of negotiations that Mr Rostenkowski's old school arm-twisting skills were as much in demand as ever. The budget agreed by the Democrats yesterday, however, marks a victory for the 'do-nothing' Senate and a failure for Mr Rostenkowski. It may also sound the knell for a politician from another era.</p>

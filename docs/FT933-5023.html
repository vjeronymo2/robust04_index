			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (11): Aware of the risks - Life becomes more complex LIFE reinsurance has traditionally been the low-risk, low-margin end of the business tacked on to a much larger and more profitable general reinsurance capacity, But staggering losses in some business classes, including usually safe areas such as home and auto reinsurance, are causing a re-think about the merits of life cover for the reinsurance business. Mr Roger Sansome, director of long-term business at Mercantile and General, a subsidiary of Prudential plc and the UK's largest life reinsurance underwriter, said that 10 years ago only a third of M&amp;G's business was life reinsurance. Now, life reinsurance is two-thirds of the total and that could go as high as 75 per cent. 'If you get the market right, you should be able to make a better profit out of the non-life business because it's more volatile. The life business is less so and the profits are lower.' But because risks are fairly predictable in pure life cover, reinsurers are able to estimate the incidence of future claims and to price products appropriately. Indeed, the great shudder which ran through the life reinsurance industry in the late 1980s, when the Aids virus first posed a threat to existing actuarial calculations, has now proved to be somewhat overblown. The incidence of Aids among Britain's insured population has turned out to be at the lowest end of estimates prepared by the Institute of Actuaries and both premium rates and reinsurance rates have eased in the past year. Mr Wayne Daniel, product development actuary at M&amp;G, said that at his company the premium rate to guarantee a Pounds 50,000 sum assured for a 30 year-old man nearly doubled in three years to reflect the increased risk of Aids. In August 1987, that man would have had to pay monthly premiums of Pounds 7.30 but by April 1990 that had risen to Pounds 14.55. But the lower than expected rate of Aids has pushed premium rates down to Pounds 12.90 in April 1993 and there may be scope for further premium reductions. However, pure life cover, the core of the business, is increasingly taking a back seat to the higher risk but potentially more lucrative market of 'living risks'. 'We think the growth is in all the areas where people can claim while they are still alive,' Mr Sansome said, noting that the pace of expansion in these types of policies now outstrips that of straight death cover. That view is echoed by Mr Jonathan Ludbrooke, assistant general manager at Munich Reinsurance which holds roughly 25 per cent of the UK's life reinsurance market. 'For years the reinsurers have been banging the drum and saying to the life insurers that protection products are the way to go. Now, the direct insurers are getting the message,' he said. The greatest growth areas for life reinsurers are critical illness policies, private medical insurance coverage and long-term care policies for the elderly. 'The state would like to withdraw from provision of benefits and the insurers for the most part are happy to take up the role,' Mr Ludbrooke said. But selling these products to a wide portion of the population remains problematic. 'Long term care in particular is a hard sell,' Mr Sansome said. 'We did some market research and found the demand was there until the price was mentioned.' The challenge for the life underwriters and their reinsurers is to find a way to convince the public to buy an expensive product that they still believe is a luxury and not a necessity. 'What is needed are tax breaks and there are no tax breaks although the industry is working on it,' Mr Ludbrooke said. For the reinsurers, one big difficulty remains assessing risk and setting premiums. Since so many life offices rely on the reinsurers to set the rates for them, the reinsurers are now in the position of having to conduct sufficient research to enable them to price products appropriately. 'There is almost no data on which to base your premiums,' Mr Ludbrooke said. The existing information on, say, critical illness experience, covers the general population at large and is often too old or too limited to be of much use. There are substantial statistical variations in life expectancy and healthiness between non-insureds - who tend to be the unemployed and less well-off - and the insured population. Reinsurers believe that one of the best things which could happen to non-death cover is that some of the nation's largest employers begin bolting on to their pension plans options for that sort of provision. That would give reinsurers the necessary data base to help them consider likely loss experience and get the public acquainted with the merits of products such as critical care cover. Mr Ludbrooke suggests that leading schemes might wish to offer their members an option of receiving a lower rate of pension while they are healthy with a guarantee of critical care cover if they become ill. The willingness of pension schemes to be more creative in their benefit offers would create a pool by which underwriters could judge loss experience. A 70 year-old seeking,say, a critical care or PHI policy, is a difficult customer. Although the potential policyholder may have been subject to a full medical examination, insurers do not know how to assess the findings. 'Is what the doctors have found comparable to what is normal in a 70-year old?' Mr Sansome said. 'We don't know because we don't know what is comparable in a 70 year-old.' Meanwhile, the data so far suggest that, if anything, reinsurers and direct insurers are underpricing their Permanent Health Insurance products as well as their long-term and critical illness care products. 'We have wanted to raise our PHI rates,' Mr Sansome said, noting that stiff competition was preventing M&amp;G, the market leader in reinsuring that product, from doing so. 'It's not a market where you can dictate prices because there are other competitors.'</p>

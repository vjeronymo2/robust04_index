			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil rises through resistance barriers Equities in Sao Paulo closed 1.6 per cent higher after moderate trade on selective portfolio-squaring by institutional investors in blue chips and major second-tier stocks at the end of the month. The Bovespa index of the 56 most active shares added 388 points at 24,672. Turnover was Cr406.1bn (Dollars 216.5m). A senior broker said: 'We noted a lot of equity and pension fund managers buying after the market broke some resistance barriers earlier today.' Brokers commented that optimism remained high ahead of the adoption of the country's new currency on July 1 which could pave the way for a significant drop in the 45 per cent monthly inflation level. They added that a forecast rise in consumer spending, taken together with lower export tariffs, were also expected to boost cyclical shares, such as retail and mining companies. Smith Barney Shearson has initiated coverage of Cemig, the electric utility, with a neutral, speculative risk rating. The broker said it believed that the company had a good potential, but maintained a neutral weight because of the country's general economic and political uncertainty.</p>

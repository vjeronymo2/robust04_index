			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Japan's LDP rules out cut in income tax JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday strongly hinted that an income tax cut would not be included in a special package to stimulate the economy, expected to be announced this spring. Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the LDP's policy affairs research council who is co-ordinating the party's plans, said an income tax cut would be discussed only after a package of stimulative measures has been agreed. Mr Mitzusuka said the LDP would push ahead with plans for housing-related tax concessions which would be designed to maintain the momentum of the rally in house building which has recently shown signs of running out of steam. The party would also consider proposals for one-off tax rebates, rather than cuts in tax rates, Mr Mitsuzuka said. He indicated that the outlines of a special economic package would be announced as early as April 1, immediately after the 1993 budget is due to be formally agreed. Mr Mitsuzuka's comments are the clearest sign yet that the LDP may be backing away from plans for a straight income tax cut, which is strongly opposed by the powerful ministry of finance. The finance ministry believes a tax cut would deliver only a negligible boost to consumption, while at the same time risking starting a long-term deterioration in the country's public finances. The timing of further moves to stimulate Japan's flagging economy has been complicated because the Y10,700bn (Pounds 62bn) special package announced last year is still working its way into the country's economy. However, a recent official survey found that only 5 per cent of companies had felt any benefits from the package. About a third of the public works projects including in last year's packages are unlikely to be started until later this year. Japan's industrial production fell 1.3 per cent in December from the previous month, according to revised figures issued by the ministry of trade and industry. The original figures reported a 1 per cent fall.</p>

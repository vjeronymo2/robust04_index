			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sharp first-half improvement at ANZ Banking Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation, one of the big four Australian banks, yesterday reported a sharp improvement in first-half operating profits after tax but before abnormal items, at ADollars 363.8m (USDollars 267.7m). This figure compared with ADollars 170.3m in the same period of the previous year, and ADollars 289.4m in the following six months to end-September. After abnormals, profits were unchanged in the most recent period, although they were reduced to ADollars 72.1m in the corresponding period of the previous year. Like National Australia Bank and Westpac, which reported interim figures last week, ANZ attributed the improvement to the recovery in the domestic economy and to declining bad and doubtful debts. 'The profit levels we are back to are reasonable and respectable, although that's not to say that there won't be further improvement,' said Mr Don Mercer, ANZ's chief executive, yesterday. ANZ's net interest income in the six months was ADollars 1.39bn, up from ADollars 1.23bn in the previous year. Other operating income rose from A951.3m to ADollars 1bn, while operating expenses increased by 3.3 per cent, to ADollars 1.58bn. Specific provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell from ADollars 377.4m a year ago, to ADollars 220.5m, and ANZ's total non-accrual loans by end-March stood at ADollars 2.86bn, compared with ADollars 4.89m a year earlier. This left operating profit before tax at ADollars 570.8m, up from ADollars 249.1m a year ago. On a divisional basis, ANZ reported good profits growth from its Australian and international operations. Profits in New Zealand declined, however, due to a competitive squeeze on margins, although Mr Mercer said that the performance in that country had been 'very solid' under the circumstances.</p>

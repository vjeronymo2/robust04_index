			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EERIE SERIAL KILLINGS HAVE SAN DIEGO WOMEN ON EDGE  </P> <P> They are hiding their knives, avoiding daytime showers, changing their locks,  keeping baseball bats beside their beds. They are afraid to show their faces on  television or allow their names to be used in print.  </P> <P> Women in the San Diego neighborhoods of University City and Clairemont are  frantic over reports that a serial killer has fatally stabbed five women since  January, two of them last week.  </P> <P> "As much as everyone tries to hide it, people are really frightened," said Jack  Edison, who lives with two women in Clairemont on the street where two of the  murders occurred. "I'm a guy and it even bothers me. There's someone out there  who is wacko."  </P> <P> The killings have fit an eerie pattern: Four of the five victims are brunettes  between 18 and 21, all stabbed between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m. after their killer  entered through open or unlocked doors. The fifth is the 42-year-old mother of  one of the women, whom the killer did not expect to be home, police suspect.  </P> <P> Some had just showered before they were killed. Three were slain within a  two-block area of Clairemont. The two most recent stabbings occurred three  miles away in University City.  </P> <P> "There was a level of security here that people used to take for granted," said  Richard Madsen, a professor of sociology at UC San Diego who lives in  University City. "Now that's gone."  </P> <P> After the third murder, in April, police released a composite drawing of a  suspect -- a black man, 14 to 23 years old, with close-cropped hair, a medium  build and 5 feet 7 to 5 feet 10 inches tall.  </P> <P> Although they did not change the drawing after the latest murders, police now  are hedging on their description: The suspect may not be black but dark  skinned.  </P> <P> Still, there are complaints that police are harassing blacks near the sites of  the murders and taking their photographs. On Thursday, police officials denied  the charges, saying they were simply conducting an aggressive investigation.  </P> <P> With 19 detectives working full time on the case and extra patrols roaming  neighborhoods in both areas, police are calling the investigation the largest  in San Diego's history.  </P> <P> They are working on a dozen different theories. Among them: The killer staked  out his victims before attacking; the killer rode a bus line that connects all  four murder sites; he delivered flyers in the neighborhood; he was a service  repairman, or homeless, or a gardener.  </P> <P> Police in this city are used to highly publicized murders: A team of city,  county and state investigators has been working for two years on the cases of  43 women, mostly transients or prostitutes, killed since 1985.  </P> <P> But they are not used to the public reaction generated by the University  City-Clairemont killings. Since Sept. 13, dispatchers have been swamped with  calls from more than 600 tipsters, many claiming to have seen the killer.  </P> <P> When law enforcement officials arranged a neighborhood meeting this week in  University City to discuss safety precautions, more than 800 alarmed people  showed up, filling the auditorium and spilling outdoors.  </P> <P> Police have assigned five full-time community service workers to help residents  make sure their homes are secure. Normally, only two are assigned and they do  five checks per week. Lately, they have been doing about 15 a day.  </P> <P> To protect their homes, residents are emptying hardware stores of locks and  security systems.  </P> <P> "Door locks and window guards are flying out of here," said Connie Johnson,  assistant manager of the Home Depot in Clairemont. "We've had to air-freight  our orders. Some of these people are getting to the panic stage."  </P> <P> Diane Ainslie, who sells window screens affixed with burglar alarms to about  140 alarm companies throughout San Diego, said sales to stores in University  City "have gone sky high."  </P> <P> So have gun sales, especially to women.  </P> <P> Woody Seals, owner of A &amp; W Guns, said many of the women who have recently  bought guns from his shop chose revolvers and other small handguns --  "something small and simple, easy to handle," Seals said.  </P> <P> Deputy Police Chief Cal Krosch said women should be cautious but should not  panic.  </P> <P> "I suggest to people that they cannot change their lifestyles," Krosch said.  "You've got to continue living your life. There's no reason to turn it upside  down. Life's too short.  </P> <P> The killings started in January. Tiffany Paige Schultz, the first victim, was a  20-year-old student at San Diego State who moonlighted as a nude dancer at a  local nightclub. She was stabbed more than 50 times.  </P> <P> Schultz lived on Cowley Way, just two blocks from where Janene Marie Weinhold,  21, a UC San Diego student, was murdered the next month. Weinhold, who was  doing her laundry and baking cookies, was stabbed more than 30 times, according  to authorities and her father.  </P> <P> The third to die was Holly Suzanne Tarr, an 18-year-old high school student and  aspiring actress who had come to visit her brother from her hometown of Okemos,  Mich. She had left the Buena Vista Gardens swimming pool for home and had just  showered when she was killed, her family said. Police said some of the other  women had showered shortly before they were killed but would not specify who  they were.  </P> <P> The latest victims were Pamela Clark, 42, and her 18-year-old daughter, Amber,  who were found stabbed to death inside their University City home. Amber Clark  bore a striking resemblance, police say, to the three earlier victims.  </P> <P> Police believe the killer used kitchen knives taken from the homes in all but  the first murder.  </P> <P> Many women in the University City-Clairemont area are so frightened that they  could be next that none of those interviewed Thursday would allow their full  names to be published.  </P> <P> Barbara, a 41-year-old mother, said she is keeping her 15- and 13-year-old  daughters out of school "to have them closer to me." Fearful of being home  during the morning hours when the killer is believed to attack, she takes her  daughters out of the house every day. On Thursday, they went bowling.  </P> <P> "Our lives have been changed drastically by this," said the woman, who lives in  Clairemont. "We live in fear of something happening."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIVERSE L.A. DRUG CULTURE THREATENS AIDS OUTREACH  </P> <P> Paul Rosas and Ronny Alvarado were out trawling for hypes in a wild pocket of  downtown Los Angeles, carrying the message about AIDS and dirty needles to an  urban prairie where an addict can get high for as little as 25 cents.  </P> <P> A man squatted on the curb, pumping heroin into a dappled arm. Nearby, another  guided a skillet over an open fire, sauteing fish. People stood, slumped,  against a chain-link fence, smoking cocaine. A woman flashed a leering grin at  Alvarado.  </P> <P> Alvarado approached her. Had she heard about AIDS? Did she know the risks of  dirty needles and unprotected sex? Could she use a few condoms? Nope, the woman  retorted perfunctorily: She was a woman; she didn't need one.  </P> <P> It's not easy spreading the word about AIDS to intravenous drug users, now a  prime target of the epidemic in Los Angeles County. The obstacles range from  the life styles of many addicts to the complex culture of drug use in the  nation's second-largest city.  </P> <P> Geography is destiny in Los Angeles County: The sprawl of the region has shaped  the drug market, and thus the AIDS epidemic. The county's vastness has slowed  the spread of AIDS among drug users, but it is making it difficult to reach  those at greatest risk.  </P> <P> In East Coast cities like New York, intravenous drug use is centralized.  Hundreds of addicts share needles daily in shooting galleries. As a result,  more than half of New York City's estimated 200,000 addicts are believed to be  infected with the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> But that same density makes addicts easy to find. Public health workers  routinely canvass the shooting galleries of cities such as New York and Newark.  They have alerted addicts to the risk of AIDS and thus helped cut down on the  sharing of contaminated needles.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles County, by contrast, there are few places, except Skid Row,  where addicts congregate in large numbers. Drug use is spread out and tends to  occur among small groups. Those who share needles tend to do so with a few  friends, again and again.  </P> <P> For that reason, and the fact that the virus came late to the West Coast, the  HIV infection rate among addicts here appears to have remained relatively low.  Just 3% to 5% of the county's estimated 80,000 to 120,000 intravenous drug  users are infected, researchers believe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Difficult to Reach  </P> <P> But that same diffuseness makes it difficult to reach users. They are scattered  all over the county, only occasionally in pockets. Public-health workers find  themselves forced to go door to door, scouring neighborhoods for an entree,  hoping to happen upon a user.  </P> <P> Gangs, too, create obstacles to spreading the word. Their role in drug dealing  creates risks for public health workers in some areas. Most outreach workers  say they avoid working after dusk -- the time when, some acknowledge, addicts  are most accessible.  </P> <P> The county's cultural mix makes their task even more complex. In some Latino  communities, experts say addicts are inadvertently protected. Sheltered at  home, rather than forced out, they are harder to reach. Their families may  offer the only access.  </P> <P> "Intravenous drug use is happening all over," said John L. Brown, who runs one  of the five county-funded programs doing outreach with addicts. "But it  manifests itself differently depending on culture, socioeconomic circumstances  and even the neighborhood.  </P> <P> "So what really burns me is people from San Francisco and New York who say,  'This is how you do street outreach,' " said Brown, director of the Los Angeles  Centers for Alcohol and Drug Abuse. "It's a much more complicated problem than  that."  </P> <P> But without effective outreach, experts believe infection inevitably will  spread.  </P> <P> Many addicts here admit they still share needles and syringes. Those who use  bleach to sterilize their equipment say they do so only intermittently. Many  use condoms only rarely, yet condoms offer the only means of avoiding infection  during sex.  </P> <P> One preliminary survey of 100 addicts in the San Fernando Valley found that  needle-sharing remains common. Yet use of bleach to clean needles was  relatively rare. Many of the users surveyed had multiple sex partners or  frequented prostitutes, but few reported using condoms.  </P> <P> Even so, county-funded AIDS outreach workers remain barred by the Board of  Supervisors from giving out condoms or bleach -- an approach used widely  elsewhere in the United States and abroad and credited with having helped  change addicts' behavior.  </P> <P> Among the homeless, activists believe drug use is rising. Among bisexual drug  users, as many as 30% to 40% may be infected, researchers say. Some say there  may also be a "microepidemic" of infection among the county's prostitutes.  </P> <P> Others in the field see a rise in "dual addiction," especially among  Mexican-American addicts -- the supplementing of a heroin habit with low-priced  cocaine. They find that ominous: Dual addiction is especially risky and can be  more difficult to treat.  </P> <P> Treatment -- getting off drugs -- is the ultimate form of AIDS "risk  reduction." But access to programs remains a problem in the county. The wait  for admission to a subsidized program ranges from weeks to months. And the  price often serves as a powerful deterrent.  </P> <P> "What makes people comfortable (ignoring the threat of AIDS for addicts) is the  thought that if they wanted help, they could get it," Brown said. "The reality  is, if they all decided to kick, there's nothing for them."  </P> <P> How fast the AIDS virus is spreading among drug users is not entirely clear.  </P> <P> M. Douglas Anglin, who heads UCLA's Drug Abuse Research Group, has studied  rates of infection among addicts in treatment. His findings and others suggest  that perhaps 2% were infected in 1986 and that the rate is still below 5%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> History of Drug Use  </P> <P> According to those studies, the virus appears to be "pooled" among male  intravenous drug users with some history of homosexual activity, and among  women intravenous drug users with some history of prostitution, Anglin said.  </P> <P> But some authorities have wondered whether the findings are reliable; that is,  are addicts in treatment representative of addicts on the street? If men and  women in treatment are less likely to be infected, the overall rate could be  higher.  </P> <P> Anglin expressed confidence in the data. He said the county could have as much  as a three- to-five-year grace period before the infection rate reaches that  critical 6% to 8% level at which a rapid rise could be expected to occur.  </P> <P> Who are the drug users at risk in Los Angeles County? They are as diverse as  the county itself. They include longshoremen, physicians, mothers, truck  drivers and prostitutes, from San Pedro and East Los Angeles to the San  Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Their drugs of choice, and their using patterns, vary widely. Heroin remains  dominant among Latino addicts, experts say. Cocaine has eclipsed heroin in the  black community. Both those drugs, as well as methamphetamine and PCP, are  widely used by Anglos.  </P> <P> The following sketches hint at the extraordinary diversity of drug use in Los  Angeles County. While the people profiled have escaped infection, their stories  illustrate the insidious power of addiction and a life style with potentially  lethal consequences.  </P> <P> Take Cheryl, a 33-year-old mother of three from East Los Angeles, who asked not  to be identified by her real name. Experts in drug addiction say her experience  is common among women addicts: They fall into drug use on the heels of men.  </P> <P> Cheryl grew up in East Los Angeles, one of five children. Her father is a  transit worker; one sister is an aspiring wrestler. She completed high school  and, she says, she had little interest in drugs until she met the man who would  become her second husband.  </P> <P> Ten years ago, faced with his growing addiction, Cheryl tried heroin. It was a  reckless bid for attention; his drug use seemed to have shouldered her out of  his life. She followed him into the bathroom where he was fixing, and insisted  he inject her too.  </P> <P> For several years, Cheryl used only occasionally. But when her husband began  dealing, they both began using more often. Emerging, horrified, from a two-week  binge, she resolved to quit. But when she tried, she became violently,  intolerably sick.  </P> <P> After her husband was sent to prison, Cheryl tried to control her habit. She  held down a job and cared for her children. Then one day, an old connection  showed up at the furniture warehouse where she worked. As a favor, he gave her  some heroin to sell.  </P> <P> Cheryl began dealing, and used up the rest of the supply. From there, she slid  into prostitution. She lost jobs, was sent to jail and was briefly cut off by  her family. She remembers spending Christmas on her parents' front porch,  barred from the house.  </P> <P> "In this type of life, it's nothing but an evil merry-go-round," she said  recently, in an interview at a methadone-maintenance program where she is  enrolled. "It's a vicious master, you go in a circle. It's a never-ending  circle."  </P> <P> A similar tale comes from a man who asked to identify himself only as Doc, a  35-year-old psychologist living in Los Angeles County. He began using heroin  while working as a drug-addiction researcher at a prominent Southern California  university.  </P> <P> Intrigued by the world of the men and women he was interviewing in motel rooms  throughout the state, Doc began experimenting with heroin. He compares his  curiosity to that of an apple researcher who has never tasted the fruit: "I  wanted to taste the apple."  </P> <P> Two years ago, he began using more frequently, driving from his home in the San  Fernando Valley to the heart of East Los Angeles to score. Even after his wife  overdosed, and with a 10-month-old child at home, Doc found himself powerless  to quit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rebuilding His Life  </P> <P> Early last year, he entered a residential treatment program. His wife had left  him, taking their child. He was having difficulty holding down jobs. He has  remained clean ever since, he says, and is in the process of piecing together  his life.  </P> <P> "It will kill you," said Doc, who, like Cheryl, escaped without becoming  infected with the human immuno-deficiency virus, which causes AIDS. "If you're  lucky, it will only kill you psychologically. So you have a chance for another  life."  </P> <P> Contrary to stereotypes, the life of an addict can be cruelly demanding -- in  ways that make it difficult to get the AIDS message across. It is a life in  which immediate needs eclipse longer-term goals, in which caution is not a top  priority.  </P> <P> Many addicts, for example, rise before dawn to get high. Then they turn  immediately to the urgent business of securing their next fix -- a task that  may entail shoplifting, theft, prostitution, moving hot goods, wheeling and  dealing, or selling drugs.  </P> <P> Paul Rosas, a former addict, supported his habit for a time by ripping off  other addicts, peddling crack vials filled with soap or peanuts. He became so  hated on the streets that, he recalls, he could only come out at night, his  head covered by a hood.  </P> <P> Personal hygiene, even eating, often fall by the wayside. Many addicts have  chronic health problems, from tooth decay to liver and lung disease. Suspicious  of institutions, and sometimes mistreated by doctors, many shy away from  medical clinics.  </P> <P> "There's no reality outside of the next two to three hours," said Barbara  Casucci, director of Cornerstone Health Services, a methadone program in Pico  Rivera. "There's no long-term planning, no looking forward to Christmas or  Easter. It's just how are you going to get through the next two or three  hours."  </P> <P> For that reason, among others, AIDS outreach workers have a hard job. Just  getting the attention of an addict on the street is no small feat. What should  be a 20-minute presentation on AIDS and how to avoid it ends up abbreviated  into a fleeting, one-minute rap.  </P> <P> Then there's the problem of vocabulary -- both language and lingo. In some  communities, adults find it difficult to talk about sex. On Skid Row, phrases  like "intravenous drug user" are jettisoned in favor of more graphic  alternatives such as, "D'you slam?"  </P> <P> Bleach and condoms, many outreach workers say, would make their job easier.  They would catch addicts' attention and give them something for their time.  They would also serve as invaluable tools in explaining precisely how to  protect oneself against AIDS.  </P> <P> In the absence of those tools, outreach workers fall back on the power of  repetition. By being visible on the streets, and offering repeated reminders,  they hope they will eventually get across their point.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Ongoing Process'  </P> <P> "These people are busy. They're trying to get money, trying to get paid, trying  to get high," said Rosas, who does outreach along Skid Row for Brown's agency.  "It's an ongoing process. No one's going to learn this in one shot."  </P> <P> One afternoon this month, Rosas threaded his way down the crowded sidewalks of  downtown Los Angeles making his regular rounds -- past the park where addicts  gather, past the curbside cardboard dormitories, past hotels where  transvestites co-habit, four to a room.  </P> <P> Traveling with him was Ronny Alvarado, a 20-year-old former addict who works  with the Homeless Outreach Project, a Skid Row agency that, among other things,  accompanies AIDS outreach workers and makes available free condoms and bleach.  </P> <P> (That agency's funding comes from the city, not the county. So it is not bound  by the county supervisors' ban on distributing condoms and bleach.)  </P> <P> The two men loped through the streets, greeting familiar faces, cajoling  passers-by, scanning arms and necks for tracks. They offered pamphlets,  condoms, information. Some people listened, others kept walking. A few  protested, in mock offense, they were happily married.  </P> <P> "You can't push yourself on nobody out here," explained Rosas, a 225-pound man  with a buzz cut who put in his own time on the New York City streets. "You got  to know when to step, when to go. If you don't, you may end up dead where you  stand."  </P> <P> Over the hills in the San Fernando Valley, three AIDS outreach workers from an  agency called El Proyecto del Barrio were working Van Nuys, moving methodically  from house to house on a run-down street where residents said drug deals  regularly go down.  </P> <P> There, the obstacles are different. Drug use goes on mostly behind closed  doors. "The biggest problem is identifying where these people are," said John  Paloma, 36, one of the outreach workers. "Then, when you've found them, it's  convincing them we're not the police."  </P> <P> The outreach workers watch for tell-tale signs: Cars pulling up outside certain  houses, visitors returning one time too often. They ask questions: Any signs of  drug use in the neighborhood? They hope their message makes its way into the  right hands.  </P> <P> In Paloma's experience, most addicts now know about bleach. Whether they use  it, he cannot be certain. Most say they no longer share equipment, but Paloma  remembers when he was using: Everyone shared because no one wanted to be caught  carrying an outfit.  </P> <P> For that reason, Paloma used to stash equipment around town -- for example,  high atop public toilets. Now, working the parks, he occasionally runs a hand  through those familiar crannies. When he comes upon a syringe, he leaves a  pamphlet.  </P> <P> Are outreach programs working? In Los Angeles County, it is difficult to know.  Most programs have been operating little more than a year. And there has been,  so far, no comprehensive study assessing whether addicts' practices have  changed.  </P> <P> El Proyecto del Barrio, the agency that covers the San Fernando Valley,  recently completed a survey of 100 intravenous drug users. The findings are  preliminary and the study sample small, but the results indicate there is more  work to be done.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sharing Needles  </P> <P> Nearly 75% of those surveyed said they share needles, at least occasionally.  More than half said they clean their equipment with water -- which is  ineffective. Only one third said they cleaned their equipment with bleach and  water, the only proven method.  </P> <P> As for sex, 33% said they had multiple partners. Nearly one in five said they  frequented prostitutes. Yet most never use condoms and only 30% use them  sometimes. Four people said they used them all the time.  </P> <P> "Changing attitudes and behavior takes time," said Kimberly Green, outreach  project coordinator for El Proyecto del Barrio. "Eventually, they hit bottom.  Then they become more vulnerable."  </P> <P> Those spreading the word say they have no grandiose expectations.  </P> <P> "We're not out to solve the problem of AIDS," said Mike Neely, who runs the  Homeless Outreach Project out of a storefront in the heart of Skid Row. "What  we're trying to do is keep the person in front of us alive long enough to deal  with their life.  </P> <P> "If we can keep the person alive 'til they're ready to hear the message, maybe  they'll be OK," said Neely. "If they die first, all we've got is a dead drug  addict."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMAX: WANTS TO BUY PEABODY HOLDING, BIDS $1.25 BILLION  </P> <P> Amax Inc., the nation's third-largest coal producer, made a $1.25-billion offer  Friday for industry leader Peabody Holding Co., raising the possibility of a  bidding war with a major Peabody investor.  </P> <P> The bid was rejected immediately by Hanson Industries, which owns 45% of  Peabody and is attempting to buy the rest.  </P> <P> Hanson responded by raising its offer for the Peabody shares it doesn't own.  </P> <P> The remaining 55% of St. Louis-based Peabody is owned by Newmont Mining Corp.  of Denver. Hanson, in turn, owns 49% of Newmont.  </P> <P> Hanson in March offered to buy Newmont's stake in Peabody for $715 million. But  under terms of the sale agreement between Hanson and Newmont, the companies  agreed to consider outside bids for all of Peabody until the deal with Hanson  closed.  </P> <P> Closing tentatively was scheduled for sometime next month, said Newmont  spokesman James Hill.  </P> <P> After New York-based Amax disclosed its bid Friday, Hanson immediately  increased its offer for Newmont's Peabody stake to $725.6 million. That tops  the $718.5 million that Newmont's stake is worth under the Amax offer, Hanson  said.  </P> <P> Hill said Newmont's agreement to sell its Peabody stake to Hanson remained in  effect but that the Amax bid started an auction process for Peabody.  </P></p>

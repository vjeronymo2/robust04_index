			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LETTERS  </P> <P> DEAR FOOD EDITOR:  </P> <P> The food section contained an interesting article on Philippine food by Minnie  Bernardino ("Philippine Potpourri," June 7), which, unfortunately, perpetuates  a common culinary error.  </P> <P> I refer to the recipe for Cassava Bibingka, which calls for "1 1/2 pounds of  cassava or yucca," among other things. Cassava and yucca are two entirely  different plants, and if you try the recipe with yucca you will surely have  problems.  </P> <P> CLAY A. SINGER, Santa Monica  </P> <P>  Editor's Note: Our error was in the spelling. Yucca is a familiar California  desert plant; yuca -- with one c -- is a Central American name for cassava. We  apologize to anyone who tried to cook yucca.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SITUATION REGARDING TENURE AT UC IRVINE  </P> <P> Regarding the article "Blacks, Women Charge UC Irvine With Prejudice" (Dec.  18):  </P> <P> As one of the relatively few minority graduate students at UC Irvine, it was  disheartening for me to read about the experiences of the women and men who  were denied tenure and other promotions at UCI. Apparently the University of  California motto, "Let there be light," does not apply to UC Irvine's faculty  promotion policies.  </P> <P> PHILIP J. ITUARTE  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

We have interpreted this to mean that only providers who meet the very minimum level of requirements should remain authorized under CHAMPUS. Additionally, the legislation did not provide grandfathering provisions for marriage and family counselors already authorized under CHAMPUS. We feel recertification will ensure CHAMPUS beneficiaries receive care provided by both certified and qualified providers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Will certified marriage and family therapists who have signed a participation agreement with OCHAMPUS be able to terminate the agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certified marriage and family therapists who have signed a participation agreement with OCHAMPUS may terminate the agreement upon notification to OCHAMPUS. The participation agreement will stipulate the number of days required for notification to terminate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Will certified marriage and family therapists who have terminated their participation agreement be eligible to qualify as another category of provider under CHAMPUS? If this allowed, we foresee a number of problems in the adjudication of claims, particularly if they choose to switch to a category of provider which still requires physician supervision and referral and continue to treat the same patients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon application to OCHAMPUS, a provider must indicate under which category of provider he/she wishes to be authorized. Once a determination by OCHAMPUS is made that the applicant meets the qualifications of the provider category for which he/she is applying, switching from one group to another seldom occurs. Switching could be allowed if the provider has continued his/her education and such additional education qualifies him/her for a different provider category (i.e., nurse to M.D., clinical psychologist to psychiatrist, or M.D. to psychiatrist). Such upward or changed speciality movement generally does not create an adjudication problem. However, we agree that the new legislative provisions regarding certified marriage and family therapists may create adjudication problems, since the provisions of the law allow certified marriage and family therapists to practice without physician supervision and referral. Switching and movement within any other extramedical provider category where physician supervision and referral is required would result in CHAMPUS beneficiaries incurring costs for denied care. Care denied for lack of physician supervision and referral would not be subject to the hold harmless provisions of the new legislation since these provisions only apply to the certified marriage and family therapists provider category. We feel it would be inappropriate to require retroactive physician supervision and referral for care that has already been rendered, or for continuing care. To prevent CHAMPUS beneficiaries from incurring costs Congress did not intend them to incur with this change, we have added language to the final rule which precludes marriage and family therapists from switching within the extramedical provider category. As of the effective date of termination, the certified marriage and family therapist will no longer be recognized as an authorized provider under CHAMPUS. Subsequent to termination, the certified marriage and family therapist may only be reinstated as an authorized CHAMPUS extramedical provider by entering into a new participation agreement as a certified marriage and family therapist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

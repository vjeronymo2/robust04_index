			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Panamco to increase stake in subsidiaries Panamerican Beverages (Panamco), Latin America's largest soft drinks bottler, wants to buy minority interests in its Mexican subsidiaries. If the offers are accepted, the purchase price would be about Dollars 500m. It will be funded by Dollars 100m in cash and a bank loan. Panamco is the second-largest Coca-Cola bottler in the world, with annual sales of Dollars 957m in 1992. It plans to refinance part or all of the purchase with a public offering of its 'A' stock. Panamco directors have already agreed to tender their shares in the subsidiaries and stand to gain Dollars 50m from the transaction. Panamco has significant interests in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, controlling about 50 operating subsidiaries in the three countries. Coca-Cola owns about 10 per cent of the company, but has not made it an anchor bottler. Panamco intends to buy up to 46 per cent of Azteca, its holding company for Mexican operations, and outstanding shares held by minority investors in subsidiaries controlled by Azteca. It said the price offered for shares in Azteca and subsidiaries is equal to 13 times 1993 earnings. Neither Azteca nor subsidiaries has publicly traded stock. 'This is an intelligent way for Panamco to take a bigger stake in their fastest growing market,' said William Scovin, an analyst with Nomura, the brokerage.</p>

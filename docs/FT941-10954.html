			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / International Company News: Banco Santander rises 17.8% Banco Santander increased net income in 1993 by 17.8 per cent to Pta77.9bn (Dollars 557m), cementing its position as front runner in the race to take control of the Banesto group should the troubled banking conglomerate be sold later this year. Mr Emilio Botin, chairman, told the annual meeting on Saturday that he was studying the advisability of making an offer for Banesto. But he reassured the shareholders that the final decision would be dictated by the impact of such a acquisition on Santander's profits. Mr Botin was speaking after disclosing extraordinarily good results by Santander which underlined the strength of its balance sheet and its position as Spain's leading bank. Net interest income rose 19.3 per cent to Pta242.6bn and operating income improved 12.8 per cent to Pta137.6bn. Average total assets increased by 34 per cent to Pta8,081bn. Mr Botin told shareholders their dividend would be going up by 12.3 per cent to Pta292 per share. Mr Botin said the results reflected the diversification of the group's business in financial services, corporate and retail banking as well as the geographical spread of its activities. Business outside Spain, mainly in the US, Chile, Mexico and Puerto Rico, contributed 42 per cent to profits. The group would continue to expand abroad this year, Mr Botin said. He hoped its profits this year would be shared 50-50 between domestic and foreign earnings. 'If buying Banesto means I cannot buy a bank in America, then I will not buy Banesto,' Mr Botin said. 'The all-important consideration (over a Banesto offer) is the price.' Under a rescue plan designed by the Bank of Spain - which is subject to the approval of Banesto's shareholders - Banesto is to be recapitalised by a Pta180bn rights issue and subsequently sold to a domestic banking group. Banesto was the fourth largest Spanish bank. The Bank of Spain intervened at the end of last year after an inspection revealed it had heavily overvalued its assets. Banco Exterior de Espana, part of the Argentaria state financial group, reports pre-tax profits little changed at Pta42.7bn for 1993, against Pta41.4bn a year earlier.</p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Kenya lifts curbs on borrowing Kenya has lifted restrictions on local borrowings by foreign-controlled companies, and plans to repeal remaining foreign exchange controls by the end of the year. The move was announced at the weekend by Mr Musalia Mudavadi, the finance minister. It is the latest step in a reform programme designed to attract foreign investment, restore confidence among aid donors and revive growth. Earlier in the week, in an interview in Nairobi with the Financial Times, the minister said that the government hoped to remove all foreign exchange controls by the end of the year. But Mr Mudavadi warned that economic growth would be hard hit by the country's drought. President Daniel arap Moi has appealed for international help for a Dollars 60m (Pounds 41m) programme to feed about a fifth of Kenya's 26m people. In his statement lifting the local borrowing restrictions, the minister said: 'Commercial banks will be expected to exercise their prudential credit policy in assessing the viability of each borrower.' The statement also allowed unlimited borrowing by Kenyans resident abroad to finance investment in Kenya. This would include working capital provided interest charged did not exceed two percentage points above Libor (London inter-bank offered rate). Kenyans with foreign exchange earnings, including non-export earnings, may now open foreign currency accounts with banks in Kenya and exporters may hold wholly-foreign retention accounts. Previously, exporters were allowed to hold 50 per cent of their earnings in hard currency. Mr Mudavadi said existing retention accounts would be converted to resident foreign currency accounts but exporters were still required to surrender proceeds within 90 days of receiving them. The International Monetary Fund has told Sudan it has launched the process to terminate its IMF membership, Reuter reports from Khartoum. The government-owned al-Ingaz al-Watani newspaper yesterday reported that Sudan had, however, been given the chance to answer before a final decision was taken. The finance minister, Mr Abdalla Hassan Ahmad, said the fund's technical experts would meet soon to consider Sudan's response. Sudan would be the first country to be thrown out of the fund since it was created shortly after the second world war.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prosperity Party leader Necmettin Erbakan has  described the downing of two helicopters belonging to Poised  Hammer in northern Iraq and the martyring of three Turkish  officers as another Saratoga incident. He said that the  incident cannot be covered up.    Addressing his party's assembly group meeting, Erbakan  remarked that the F-15 planes that downed the helicopters are  equipped with instruments that determine the identity of the  target, but it is clear that these were not used. Pointing out  that Turkey also has the same helicopters, Erbakan claimed that  the uncontrolled shooting enhances the possibility that the  helicopters were believed to be Turkish. Erbakan said that the  suspects in the Saratoga incident were not tried by Turkish  courts and charged that the presence of a Turkish officer in the  panel of judges was merely for show.    [Begin Erbakan recording] We are experiencing the same thing  in this second Saratoga incident. What is the problem? Let us  summon the pilots of Poised Hammer, which is located in Turkey.  Let us bring them here and question them in court on how they  shot, what they shot. This is a requisite of an independent  country. Moreover, it is the requisite of law an human decency.  [end recording]    Erbakan claimed that Turkey is unable to play an active role  in the face of the annihilation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Serbian  hands. He declared that it must be known that no concessions can  be made on the subjects of Bosnia or Cyprus.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Yegor Gaydar, chairman of </F> Russia's Democratic Choice, by Nikolay Ivanov; place and date  not given; from the "Novosti" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Ivanov] You have said that the new party is not a  party belonging to a certain class, is that not so? In your  view, whose party is it, in that case?    [Gaydar] It is the party for those people who want a calm  and dignified future for Russia. It is the party for those who  do not wish their children to fight for a way out to the Indian  Ocean. It is the party for those who are well aware that there  is no going back, and that any experiments in that direction are  dangerous, that we have one proper path -- namely, to be a  civilized, democratic, market society.    The problem with us is that we often do not know how to  explain and defend these ideas and, as a result, yield the field  of political struggle to people who have a single, very simple  little idea, and a very dangerous little idea, namely: let's  find a non-Russian enemy and try to turn Russian society against  that enemy. So, in order to prevent such people from gaining the  political arena we need a serious and effective democratic  organization.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Bosnian Moslems pave way fortalks with 24-hour ceasefire: US and Nato urge dispatch of peacekeepers to Gorazde Bosnia's Moslem leadership, under mounting diplomatic pressure to enter peace talks with its Serb enemies, yesterday announced a 24-hour ceasefire intended to pave the way for talks on a longer-term truce. The gesture came after General Sir Michael Rose, commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, failed to bring the two sides together yesterday for talks near Sarajevo airport. But the two sides received peace proposals from Gen Rose and are due to respond - and may meet - today. A Bosnian Serb commander said that he would do his utmost to restrain his troops during the 24-hour ceasefire proposed by the Moslem leadership. Mr Charles Redman, the US special envoy to former Yugoslavia, arrived in the Croatian capital of Zagreb yesterday to give momentum to the peace effort. He will go on to Sarajevo, the Bosnian Serb HQ in Pale, and Belgrade. Late last night, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that his country and its Nato allies were urging the United Nations to act quickly to dispatch hundreds of Ukrainian and other peacekeepers to the Serb-encircled Moslem enclave of Gorazde. Serb forces continued shelling Gorazde yesterday, ignoring a UN security council demand and their promise to Gen Rose to stop bombarding the town, US officials say that British and French peacekeepers may be redeployed to join Ukrainians in trying to protect Gorazde's 65,000 civilians. 'The plan is being put on a fast track,' senior US officials said in Washington. The US has offered to transport the Ukrainians, most of whom would come from Kiev, to a staging area. US officials said that Ukraine had offered some 800 soldiers for the Gorazde mission but that British and French forces already in the Balkans may be included. The US administration has disappointed the Moslems with its cautious attitude to the latest fighting around Gorazde. However, President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, Mr Anthony Lake, stressed yesterday that the UN peacekeepers sent to Gorazde would be protected by Nato airpower. 'We stand by that commitment,' Mr Lake said in a speech prepared for delivery at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. He said the UN forces should be on their way to Gorazde as soon as possible. 'We must make clear to the Serbs and to the Serbs of Bosnia that the costs of continued intransigence are high'. Serbian forces have recently gained strategically important ground near Gorazde, one of three UN-designated 'safe areas' in Bosnia, drawing nearer to their long-standing goal of unchallenged control of eastern Bosnia, which adjoins Serbia. The Moslem Bosnian leadership has been reluctant to enter peace talks if this is likely to consolidate the new Serb acquisitions. In Zagreb, meanwhile, at least 15 people were injured yesterday in explosions at a military ammunition dump. The explosions occurred after fire broke out in a warehouse.

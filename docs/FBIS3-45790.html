Figures show that the 27 cities in the province spent a sum  of 8.5 billion yuan on urban public facilities last year.    So far these cities have completed construction of seven  million square meters of roads and streets, water supply  projects with a daily capacity of 700,000 cubic meters, nine  garbage treatment plants, and cooking gas projects able to  supply 110,000 households.    Projects still under construction include a number of urban  water supply projects, large gardens, and environmental  protection and public transport facilities.    A provincial official in charge of urban public facilities  noted that these projects will offer convenience for residents,  improve the environment, and help the province to attract more  foreign investment.</p>

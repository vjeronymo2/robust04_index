			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Shih Lei (4258 4320) from Hong Kong] </F>   [Text] While it was rumored that pro-democracy activist  Wang Juntao would soon be released, it was also recently rumored  in Beijing that the authorities were considering releasing Bao  Tong on parole, who was the political secretary for former CPC  General Secretary Zhao Ziyang.    According to sources, after CPC General Secretary Jiang  Zemin  met with U.S. President Clinton last November and after former  U.S. President Bush recently visited Beijing, the CPC  authorities discussed the release-on-parole of Wang Juntao and  Bao Tong in order to show their attention to human rights and  their intention of improving relations with the United States.  It was said that most people agreed that Bao Tong should be  released first on parole, because Bao was sentenced to only  seven years' imprisonment and his prison term would expire in  less than three years. Moreover, Bao Tong is quite old and he  was a member inside the establishment (or inside the party). He  would not do or say anything unfavorable to the authorities  after being released. However, former President Bush and  incumbent U.S. President Clinton did not mention the release of  Bao Tong, so the Beijing authorities have not decided whom they  will release first, but the result of the discussion was only  that one of them would be released.    Reportedly, when meeting with Jiang Zemin in Seattle last  November, Clinton hinted that if the CPC authorities did not  take concrete action to improve China's human rights conditions,  it would be difficult to extend China's most-favored-nation  status next June. During Bush's recent visit to Beijing, Bush  once again brought this message to the mainland authorities in  moderate words.    The CPC top authorities have decided to release a certain  prisoner as an expression of goodwill to the United States.</p>

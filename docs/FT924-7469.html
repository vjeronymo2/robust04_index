			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / City bomb threats prompt back-up strategy THE RISE in bombings and bomb scares in the City of London has prompted at least two companies to launch emergency dealing room facilities. Banks and insurance companies can face huge losses if dealers are cut off from their desks for any reason - a security alert, bomb, or gas leak. Fully-equipped standby dealing rooms will allow dealers to be back in business in minutes. Telehouse, an Anglo-Japanese telecommunications and computer joint venture, concluded there was a gap in the market after research showed that dealers at 27 per cent of the financial institutions surveyed had been prevented from dealing for an hour or more in the previous year. Only 43 per cent of companies had a dealing room disaster recovery plan. Back-up computer facilities are more widespread - 84 per cent had plans for a computer disaster. Telehouse estimates the emergency dealing room market at between Pounds 9m and Pounds 14m a year, and says interest has doubled since the bomb at the Baltic Exchange in the City after the election in April. It is offering up to 30 dealing positions, as well as 50 back-office desks, at its secure purpose-designed headquarters in London's Docklands. The building, which has bullet-proof glass and 24-hour surveillance, is supplied from two parts of the national grid, with generator back-up and duplicated telephone links to protect against further disruption of business. DSL, the software and communications consultancy specialising in dealing rooms, is to offer a similar service for up to 80 dealing and settlement positions at its office in Southwark, south London. Subscription will be on a 'club' basis - companies with similar requirements will form a group with up to 10 members subscribing to the same set of dealing desks.</p>

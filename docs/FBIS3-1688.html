			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, February 28 (XINHUA) -- A Serb military  spokesman said today that the four warplanes shot down by NATO  fighter jets did not belong to the Serbian Air Forces.    Nebojsha Radmanovich, spokesman for the Serb military press  center in Banja Luka, near where the four planes were downed,  said that Serb planes did not fly today.    NATO said two U.S. F-16 fighters first warned and then shot  down four Galeb light attack aircraft early this morning near  Banja Luka, the main Serb air base in northern Bosnia.    This was the first Western military intervention in the  22-month-long conflict, and NATO's first combat action since it  was founded in 1949.    U.N. sources in Zagreb said the Serb planes had apparently  attacked a Muslim-controlled ammunition factory in central  Bosnia shortly before being shot down.    Muslim radio in Sarajevo also reported that Serb planes this  morning attacked Muslim targets in central Bosnia.    But Serb military personnel said all their warplanes were  under the supervision of United Nations observers, and that if  the planes took off they could not escape detection by the  observers.    NATO jets have flown more than 1,000 sorties over  Bosnia-Herzegovina since last April when the no-fly zone  injunction took effect.    NATO said it will continue to take military action against  any plane that intrudes into the no-fly zone.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Food prices remain stable ALTHOUGH sterling's devaluation has increased the cost of many imported products, it has yet to feed through into higher retail prices for many popular products sold in British supermarkets. A survey carried out for the Financial Times by AC Nielsen, the market research group, shows that the prices of a range of popular consumer goods have remained remarkably stable since the pound left the European exchange rate mechanism. A comparison made last month of 45 'Euro-brands', sold in at least three other large European countries, found that none had risen in price in the UK by more than 1 per cent since August, while 16 have become slightly cheaper. Another Nielsen survey, of 31 product categories, found that in 17 of them the price of the brand leader had fallen in the past six months. In the case of shampoo, mineral water, pasta sauces, disposable nappies and toilet tissues, the fall was as much as 7 per cent. The biggest price increases were for canned salmon, baked beans, sliced cooked meats and mayonnaise, which rose by between 9 per cent and 23 per cent. The prices of most other goods were almost unchanged. This stability suggests that the recession and weak demand are leading many large manufacturers of consumer goods to put a higher priority on preserving market share than on recouping cost increases caused by devaluation. For most brand leaders, the keenest competition comes not from other manufacturers' brands but from retailers' own-label products, which usually sell more cheaply. Sales of some categories of own-label goods have grown strongly during the recession, as consumers have 'traded down' from dearer alternatives. However, in several cases - notably nappies, tampons, canned fruits, pasta sauces, breakfast cereals and hosiery - the difference in prices has been narrowed significantly since August by falls in the prices of brand leaders and increases for own-label products. The main exceptions to this pattern are detergents, fruit juices, bleach and tea, where the branded/own-label gap has widened. In some categories, prices have shown they can also move sharply from month to month in response to competitive conditions. For instance, the prices of hosiery, carbonated drinks and toilet tissues - none of them seasonal items - were higher in November than now.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          HOW UK PRICES COMPARE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      A               B          A as                                   UK price   Price in dearest   percent                                   in ECU     European country   of B*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Kelloggs Cornflakes, 500gm         1.15      3.18 (Greece)       64 Pedigree dog food, 400gm can       0.48      1.33 (Finland)      36 Nescafe, 100gm                     1.69      3.87 (Denmark)      44 Kit-Kat, 4-finger pack             0.27      0.67 (Spain)        40 Ariel washing powder E3            1.72      4.14 (Netherlands)  42 Pampers Ultra Maxi (pack of 40)    7.95     12.61 (Netherlands)  63 TDK videotape (VHS180 Hi-grade)    3.69      9.39 (Finland)      39 Palmolive handwash liquid, 500ml   0.73      1.86 (Ireland)      39  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Nielsen  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *UK price as per cent of prices in dearest European country  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> DISTINCT DIFFERENCES  </P> <P> It can be said that those living north and south of Orange County's Mason-Dixon  Line (the Costa Mesa Freeway) live in different worlds. Besides the more  obvious differences such as income (southerners are wealthier) and age  (northerners are a little younger) and in population (there far fewer  southerners), external factors also help shape an area's identity. After all,  no place with Disneyland smack in the center of it can be quite like any other  place on Earth. And where else do the swallows come home to roost? With this in  mind, here is a potpourri of personality-shaping factors that have helped to  make North County and South County unique places.  </P> <P> Famous Animal  </P> <P> North: Mickey Mouse, fictional rodent portrayed by short people in costumes at  that Anaheim amusement park. At age 51, Mickey may be the most recognizable  character in the world. He still can be found roaming Main Street between  Fantasyland and Abraham Lincoln's statue.  </P> <P> South: Bubbles the hippopotamus, a real-life plant-eating mammal of the type  usually found frolicking in the mud of Africa rivers. But in 1978, this two-ton  escapee from the since-closed Lion Country Safari hid out for three weeks in a  swamp created by heavy rains near the park. Bubbles died when shot with  tranquilizers by would-be rescuers.  </P> <P> Higher Education (public)  </P> <P> North: Cal State Fullerton, Fullerton; Coastline Community College, Fountain  Valley; Cypress College, Cypress; Fullerton College, Fullerton; Golden West  College, Huntington Beach; Orange Coast College, Costa Mesa; and Rancho  Santiago College, Santa Ana.  </P> <P> South: UC Irvine, Irvine; Irvine Valley College, Irvine; and Saddleback  College, Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Budget for Booze  </P> <P> North: Orange County's highest expenditure for packaged liquor was in the North  County, where Costa Mesans spent $40.33 per capita.  </P> <P> South: The county's lowest per capita expenditure was in the South County,  where Irvine residents spent only $9.23.  </P> <P> Most Democrats  </P> <P> North: 41,101 in Anaheim  </P> <P> South: 11,485 in El Toro  </P> <P> Hotbed of Libertarian Politics  </P> <P> North: Huntington Beach, 798 registered Libertarian Party members.  </P> <P> South: Irvine, 208 registered Libertarian Party members.  </P> <P> The Most Traveled Surface Street  </P> <P> North: Beach Boulevard, south of McFadden Avenue, Westminster, 81,000 cars per  day.  </P> <P> South: MacArthur Boulevard, south of University Drive, Newport Beach, 64,000  cars per day.  </P> <P> Movie Theater Screens  </P> <P> North: 102  </P> <P> South: 37  </P> <P> First Incorporated City  </P> <P> North: Anaheim, 1878  </P> <P> South: Newport Beach, 1906  </P> <P> Last Incorporated City  </P> <P> North: Yorba Linda, 1967  </P> <P> South: Mission Viejo, 1988  </P> <P> Most Populated  </P> <P> North: Anaheim, 244,300  </P> <P> South: Irvine, 100,500  </P> <P> Least Populated  </P> <P> North: Villa Park, 6,950  </P> <P> South: San Juan Capistrano, 24,390  </P> <P> TV and Radio Stations  </P> <P> North: KOCE-TV (Channel 50, Huntington Beach); KDOC-TV (Channel 56, Anaheim);  KEZY-FM 96.7 (Anaheim); KORG-AM 1190 (Anaheim); KIKF-FM 94.3 (Garden Grove);  KWIZ AM-FM (1480-96.7, Santa Ana); KYMS FM (106.3, Orange); KBPK-FM (89.1 Buena  Park).  </P> <P> South: KWVE-FM (107.5, San Clemente); KOCM-FM (103.1, Newport Beach); KUCI-FM  (88.9, UCI); KSBR-FM (88.5, Saddleback College).  </P> <P> United Way Contributors (1986, the most recent figures available)  </P> <P> North: 17% of the work force, or 68,883 employees.  </P> <P> South: 31% of the work force, or 27,156 employees.  </P> <P> United Way Contributions (1986, the most recent figures available)  </P> <P> North: $10,354,429  </P> <P> South: $ 3,271,513  </P> <P> Significant Transformation  </P> <P> North: In the mid-1950 Walt Disney developed 160 acres of mostly orange groves  into a Magic Kingdom, which he named after himself, paving the way for a  plethora of tourist attractions and setting the tone for future development of  much of the North County.  </P> <P> South: In the late 1950s and early 1960s architect William L.

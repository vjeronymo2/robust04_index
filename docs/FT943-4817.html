			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / People: Ian Reynolds' return ticket The Association of British Travel Agents, which acts as both watchdog and industry association for the UK travel business, has just appointed a new chief executive: Ian Reynolds. Reynolds, 50, has previously spent 26 years with IBM (UK) in a multitude of roles. He joined the company in 1968 as a trainee salesman in London, after studies at the London School of Economics. He became regional manager for the Midlands and North, and group director of administration in Paris in 1982. He returned to the UK in 1983 to lead a division concerned with information systems, but Paris once more beckoned in 1986, where he returned to be general manager responsible for the Benelux, Spain, Switzerland and east European territories. Back to the UK in 1987, Reynolds took over as director of marketing and services for three years. Clearly, however, Paris got into his system, as he returned there in 1991 to be vice-president, communications, dealing with government and media relations, as well as internal communications. He finished his career with IBM as director of personnel and corporate affairs, back in the UK. He retired from IBM earlier this year. Given that he enjoys tennis, golf, skiing and sailing, and he now has some spare time to pursue those activities, why is Reynolds taking on the tough role of steering ABTA, which has had its ups and downs in the recent past? 'Travel is a high-growth industry, soon to be the world's largest. ABTA is in a good position to provide the necessary leadership for that industry; it's a challenge too good to miss,' says Reynolds. ABTA currently has 2,900 main members, though that increases to 7,000 when counting all retail outlets. Reynolds is taking over from John Dunscombe, who resigned earlier this year.</p>

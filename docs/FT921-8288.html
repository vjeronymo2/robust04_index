			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Germany holds on tight FT-SE Index: 2,541.0 (+27.1) Thanks partly to the low oil price, Germany should avoid the 5 per cent inflation rate which once threatened this spring. But that will be little comfort to those awaiting a Bundesbank rate cut. Even though it denied yesterday that wage settlements were directly linked to monetary policy, the central bank is clearly unhappy about the 6.4 per cent settlement for steelworkers. Worse still, January money supply figures due this week will show a further surge in M3, putting it outside the target range for several months to come. Indeed, the Bundesbank looks boxed in. Even if a weakening economy were now prompting second thoughts on monetary policy, it would be hard to find a convincing reason for cutting rates. The hawks on its governing council would hardly swallow the argument that credit demand has been artificially swollen not only by unification, but also, temporarily, by companies borrowing to offset cash flow tightness induced by the slowdown. Equally unbeguiling are expectations of lower headline inflation from July as last year's temporary tax increases drop out of the index. By then, US economic recovery may be pushing up both raw material prices and the dollar, adding to German inflationary pressures. There is thus a real possibility that the Bundesbank may do no more for the balance of 1992 than trim money market rates, leaving official rates unchanged - unless, of course, it becomes really alarmed about the economy. It currently believes that activity will revive during the second half, fuelled partly by higher demand in the rest of Europe. Its own policies, however, reduce the prospect of a spontaneous European recovery, while the risk of a hard landing in Germany is growing.</p>

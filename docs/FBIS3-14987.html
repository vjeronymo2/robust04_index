			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 28/2/1994 -- BASA has  interviewed representatives of many political formations  immediately after the first estimations of the voting have  emerged. Valeriu Senic, leader of the Socialist Party of  Moldova, declared "a normal thing happened, the voting expresses  the population's will. First of all I consider these elections  a general rehearsal for the future parliamentary elections,  which will be run in an already unitary republic. Together with  agrarians we shall constitute a based parliamentary majority,  that will first of all solve the problems of the republic's  south and east, adherence to CIS, and amendments to the law on  languages. In a civilized state, the language is not taught  with the cudgel, but with competent teachers, said the  interviewed.    Gheorghe Ghimpu, leader of Democratic Party, told BASA:  "Those who said long before that the elections will not be  democratic were right. I think there have been infringements,  frauds. A lesson of yesterday is that Russians have actively  participated, while Moldovans were passive. The results of  elections can only mean the following: The reaction won in  Russia, the reaction also won here. Winners of the elections  will federalize the republic, revise the laws on state language,  Latin graphology, etc. We have to recognize that Moldovans  neither know what is freedom nor want it."    Victor Popa, representative of the Reform Party, asserted  "results of the elections show that the communist ideology is  deeply infiltrated in our mentality. These results do not show  at all the balance of forces in the society, but as always, any  elections leave room for a triumph of paradoxes. Our electorate  has voted the past instead of voting the future."    In the opinion of FPCD [Christian Democratic Popular Front]  Alliance representative Sergiu Mocanu, "nothing grave happened:  communists came back to power." Mocanu thinks the results of  elections were influenced by the decree of Snegur on the  participation of Dniester population and by the pressure of the  executive which forced part of electors vote for agrarians. "We  will try to contest the results of elections, both in localities  inhabited by Gagaouzians and where Dniestrians voted, where  numerous electoral frauds were detected."    PDAM [Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova] representative  Dumitru Diacov stated to BASA "results of the elections display  the ratio of forces in the society. We must all understand that  electors realized well with whom to go. Despite of the  arguments and the electoral noise." In Diacov's opinion, the  mass voting for "Edinstvo" denotes a disorder in our political  life. "Our Parliamentary majority will first of all solve the  most urgent problems: the constitution, the Moldovan east and  south and will prepare a package of documents to unleash  reform," stressed the PDAM representative.</p>

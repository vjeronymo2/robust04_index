			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Company News: Standard Chartered to appeal on US ruling STANDARD Chartered, the UK-based international banking group, is to pursue its legal case against accountants Price Waterhouse in connection with the firm's audit of United Bank of Arizona. In a statement issued yesterday, Standard Chartered said it had filed a notice of appeal in Maricopa County, Arizona, against the decision by a state superior court judge to overthrow a Dollars 338m jury verdict against Price Waterhouse. Judge John Sticht had last December granted Price Waterhouse's motion for a new trial in July 1992 after ruling that the verdicts were inconsistent. His judgment overturned a verdict in May last year after an 11-month trial which found against the firm on seven out of eight charges. That left Standard Chartered with the options of appealing against the decision, pursuing a new trial or entering discussions for an out-of-court settlement. The bank brought a lawsuit against the firm in 1988 alleging that Price Waterhouse failed to identify and report 'material deficiencies' in the loan portfolio and internal control systems of United Bank of Arizona, and that its audits for 1985 and 1986 were negligent. Standard Chartered bought United Bank in 1987 for Dollars 335m. It made heavy losses and was sold 18 months later to Citicorp for Dollars 207m.</p>

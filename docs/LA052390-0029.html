			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CANSECO'S GRAND SLAM IS ONLY SECOND FAVORITE  </P> <P> The Oakland Athletics' Jose Canseco hit his first regular-season grand slam  with authority.  </P> <P> Canseco's home run at the SkyDome Tuesday landed on the roof of the stadium  club overlooking the center-field seats and led the Athletics to a 5-4 victory  over the Toronto Blue Jays.  </P> <P> Canseco's only other major league grand slam came against the Dodgers in the  first game of the 1988 World Series. It was his only hit of the series.  </P> <P> "It ranks as my second favorite home run simply because it was a grand slam,"  said Canseco, who has 15 home runs in 38 games. "The No. 1 was the one in the  World Series.  </P> <P> "I've had some trouble hitting with the bases loaded. Maybe that will end it."  </P> <P> The SkyDome is rapidly becoming Canseco's favorite home run park. He hit his  first there after coming back from injury last season, then hit a long home run  in the championship series there.  </P> <P> "Jose does it again," Curt Young (2-1) said. "I'm glad he's on our team."  </P> <P> Dennis Eckersley got his 11th save by striking out two in a scoreless ninth.  </P> <P> The Blue Jays, who lost pitcher Jimmy Key in the fourth inning because of a  hamstring injury, got home runs from Manny Lee, Junior Felix and Kelly Gruber  in the sixth inning. Gruber also had homered in the fourth and has 12 for the  season.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 3, Seattle 2 -- Bill Spiers, batting .077, bounced a single through a  drawn-in infield with the bases loaded and one out in the ninth inning for the  victory at Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Brewer Manager Tom Trebelhorn had a ready explanation for using the youngster  despite his poor start this season.  </P> <P> "He was a big league hitter last year and he'll be a big league hitter this  year," Trebelhorn said. "So I decided this was the spot for him to get  started."  </P> <P> The hit made a winner of Mark Knudson (3-1), who gave up seven hits, including  Ken Griffey Jr.'s 10th home run, and pitched his first complete game of the  season. He is 3-0 lifetime against Seattle.  </P> <P> Baltimore 10, Minnesota 2 -- Joe Orsulak hit two home runs and drove in four  runs at Baltimore and the Twins lost for only the fifth time in their last 19  games.  </P> <P> Orsulak's second homer capped a six-run rally in the fifth inning. It came too  late for Jeff Ballard, who hasn't won this season. Ballard led the league's  left-handers with 18 victories last season.  </P> <P> It was the Orioles' 10th victory in their last 26 games.  </P> <P> New York 5, Chicago 2 -- Bob Geren ended a two-for-29 slump with a three-run  home run at New York.  </P> <P> Both dugouts emptied during an argument between the Yankees' Deion Sanders and  White Sox catcher Carlton Fisk.  </P> <P> Fisk, 42, is outspoken in his criticism of the failure of young players to  hustle. In the third inning, Sanders merely stood at the plate after hitting a  pop-up with a runner on third and one out.  </P> <P> When he came up in the sixth, Fisk told the youngster what he thought about  Sanders' lack of hustle in the third.  </P> <P> Kansas City 9, Detroit 8 -- The Royals ended their 14-game Tiger Stadium losing  streak, but only after relief pitcher Jeff Montgomery got the final out with  the bases loaded in the ninth.  </P> <P> Texas 5, Boston 4 -- Rookie Jack Daugherty had four consecutive singles at  Boston and the Rangers won for only the third time in their last 12 games.  </P> <P> Jeff Russell earned a save by striking out Tony Pena to end the game with  runners on second and third.

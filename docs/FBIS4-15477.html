			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Marina Barinova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 7 Apr--A protocol signed by the Governments  of the Russian Federation and the Hungarian Republic provides  for the construction of an AES [Nuclear Electric Power Station]  in Hungary.    "In accordance with the protocol, Russia will also supply  Hungary with nuclear fuel," Georgiy Kaurov, head of the Russian  Ministry of Atomic Energy's [Minatom] Information and Public  Relations Department, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent.  "Furthermore, our organizations will begin to receive nuclear  fuel exhausted at the Paks AES after a five-year interval at the  station. We cannot refuse to accept it. That would mean  breaking obligations and undermining Russia's international  reputation as a reliable partner."    "Let me explain", Kaurov added. "Russia receives exhausted  fuel and not radioactive waste from Hungary. The two things are  not at all the same. During processing, useful components are  given off that are used as repeat fuel for an AES. Russia's  Minatom enterprises have highly effective and ecologically sound  processing technology for nuclear fuel. I would also point out  that the protocol guarantees a stable hard currency income that  allows resources to be channelled into rehabilitating polluted  sites and implementing programs for handling radioactive waste."</p>

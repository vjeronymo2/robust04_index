			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TWO-PART ACT;  </P> <P> TORI ROMEO JOINS BIG SISTER ON PROFESSIONAL BOWLING STAGE  </P> <P> Victoria Romeo started bowling as a youngster, a 9-year-old tagging along  behind an older sister who was in a junior league in Mamaroneck, N.Y.  </P> <P> Eighteen years later, she is still following in the footsteps of that big  sister, Robin, but now it's on the Ladies Professional Bowling Tour.  </P> <P> "We're a pretty good team," Tori said. "It is fun and very comfortable. She  doesn't expect a ton out of me and I don't expect a ton out of her. Whatever  happens, happens."  </P> <P> Robin had established herself as one of the Tour's most successful bowlers long  before Tori, as she is known to family and friends, rolled her first ball in a  pro tournament in February. In 11 years on the Tour, Robin, 32, has won five  national titles and more than $200,000.  </P> <P> Tori, 27, had been content to watch her sister from the sidelines until this  year when she decided to make a commitment to pro bowling, giving the tour its  only team of sisters.  </P> <P> "I let it (bowling) go for awhile, but this year I decided to do it," Tori  said.  </P> <P> When the Romeo family moved to Beverly Hills 10 years ago, Robin was already on  the pro circuit. Tori, then 17, bypassed the local junior leagues and joined an  adult league but soon found herself overwhelmed by the competition. So while  Robin was on the road, Tori was bowling in monthly and regional tournaments  trying to regain her confidence.  </P> <P> But in 1986, three years after moving again -- this time to Van Nuys -- Tori's  ego got a major boost when she won the West Coast Mixed Elimination tournament  at Canoga Park Bowl.  </P> <P> Now, with only six months' experience on the Tour, Tori believes she possesses  the skills to compete with the pros.  </P> <P> In fact, Tori, who has won $3,800 on the Tour thus far, is so confident that  she has designs on the LPBT Rookie of the Year award.  </P> <P> "You have to be cocky," she said. "It is all a part of the mental attitude. If  you don't think you are good enough to win, then you don't need to be out  there. I feel I belong out there."  </P> <P> Although Tori says that she enjoys bowling professionally, she also says it has  its drawbacks.  </P> <P> "It is the kind of sport where you like it or you don't," she said. "There is  no in between. It is a very frustrating sport. It is something where you have  to be mentally strong instead of physically. If you don't have it mentally it  can be really hard."  </P> <P> In spite of the drawbacks, Tori contends she will continue bowling. "The money  isn't that great, but I will stick it out as long as I can," she said.  </P></p>

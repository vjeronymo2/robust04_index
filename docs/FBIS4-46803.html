			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Afghanistan Is Opposed to Aggression </F> and Condemns the Mercenaries"]    [Text] As already reported, in December 1993 Levon  Ter-Petrosyan, president of the Republic of Armenia, sent  letters to Borhanoddin Rabbani, president of the Islamic  Republic of Afghanistan, and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar,  in which he expressed concern at the involvement of Afghan  mujahidin in the Karabakh conflict in units of the Azerbaijani  Army.    We were able to acquaint the reader with fragments of the  return message of the president of Afghanistan. Today we have an  opportunity to publish a more detailed text obtained from the  staff of the president of the Republic of Armenia:    "Your Excellency, I have received and studied your message  concerning the involvement of certain irresponsible Afghan  persons participating in the war in Nagornyy Karabakh. The  Afghan side recognizes the feelings of the Armenian leadership.  I want with great regret to inform you and, through you, the  people of Armenia that some groups of adventurers undermining  social and political stability in Afghanistan are, truly, for  financial backing for their aims accepting Afghan underlings of  the former Soviet Azerbaijan in order to cause a deterioration  in relations between Armenia and Afghanistan.    "Your Excellency! The Islamic state of Afghanistan and the  freedom-loving people of Afghanistan, recognizing the UN  Charter, express their protest against aggression, from wherever  it emanate.    "We view the roots of the contradiction between Armenia and  Azerbaijan as the consequences of a conspiracy of the former  Soviet leaders. The Islamic state of Afghanistan and the people  of Afghanistan advocate peaceful coexistence and are following a  strategy of peace and Afghanistan's friendly relations with the  two countries: Azerbaijan and Armenia. In the light of this we  do not approve of the participation of Afghan citizens in the  armed operations in Karabakh. We support a peaceful resolution  of the conflict between the recently formed countries.    "Your Excellency! The participation of certain mercenaries  going by the name of mujahidin cannot cause a deterioration in  the friendly relations between Afghanistan and Armenia. The  Afghan side will endeavor in every possible way to prevent this  inhuman business, which is being conducted by extremists using  their income from this to increase instability in Afghanistan.  Afghanistan will try to put an end to this business as soon as  possible.    "Your Excellency! Availing myself of the opportunity, I wish  you and the people of Armenia success, good health, and  happiness."</p>

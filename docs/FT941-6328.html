			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Tackling the settler problem The Middle East has taken important strides towards greater stability in the past three years and it would be criminal folly to permit the act of one extremist to undo much of what has been achieved. The peace negotiations between Israel, the Palestinians, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan must continue despite the massacre at a mosque in Hebron last Friday. But it would be politically naive to suppose that the Arabs, and particularly the Palestinians, can agree to a resumption of negotiations while passions in the Israeli-occupied territories are so inflamed. A measure of calm has to be restored, and some confidence instilled that there will be less risk of similar acts of barbarism in the future. The greatest part of that responsibility lies with the government of Israel. Successive Israeli governments have permitted or vigorously encouraged Jewish settlers to establish themselves in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights, against the terms of the Geneva Convention and despite the condemnation of the world community, including the US. All recent incumbents of the White House have emphasised that they consider the settlements to be an obstacle to peace. They become even more of an obstacle when provocatively placed in the heart of, or very close to, substantial Palestinian population centres. Baruch Goldstein, who carried out the Hebron massacre, lived in such a settlement along with other fanatics whose declared aim is to sabotage the peace process. Too modest The measures announced by the government against a handful of settlers since the massacre seem far too modest to ensure a significant improvement in security for Palestinians. Less than 100 people have been banned from carrying weapons under new government restrictions. Other armed settlers, many of whom are army reservists, are still free to walk the streets of Hebron and other Palestinian towns. The risk of another Goldstein being among them cannot be ignored. The best way of reducing that danger is for the government immediately to order the closure of those few settlements sited in the most sensitive areas of Palestinian population, and to bar settlers from carrying arms outside their own settlement areas. Responsibility for their security must rest with the Israeli army, just as it does for the Palestinian population. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, has so far set his face against such measures, but they would not lack support among an important part of the electorate, and among some of his cabinet colleagues. Neither need the closure of a few settlements prejudge negotiations on the wider settlement issue, which, under the Washington agreement signed with the Palestinians on September 13, are scheduled to begin two years after the introduction of limited Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza. Act decisively Mr Rabin, though cautious by nature, has shown in the past that he can act decisively when faced by security threats. At the end of 1992 he expelled 415 Palestinians to south Lebanon, and in July he launched a week-long bombardment of southern Lebanon which cost an estimated 125 lives and drove some 250,000 people from their homes. He might reflect that extremists from within his own community can now be seen as every bit as much a threat to the peace process as those from the Arab community. The Palestine Liberation Organisation should equally be careful to maintain a balance in its own reaction to the tragedy. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, is justly concerned that security for Palestinians in the territories be improved, and the presence of UN observers, as agreed in the Washington accords, would be a useful step. But any attempt at this stage to force a more fundamental reassessment of those agreements would almost certainly be counter-productive. The longer-term political survival of both Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin is closely linked with their ability to conclude a successful peace accord. In the short term that will be best served by Israel taking a tighter grip on its extremists, and by the two sides completing their negotiations on an Israeli troop withdrawal from much of Gaza and the West Bank.</p>

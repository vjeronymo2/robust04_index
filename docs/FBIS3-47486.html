			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa denied press reports Thursday [13 January] that he is  considering reshuffling the cabinet immediately after the  expected passage of political reform bills at the end of this  month.    Hosokawa told reporters that he is "not at all considering"  a  cabinet reshuffle.    The premier also said the government plans to retain the  post  of a state minister in charge of political reform after the  expected passage of the political reform bills. Sadao Yamahana,  former chairman of the Social Democratic Party, currently holds  the post.    The YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported Thursday that Hosokawa  discussed  the plan to reshuffle the cabinet with Shinseito (Japan Renewal  Party) co-leader Ichiro Ozawa at the end of last year and is  studying the timing and scale of the change.    The YOMIURI said the reshuffle would be on a limited scale,  though it was intended to replace Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura and a few other ministers.    Takemura, who advocated concessions to the opposition  Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) on the bills, is likely to be retained in  the cabinet with a new post, the YOMIURI said.    Ozawa, former LDP secretary general, takes an uncompromising  stance to the LDP.    Shinseito is offering cabinet posts to [Social Democratic  Party of Japan] SDP [SDPJ] executives calling for tightening  control on party members, sources said. Several SDP[J] House of  Councillors members have expressed opposition to the bills and  could vote against them or abstain.    The government-proposed package that Hosokawa has vowed to  push through the Diet during its current session is pending  before the upper house.</p>

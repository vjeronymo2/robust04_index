			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Policy shift signalled at CBI: Attitude of Davies to political parties contrasts sharply with Banham stance THE Confederation of British Industry is set for a marked shift in its approach to dealings with the government under Mr Howard Davies, the controller of the Audit Commission, who will become the CBI's director-general on July 1. Mr Davies, whose appointment was approved yesterday by the CBI's governing council, said he would prefer to work alongside policymakers whichever party was in power, rather than 'throwing in ideas from the outside'. He adopted a markedly less critical approach to Labour than either Sir John Banham, the outgoing director-general, or Sir Brian Corby, the CBI president who is to retire soon. Mr Davies said there was an emerging consensus on economic management with both Labour and the Conservative saying the right things about the economic climate they wanted to create. He said the CBI's task would be to work closely with the government to influence the detail of policymaking from the inside in an attempt to make sure legislation did not damage business interests. Mr Davies indicated that while the CBI would be open about its policy objectives, it would pursue them through detailed analysis of policy proposals rather than engag-ing in wide-ranging public debate. Mr Davies' style contrasts with that of Sir John, who has favoured a much more public role, often outspokenly criticising government and opposition policy. Mr Davies' even-handed approach to the policy programmes of the two main parties also contrasts with the stringent criticisms which Sir John and Sir Brian have made of Labour party policy. Early in the election campaign Sir Brian sent a letter to CBI members reiterating what he saw as the gains that industry had made in the past decade. It was widely seen as an endorsement for the Conservative party. The CBI council called on the incoming government to maintain downward pressure on inflation, to manage pressure for regional government and devolution to minimise the damage it might do to business and to strengthen considerably the Department of Trade and Industry. The council called for the DTI to be refocused, with responsibility for the National Economic Development Council transferred to it from the Treasury, and its regulatory functions separated from its support for British industry. It called for the DTI to take on the Department of Employment's responsibilities for small businesses and enterprise.</p>

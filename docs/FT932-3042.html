			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Observer: Ex-Governor for hire With only a fortnight to go before the newly-ennobled Robin Leigh-Pemberton hands in his keys as governor of the Bank of England, it is far from clear what he is going to do next. He has had a good innings at the Bank and as a fit 66-year-old he has a few years service left in him. If he should run short of job offers he could always seek advice from his old chum and long-time Bank director, Sir Adrian Cadbury, whose ProNed body specialises in finding non-executive directors for tough jobs. But it is unlikely to come to that. Before he became a central banker, Leigh-Pemberton had been chairman of a clearing bank (NatWest) and an industrial company (Birmid Qualcast). The Fed's Paul Volcker and the Bundesbank's Karl Otto Pohl, have had no difficulty collecting an impressive portfolio of directorships when they stepped down. Neither should Leigh-Pemberton. However, there is one particularly delicate matter which needs to be resolved. Leigh-Pemberton is one of two Brits on the board of the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers' talking shop. The other is his predecessor, Lord Richardson, who has just been re-elected for a further three-year term. Eddie George gets a seat automatically. But will Lord Richardson do the decent thing and give up his place. After all Lord O'Brien did the same for Richardson when he quit the Bank in 1983.</p>

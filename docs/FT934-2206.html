			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Management: Portrait of an image adviser - A former actor tells Judy Dempsey of his attempts to help fellow 'Ossis' with their presentation When the Berlin Wall came down, Torsten Schlingelhof quit the stage, folded his jazz band, and moved to Berlin from his native Weimar. But he quickly tired of his jobs in the capital. What disappointed him most was the way east Germans presented themselves. Schlingelhof decided to do something about it. 'I saw the way in which they lacked self-confidence,' he explains, 'and how they were unsure about how to deal with the opportunities which opened up before them.' Schlingelhof and his friend Jutta von Brunkau started their image advice consultancy, Atmeum, in February last year. 'The east Germans have found it difficult to cope with the changes,' says 37-year-old Schlingelhof. 'For 40 years, they were not allowed to express their individualism publicly. They had to act in a collective way. But in their heads, they were individuals. I want to draw out this individualism. I suppose I try to provide a bridge between the collective mentality and individual self-expressionism.' Schlingelhof's method, like his manner, is informal and relaxed. His clients, mostly women aged between 30 and 55, can register for an individual course or in groups. 'I first ask my clients what they do, and what they want from life. The answer is invariably the same,' says Schlingelhof. 'Many of them are professional women. Before unification, they were working as lecturers, teachers, or art historians. Their jobs were secure. Now they have to compete in the market economy. They all want self-confidence, particularly when they apply for a job, but they do not have the tools to achieve this.' With his staff of six, including Wilfried Markert, a retired voice teacher at east Berlin's renowned Schauspielschule, Schlingelhof advises on deportment, dress, style, and how to articulate with confidence. Business has not been particularly brisk - about 350 people have passed through his doors - but as Schlingelhof explains, 'our clients are shy about coming'. Half of them are from west Berlin, according to Schlingelhof. 'I believe that in west Germany, you are not meant to admit that you lack self-confidence.' Katharina Gruhl, a 30-year-old west Berliner who runs her own management consultancy agency, approached Schlingelhof 'because I wanted to project myself. Atmeum has given me great self-confidence'. Gruhl is surprised that Schlingelhof is an Ossi, or Easterner. 'He is so untypical of the Ossis. He is confident. But I realise that by going to the studio, I can learn about how the Ossis think as well. That is very important for breaking down the mental wall between the Wessis and the Ossis.' Schlingelhof feels both bemused and irritated when Ossis or Wessis discover he is an east German. 'Some Wessis have this image that the Ossis are from another planet. Indeed, I had a lot of difficulty in obtaining a bank loan largely because the banks were suspicious because I was an Ossi. They distrusted me because I had no previous record in running a business. But we have to start somewhere.'</p>

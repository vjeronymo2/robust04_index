			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> YWCA, YMCA DROP COMBINED PROJECT  </P> <P> The Pasadena YWCA on Tuesday dropped efforts to develop a joint athletic and  social service complex with the YMCA, abandoning a project that has been beset  with site, design and financial difficulties.  </P> <P> Instead, said YWCA president Ernestine Moore, the group will explore ways to  develop its property in the Pasadena civic center either on its own or with a  financial partner. She said the plan would allow the organization to remain at  the site in improved facilities.  </P> <P> The decision leaves the YMCA without a partner in its quest for a new home near  downtown Pasadena. The organization closed the recreation portion of its  building across from the YWCA in February and has sold the property.  Originally, the two organizations planned to build a joint-use facility on the  YWCA site. But that proposed $15-million project failed last December when  financing could not be secured.  </P></p>

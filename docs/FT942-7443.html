			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Strong yen depresses TDK sales TDK Corporation, the world's largest maker of magnetic tapes and a leading manufacturer of computer products, yesterday reported a slump in earnings for the year to March 31. Consolidated pre-tax profits fell by 47 per cent to Y17.8bn (Dollars 170m) as sales declined by 13 per cent to Y457.4bn. The company attributed most of the collapse to the sharp rise in the yen, which it said had reduced sales by an estimated Y44.3bn. In response, TDK was continuing to pursue an aggressive policy of expanding production overseas, with particular emphasis on Asian operations, it said. But weak demand in Japan also contributed to the decline. A depressed home market forced the company to cut prices, and the growth of imports of low-priced video tapes created an extremely difficult climate. Among the few bright spots were a rise in orders from the telecommunications sector and an upturn in the production of audio-visual products in the second half of the year. The parent company's pre-tax profit dropped 25 per cent to Y14.4bn on sales lower by some 9 per cent at Y334.6bn. Weak private sector capital spending and the strong yen pushed sales of electronic materials and components down by 6 per cent, while recording media sales dropped by 16 per cent.</p>

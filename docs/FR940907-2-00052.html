Company has previously received Federal Reserve System approval to engage in full-service brokerage activities, providing financial advice to state and local governments, and underwriting and dealing in bank-eligible securities. Applicant proposes to conduct these activities throughout the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks have generally provided the proposed activity; that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity; or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision in a specialized form.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Courier Ass'n v.

In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board has previously approved, by regulation, financial advisory activities and providing foreign exchange transactional and advisory services.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4)(vi) and (17). Applicant has stated that it will conduct these proposed activities subject to the requirements and limitations of the Board's Regulation Y. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board also has previously approved, by order, underwriting and dealing in, to a limited extent, bank-ineligible securities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., Citicorp, et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 473 (1987) (1987 Section 20 Order),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> aff'd sub nom.

Applicant has stated that it will conduct the proposed underwriting and dealing activities in bank-ineligible securities using the same methods and procedures, and subject to the same prudential limitations established by the Board in the 1987 Section 20 Order, and the 1989 Section 20 Order, as modified by the Modification Order, including the Board's 10 percent revenue limitation on such activities. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  For this reason, Applicant contends that approval of the application would not be barred by section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377), which prohibits the affiliation of a state member bank with any company principally engaged in the underwriting, public sale, or distribution of securities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 Applicant is proposing that Company have two director interlocks with Applicant's subsidiary banks. These directors would not be officers of Company or the subsidiary banks, would not have authority to handle day-to-day business of the banks or handle individual bank transactions. These directors would not make up a majority of Company's board of directors.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Synovus Financial Corp., 77 Federal Reserve Bulletin 954, 955 (1991); Banc One Corporation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 756, 758 (1990). Applicant is also proposing that affiliate banks of Company broker or act as riskless principal for bank-eligible securities underwritten or dealt in by Company in a manner previously approved by the Board.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See BankAmerica Corporation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1163, 1165 (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board also has previously approved, by order, the proposed private placement and riskless principal activities, and Applicant has stated that it will conduct these proposed activities using the same methods and procedures and subject to the prudential limitations established by the Board in its previous orders.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Dauphin Deposit Corporation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 77 Federal Reserve Bulletin 672 (1991);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> J.P.

Applicant proposes to engage in these swap activities subject to the provisions and conditions established by the Board in its previous orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to satisfy the proper incident to banking test, section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act requires the Board to find that the performance of the activities by Company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will benefit the public by increasing customer convenience, increasing competition in the market for the proposed services, and promoting gains in efficiency. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will not result in any unsound banking practices or other adverse effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the BHC Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W.

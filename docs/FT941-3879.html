			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Banks return to acquisition finance - Capital &amp; Credit The financing of takeovers in the US passed a significant milestone last week. As an all-cash, Dollars 2bn battle broke out in the defence industry for Long Island-based Grumman, the message to the financial markets was loud and clear: the banks are back. A Dollars 1.9bn offer from Martin Marietta, launched at the start of the week, was underwritten in its entirety by JP Morgan and Bank of America, with the two banks making an additional Dollars 500m available on top. By Thursday, rival Northrop had responded with a Dollars 2bn bid, backed by total commitments of Dollars 2.8bn from Chase Manhattan and Chemical. The extra cash available to both bidders immediately raised the spectre of a bank-financed bidding war, pushing Grumman's market value on Friday up to Dollars 2.2bn. Neither offer is highly leveraged. Northrop has minimal gearing at present, with debt only 10 per cent of total capital. Standard &amp; Poor's calculates that Martin Marietta's gearing would go up from 36 per cent to 54 per cent if it wins the battle for Grumman. Yet the willingness of some of the US's biggest financial institutions to lay more than Dollars 1bn each on the line inevitably prompts comparisons with the debt-financed acquisitions of the 1980s, known for their leverage. Starved of opportunities to lend, a whole array of US and foreign banks have pinpointed acquisition finance as one area of growth. 'There is a great deal of bank money chasing far too few deals,' says Mr Stewart Boswell of North Carolina-based NationsBank, one of a number of banks whose ambitions to play a prominent role in big corporate transactions is making the bank lending market increasingly competitive. If banks are so eager to lend again, can reckless leverage be far behind? Until recently, the US's latest takeover wave had been carried along by a buoyant equity market, prompting a rash of all-share bids. Now, two things have changed. First, with short-term US interest rates widely expected to rise further, the stockmarket has lost some of its shine. Second, equity investors are no longer so confident in the ability of acquisitive companies to expand without diluting their earnings. The Dollars 10bn battle for Paramount Communications did much to change sentiment. As the share prices of bidders Viacom and QVC came under pressure, both fell back increasingly on bank finance to support their offers. The banks are more than ready to fill the gap. Acquisition financing could help to plug part of the hole left by the slide in banks' lending to their big business customers so far in the 1990s. Total commercial and industrial lending by US banks has picked up slightly from its low point in the third quarter of last year, but is still around Dollars 100bn lower than the peak Dollars 600bn reached in 1990. More important to the banks, though, are the fees for underwriting big transactions. Equity-financed deals favoured Wall Street's investment banks, which reaped big underwriting profits last year. Transactions backed with debt, on the other hand, will boost the fee income of commercial banks - particularly now that the biggest of them have the ability to arrange bond deals as well as syndicated loans. Underwriting fees vary greatly, depending on the amount of leverage involved. For committing Dollars 100m to back Loral's acquisition of IBM's aerospace business, for instance, banks were offered fees of 6.5 basis points. On the other hand, those committing Dollars 25m to the Dollars 1.5bn transaction to releverage Jefferson Smurfit in the US are being paid 150 basis points. A handful of money-centre banks are coming to dominate the business. The Grumman battle is unusual in that just four banks have committed more than Dollars 5bn between them. Two of the four - Morgan and Chemical - also featured in the bank financing of the rival bids for Paramount, acting for Viacom and QVC respectively (Citibank also acted as a joint-lead for Viacom.) The availability of bank money - together with the renaissance last year of the junk bond market - has also kicked the leveraged buy-out business back into life. The Dollars 1.5bn Jefferson Smurfit deal (Dollars 1.3bn of it underwritten in the bank market, with another Dollars 250m of junk bonds) involves the first leveraged bank financing of more than Dollars 1bn since 1990, when the buy-out market last ground to a halt. How far will it go? The limitations on leverage at the moment are being imposed by buyers, rather than financiers. The equity component in a typical leveraged transaction has fallen to 20 per cent or less, from 25 to 30 per cent last year, but is still higher than the 5 - 10 per cent level common in the 1980s. 'Leverage is back. It's just a question of how far companies want to go,' says Mr James Lee, managing director in charge of structured finance at Chemical, probably the most aggressive bank in the leveraged buy-out business at the moment. With such views now common among bankers, it may not be long before the multi-billion leveraged buy-out is back.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / White House shrugs off Panetta's Nafta doubts THE White House yesterday tried to minimise the impact of published remarks by Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, to the effect that its economic programme was in trouble in Congress and that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) currently was politically 'dead'. President Bill Clinton said he had no reason to be angry with Mr Panetta. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, insisted the legislative programme was 'on track', that Nafta was 'alive and well', and that Mr Panetta was only speculating on its prospects 'if it went up to the Hill this week'. She said that whatever the current opposition the Nafta treaty would be seen in a different light when it was eventually presented for ratification with supplemental agreements now being negotiated with Canada and Mexico. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, also told Congress yesterday that the treaty remained an administration priority. Mr Panetta was particularly concerned at the anti-Nafta campaign being waged by Mr Ross Perot, last year's independent presidential candidate. This, he said, 'makes it even more difficult' to get the treaty through Congress when it already had many enemies. The general thrust of his comments, in an interview with US reporters, did not appear to help the administration, recently defeated over the Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10bn) stimulus package and increasingly subject to criticism from Congress over various aspects of its extensive domestic agenda. The budget director, a former congressman from California, specifically said he was advising Mr Clinton to delay releasing his plan for healthcare reform, probably due out next month, until after the budget reconciliation bill has been voted in June. He predicted stiff congressional resistance to published proposals to trim the costs of Medicaid and Medicare, the federally funded health care programmes, to the energy tax in its present form, to the investment tax credit, already under fire from Democrats, and to the new student loan programme. He thought there was no chance of passage of a value added tax unless it were a 'revenue neutral' substitute for payroll and income taxes. The president ran the risk of seeing his programmes torn apart by a combination of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans. He urged Mr Clinton 'to define his priorities more clearly,' and to be willing to carry the fight for his proposals to the public.</p>

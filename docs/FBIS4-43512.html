			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Heinz-Joachim Fischer: "Conspicuously </F> Berlusconi's First Foreign Trip Is to Bonn"]    [Text] Rome -- The new Italian prime minister, Berlusconi,  will meet Chancellor Kohl during a brief visit to Bonn on  Thursday [16 June]. It is Berlusconi's first foreign visit  since he led a three-party center-right coalition to victory in  the parliamentary elections in March, formed his cabinet on 10  May, and then received a vote of confidence from the Senate and  the Chamber of Deputies. Berlusconi's visit has thus highlighted  Germany's importance for Italy as a partner of the highest order  within the European Union as well as Kohl's significance for  personal and substantive issues involving Europe's states  against the background of the Commission in Brussels and the  conferences that will take place on Corfu and in Naples over the  next few weeks.    However, there is an element of excitement about the visit.  Since the billionaire and media businessman Berlusconi decided  to enter politics at the end of January, challenging the Left  and winning the elections, and since accepting the postfascist  National Alliance as a coalition partner, he has been the target  of hefty criticism both in Italy and abroad. Reporting by some  of the Italian media stems from unfriendly to hostile. Rome has  noted with regret that the German media in particular have been  launching attacks against the Italian Government, and the  fierceness of the attacks is out of proportion to their content.  To spare the guest from Italy a furor, it has been decided not  to stage a general news conference in Bonn. It has been  announced that Berlusconi will only be available to a few  journalists at the embassy. In considering the pros and cons  regarding Berlusconi, it should be borne in mind that his  opponents do not necessarily represent a majority of the  electorate. In contrast to Kohl, Berlusconi has successful  national elections behind him; both of them can congratulate  themselves as victors in the European elections.    Speaking to this newspaper, Foreign Minister Martino set out  the government's field of activity. That the center-right  coalition should encounter fierce opposition is no surprise. As  head of Forza Italia, Berlusconi, along with his allies in the  Northern League and the right-wing National Alliance, has  started to change the corrupt party and state systems. He has  been charged with doing so by a majority of the electorate. It  is understandable that there are forces that oppose. Providing  an example, Martino mentioned that since 1978, what was at that  time the communist party and is now the opposition left-wing  democratic party backed 95 percent of government budget policies  and thus unrestrained state expenditure.    At that time, all the parties bought the support of voters  with public expenditure. Now, the Italians have to expose the  costs of that wastefulness, reduce costs, and be given an honest  pay for their work.    The 52-year-old Sicilian Martino talked openly about the  problem of fascism and fascists. He said that in his opinion,  fascism was something entirely different from what appeared in  Berlusconi's government program. As a liberal economist, he  only joined up with Berlusconi because Berlusconi wants to  reduce state intervention in the economy and society -- a  difficult task in Italy, because of the high level of state  involvement in the economy and an extravagant social system that  cannot be financed. Both these phenomena stem from the fascist  period, but have been stubbornly defended by the parties over  the past few decades. The program is being supported by the  five National Alliance ministers, because they are not fascists,  said Martino. In his opinion, the polemics about fascism will  die down. Martino did, however, concede that representatives of  the National Alliance had made unnecessary, damaging statements:  The lack of wisdom about those statements was balanced out by  statements in a similar vein on the other side. On the other  hand, the advantage of these exchanges of differing views was  that greater clarity had emerged. He described his meeting with  Israeli Foreign Minister Peres on Monday [13 June] as "cordial  and friendly," and "friendlier than would have been the case if  certain statements had not been made."    Regarding policy on Europe, Martino and the Berlusconi  government share the chancellor's view that content and the  joint goal are more important than the timeframe. This  indicates that he is a supporter of a free market and does not  think much of Brussels dirigism and unnecessary EU intervention  in national sovereignty. "Intervention from above justifies  division, harms interests, and restricts free trade," said  Martino. This also showed that the foreign minister was in tune  with the feelings of his voters, who do not appreciate being  told what to think by politicians and made to display enthusiasm  about Europe. There is no doubt in Martino's mind that Italy  will seek to fulfill its European duties. Martino has a  consolation ready for the Christian-Democrat chancellor in Bonn,  who will no longer be able to speak to an Italian  Christian-Democrat head of government. Berlusconi's "Italia" is  a "recovered Democrazia Cristiana," a popular party of the  center, which is open-ended in the case of voters on the Right  and whose limits on the Left are the competing opposition  parties.</p>

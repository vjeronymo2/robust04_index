			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Drugs cuts lead to unhealthy figures - Daniel Green reports on the forthcoming results from pharmaceutical companies This year's round of pharmaceutical company results will be the first to show the effects of a full year of healthcare reforms in Germany, one of the world's biggest markets. Germany cut its drug spending at the start of 1993 and sales there have, on early indications, fallen by about 10 per cent. These reforms, as well as those more recently in the UK, Italy, France and Japan, and those planned in the US, have depressed drug company share prices. Investors fear that government efforts to cut health spending budgets by concentrating on limiting the drugs bill will slow profits growth. Drug companies are already busy trimming costs. But they have not moved fast enough to have prevented the drugs sector becoming one of the worst performers in the stock market. Share prices have underperformed the rest of the market by so much that investors are now in the unusual position of evaluating their portfolios on the basis of dividend yield rather than capital growth, as has been the case for more than a decade. This means that what happens to the dividend pay-outs in the results season is at least as important as the pre-tax profits figures. At Glaxo, where first half results are released today, the dividend is likely to rise to between 8p and 9p, compared with 7p a year ago. The company has a policy of paying a much higher final dividend, forecast by stockbroker Goldman Sachs to be 25p this year, giving a yield of well over 4 per cent. The range of forecasts for pre-tax profits is from just over Pounds 900m to about Pounds 970m. Shareholders are also likely to hear comments from Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive, on speculation that the company will form an alliance with Pfizer, the US drugs company. The two have had talks on collaboration ahead of the implementation of the Clinton administration's healthcare reforms. Sir Richard may also indicate how talks are going with other companies, including those at the distribution end of the business. Developments in the US will also be picked over in any statement from SmithKline Beecham, whose full-year figures are due on February 22. Tagamet, the ulcer treatment that was once the world's biggest selling drug, loses US patent protection in May. The company's share price is already sensitive to indications of the speed of the sales decline and of how fast sales of an over-the-counter version will grow. SB's pre-tax profits are expected at about Pounds 1.22bn, compared with Pounds 1.12bn and the dividend rise should be about 1.8p to 10.4p, giving a gross yield of more than 3 per cent. Zeneca will on March 3 reveal its first set of full-year figures since its demerger from ICI last summer. The company should show it has made at least Pounds 600m pre-tax. At the time of the demerger it indicated that it would pay a dividend of 27.5p. This would give a gross yield of about 4.5 per cent. Within the figures, there will be much interest over whether the rapid growth of Zestril, a heart treatment, can be maintained. The drug should be close to becoming the company's biggest selling product; and the company's debt level should be coming down quickly as it cuts costs. Fisons' results on March 8 should show that pre-tax profits have slumped to zero in accordance with the company's profits warning which accompanied the departure of Mr Cedric Scroggs, the chief executive, in December 1993. The company is yet to appoint a new finance director or chief executive. Indications that there has been progress on either search should bolster the share price. At Wellcome, where interim results are due on March 24, a cash pile of about Pounds 600m provides a useful cushion against the difficulties the company is having with its anti-Aids drug, Retrovir. Recent drugs trials suggest that Retrovir should not be used in patients that do not show symptoms of Aids even though they are infected with the HIV virus. The publication of further trial results is likely before the company's results are published. The company's biggest selling drug, anti-viral Zovirax, should once again be a star performer. Competition for Zovirax is emerging for the first time in the shape of SmithKline Beecham's Famvir, but this will not affect 1993 figures. Pre-tax profits at Wellcome are expected by broker James Capel to rise by 12 per cent to Pounds 360m (Pounds 325m).</p>

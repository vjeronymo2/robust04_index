			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Stop the Talking, Finish the Airport"] </F>   [Text] It is hard to find more than a handful of people in  Hong Kong who do not believe the territory needs a new airport.  It is equally hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel  during Sino-British negotiations on the building of the Chek Lap  Kok airport. The simple fact of the matter is that the airborne  conveyance of passengers and cargo has become a political  football.    The Hong Kong Government is poised to make yet another offer  to the Chinese government designed to quell its anxieties on the  accumulation of public debt for the purpose of building the  airport. Slamming billions of dollars down on the negotiating  table in the hope of securing a deal, the government is  effectively undermining all its original plans for the project.    In 1989, when then Governor David Wilson announced the plan  for the new airport, he solemnly assured the public it would be  largely financed by the private sector and would be open for  business in 1997.    Now it is clear that the bulk of the funding will come from  the public purse and it seems increasingly unlikely that a  single aircraft will brush its wheels along the carefully  levelled runway in 1997.    Large scale private financing has been virtually ruled out  by  China's insistence that capital should be collected without the  subsequent accumulation of debt. With no guarantee of Chinese  support, raising funds in the private sector is near impossible.  Steadily the Government has moved to satisfy China's demanding  fiscal requirements, but to no avail. In desperation Governor  Chris Patten cries out for "China to take yes for an answer" in  responding to British offers on airport financing. However,  Patten and everybody else knows that the Chinese government will  not take yes for answer because it is asking a different  question. Put bluntly, the airport is being held hostage to the  wider political dispute about the extension of representative  government in Hong Kong. Until that matter is settled it is  highly unlikely that other matters of substance will come close  to a settlement.    Even though this is widely known by the British, Hong Kong  and Chinese governments, they plunge merrily through the charade  of pretending they are talking about the airport when it is  obvious that they have a completely different agenda.    In 1991 the British Prime Minister, John Major, dispatched  his special envoy Sir Percy Cradock to hold secret talks in  Beijing aimed at breaking the impasse. Sir Percy returned  triumphant, at least this was his version of events.    Clasping a scrap of paper called the Memorandum of  Understanding, Britain and China declared that an agreement had  been reached. Sir Percy, on Britain's behalf secured this  so-called agreement by the simple expedient of saying yes to  everything China asked for. Yet, today, it is palpably clear  that the agreement was hardly worth the paper it was printed on.  There can be no agreements on anything of substance while  Sino-British relations remain at their current low point. It is  a cruel deception to pretend otherwise.    The duty of all governments concerned is to acknowledge this  reality and decide how they should move forward without  hypocrisy.    In the case of the airport this means proceeding with the  project on public funds until such a time that the general  atmosphere in relations improves. If it does not and the drain  on resources becomes too onerous, the Government will have to  stop building and leave it to the incoming administration to  complete the job. At any rate let's get a move on. The  solution we suggest is far from satisfactory but much closer to  reality than anything we have heard emanating from so-called  Sino-British negotiations.    The likelihood is that the airport will open after the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region is established. The British  may feel cheated that their biggest monument will not be blessed  by the outgoing sovereign power, the Chinese may be rubbing  their hands with glee at the prospect.    For Hong Kong it does not matter who opens the wretched  airport, be it in June 1997 or July, after the takeover. The  important thing is that it opens soon.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD  </P> <P> CIA Director William H. Webster said West European companies have knowingly  played a key role in developing chemical weapons not only in Libya but also in  Iran, Iraq and Syria. Webster also told the Senate Governmental Affairs  Committee that foreign firms are helping Third World nations develop ballistic  missiles to deliver chemical and biological weapons. He did not identify any of  the firms. However, The Times reported earlier that U.S. officials have  concluded that Messerschmidt-Boelkow-Blohm, a West German firm, and SNIA-BPD, a  subsidiary of the Italian industrial giant Fiat, played a key role in an  Argentine-Egyptian project to develop a medium-range ballistic missile. A  spokesman for SNIA-BPD denied any transfer of missile technology to Egypt,  Libya or Iraq and said its Argentine program ended in 1985.  </P></p>

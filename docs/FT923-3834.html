			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): New generation tastes take teacup by storm Britain's tea market, cool in recent years because of competition from other drinks, is being warmed up by the development of new products. A new generation of teas has begun to change the nation's traditional tea-drinking habits, fuelling a 6 per cent growth in retail sales last year to Pounds 662m. A survey* published today estimates that sales of speciality products increased 50 per cent in 1991. They now account for 9 per cent of total sales, worth Pounds 60m. Forecasts suggest the sector will be worth Pounds 100m by 1995. For the past five years, the industry has poured resources into development of new products. The biggest impact has been made by instant teas. The brands introduced by Brooke Bond, Lyons Tetley, and Premier Teas, the industry leaders, have captured a Pounds 33m share of the market. For the health-conscious, decaffeinated or low-caffeine teas have grown rapidly as improvements have been made in taste and prices have been reduced. Organic teas became available in 1989 when Ridgways launched the first product developed for environmentally-conscious consumers. Lyons and several multiple retailers have also introduced organic brands. For the traditional tea-drinker, the Extra Fresh extension of Premier Teas' Typhoo brand last year claimed improved flavour from vacuum-packing the tea on the estates where it is grown. Retailers own-label brands are now helping to build the category. For more adventurous, up-market consumers, herbal and fruit infusions are becoming more attractive. * The Tea Report 1992, Typhoo, 156a Tooley St, London SE1 2NR  -----------------------------------------------                NEW GENERATION TEAS  ----------------------------------------------- Volume growth Jan-May 1992 verses Jan-May 1991  ----------------------------------------------- Decaffeinated                 45 percent Instant                       44 percent Fruit &amp; Herb                  37 percent Organic                       29 percent Extra fresh                   10 percent  ----------------------------------------------- Source: Independent Retail Audit  -----------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / GPA Group's Aborted Global Issue: Airline executives fear blight on orders THE FAILURE of the flotation will further disrupt the order books of world aircraft manufacturers, said airline executives yesterday. They also feel that it will raise the cost of financing aircraft and so help push some of the weakest airlines into bankruptcy. GPA stood to raise at least Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) from the flotation. The first Dollars 800m was to be directly from the issue of new shares and the rest through increased borrowing. GPA said yesterday it was confident that it could tap other sources, but others in the aviation sector believe GPA and other purchasers will have far less money than planned - and at a higher cost - to spend on new aircraft. This is the latest blow for recession-hit manufacturers. In the last few months the big three US airlines - American, United and Delta - cut their capital spending programmes. Other airlines have deferred delivery dates. And only last week, McDonnell-Douglas said it was all but abandoning development of the MD-12 600-seat aircraft. As the largest leasing company in the world, GPA is also one of the biggest buyers of new aircraft. Its firm order book, worth Dollars 11.9bn, accounts for more than 10 per cent of the outstanding orders of Boeing and Airbus, the world's biggest civil aircraft makers. Without new equity, it will not have the cash to pay for all of these aircraft. Unless GPA can issue more equity - through a flotation or private placements - it might be forced to cancel some of the 308 aircraft on order for delivery between 1993 and 2000, said City analysts. Aircraft manufacturers were tight-lipped yesterday, insisting that GPA finances were not their affair. Investors took a different view however. The share prices of Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas of the US, Fokker of Holland and stakeholders in the Airbus consortium, such as British Aerospace, all fell. Smaller airlines also felt the pressure. GPA often leases to smaller or poorly capitalised airlines which struggle to obtain attractive terms for financing to back expansion. Part of the reason for the share price weakness was fear that aircraft buyers would delay purchases further, increasing the pressure on prices. 'Aircraft values could be sent spiralling downwards,' said Mr Keith McMullan, managing director of Avmark, aviation consultancy, yesterday. There was also recognition that GPA, a financial company expected to have good contacts in the investment community, had failed to persuade investors that the airline industry was a good bet. 'It cannot be good news that GPA cannot attract funds in the present business climate,' said Mr Alan Hodder of the International Bureau of Aviation, a US-UK consultancy. Airlines have been unable to recover strongly from the collapse in demand caused by the Gulf war. US carriers have fought a series of price wars that have destroyed hopes of short-term profitability Another price war has just begun, and this week American Airlines, the only large US carrier to make a profit in 1991, said it would lose money in the second quarter of this year. Such is the desperation of the airline industry to see a fall in the number of competitors, that executives were yesterday prepared to argue privately that the failure of GPA's flotation was a good thing. 'It will make it more difficult for weak or small airlines and will help consolidation in the industry,' said one executive. The corollary, was that fares would eventually increase and allow airlines, to repair their damaged finances.</p>

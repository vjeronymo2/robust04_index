The consumer has been given an  opportunity not just to take whatever is offered but to  meticulously choose exactly what he or she needs from the dozens  of models and companies available.    Unfortunately, in the battle to win the customers' hearts  and  consequently their cash, our producers, spoiled by the former  scarcity and unlimited demand, often do not look especially  attractive. The workers of the "Zarya" industrial commercial  footwear firm in Moscow have had a good taste of the first  fruits of competition and the openness of the domestic market.  Their factory has been visited by First Vice Premier Oleg  Soskovets who is in charge of light industry.    This factory served as the base for an exhibition-fair where  contracts were signed with industrial enterprises and commercial  organizations for the production and sale of footwear in 1994.  And even though the goods on display at the show were the best  that this country's cobblers have to offer, it was clear that  they still face major marketing problems.    "There must be an on-the-spot investigation to find out just  why all the stores are crammed with foreign goods at a time when  we are unable to sell the goods produced by our plants," Oleg  Soskovets said, explaining the purpose of his visit. [passage  omitted]    After visiting the "Zarya" factory's shops and talking with  workers and foremen, Oleg Soskovets held a short conference with  the directors of Moscow textile and footwear enterprises. There  was just one topic of discussion: What must the government do  in order to remedy the situation in light industry and prevent a  further slump in production which has reached almost 60 percent  in the past three years.    The package of measures proposed by the directors were,  generally speaking, not distinguished by their variety. It was  the general opinion of enterprise directors that the  overstocking of the Russian market with cheap but not always  high-quality imported consumer goods is jeopardizing the very  existence of the country's light industry. "There must be  protective customs barriers against the import of finished goods  into Russia and the export of unprocessed agricultural raw  materials from the country," the production specialists stated.    "We will take care of our enterprises and create normal  conditions for their work. There is no doubt about that.  However, government-based protectionism must have reasonable  limits. Ultimately only the customer with his rubles can  properly assess the results of production collectives' work.  Not just to make things but to make things that will sell --  that must be the slogan of today," the first vice premier  believes.    The situation in Russia's light industry was the subject of  the discussion at a session of the Council of Ministers  Commission on Topical Questions.</p>

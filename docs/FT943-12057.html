			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Rwanda leader says UN role could ease crisis The presence of UN human rights monitors in Rwanda to guarantee the safety of returning refugees would be acceptable, Gen Paul Kagame, the strongman of the country's new government said yesterday. Gen Kagame, the commander of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, which took control of the country last week, said he wanted to persuade the millions of Hutus who fled in fear of his Tutsi-led guerrillas to come home. 'They have to give Kagame a chance to prove he is not what he has been portrayed to be,' he said. The propaganda of the ousted Hutu government, which Gen Kagame fought for 3 1/2 years, depicted him as an ogre. Yesterday, in his well-cut civilian suit and gold-rimmed glasses, Gen Kagame, who has assumed the posts of vice president and defence minister, looked more like a university professor than a soldier. He appears much older than his 37 years, having spent more than a third of his life as a guerrilla in the African bush. Perhaps because of a life spent in exile, Gen Kagame insists Rwanda needs a new political ideology that might break the cycle of ethnic hatred which has plagued his small nation for decades. 'Not all Hutus took part in the genocide of the Tutsi community,' he said. 'Not all Tutsis were feudal overlords in the past. We need to create a country that belongs to all Rwandans. We need to educate people on how to live together again.' He defended the dominance of the RPF in the new government, which includes four other political parties and Hutus in prominent posts. 'The RPF will have a strong voice in the new government if necessary,' said Gen Kagame, who prefers to speak English, instead of French, Rwanda's official language. 'This country needs to move. Someone must give it direction and a programme.' It was Gen Kagame's philosophy of a united Rwanda that prevented the RPF wreaking massive revenge upon the Hutu population for the massacre of the Tutsi population that began in April. That was sparked by the death of Gen Juvenal Habyarimana, the country's former president, in an air crash. Gen Kagame says those who did not take part in the massacres have nothing to fear. But he pledged to bring all suspects to trial. He says the RPF is only holding 'a few dozen' prisoners of war. He says he would welcome an international war crimes tribunal.

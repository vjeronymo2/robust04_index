			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Commercial logic drives hostility into the shade: The three Rs replace M&amp;As as merchant banks get busy After three years of twiddling their thumbs, merchant bankers are finding business picking up. Some are even beginning to recruit to their corporate finance departments. It is the clearest sign yet that the banks believe the revival in corporate finance work sustainable. Those financiers not enjoying their summer holidays claim they are working overtime on deals which will become public in the autumn. 'I'm normally a cautious chap,' says one, 'but I'm really quite surprised about the level of activity in the last three months. We are very busy at the moment, and not with tiddly floats. Since March or April activity has picked up strongly and the quality is good.' Others refer to the three Rs of corporate finance: restructurings, rights issues and rescues. The year has already seen a high level of flotations and rights issues; restructurings, such as the reorganisation of the Rothmans empire and the demerger of Zeneca from Imperial Chemical Industries; and continued rescue work. UK privatisations may be falling off after the BT3 sale last month, but there is much to be done for foreign governments - French and Italian for instance - and UK banks have an edge because of the experience of the past 10 years. Hill Samuel was this week appointed to seek private sector finance for the Channel Tunnel rail link, while NM Rothschild is privatising the Dutch post office. The Lloyd's insurance market's decision to seek corporate capital has also produced work for corporate financiers. But the pick-up in activity does not presage a return of the large hostile bid, or even a high level of mergers and acquisitions. 'In the UK there is quite a lot of activity, but it's not direct M&amp;A,' says a Rothschild director. 'In the late 1980s half the department would call themselves M&amp;A specialists, but not now. There is a different character to the work. Now there is little takeover activity and none of it hostile.' 'Going into the market and buying things is yesterday's game,' says Mr Nick Verey, SG Warburg's managing director of investment banking. 'The old type of mergers and acquisitions is over.' A rival agrees: 'Those are a thing of the past,' while another says: 'There has been a sea change - I'd be surprised if it recovers.' Companies have learnt that hostile bids rarely pay off for the aggressor, which ends up paying a top price without being able to perform 'due diligence' investigations. With the Footsie index reaching all-time highs in the past few days, the stock market had anticipated the economic recovery before companies were ready to expand again. 'When you run the slide rule over a company, with the stock market where it is, it doesn't look attractive to pay a premium,' one says. However, there is a marked increase in industrially driven deals, usually agreed. These often result from companies restructuring their businesses, having survived the recession. Many wish to sell non-core activities and can see a better market for assets than even a few months ago, while others want to expand. Lucas Industries' Pounds 9m disposal this week is part of its programme to raise Pounds 100m from sales this year. Other deals also illustrate the point: the sale of the Augustus Barnett off-licence chain by Bass to Allied-Lyons and the purchase by Greene King of 44 pubs from Bass. As for full-scale takeovers, the agreed bid by Greenalls for Devenish, which fought off a hostile bid from Boddington two years ago, shows that commercial logic can bring about a deal that hostility did not. Some bankers claim such deals are 'small beer', compared with some they are pursuing. Agreed deals are seen as low risk, as due diligence can be carried out and nasty surprises avoided. A price can be fixed without the bidder finding itself caught in a public auction. These deals are often cross-border, as companies find themselves restricted within their domestic markets and keen to become international forces in their industries. The agreed merger between Kingfisher, the UK retail group, and Darty, the French electrical chain, earlier this year is a case in point. Many banks, such as Lazard Brothers and NM Rothschild, have built up European office networks and forged closer links with partners in North America or Asia. Similarly, says Mr David Challen, head of corporate finance at Schroders, European cross-border mergers and acquisitions now account for half of that investment bank's public activities - a very different picture from five years ago. Two thirds of Warburg's corporate finance work is now generated overseas - privatisations and secondary shares issues on continental Europe and equity and debt issues in the US. If the economy continues to revive, some expect M&amp;A activity to increase next year. With interest rates low and the equity market high, finance for deals should be forthcoming.</p>

News that the Swiss retailer Metro was to take a majority stake in Asko saw the latter's shares fall as low as DM762 before recovering to close up DM2 at DM792.

PARIS was unsettled by weakness in the bond market and worries that the French will vote against the Maastricht Treaty in the September referendum. The CAC-40 index fell 27.90 to 1,754.67, but was still up 1.2 per cent on the week thanks to an earlier but short-lived bear market rally.

Fondiaria rose L560 to L23,810 and Ras added L340 to L13,850. The market's rebound caused some 10 shares to be suspended temporarily for excessive gains, including the steel group Falk and the energy group Edison.

Speaking after a rally at the  University of the Western Cape, he said Law and Order Minister  Hernus Kriel had apparently snubbed a Transkei Military Council  offer for a joint public relations exercise to persuade  Transkeians to allow NP canvassing in the territory.    In a telephone conversation, Mr Kriel had wanted guarantees  for the safety of NP offices and party workers in Transkei, Gen  Holomisa said. However, Transkeians were under the impression  that the South Africans were "hell-bent on our killing our  people". For this fear to be dispelled, the two countries had  to meet and work out a security plan, but Mr Kriel seemed to  have neglected taking up his advice, Gen Holomisa said.    "I cannot see how I can let him deploy his people (in  Transkei) because of the security risk." Without a security  agreement on political activities "the NP will have to take  Casspirs; we do not have armoured vehicles".    If agreement had not been reached within a week, the matter  of NP canvassing in Transkei could be referred to the  Independent Electoral Commission.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Bank of Japan governor  Yasushi Mieno vowed "appropriate steps in a timely manner"  Tuesday [22 February] to stabilize recently gyrating currency  markets.    Four days before meeting finance leaders of the Group of  Seven industrial nations, Mieno said in a Tokyo speech that the  recent resurgence of the yen had "clearly gone too far."    The yen has eased against the dollar in recent days from  last  week's trade woes-prompted jump, with dealers citing apparently  repeated yen-selling interventions by Japan's central bank.    Mieno said that a surging yen could again dampen Japanese  corporate sentiment, which he said had been showing glimmers of  improvement since the year began.    He said he wants to watch the effect of corporate sentiment  on economic recovery, but repeated that no clear signs of a  turnaround are visible.    Mieno said the economy remains weak, repeating that  corporate  capital spending is still sluggish and personal consumption is  weak overall, despite a few bright spots.    The basis for recovery, however, is firming, he said.    Capital stock adjustments will take time for full  completion,  but recovery can begin before that process is finished, he said.    Mieno also appeared to quash expectations of an imminent  interest rate cut, saying the central bank's record low official  discount rate, as well as money market and bank lending rates,  are all low enough to support corporate restructuring.    He stressed that he is taking a long-term perspective in  monetary policy to support sustainable, inflation-free growth  and prevent a resurgence of the speculative "bubble" of the late  1980s.    Banks remain reluctant to lend and companies reluctant to  invest, Mieno said, adding that a "steep, large correction is  needed" for financial institutions to clear their bad loans and  corporations to improve their balance sheets.    Moreover, financial institutions should not focus solely on  liquidating bad loans but should also show entrepreneurship to  revitalize their businesses, he said.    Repeating that the main task rested with the efforts of  corporations and institutions, Mieno said the authorities should  pave the way.    He said the central bank will do its part and called for  government "leadership" in such areas as deregulations included  in its recent fiscal stimulus package, saying he hopes  deregulation does not remain simply a slogan.    Deregulation would give companies and institutions the  chance  to use their "innovation potential" in new businesses and  products, he said, calling deregulation and innovation the  "wellspring of growth."    Mieno said deregulation can also play an important role in  reducing Japan's trade imbalances with other countries.</p>

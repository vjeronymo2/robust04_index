			<p>BFN     [Text] BANGKOK -- Deputy Commerce Minister Churin  Laksanawisit stated after his return from Vietnam, that he  reached a comprehensive agreement with Vietnam for the  protection of bilateral intellectual property rights and drug  patents.    According to Churin, the agreement is the first of its kind  between Thailand and Vietnam's Public Health Ministry on the  registration (patent) of medicines in both countries.    "This will help protect the trademarks of Thai medicines,  and  its import process (into Vietnam) will be convenient, too," said  Churin who just returned from an official visit to Vietnam.    By signing the agreements with Vietnam and holding talks  with  two major Vietnamese medicine importers, Churin is hopeful that  Thai medicine will be able to tap the Vietnamese medicine market  estimated at around 20 billion baht annually.    Another agreement that the deputy commerce minister has  entered into with Vietnam's Commerce Ministry is on intellectual  property rights. Churin said that Thailand plans to enter into  similar agreements with all the Indochinese countries, Myanmar  [Burma] and China. After agreements are made with all these  countries, Thailand will host a meeting among these countries  about property rights and copyrights.    While in Vietnam, the Thai deputy minister also held talks  with Vietnamese commerce ministry officials on the rice issue.  Both Thailand and Vietnam produce about three million tons of  low-quality rice, so both countries have to compete in the world  market. To avoid fierce competition, Jurin has invited the  Vietnamese commerce minister to talks in Bangkok.</p>

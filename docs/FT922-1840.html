			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: Plans for Canary Wharf to be revealed next week THE administrators of Canary Wharf are expected to present their initial proposals next Wednesday on the future of the Pounds 1.5bn (USDollars 2.77bn) project in London's Docklands. According to papers filed by Olympia &amp; York with an Ontario court yesterday, the Ernst &amp; Young partners who were appointed administrators in late May, are to submit 'their initial findings and suggested strategy' at a meeting with Canary Wharf's construction lenders in Toronto. O&amp;Y also outlined a new debt-restructuring proposal which would include extending repayments on most of its debt for five years, and the disposal of some Canadian properties and other investments. The company reaffirmed an earlier plan to convert some of its CDollars 13.5bn (USDollars 11.2bn) debt into equity, but it continues to insist that control remain with its existing owners, Toronto's Reichmann family. The court separately approved an application by a group of Canadian banks to terminate 13 interest-rate swaps with O&amp;Y. The banks argued that the value of the swaps, considered an asset, was declining as interest rates fell. The move freezes the amount of the banks' claim against O&amp;Y in respect of the swaps. In its submission, O&amp;Y reiterated the importance of remaining a going concern. It warned that immediate liquidation would result in 'significant losses to virtually all groups of creditors'. It also said common management of its properties 'serves to increase asset values in the aggregate'. The latest restructuring proposals call for loans to be categorised as convertible or non-convertible debt. At the end of the five-year standstill period, convertible debtholders would have the option of exchanging their claims into common shares, The company also promised to draw up annual 12-month and 24-month business plans to be approved by an operating committee representing the creditors. It proposed liquidating marketable securities on an orderly basis, except for certain core holdings, including its stakes in Gulf Canada Resources, newsprint maker Abitibi-Price, and property developer Trizec. O&amp;Y said yesterday it was selling its 50 per cent stake in a 12-storey office building under construction in Budapest as the head office of Hungarian Credit Bank. O&amp;Y expects to remain as manager of the project, but the buyer, Budapest Financial Centre, will take over its obligation to invest CDollars 12.5m in the project. Meanwhile, O&amp;Y's information officer filed his first monthly report on the ailing developer's financial condition yesterday and promised monthly briefings to the company's far-flung creditors. The reports stem from creditors' efforts to obtain more detailed information since O&amp;Y filed for bankruptcy protection for its Canadian assets on May 14. O&amp;Y handed control of the Canary Wharf project in London's Docklands to administrators two weeks later, but its US buildings remain outside the court orders. The court order covers about two-thirds of O&amp;Y's CDollars 13.5bn debt.</p>

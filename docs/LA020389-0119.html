			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MONITOR  </P> <P> I was interested in a Times column that offered one writer's view of  discussions surrounding the Christian Science Monitor -- and her effort to  express a concern and care for the paper ("A World Newspaper Falls on Parochial  Bottom-Lines," by Cynthia Parsons, Opinion, Jan. 15). But the viewpoint she put  forward left in its wake several mistaken notions about our church.  </P> <P> Christian Scientists certainly don't feel they lead "a life of compromise with  the world." Far from it! With a noticeable amount of vigor they are bringing a  full and vital life of spirituality to the world.  </P> <P> Also the writer protests that the church directors and trustees are  "politically ultraconservative" and merely "bureaucrats" who have never "read  and loved the paper." Sometimes we all hastily say things that, on reflection,  we would say differently. Actually, these are individuals who have committed  their lives to the church's ministry of spiritual healing and are serving in  their posts for the very reason that they have loved the Monitor and every  other activity of the church.  </P> <P> I've observed with interest the forebearance and patience expressed by church  officers as critics have their day in the press. In the long run I'm sure  everyone will agree that Christian qualities expressed by all people who love  the Monitor will best contribute to helping fulfill its mission to "injure no  man, but to bless all mankind."  </P> <P> NATHAN A.

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (1): Seoul tries to throw open the doors - South Korea is striving to overcome its legacy of isolationism and to push for economic liberalisation. But it is a hard struggle In his second year in office, President Kim Young-sam is struggling against South Korea's traditional isolationist attitude toward the outside world. He is trying to open his country's economy to full international competition for the first time in its history. But bureaucratic resistance and public doubts about the benefits of increased foreign economic influence on Korea could undermine Mr Kim's latest crusade to 'internationalise' the country, which follows his successful political reform programme last year. Moreover, the campaign for domestic economic reforms has been overshadowed in recent weeks by the North Korean nuclear dispute, whose origins lie in the xenophobic nationalist doctrine preached by Pyongyang. The challenges confronting Mr Kim reflect the fact that Korea has never completely escaped from the legacy of the Hermit Kingdom, when the country went into self-imposed isolation almost 400 years ago in response to repeated invasions by the Japanese and Manchus. It was one of the last countries in the world to establish contacts with the west in the late 19th century. Subsequent colonial exploitation by Japan during the first half of this century re-enforced a defensive mentality among Koreans that still exists today. The clearest example of this can be seen in North Korea, which has adopted juche (self-reliance) as its guiding principle. But the Korean peninsula's tragic history has also produced considerable psychological resistance in South Korea to accepting the full rigours of the modern global trading system in spite of the considerable benefits that the country has reaped from it. One recent survey found that almost half of South Koreans opposed direct foreign investment in the country, while two-thirds were against the lowering of trade barriers. But Mr Kim has tried to turn the historical record to his advantage in persuading Koreans to accept foreign competition. 'A century ago, we failed to internationalise on our initiative and were thus forced by others to open up our country. This was why Korea remained backward, soon to be reduced to a colony of a foreign power (Japan),' said Mr Kim in a speech on the first anniversary of his inauguration in February. 'We must learn the lessons of history. Instead of deploring the fact that our doors are unlocking, we should ourselves throw open our doors and march out into the wider world,' he urged. Several opportune factors support Mr Kim's push for economic liberalisation. The economy is once again booming after two years of the slowest growth since 1980. The GNP growth rate is expected to exceed 7 per cent this year as exports increase due to a weak Korean won and industrial invest- ments grow in response of overseas demand. Labour disputes, which have disrupted industrial production in the past several years, are on the wane as living standards rapidly improve. Wage negotiations are being settled at an unprecedented rate this year, although troubles may still lurk in the car and shipbuilding sectors, two of Korea's main export industries. Mr Kim and his Democratic Liberal party enjoy a solid political position with a secure parliamentary majority. The opposition is in disarray, with the Democratic party failing to reinvigorate itself under the somewhat hapless leadership of Mr Li Ki-taek. The president does not have to worry about immediate electoral considerations since the next parliamentary elections will not occur until 1996, one year before his mandatory single term ends. This should give the Kim administration enough time to lay the foundation for its economic reforms and make South Korea eligible to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development by its desired deadline of 1996. The government wants to reduce strong state intervention in the economy. The myriad barriers to foreign investment and goods are gradually being lowered as Korea seeks technology and capital from abroad to improve its global performance. Korea neglected research and development as it concentrated on building an impressive industrial base. The country consequently needs foreign technology if it is to achieve its goal of becoming an advanced industrial power. It is now actively seeking foreign partners as it builds high-speed rail systems, advanced telecommunications networks and an indigenous defence industry. Korea is also overhauling its antiquated and tightly regulated financial system that has created distortions in economic development, particularly at the expense of small businesses, and prevented large industrial concerns from obtaining cheaper credit abroad. The government argues that the reforms will make the economy more efficient as it switches from governance by bureaucrats to market forces. Foreign competition in the home market will help to improve the performance of the large conglomerates, or chaebols, as they increase their operations abroad. It has even used the 'Visit Korea 1994' campaign primarily as a means to encourage Koreans to accept internationalisation by playing host to foreign visitors. But Mr Kim is already discovering that he lacks the public support for trade liberalisation that he enjoyed on political reforms. Public attention has focused on the immediate disruptive impact of the changes. Farmers have protested about the decline of the agricultural industry caused by the opening of their protected market under the Uruguay Round of Gatt. Labour-intensive industries as well as the service and financial sectors are also ill-prepared for foreign competition. Public opposition, encouraged by bureaucrats afraid of losing power, remains a potential obstacle to the successful introduction of the reforms. But an even bigger threat is now emerging with the North Korean nuclear dispute, which could eventually throw the economic liberalisation programme off course. A military conflict, though still unlikely, would obviously force the government to re-orient its priorities. A possible economic collapse of North Korea, caused by stiff international sanctions, might also force the government to scale back the reforms as it concentrates the country's economic resources on reconstructing a post-communist North Korea. Even if these two worst-case scenarios do not occur, the nuclear dispute is creating suspicions among some South Koreans that the looming crisis is the result of international meddling, primarily by the US, on the Korean peninsula. That is likely to increase public scepticism about the government's calls for internationalisation.</p>

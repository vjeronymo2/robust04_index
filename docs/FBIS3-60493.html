			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Victoria Macdonald, Health Correspondent: </F> "Health Targets Have Failed Says Bottomley"]    [Text] Virginia Bottomley, the Health Secretary, will admit  tomorrow that the Government's Health of the Nation strategy is  failing to have any effect on three of its key targets.    Releasing the first year's progress report, Mrs Bottomley  will acknowledge the target figures have either increased or  remained the same for suicides, obesity, and teenage smoking.    Health of the Nation aims to reduce the overall suicide rate  by at least 15 per cent and the suicide rate of the severely  mentally ill by 33 per cent by the year 2000. Instead there has  been an overall increase from 1989-91 to 1990-92 of 0.9 per cent.    The target for obesity is a six per cent reduction in the  number of men who are seriously overweight and an eight per cent  reduction among women by 2005. In men, obesity numbers have  nearly doubled from eight per cent to 13 per cent and in women  from 12 per cent to 15 per cent since 1986.    There has been no movement in the aim to reduce the  prevalence of smoking among 11 to 15 year olds by at least 33  per cent by 1994.    Mrs Bottomley said that overall, there had been "impressive  progress" in establishing the strategy's foundations. "This is  not a coercive, nannying approach. It is to enlist the willing  co-operation of the public."    But of particular concern to the Health Secretary are the  suicide figures, which she said account for one in 100 deaths,  more than for road traffic accidents.    "Think of the effort we put into the Christmas drink driving  campaign to reduce avoidable deaths on the road," Mrs Bottomley  said.    "It gives some measure of the energy in turn to put into  combating suicide."    To turn the figures around, the Health Department is  spending  &pound;1 million on a public information campaign and working  with  GPs to improve their ability to identify mental illness.    It is thought that as many as 40 per cent of those who take  their lives had contacted their GPs within the week before they  died. It is also estimated that 89 million working days are lost  each year on mental illness.    "In 1979 we lost 29 million days on industrial action and as  a nation we decided this was outrageous," Mrs Bottomley said.    Dr Kenneth Calman, the Government's senior medical officer,  said that suicide was a complex issue but was a good marker for  mental illness as a whole. He also said it was preventable if  people could be helped through their "bad patch," but that it  was important to look at the accessibility to the means, such as  guns or drugs.    But Dr Colin Brewer, a psychiatrist who has studied suicide  patterns, was dismissive of the Government's efforts and said  pamphlets would have little effect. Instead, Dr Brewer suggested  changes in prescribing habits away from toxic antidepressants to  newer drugs that do not kill people in overdose.</p>

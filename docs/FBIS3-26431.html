The projects are mainly in the transportation,  telecommunications, energy, water conservancy and raw material  production sectors, according to officials of the provincial  office for the construction of key projects.    The projects include an expressway between Chengdu and  Chongqing, the second-phase construction of a digital  telecommunications network, the Tongjiezi Hydropower Station,  the second-phase construction of the Panzhihua Iron and Steel  Company, the Longchang-Luzhou railway line, a chemical  fertilizer plant, a chemical plant and a cement plant.    The Sichuan section of an optical fiber telecommunications  cable line between Xian, capital of Shaanxi Province in  northwest China, and Chengdu, capital of Sichuan, have been  completed.    For a long time the backward infrastructure had hampered  this  inland province's economic development.    Last year Sichuan invested nearly nine billion yuan (over  one  billion U.S. dollars) in the construction of 60 construction  projects -- both figures setting records for the province.    The responsibility system has been used for the construction  of some projects, as a reform measure, to ensure quality and  progress of construction, production, management and repayment  of loans.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Russian central bank chairman steps down MR Georgy Matiukhin, chairman of the Russian central bank, resigned yesterday after it became clear he had lost the support of both government and parliament. The departure of Mr Matiukhin, who was criticised by the increasingly powerful industrial lobby for his tight rein on credit, came as the Russian parliament voted to cut VAT, the main source of government revenue. The rate will come down from 28 per cent to 20 per cent from January 1, and to 15 per cent immediately on some 'socially necessary' goods, mainly basic foodstuffs. Parliament also began amending the government's budget, agreeing a huge list of costed and costly changes which early yesterday evening amounted to a rise in the projected deficit to Rbs1.5 trillion, with more to come. The effect of the developments is further to weaken the government's hold over the budget deficit and rapidly-growing credits to industry. The VAT decision was a compromise with the government which wanted no cut. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, warned that other taxes would have to rise. Mr Matiukhin's most likely replacement, according to officials in the government and parliament yesterday, is Mr Victor Gerashchenko, former chairman of the Soviet Central Bank, Gosbank. Mr Gerashchenko was on a shortlist for the job in June when Mr Matiukhin's previous request to resign was turned down narrowly by the Russian parliament, and now seems to have emerged as the front runner. If Mr Gerashchenko succeeds to what is the hottest central bank chair in the world, it will for a man who was himself dismissed from his Gosbank post, after the August coup, by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, for alleged complicity. He has been criticised by Russian radicals for alleged complicity in concealing Communist Party funds and in propping up the old regime. The end of Mr Matiukhin must be seen as a further victory for the industrialists' lobby, who have a strong showing in the cabinet. In the end the government withdrew support and let him fall, with only 15 deputies voting against accepting his resignation to 154 for. Mr Konstantin Borovoi, president of the new Party of Economic Freedom and a leading Russian businessmen, said yesterday that the holding of people, often on sentences of 15 years or more for behaviour considered normal in market economies, was 'absurd' when Russia was attempting to attract foreign partners, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. Some 127,000 people convicted of 'economic crimes,' many of which are no longer classified as illegal, are being held in prisons in the former Soviet Union. In some cases, people are still being sentenced under extant Soviet-period legislation for 'speculation' (selling) and other 'crimes.' Mr Vladimir Bukovsky, a Russian dissident himself imprisoned then exiled in the seventies, said 'there are some people in jail for real crimes, and we would not defend them. But most are in jail for buying and selling, or for changing money.'</p>

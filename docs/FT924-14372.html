			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / US queries Japanese computer decision THE Japanese government fears that US criticism of the country's supercomputer procurement methods will lead to Japan becoming a target of trade anger during the final weeks of the US election campaign. The two countries signed a supercomputer pact in 1990 that was supposed to end almost a decade of disagreement over Japanese government procurement practices. The Bush administration had seen the agreement as an important achievement for its trade strategy with Japan. However, a decision by Japan's education ministry to award a supercomputer contract to NEC, the Japanese electronics company, over the US maker Cray Research, and a further decision by a government procurement review board to uphold that award have created new friction between Japan and the US. Mr John Rollwagen, chairman of Cray, who is visiting Tokyo, said yesterday he was disappointed by the panel's decision, but was unsure what further redress his company would have in Japan. Meanwhile, Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, has asked her department to study the review board's finding, and said she has 'serious concerns' about the decision, which is the first handed down by the newly-established panel. 'The review board process is an important test of the Japanese government's resolve to fully implement the provisions of the 1990 supercomputer agreement. We therefore want to review its report and scrutinise carefully the steps taken to reach this decision,' Mrs Hills said. The supercomputer in dispute was ordered by the ministry's institute for fusion sciences, and Cray alleged that the institute fashioned the specifications to suit NEC and leaked information to the company. NEC denies this. Mr Rollwagen claimed yesterday that his company's supercomputer was superior to the NEC product, and that under normal bidding conditions, should have been selected by the institute.</p>

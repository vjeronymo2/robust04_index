Kruglov, prosecutor of Administration </F> for Supervision of Implementation of Laws on Federal Security  and Interethnic Relations of Russian General Prosecutor's  Office, by Sergey Kaverin; place and date not given: "Mr.  Zhirinovskiy Might Be Arrested"]    [Text] While V. Zhirinovskiy, Russia's chief liberal, was  traveling around Europe making fiery speeches and generous  promises, the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office was  actively drawing up a criminal case against him. V. Kruglov,  prosecutor of the Administration for Supervision of  Implementation of Laws on Federal Security and Interethnic  Relations of the Russian General Prosecutor's Office, gives the  details on this topic.    [Kaverin] Viktor Alekseyevich, does it not seem to you that  the institution of criminal proceedings against Zhirinovskiy is  a kind of act of vengeance by the pro-government forces which  lost to him?    [Kruglov] Certainly not. Interestingly, our administration  and I personally tackled Zhirinovskiy quite a long time ago, but  Vladimir Volfovich committed his main "transgressions" precisely  on the eve of the elections. The grounds for instituting  criminal proceedings were provided by such points as the  arbitration tribunal's well-known 10 December decision and the  incident which occurred between Zhirinovskiy and Gdlyan in the  Kremlin Palace of Congresses on the night of 12-13 December.  The latest episode was the book The Last Dash to the  South, published by Zhirinovskiy. All these facts were  examined by us as a package, and on their basis criminal  proceedings were instituted under Article 71 of the Russian  Federation Criminal Code -- "war propaganda." The decision to  institute criminal proceedings was adopted at the level of the  leadership of the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office.    [Kaverin] What steps will be taken in respect of  Zhirinovskiy after his return from abroad?    [Kruglov] First of all, the general prosecutor must decide  who will investigate the criminal case which has been instituted  and appoint the specific investigator and subdepartment. Then  this subdepartment will begin directly conducting the  investigation, naturally resolving the questions that arise  within the framework of the law. The mechanism for conducting  such an investigation is known: summonses, interrogations. The  investigation will be conducted in full as an investigation into  an ordinary criminal case.    [Kaverin] As far as I know, this is something new in  jurisdiction relating to relations between law-enforcement  organs and deputies, is it not?    [Kruglov] Yes, it is. In accordance with the new Russian  Federation Constitution, the status of a Russian Federation  State Duma deputy is no obstacle to the institution and  investigation of a criminal case. The Constitution stipulates  perfectly unequivocally and clearly that the State Duma's  consent is required only for the arrest of a deputy, his search,  and (or) his detention. I repeat: arrest, search, and  detention. That is, a criminal case in respect of a deputy is  instituted and investigated on generally applicable grounds; and  with regard to the investigation, if grounds arise for a search,  detention, or arrest, the general prosecutor petitions the State  Duma for a particular deputy to be stripped of his immunity on  the grounds of the investigation results submitted. I will  remind you that previously, in accordance with the Constitution  in force then, the Supreme Soviet had to ask permission to  actually institute criminal proceedings against a deputy.    [Kaverin] What threatens Zhirinovskiy in accordance with  the new Constitution and the laws if he does not answer the  summons? Knowing Vladimir Volfovich, it is not hard to imagine  the reality of such a development of events.    [Kruglov] At present Zhirinovskiy is formally considered a  witness and is obliged by law to appear in order to testify.  Juridically he is considered a witness until the moment he is  charged. Therefore at first he will be summoned precisely as a  witness. If he does not come, the investigator will be forced  to react. How? In the event of a failure to appear without  valid reason, an ordinary citizen is threatened with arrest  [privod], which is carried out by militia organs. But this is  an element of coercion and therefore can be qualified  essentially as detention -- one of the three points (!) on which  a deputy enjoys immunity.    [Kaverin] You end up with a vicious circle: In order to  arrest a deputy who is at fault, weighty grounds and,  consequently, the State Duma's "go-ahead" are needed. In order  to secure this "go-ahead," the Duma needs facts which the  investigation cannot obtain from the "undisciplined" deputy....    [Kruglov] This is partly true. But take into account the  fact that any criminal case is built not only on the testimony  alone of the person under investigation. There must also be  some other studies, materials, witnesses' testimonies, and data  from expert appraisals. In principle, therefore, a sufficient  quantity of proof can be gathered against an "evasive deputy" to  charge him even without his "participation." I wish to repeat  once again that all the aforesaid is of a purely theoretical  nature, and specific questions in respect of a specific accused  will be decided by the investigator who, according to the law,  investigates this case and independently adopts decisions.    [Kaverin] Viktor Alekseyevich, how long, in your opinion,  will this investigation last?    [Kruglov] I do not know. This is a complex question. It  depends on a huge number of circumstances.</p>

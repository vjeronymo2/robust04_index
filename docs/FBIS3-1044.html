Speaking in Ulundi at a luncheon after the opening of the  kwaZulu Legislative Assembly, King Zwelithini said it was  "foolishness" to believe there could be a free and fair election  in kwaZulu "when the election is being foisted on people without  their approval". "If anyone believes that the vast majority of  blacks in the kwaZulu/Natal region want an election, they can  only be right to the extent that those people have not heard  their king and their traditional prime minister (Mangosuthu  Buthelezi) say `no' to their participation in the election."    The Zulu monarch said he had never attempted to dissuade any  Zulu from belonging to the political party of their choice.  However, if he called an imbizo (traditional gathering) at  which Zulus heard him admonish parties which approved the  interim constitution, "they will not vote in the elections".  "The word will spread rapidly that this election is death to  `Zulu-ness' and that it must be resisted at all costs."    He added that Zulu nationalism, irrespective of party  politics, would gather in strength through "rolling Zulu mass  action".    Although stopping short of calling for a poll boycott the  king said: "I will not encourage my people to enter the  elections, enter the polling booths, and destroy the kingdom."    On his demands for a sovereign monarchy, King Zwelithini  expressed his frustration at "tedious discussions, as though the  South African Government had some kind of proprietary right to  the soul of the Zulu people".    The king insisted his demands be dealt with immediately,  saying he was not prepared to leave the future of the Zulu  kingdom in the hands of a nationally-elected government. "The  present constitution is totally unacceptable to me," he  repeated, saying it would lead to the demise of the Zulu nation.    He commended Mr Buthelezi's initiative on international  mediation in the constitutional impasse, but added: "As far as  I am concerned, mediation must be pinned to the question of  entry into elections."</p>

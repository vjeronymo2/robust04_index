			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with MSI Youth Front member Alessandro Ambrosini </F> by CORRIERE DELLA SERA correspondent Massimo Nava; place and  date not given: "We Are Different From the Germans: Salo Is  Present in Our Ideals"]    [Text] Vicenza--He had joined the Youth Front--the youth  organization of Fini's party--only six months before and had  convinced some of his "comrades" to join the National Alliance.  "It was a tactical conversion, for the purpose of pressing  forward with our struggles and our values," explains Alessandro  Ambrosini, 22, a political science student at the University of  Padua, who wears his beard and hair in the style of Che Guevara  despite his "Naziskin" past and his predilection for Roman  salutes, which he says "are for us what the clenched fist is for  the Left."    He was welcomed with open arms, among other things because  the Front in only a few weeks "reached 150 members" and because  these young men with their "testicles of marble" had made a  noteworthy contribution to the MSI [Italian Socialist Movement]  election campaign in Vicenza with their frenzied activism, which  consisted of composing handwritten manifestoes at night and  devoting entire days to distributing fliers door to door.    Alessandro Ambrosini in this way obtained his stripes as  secretary of the Youth Front and also the esteem of the party's  top leadership, in addition to a provincial notoriety as an  artist, because Alessandro and his friends--with their "Black  Rats" rock group--were preparing for the Sanremo festival.    But his heart yearned for the surroundings that he had  frequented ever since his teenage years, and for the Naziskins,  with whom "you get together on Saturday night, at the  discotheque or the beer hall." And the rallies in Vicenza--with  the Roman salutes and the swastikas--held an irrestible  attraction for Alessandro. He preferred street demonstrations to  a career in the party.    They had warned him in the federation, but he went there  anyway in the company of his friend Piero Puschiavo, the  acknowledged head of the Vicenza Naziskins. "It is a friendship  that I am not going to repudiate. Piero is a valiant fellow--a  working man, not the head of a gang. They have constructed a  myth in an effort to discredit him."    Puschiavo's parents are of the same opinion, and greet with  insults and threats any journalists who approach their little  house in Gambellara. Piero does not talk to the press and has  made only one telephone call to IL GIORNALE DI VICENZA: "My  fellow residents of Vicenza," he said, "need not worry. We are  not going to organize new street demonstrations. The autonomists  are allowed to hold them, so why aren't we? We certainly did not  want to cause all this uproar."    [Ambrosini] I have marched with my comrades to demand  justice. I am participating personally, as a gesture of  solidarity in opposition to the attacks by the autonomists,  which have gone unpunished. I have had to resign from the party,  in anticipation of my expulsion, but I repudiate nothing.  Certain values must be defended.    [Nava] Even racial hatred, Mussolini, Hitler, and Hess?    [Ambrosini] The Italian Naziskins are different from the  German ones. We oppose violence against immigrants; we are  fighting to save our European culture. That is different. The  Naziskins are not empty heads, as Fini says. We are also putting  some good ideas into practice.    [Nava] Such as?    [Ambrosini] Such as the fight against drugs and crime; the  campaign against homosexual marriages; and a reassessment of the  Republic of Salo, not as a historical event that cannot be  repeated but as a set of ideals, of universal values. The  fascist style, let us say.    [Nava] And also the denial of the Holocaust.    [Ambrosini] I have read Irwin, but I do not agree with him.  It is not possible to deny the Holocaust. Nor do I agree with  anti-Semitism. My friend Puschiavo is of the same opinion.    [Nava] Fortunately. From what you say, however, the National  Alliance is a little too confining for you.    [Ambrosini] We underwent a conversion; we were won over to a  softer [preceding word in English] language. We understood  Fini's tactics--which have indeed been successful--but I cannot  agree with the content of the new policy line. The values of the  Social Movement have been betrayed. Fortunately, Gianfranco Fini  has at least remembered to say that Mussolini was the greatest  statesman of the century. It has all been heard before, however.  I will not be able to reenter the party.    [Nava] But they had warned you.    [Ambrosini] To be sure. We had spoken with the provincial  secretary on Friday evening, but my feelings got the better of  me. I even went to the Blues Bar [preceding two words in  English] (the meeting place of the Naziskins--CORRIERE DELLA  SERA editor's note) which the autonomists have destroyed. I even  received threatening phone calls and found my name on walls in  Vicenza, but the autonomists remained unpunished. There had to  be a response; we had to make our voice heard. Do we not live in  a democracy?</p>

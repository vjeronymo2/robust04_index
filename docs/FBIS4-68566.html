			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Yusifova: "Banks Have Been Audited"] </F>   [Text] The Main Administration for Banking Control of the  National Bank of Azerbaijan audited 31 commercial and joint  stock-commercial banks in the first quarter of 1994.    The audits revealed the following shortcomings: To this day  a  large amount of indebtedness on loans remains at many commercial  banks; unlawful increases in banks' statutory fund, failure of  some joint-stock banks to issue stock, absence of registrations  by the Ministry of Finance of the republic, violations of the  quota of cash holdings, provision of cash services to customers  without permission from the National Bank, violations of rules  in the process of accepting customer documents, violations of  the economic standards of banks, failure to meet compulsory  reserve requirements, and deficiencies in opening accounts have  occurred.    For the most part the absence of letters of guarantee from  enterprises which are indebted to the banks, guarantees of  security for personal property, and other credit guarantees, as  well as the absence of control over the use of the credit issued  were the reasons for the violations.    Besides, it was noted that the founders of the Naftabank  commercial bank have contributed to the statutory fund 460,000  manats out of the funds issued to them as a loan. Five other  commercial banks have violated the percentage ratio for  contributing monies to the statutory fund (it should be no  greater than 12 percent). Some banks were not adequately  equipped with security devices. Seventeen banks were fined  11.049 million manats for failing to comply with compulsory  reserve requirements. In 728 cases, enterprises did not have  certificates of registration with the tax inspectorate. Some 178  enterprises and organizations have not been registered by the  Ministry of Justice.</p>

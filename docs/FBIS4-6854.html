			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Vice Finance Minister Jiro  Saito urged Japan's yet-unformed government Monday to enact a  fiscal 1994 budget quickly and called for cooperation to  stabilize currency rates. Asked what he hopes to see from the  government that new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was to form  later in the evening, Saito told a regular news conference he  would first put priority on the long- delayed budget.    The government of Morihiro Hosokawa was unable to start Diet  deliberations on the budget for the fiscal year that started  this month, as parliamentary business snagged on the personal  financial dealings that toppled Hosokawa.    "It would be nice to see the budget enacted as soon as  possible," Saito said. He also noted that a meeting of finance  leaders from seven major industrial nations Sunday reconfirmed a  Group of Seven (G-7) commitment to exchange rates that reflect  economic fundamentals and to avoiding "excessive" fluctuations.    In the future, Saito said, he hopes the G-7 will "cooperate  to stabilize the foreign exchange market."</p>

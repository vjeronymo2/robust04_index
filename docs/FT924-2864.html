			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pirelli warns of further loss due to recession PIRELLI, the Italian tyres and cables group, warned that it faced a further loss this year, before extraordinary items, owing to economic recession and continuing difficulties in its two main activities. The warning came after an agreement last Saturday with government ministers and unions covering almost 1,000 job losses at two tyre plants. The company had previously cited delays in pushing through the redundancies as a major obstacle to restored profits. Substantial closures and job losses have already taken place at some of its foreign operations. Pirelli made a net profit of L77bn (Dollars 56.2bn) in the first half of this year after losing L105bn in the same period in 1991. However, it stressed the 1992 figures were not directly comparable owing to accounting and consolidation changes. The precise outcome for 1992 will depend on how much Pirelli realises from the continuing disposals in its diversified products division, some of which have already been sold. The company said extraordinary items would be positive, but their size depended on the outcome of talks on further disposals.</p>

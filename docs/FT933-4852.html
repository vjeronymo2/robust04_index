			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / People: Five Oaks Investments Tom Frost has lost no time in snapping up his first non-executive directorships since retiring as deputy chairman of National Westminster Bank. Last week he joined ICCH and The London Clearing House, the clearing house for Liffe, IPE, LCE and LME. Now he has joined the board of Five Oaks Investments, a property company. Five Oaks says it had decided to appoint a third non-executive director to comply with the Cadbury report. It plans to embark on a period of expansion to take advantage of the upturn in the property cycle. Last month, Five Oaks Investments raised Pounds 12.2m in a placing and open offer, which has given it the scope to spend Pounds 15m on acquisitions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Chun-pom] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that North Korea has succeeded  in developing the Nodong-1 and Nodong-2 missiles, which have a  firing range of more than 1,000 km, and that it has recently  assembly-line produced Russian ultramodern MiG-29 jets. Thus,  attention is focused on the ROK's counter strategy and on the  balance of North- South forces.    Remarkable progress in U.S.-North Korean negotiations over  nuclear issues has not been made and the United States is  reviewing sanctions against North Korea. This causes the people  to worry that a war may break out once again on the Korean  peninsula.    It is clear that if a war breaks out on the Korean  peninsula,  the first offensive and defensive battle between the North and  the South will be a air battle [kongjungjon].    Comparison of the North and South Air Force reveals that the  South has 520 tactical planes [chonsulgi] and the North has 850  tactical planes; the South has 190 support planes [chiwongi] and  the North has 480 support planes; and the South has 600  helicopters and the North has 290 helicopters. Thus, North  Korea has approximately 320 [number as published] more planes  than South Korea.    The ROK plans to introduce and produce F-16 jets. It has  been learned that North Korea has decided to introduce or  produce 100 MiG-29's from Russia and that it has already  introduced 14 MiG-29 jets.    It is estimated the F-16 jets and MiG-29 jets rate the same  in performance standards -- mobility, weapons-loading capacity,  and radius of action.    The superiority of the F-16 and MiG-29 jets will be  determined by the ultramodern electronic equipment loaded in  both jets and by the ability of its pilots.    Both the South and the North are competing to introduce  ultramodern fighters. Regarding the comparative strength of the  North and South Air Force at the Military Demarcation Line,  North Korea will, for the time being, maintain its superiority  over South Korea.    It is true the ROK is numerically inferior to North Korea  when considering the fighting power of North and South.    Regardless of the quantitative comparison, the U.S. Air  Force  has pride in the strength of its air supremacy in the ROK.  Comparison of the index number [chollyok chisu] of fighting  power -- one rifle equals one index number -- reveals the ROK's  index number is 4.5, thus being superior to that of North Korea  by approximately 1.5.    Of course, the figures do not reflect intangible fighting  power, such as pilots' ability and morale. The ability of ROK  pilots has been estimated as greatly superior to that of North  Korean pilots.    Regarding the level of training and ability of South and  North Korean pilots, average flying hours of an Air Force  lieutenant colonel of South Korea is approximately 2,500 hours,  that of a North Korean is approximately one-third that amount.    Therefore, our Air Force has the confidence that "it will be  a competent match" in the event of an air war between the South  and North.    North Korea possesses more than 470 aircraft, including the  Russian-made fighter MiG-19/21 and SU-7/25, as its mainstay  aircraft. The ROK has the F-4/E as its mainstay aircraft and  the existing air firepower will be reinforced with F-16's at the  end of this year. It is difficult to discriminate between the  fighting power of North Korea's MiG and ROK's Chekong because  they are almost the same.    It has been learned that in the event a war breaks out on  the  Korean peninsula, the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces will apply the  following five-step scenario according to the existing combined  defense strategy of "Operational Plan 5027:"    One, (Pre-war), the U.S. Rapid Deployment Forces will be  deployed to the Korean peninsula to deter a war; if a war breaks  out;    Two (Rejection), the southward invasion will be blocked  along the current front and strategic facilities at North  Korea's rear will be destroyed;    Three (Annihilation), major North Korean combat  capabilities will be annihilated and large-scale landing  operations will be conducted while breaking through battle lines  to advance northward;    Four (Isolation), Pyongyang will be isolated and occupied  areas in North Korea will be placed under military rule;    Five (Post-war), the reunification of the Korean peninsula  will be achieved with the ROK's initiative.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The cask vendor can apply to the NRC for a change to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cask certificate and SAR after the final rule is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The vendor must propose the generic revisions to the certificate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and SAR and request NRC review of the proposed revision. The NRC will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate the proposed revision in an SER, and if appropriate, prepare a draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised Certificate of Compliance. These documents would then be placed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NRC Public Document Room and a proposed rule would be published requesting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comments on the proposed revised Certificate of Compliance. After  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of public comments (and assuming an appropriate basis exists), a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule would be published incorporating the revision in the revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certificate of Compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SAR (CSAR) is not necessarily generic for all United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating reactor sites as the comment appears to suggest. The SAR is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertinent for those sites that have parameters that are incorporated by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cask design bases analyzed in the SAR. From a practical standpoint, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult for a cask vendor to foresee all possible combinations of seismic,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control component, distance, changes in length and weight, changes in transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices, etc. Revisions are expected when the vendor submits its initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application for approval. The vendor is responsible for the certified cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> L.3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter wanted an explanation for not allowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> buyer substitution of material for a Certificate of Compliance and that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> references should be deleted from fabrication specifications and drawings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Does this mean that no changes in any materials are allowed once the design is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified? If so, explain this in reference to new models of the VSC&hyph;24 as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> far as materials, coatings, etc.?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under 10 CFR Part 72, the licensee is permitted to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in the ISFSI as described in the SAR provided the changes do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve an unreviewed safety question. The licensee and cask certificate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holder must have a quality assurance (QA) program that provides control over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities affecting quality of the identified structures, systems, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components to an extent commensurate with the importance to safety and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure conformance with the approved design. The NRC does not want buyers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (who may not be the licensee or certificate holder) of cask materials to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatically be able to substitute material without the necessary safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluations. Rather, the licensee, through the cask certificate holder, has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ultimate responsibility for approving any changes to ensure conformance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the approved design. For structures, systems, and components identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as important to safety, if alternative materials are desired to be used and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those specific materials form the basis of the safety evaluation, it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to identify those materials in the cask application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, the certificate holder may seek an amendment to the SAR and, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary, a change to the Certificate of Compliance. For other structures,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems, or components that are needed for the design to be used or are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise prudent, but do not perform a safety function and were not relied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon in the basis for design approval, appropriate changes may be permitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided the licensee and the Certificate of Compliance holder document the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate evaluations and use their quality assurance programs to implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the change. New models of the VSC&hyph;24 casks are not the subject of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> L.4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter questioned how the draft Environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact would remain valid if changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to cask design and procedures can be made. Tests or experiments could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted under draft Certificate of Compliance Item No. 9 (see also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR 72.48) leading to the use of a cask that does not meet the conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in the Certificate of Compliance. These changes may adversely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact site-specific public health, safety, and the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Given the limiting criteria of 10 CFR 72.48, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unlikely that any change would materially change the environmental analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee's authority under 10 CFR 72.48 does not permit any changes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve unresolved safety issues, changes to the conditions for cask use in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Certificate of Compliance, significant increase in occupational exposure,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or significant environmental impact. In the Environmental Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting this rulemaking to approve the Standardized NUHOMS, the NRC staff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated various types of accidents that could happen to the ISFSI facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff's evaluation encompassed design basis accidents and concluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no radioactive material will be released to the environment. The NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> staff also evaluated a worst-case accident and found that the environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact is insignificant. Therefore, it is unlikely that the potential impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from changes to cask design or tests or experiments under the control of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee would introduce new environmental considerations or impacts that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differ from or exceed those as analyzed in the Environmental Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changes in environmental impacts, as a result of changes to the cask design or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, must be evaluated by the licensee. The licensee's evaluations are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for inspection by the NRC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

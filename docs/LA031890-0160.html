			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT / EAST REGIONAL;  </P> <P> DUKE LOOKING FOR TRADITIONAL VICTORY OVER ST. JOHN'S TODAY  </P> <P> Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski, fresh off a milestone 300th coaching victory,  talked of tradition in schoolboy tones.  </P> <P> Fifteenth-ranked Duke (25-8) against St. John's (24-9), and UCLA (21-10)  against fifth-ranked Kansas (30-4).  </P> <P> Thirty-one Final Four appearances represented today in the East Regional in  Atlanta.  </P> <P> "It sends chills through you as far as tradition goes," Krzyzewski said  Saturday. "I think it will be a special afternoon. We're proud to be a part of  it."  </P> <P> St. John's Coach Lou Carnesecca is more concerned about the here and now.  </P> <P> "I'm a very poor student of history," Carnesecca said. "I don't know if history  has anything to do with this tournament."  </P> <P> He was more concerned with Duke's defense than Duke's tradition. Carnesecca has  his own description of the Blue Devils' pressure defense.  </P> <P> "First, they're in your pocket," he said. "Second, if you try to take out  change, they're in the way. And, if you try to deposit it at the bank, they  meet you at the vault."  </P></p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (18): Things to do and avoid - Trading in China is not for the light-hearted CHINA is a difficult place to do business. It has a lot of idiosyncrasies and doing business here takes a lot of time and effort. That is why to deal in it successfully, it is often not a place for a small company. However, to ignore China can be a serious mistake. For experienced business people there is money to be made here. What follows are some guidelines from veteran China traders and from Peking-based diplomats about how to do business in this complex market. Trips should be well planned. Visas are necessary. Business visas can be obtained from any Chinese embassy, but travellers need a letter of invitation from a Chinese host organisation. For those lacking a Chinese sponsor, some embassies will help their nationals obtain one. Most, however, will not get involved. Yet a business visa is not always necessary. For those who are coming to China for their first or second time, a tourist visa will suffice and is readily obtainable in Hong Kong. Travelling around the country used to be a nightmare for anyone with a fixed schedule. That has begun to change as the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), China's national airline, has gradually computerised its operations. It is now possible to buy round trip tickets to a handful of major cities in China. Interpreters are vital for those who cannot speak Chinese. The Chinese host will always supply an interpreter, but it is better to bring their own to any business meeting. One way to find an interpreter is for the business traveller to ask at his or her country's business trade council in Peking. For British citizens, the China Britain Trade Group in Peking and Shanghai will help at minimal cost. Newcomers to China should be aware of significant cultural differences in the Chinese and Western ways of doing business. Patience, determination and strong financial backing are essential, but equally important is recognition of the fact that the Chinese concept of time differs dramatically from that of the west. Negotiations with the Chinese take time and time is only occasionally important to the Chinese, a western diplomat says. First or even second time business people should not expect to conclude a deal. During the first visit, the businessman needs to obtain from the relevant commercial sections of embassies or from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade (MOFERT) some idea of the official policy towards his product. If the products are in a priority sector that is part of the government's eighth Five-Year Plan, significant opportunities may be developed. However, some products fall in a grey area or are actively discouraged by the government and banned from being imported. There are many ways of blocking imports. China has a complex system of tariff and non-tariff controls to restrict foreign companies' access to its domestic market. Some of the barriers include: import bans; import licenses (which can be denied if domestic alternatives are available, or if the goods are considered incompatible with China's goals); a strict import substitution policy that restricts competition; foreign exchange allocation; testing and certification of foreign products to specifications not applied to domestically-produced goods. Once a businessman has decided to be in the China market, he should remember a few basic rules: never sign a loss leader. The Chinese are tough, organised negotiators who know the real value of any product. don't begin the first sale on the basis of losing money in order to gain access. know your end user's needs well. Rely on multiple channels for information and never use only one source. build a coalition of relationships with people involved in making the decision. For those serious about being in the China market, but who cannot afford to staff it with their own representative, there are various alternatives. China's telecommunication links with the rest of the world have improved dramatically in the last decade, and calling or sending a fax is now simple. But there is no substitute for a good agent in a country where personal relationships are extremely important. Agents provide contacts. Just as selecting an agent is important for those exporting to China, choosing a partner in a joint venture operation is perhaps the single most important decision a foreign company will make. Finding a suitable partner takes time and knowing where to start can be a daunting process, but much depends on the foreigner's line of business and whether the goal is to export or manufacture. Generally, big cities, the coastal provinces, and the south are favourite areas of business for foreign trade. 'Anywhere but Peking, and the farther south you go the better,' a western businessman says. Other points to consider in selecting a partner include the organisation's proximity to raw materials, electrical supply and shipping facilities. Finally, don't let the system wear down your mental and professional faculties, as happened to a French businessman who had been negotiating with the Chinese over a problem for a year and a half. When he believed he had finally resolved the matter and was preparing to board his aircraft for home,the Chinese came to him at the airport, saying another organisation had not agreed to the terms and problems remained. This was too much. The Frenchman was subsequently found running naked around Tiananmen square and was taken out of China in a straitjacket.</p>

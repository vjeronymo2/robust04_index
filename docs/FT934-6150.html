			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Egypt PM escapes Jihad bomb blast Mr Atef Sidki, Egypt's prime minister, yesterday escaped an assassination attempt by Islamic militants after a powerful bomb exploded beside his motorcade near his home in northern Cairo, killing a schoolgirl and injuring at least 18 others. Mr Sidki, 63, was unscathed. Jihad, an extremist Islamic group, immediately claimed responsibility. The bombing was to 'avenge the blood of the martyrs', a reference to Jihad members killed by security forces or sentenced to death in recent trials. The attack is the third failed assassination attempt on an Egyptian minister in eight months. Mr Safwat al-Sherif, information minister, survived a shooting near his home in April, while Mr Hassan al-Alfi, interior minister, was injured when a bomb exploded near his motorcade in central Cairo in mid-August, an attack also claimed by Jihad. Mr Sidki, on TV a few hours after the attack, warned the government would toughen its clampdown on Islamic extremists.</p>

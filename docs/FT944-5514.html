			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / PIA set for clash on training agents The Personal Investment Authority, the private invesment watchdog, is heading for a clash with independent financial advisers over plans which would add about 10 per cent to the cost of ensuring that advisers are properly trained. The proposals would mean that all new sales agents or advisers, together with those who supervise them, would have to pass all three papers of the financial planning certificate or the investment advice certificate unless they advised on only a limited range of products.</p>

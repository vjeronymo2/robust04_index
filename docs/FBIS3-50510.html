			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision  Networks in Spanish at 0130 GMT on 30 December carry a recording  of the 28 December evening session of the National Assembly of  the People's Government [ANPP].    The session is called to order by ANPP President Ricardo  Alarcon de Quesada who asks the deputies to try to be as brief  as possible in their presentations and to avoid repetition.  Alarcon gives the floor to Deputy Zoe de la Cruz who reminds the  deputies that many of the issues discussed earlier were  repetitions of issues discussed at provincial assemblies and  suggests that deputies broach specific rather than overall  issues.    The chair recognizes Pedro Martinez Pirez as the next  speaker. Martinez Pirez begins by saying that "we must all admit  that we are responsible for our people's lack of economic  culture." He continues to speak of the current situation and the  need to adopt measures that will contribute to solving the  country's problems. Martinez Pirez recalls that the media has  been reporting that a "shock policy" would be implemented and  that "thousands would be unemployed as a result of this." The  deputy continues to say that "here in Cuba things are not like  in other countries where policies are not dictated by  governments and parliaments, but by the IMF." Martinez Pirez  concludes his presentation by saying that "this ANPP meeting  should not conclude without some statement on the measures that  should be taken." The deputy stresses that the ANPP should issue  a document suggesting the changes that should be made to "save  the fatherland, save the Revolution, and save the achievements  of socialism."    Castro addresses Ricardo Alarcon: "Alarcon, let us see if we  can also preserve common sense; it would not be such a bad idea.  I want to ask you something: Is adopting measures our goal at  this meeting? Martinez Pirez was talking about a series of  measures, and I do not know if a series of measures was  mentioned in the document. I believe that any hope of adopting  measures prior to the conclusion of this meeting is a bit too  ambitious. We are practically in diapers on these issues with  the material we have presented. On various occasions in the  past, we have at least tried to bring to the attention of our  comrades that our goal was to think out the problems. We wish to  think the problems through. We would really be crazy if we  thought we could adopt measures before the conclusion of this  meeting that would solve all our problems.    "I want to know if everytime something is brought up at this  meeting, whether we can just comment on it, or do we have to  wait until 55 deputies speak before we can clarify issues such  as the ones Martinez Pirez has brought up. He has proposed that  we adopt a series of measures. Do we have to wait until the 56th  deputy speaks before we clarify that this is not the purpose of  this meeting? Do we have to wait until the 56th deputy speaks  before 60 more speak to clarify these issues?"    Ricardo Alarcon says that during the provincial assemblies,  it was made "very clear" that "the purpose of this session was  not to adopt measures, but rather to consider, as a group, what  could be done to solve these problems."    Castro continues: "Someone else talked about the need to  create awareness. I believe that what we are trying to do is  create an awareness. Others have talked about repeating 24  February, but what would be our goals? To have a repeat 24  February, we would need to have an idea of what we want to do.  There is something else I would like to remind you of. I  suggested that these issues be discussed at this meeting. It  would take us three days to adopt measures. All we need to do is  issue another draft bill with four et ceteras. We would have our  group of measures.    "This is a very sensitive issue. This is not  self-employment.  This is something that can affect millions of people. It is of  high political sensitivity. The ANPP can adopt a series of  measures. The day the ANPP adopts a series of measures, it will  say: Ladies and gentlemen, these are the measures we have  adopted. A series of measures do not all have to be adopted at  the same time. We are already adopting measures.    "There is one thing that yields more than any amount of  taxes. Some say we must produce; that is fine, we must produce.  We must produce pants, we must produce textiles. But where is  the cloth we need, where is the cotton we need? We must produce  rum, but where is the molasses? We must produce beer, but where  are the bottles? Where is the barley we need to produce the  beer? We have a great many great ideas. Produce. Yes we must  produce, but we must produce what we can produce. We cannot  produce for the sake of producing.    "I was saying that there is something that yields much more  than anything we have mentioned here. We can eliminate all  subsidies to the sugar industry and agriculture. Doing this  would save us 3 billion [currency not specified]. I believe that  the creation of the Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's]  is one of the good measures. There are others. The Ministry of  the Revolutionary Armed Forces [Minfar] has cut back its budget  by 600 million [currency not specified]. These are measures we  are adopting.    "We must adopt a group of measures. We have not taken the  bull by the horns. We have been discussing the implementation of  a tax system but no one has told us how much we will receive  from those taxes. I believe we all wish to make progress, make  some progress.    "We must bring Jose Luis [Jose Luis Rodriguez Garcia,  minister president of the State Committee for Finance] and  Osvaldito [not further identified] here and interrogate them --  in the positive sense of the word. We want them to help us  clarify some things.    "But the big question is: Do we or do we not seize the  money?  That is a big question for you, select deputies, to answer.  Should we or should we not seize the money? You are talking  about the people hearing rumors. Many people do not know what to  do with the money they have. They do not know whether they  should put it in the bank or dig a 3-meter-deep hole and bury  it. [laughter] Should we implement a policy where the money is  not seized? Should we or should we not change the currency? I  truly would not like to solve that problem here.    "Among other things, some of the measures are very complex.  I  knew this when I suggested that this issue be broached by the  ANPP. I will even add that from the very first day this issue  was brought up at the ANPP, I knew it was going to represent a  problem. I told the comrades at the National Bank to keep very  accurate accounts of what happened, from the very day this  problem was first mentioned. Who had his money in the bank and  who had it buried? There are many people who have [words  indistinct]. We cannot assume that those people who do not keep  their money in the bank have illegal money. There are people in  the habit of keeping their money at home. That is something  else. However, many of the illegal street vendors and those  involved in dirty businesses have money. Many people still  remember the first exchange of money we made. They still  remember how it was done. But that is not the issue.    "Should we or should we not exchange the money? If we do,  then we must be intelligent enough to do it publicly. The last  time we did this, it was a big secret. A tremendous secret. We  had the money printed in Czechoslovakia, brought it secretly  into the country, distributed it, and from one day to another,  the measure was implemented. All measures around the world are  implemented in this manner. This will be the first time a  measure is adopted publicly. But how do we go about doing this?  We must find out. Well, that is one subject we must discuss:  Should we or should we not change it?    "Some deputies have attempted to differentiate between the  thieves' money and the honest people's money. Ah, if only it  were marked so that we could tell the difference. [laughter] How  wonderful that would be. If that were the case, I would  immediately suggest one measure, not a group of measures, but at  least one measure: Gentlemen, remove all the money that is  marked. But money has the same color and shape. We cannot tell  the difference between one bill and another.    "We must decide whether we should or should not seize the  money; whether we should or should not exchange the money. How  to do this. We must discuss this publicly. We must decide what  policy to follow, taking into consideration the fact that we  have two types of money: honest money and the other kind of  money. I wonder if anyone involved in finance keeps an inventory  of the money on the street. This is a decision the ANPP must  make. It must be very well thought out, discussed. What we  should do, one way or another. These are key issues. We have  already heard 17 speeches on this topic. Many of the comrades  have expressed themselves quite well. We cannot deny that.  However, we are just going round and round the problem.    "We have 10 million [currency not specified]. What do we do  with that 10 million? I believe this is a key issue. Martinez  Pirez and other comrades, if we were to begin discussing this,  it would be quite a discussion. It would be a very big  discussion. Let the media say whatever it wants to say. That is  their problem, the foreign press and whatnot. We are not  discussing dishonest matters. We must not be ashamed of what we  are talking about. The most patriotic, brave, healthy, honest  thing is to discuss this. The people will understand this. The  people will understand the problems if we explain it to them  clearly and make them part of our concerns.    "A technocratic approach cannot be used to solve these  problems. We must not think that technical measures will solve  the problems. We must not forget that in this country, honor,  patriotism, the sense of dignity and duty of the worker is  expressed. We encourage the worker to express himself. If we did  not, no problem could be solved. If tomorrow we were to decide  to take all the money out of circulation, it would not mean that  on the day after tomorrow, all the workers would show up for  work. If everyone were to show up for work the day after  tomorrow, we would not have enough room for them in our  factories. The workers do not have raw materials, electricity,  responsibilities, or workshops. Ours is a complex situation. But  if we cannot count on the support of the workers who do have a  job and a workshop to go to, then we cannot solve our problems.  If we did something without the workers' support, it would be a  political blunder.    "At this meeting, I have not heard a single word from anyone  appealing to the patriotism and honor of the worker. A few days  ago, I said that most of the people in this country are working  out of a sense of honor. Only their sense of honor makes them  wake up at the hour they must wake up and find whatever means  they can -- bicycle or whatever -- to go to work and fulfill  their duty. They do not do it for money. We know that there is  very little they can buy with what we pay them. They can only  buy a few things at the grocery store because there are only a  few things to sell, even if they are sold cheap. There is very  little they can buy on the black market because they do not earn  enough money to buy on the black market.    "If we cannot count on the patriotism and honor of the  people and their determination to do whatever [words indistinct]  the Revolution, all technical measures we adopt will be useless.  We may solve a problem today, but confront complications two,  three, or four months later. Therefore, we cannot forget the  people. We must never forget that we must keep the people  informed. I understand hope; however, I cannot understand the  need to conclude this meeting with an approved group of  measures. I believe the people's curiosity can be satisfied if  we make all that we have discussed here available to the public.  This is what we are doing. Members of the ANPP are not the only  ones in this hall. There are many witnesses here. The media is  here.    "This is the first time the ANPP is discussing problems as  complex as these. If we wish to see positive results, then we  should utilize what time we have left to discuss the heart of  the problem. This is what I am proposing, so that we do not have  to sit through 25 speeches. I suggest that we invite our two  comrades, Osvaldito because he is president of the Institute of  Economic Research -- he spoke here and expressed himself quite  nicely; others did as well, but he is an expert on this matter  -- and Jose Luis. Jose Luis is an expert on this matter and is  knowledgeable. Let us begin broaching specific issues.    "What is our budget? Jose Luis gave us some information, but  let him expand on this matter. How much revenue would we receive  from taxes? What kind of taxes should we implement? Will taxes  solve the problem? How much do we pay out in social security  benefits, wages, and other benefits? Is this a shock policy?  Should we lower wages and social security benefits? Should we  have cutbacks? Should we continue as we are? What should be  taxed? Should we implement a tax system? How much tax should we  charge? What measures should we implement? What policies should  we implement? This is what we should be discussing if we really  want to make progress. We must grab the bull by the horns. You  cannot grab a radish by its leaves.    "If everyone agrees, and we are not saying that no one else  can speak, I would suggest a start on this. I know many of you  cannot improvise a speech on specific issues... How many people  are scheduled to speak?    Alarcon answers: "Twenty."    Castro: "Twenty or 22, and more to come. They grow faster  than money. [laughter] I suggest we speak in front of witnesses  and that we discuss what is proposed. [laughter] I should have  added that the discussion be held with specialists on the  subject. Let us discuss the issues and make some progress.  However, we must do this knowing that we are not going to reach  any agreements today. We must all think. You must think and the  people must think. After you have thought, then we will talk.  The people are aware of the problems we are confronting. Someone  conducted a poll: Everyone understands what is going on, but  practically no one agrees with the measures. If we do not get  the people to understand the problem and accept the measures,  then we have achieved nothing. It will be another draft bill  with 17 et ceteras. Let us do something and extract something  positive from these discussions. This is something new for us,  something we have never done before. It is a complex situation,  but we are deputies and we were elected to broach issues such as  these. We were elected to confront the serious problems. The  people may not elect us again after this. By the way, Alarcon,  we do not get paid that much. The people can retire all of us."    Ricardo Alarcon invites Jose Luis Rodriguez to take the  floor.    Rodriguez greets the assembly, then says: "I will go  directly  to the heart of the matter: As we said earlier, we believe this  financial imbalance the country is experiencing is not a problem  that can be solved effectively by a group of technicians or by  the most brilliant group of economists. We agree that it is a  big problem and has repercussions on our country and the  Revolution. We also agree that it is essentially a political  problem. Therefore, anything that is done must be evaluated  according to [words indistinct] can be applied. We must evaluate  our situation prior to implementing one measure or another.    "As has been explained in the past, there is an excess of  money on the streets. One of the key elements that contributes  to increasing the excess currency, and the commander in chief  mentioned it yesterday and today, is the deficit of the state  budget. Our deficit has been increasing for the past few years.  The reasons for this have been explained in the past. This  deficit has been increasing since 1989. According to the report  we have already presented, our deficit in 1989 was 1.4 billion  [currency not specified]. It increased to 1.958 billion in 1990,  and in 1991, it jumped to more than 3.7 billion. Then in 1992, a  record year for us, it went up to 4.869 billion, and this year,  1993, it should be a bit lower. The report says that we will be  ending the year with a 4.2 billion deficit.    "We do not believe the measures adopted contributed to  reducing this year's deficit. The drop is the result of certain  economic activities undertaken by the country.    "Now, regarding the deficit: In the past we had several  sources that helped cover the deficit. One source was the loans  the country got from abroad. We do not have to tell you that  these are no longer available. We also had the money we could  collect domestically, and we could cover the deficit by issuing  more money. In the past few years, most of the deficit was  covered by issuing money domestically. We have been issuing  money at a rate of approximately 60 percent.    "What is the first thing we learn from this? As far as we  are  concerned, this is very important. If we do not adopt measures  to reduce the deficit, the excess money on the streets is going  to increase. The deficit automatically contributes to the excess  of money. Therefore, the first thing we should do is study the  possibilities of reducing the state's budget deficit.    "We must then say, and we mentioned it today when we  reported  to the ANPP, that contrary to what some comrades believe, the  health, education, and not even social security benefits -- and  these have shot up in the past few years, these benefits are  currently in the amount of 1.5 billion pesos -- do not  contribute to increasing our deficit. These three expenses are  only 30 percent of the expenses included in the budget. If  tomorrow we were to decide to reduce these expenses, we would  only be reducing 30 percent of the budget. This, of course, is  only a theory because we cannot make these cuts and we will not  make these cuts.    "For example, health and education: 75 percent of what we  spend on health and education falls under the category of wages.  We are working on reducing other expenditures. However, because  of our country's wage policy, these have not been touched. This  means that we are restricted to making cuts in vital areas  because we cannot touch the work force. I must honesty say that  we, for political, social, and economic reasons, do not agree  that these expenditures should be cut substantially because it  will not be here where we will find the appropriate solutions."    Rodriguez continues to mention the various areas where,  according to some, cuts can be made. Rodriguez adds that these  cuts would not make much of a difference. Rodriguez continues to  mention some of the areas the government could exploit and  receive revenue. Parents who want their children to learn to  swim or receive special courses in gymnastics can pay for these  services. These areas would represent approximately 55 million  pesos in revenue for the country.    Rodriguez states: "Where does the country spend most of its  money? We studied this situation and reached the following  conclusion: The country spends its largest amount of money  subsidizing the sugar industry and agriculture. During the three  years of the special period, 1991, 1992, and 1993, the  government has contributed 7.231 billion pesos in these two  areas. This represents 54 percent of the deficit in those years.  As you said earlier, we must work on this. And we see  possibilities."    Castro interjects: "That is a key point."    Rodriguez responds: "It is a key point."    Castro again: "That is a key point."    Rodriguez again: "It is."    Castro then says: "From the view of what we are discussing,  the issue of subsidies is a key point."    Rodriguez responds: "Yes it is. Furthermore, when drafting  the 1994 budget we not only concentrated on subsidies but also  on the financial situation of our state enterprises. Osvaldo  mentioned this in his report.    "Commander, we have a noticeable lack of discipline where  payments are concerned. Our report is through September 1993.  When we studied the business sector alone, and we are not  including the area included in the budget, we found that the  state owes the state 2.821 billion pesos. In other words, these  are amounts that one enterprise owes the other but they do not  pay."    Castro asks: "And this affects the budget?"    Rodriguez answers: "Yes it does, and it also represents a  loss."    Castro asserts: "It may represent a loss but it does not  directly influence the excess of money on the streets."    Rodriguez responds: "No."    And Castro asks: "But they report this as a loss?"    Rodriguez answers yes: "Yes. They write it off as a bad  debt.  These bad debts must be subsidized and the subsidies affect the  deficit."    Castro remarks: "Now you are talking about subsidies. That  is  included in the 7 billion you were talking about."    Rodriguez says: "Yes. It is an important element. The  problem  here is not only an economic...."    Castro, interrupts: "It is a problem of education as well?"    Rodriguez states: "Not only that. From the social viewpoint  this is very important. We have started to dig and this is one  of the things that contributes to the shifting of large amounts  of money. This is an example of the lack of economic control we  were talking about earlier.    "Since we are on the topic of shifting of large amounts of  money I will say that this is one of the [words indistinct]. If  you write and bill for services, but do not get paid for the  services bill, and the person who receives does not know what he  is receiving, does not know what he is supposed to pay, and does  not pay, then its havoc. And we are talking 2.8 billion."    Castro asks: "In how many months?"    Rodriguez responds: "Through 30 September. We have yet to  end  this year."    Castro again: "In one year?"    Rodriguez: "We do not have a breakdown because these  accounts  go back a long time."    Castro again: "You are talking 7 billion in three years.  What  about the 2.8 billion?"    Rodriguez: "We have bills dated 60 days, 90 days, and we may  even find some a year old."    Castro: "A year old. Everyone should close the year by the  end of the year. Will the amount increase by the end of the  year?"    Rodriguez: "We believe it will. It will increase because we  have not been able to create an awareness regarding the need to  collect due bills. We are beginning to meet with the biggest  enterprises, with their directors, to make them understand the  importance of this and explain to them that we cannot subsidize  them when they have these huge amounts owed them. How can we  give money out of the budget to enterprises that do not collect  their bills."    Castro says: "Give us some examples."    Rodriguez: "What?"    Castro: "Give us some examples."    Rodriguez answers: "I will. For example, the Ministry of  Basic Industry [Minbas]. I have brought this up because the  other day we met with Marquitos [Minbas Minister Marcos J.  Portal] and brought this up."    Castro: "How much is the Minbas owed?"    Rodriguez: "They are owed 556 million through 30 September."    Castro: "Who owes them?"    Rodriguez: "The Minbas oil sector is owed 556 million."    Castro: "Who owes them that amount?"    Rodriguez: "Basically, the retailers."    Castro: "The retailers fall under the people's government,  do  they not?"    Rodriguez: "Most of them."    Castro: "So who pays?"    Rodriguez: "This is something we caught only recently. We  are  making a file and then we will visit all those enterprises to  discuss the bills they owe and are owed, those that must be  written off because they are already too old, and which of them  can still be paid."    Castro observes: "Now this money can increase that excess  money on the streets. "    Rodriguez: "Yes it can."    Castro: "If that money is stolen, where will it go?"    Rodriguez: "That is anyone's guess. It can be used for many  other things. The fact that you do not pay does not mean that  you do not spend. You may spend on other things. Money is  shifted from one source to another and you do not pay what you  have to pay. "    Castro: "[Words indistinct] for example."    Rodriguez: "Yes, of course. We find that the foreign trade  sector has 835 million owed them."    Castro: "And they are not being paid?"    Rodriguez: "No, they are not being paid. The import  enterprises [words indistinct]."    Castro: "Why do they not pay?"    Rodriguez: "It seems we have a problem with operations. The  enterprises that import the merchandise are not the ones that  handle the merchandise. It seems that the billing and collecting  mechanism is not working as it should. The enterprise scheduled  to receive the merchandise takes it from the port and there is  no control by the foreign trade officials. This seems to be the  problem. We have yet to determine what the problem is. But they  are owed much money.    "Commander, we also have the bills to be paid in foreign  exchange. I would not like to go into this because we are still  investigating, but let me tell you that this involves hundreds  of millions. We are not talking 10 or 20 million. A purge is  necessary before we can give you...."    Castro, interuppting, asks: "What is the problem? Tourism?"    Rodriguez responds: "Part of the problem has to do with the  tourist sector."    Castro observes:: "We know that some of the tourist  enterprises hold back payments. They are billed in November and  they pay in January. We have to fight to get them to pay.    "Are we owed for our exports?"    Rodriguez: "Yes, we are. The Ministry of the Fishing  Industry  is a good example of this."    Castro: "This means that they export and do not get paid."    Rodriguez: "We have a problem with our collection cycle. We  have to find out why it takes so long for us to be able to  collect what is owed us. We have money invested there that we  cannot move."    Castro observes: "This has to do with international ways of  doing things. Many pay every three months or every six months.  We have to check and see what has been paid and what has not  been paid."    Rodriguez states: "That is correct. But that is money the  country has to recover. We do not know how much it is, but what  we are sure of is that we cannot continue to live like this. We  must be able to use that money. We must get them to pay what  they owe."    Castro: "We also owe, do we not?    Rodriguez: "Yes we do, but we have to pay. If we do not pay  we cannot buy, and our meager imports will drop.    "In other words, at this very moment, we are working on a  mechanism, a sole mechanism, to determine where all this money  is, and why it is not where it should be. This mechanism will  help the state do what it must do."    Castro asks: "Let us go back to the excess of currency in  the  country."    Rodriguez: "We are talking about the deficit, and all those  factors I mentioned contribute to increasing the deficit. The  deficit is covered by issuing money, and this measure puts a  certain amount of money into circulation each year. If we can  reduce the deficit by tackling the problem that increases it,  then we do not have to issue that much money next year. This  would contribute to strengthening the country's economic policy.  If this is possible, we would avoid issuing a large amount of  money."    Castro comments: "It looks as if the greatest amount of  money  goes into subsidies."    Rodriguez: "And there is a good possibility we can lower  those subsidies."    Castro: "Continue."    Rodriguez adds: "Commander, in addition to this. I must say  that solving these problems alone will not help us gradually  reduce the amount of excess money on the streets. You asked  about taxes. We responsibly tell you that we are proposing a tax  system for the country. We have already talked about the need to  create an awareness among the people, an awareness that we have  lost...."    Castro interrupts: "No, no, no. We never had that awareness.  The other tax system was a bourgeois tax system."    Rodriguez: "We did have a sort of tax system. That is why I  mentioned it."    Castro: "We paid a direct tax on income?"    Rodriguez: "We did, through 1967. We paid 11.9 percent in  taxes on our wages."    Castro: "That was for social security?"    Rodriguez: "No. We also had a 4-percent industrial tax and  other taxes. This system was abolished in 1967 and we have not  had a tax system since."    Castro: "By then, we were owners of our economy."    Rodriguez: "Yes."    Castro continues: "We had replaced the capitalists who owned  the industries and other economic sources. So we did have a tax,  but this was a relative tax system. So we paid 11 percent."    Rodriguez: "No, 11.90 percent."    Castro: "Wages were taxed."    Rodriguez: "That is correct; it was deducted by payroll."    Castro asks: "Until what year?"    Rodriguez: "Until 1967. That same year, 1967...."    Castro interrupts: "How much would that 11 percent represent  today?"    Rodriguez: "We are paying approximately 8.800 billion pesos  in wages each year, so that would represent...."    Castro interrupts: "That would be 900 million."    Rodriguez: "Yes, approximately 900 million. This is a  problem  we must discuss because you know what it would be like suddenly  imposing a tax system on the people. We have told ourselves that  we are going to study this issue carefully and see what we can  do to introduce an income tax system to the country. We cannot  implement this measure without preparation. That is the way we  see it. This means that...."    Castro: "Which would be more profitable, to establish an  income-tax system or a progressive tax on income?"    Rodriguez: "That would have to be studied. Even though we  have workers who are earning large salaries, they are not a  majority. For example, through last year, 65 percent of the  families had a monthly per capita income of 100 pesos. This  means that only 35 percent earn more than 100 pesos a month. We  are considering a family nucleus to be approximately 3.5 people.  In other words, they are not a majority.    Castro: "What kind of taxes have you been thinking about?"    Rodriguez answers: "We have been thinking about income tax  and business tax. Some taxes are currently being paid. The  self-employed are being taxed."    Castro: "How much revenue can we collect from the tax the  self-employed is paying?"    Rodriguez: "The self-employed are currently paying 49.90  percent, and 90 percent of the self-employed are paying their  taxes -- but the system was only implemented two months ago, so  we have to wait a while longer to see if they continue to do it.  According to our estimates, next year we should be receiving  approximately 126 million pesos; that is, if we do not raise  taxes. If we raise taxes, we can receive more. We believe taxes  should be raised. Only two provinces, Las Tunas and Cienfuego,  have raised their taxes. Today we learned that Pinar del Rio is  also working on this. However, we have not implemented the  resolution on a basic minimum tax which was discussed here this  morning. The other day we were telling the presidents...."    Castro interrupts: "Do you support the idea that other  products and services must be taxed, or only income?"    Rodriguez: "We believe that we should implement a  progressive  tax on income system. This calls for one specific mechanism."    Castro: "What is that?"    Rodriguez: "The filing of an income tax return."    Castro then asks: "Have you thought about this?"    Rodriguez: "Yes we have, commander, but...."    Castro interrupts: "Rest assured I did not steal your idea.  I  also suggested that."    Rodriguez: "Commander, the problem is that...."    Castro interrupts: "And what happens to the person who tries  to evade filing the return?"    Rodriguez: "If I am not mistaken, he will be fined 500  pesos."    Castro: "Is that all?"    Rodriguez: "That is for first-time offenders. Seizures and  other punishments are also being considered."    Castro: "Have other types of punishments been established?"    Rodriguez: "Other types of punishments have been suggested.  The problem is that...."    Castro interrupts: "You are talking about petty fines. If  you  read our penal and civil codes, you will see that the fines are  ridiculous. They were established when the peso was worth  something. Today, anyone who legally earns 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000  pesos, or makes 10,000 illegally, does not care at all if he  must pay that amount in fines. I understand that many of those  so-called countries have strong punishments for tax evaders."    Rodriguez: "Tax evasion can entail eight to 10 years in  jail.  Let me tell you something else...."    Castro interrupts: "The people will only file a return if  they know that if they fail to do so they will go to jail."    Rodriguez: "We are now asking that tax evasion be considered  a crime. This was abolished in 1967. We are suggesting jail  sentences for evaders."    Castro: "There was no need for this because we did not have  a  tax system."    Rodriguez: "That is correct, but if we are going to  implement  a tax system today, then we must establish that tax evasion is a  crime."    Castro: "I am just asking. For the people to pay and respect  the tax system, it is necessary to establish some type of  punishment. This must include jail; otherwise, we will have  evaders. An income tax return is an instrument to collect taxes  should you one day implement the progressive income tax."    Rodriguez: "We are suggesting both: fines and jail  sentences.  We are also suggesting confiscation of the produced goods and  the means of production."    Castro: "That is nothing. Anyone would say that you are  thinking of a car factory and that you are going to seize the  factory. Right now, all you would seize would be a stand or a  coach."    Rodriguez: "Perhaps."    Castro: "It would not take these people 10 days to set up  another stand and coach."    Rodriguez: "It is not that cheap to do, Commander."    Castro: "With the money they have, they can do it. How much  does a coach cost today?"    Rodriguez: "That depends on the type of coach. There are  coaches that cost 10,000 pesos."    Castro: "That would be a [word indistinct]."    Rodriguez: "No, no, no. The usual coach. There are comrades  from the provinces who have more up-to-date information on that."    Castro: "Great, they will have paid it off in three months.  But there are others who do not have stands or coaches and have  many ways of making much money."    Rodriguez: "We are working on another idea, commander."    Castro: "What are you going to seize from a messenger? His  feet?"    Rodriguez: "We will have to think of other types of  punishment."    Castro: "What?"    Rodriguez: "We must think of other types of punishment."    Castro: "Seizing property may be of some value, but I do not  think it will work. If you are going to implement a progressive  income tax system for the self-employed, and want the system  respected and the tax paid, you need to do more than just file  an income tax return. You need strict punishment for evasion.  There are laws for this in the United States and in Europe. If  they did not have them, people would not pay their taxes. These  mechanisms must be accompanied by others."    Rodriguez: "We are studying those proposals. We are being  careful to ensure that the control system will not be more  expensive than what we are going to control."    Castro: "You have just proven that no matter how much you  do,  you will only collect some 200 million in taxes [words  indistinct]. Now if we were to implement a general income tax,  like the 11- percent you were talking about, the state would  receive much more, right?"    Rodriguez: "Yes."    Castro: "It is a lot easier to collect that tax."    Rodriguez: "All you have to do is deduct the tax from the  workers' pay."    Castro: "And that represents approximately 800 or 900  million. That is something. So what other taxes are we talking  about?"    Rodriguez: "Of those that directly affect the people, the  ones we have mentioned are the most important at this time. We  are studying taxing other areas, but they do not affect the  people, at least not directly. We are studying the possibility  of taxing several products, especially cigarettes and alcoholic  beverages."    Castro: "Since this has been brought up here, I want all of  you to know that in 1970, we established a tax on nonessential  products. We solved that famous budget deficit and the excess of  money on the streets. It was that tax that did it. However,  there is something different that has not been mentioned here.    "Back then, we had an excess of money on the streets, but we  did not have that scarcity of merchandise we are experiencing  today. Today we have both things: excess money and a tremendous  scarcity of merchandise. [Words indistinct] deficit, but we had  things to buy. We had more than enough money, but we had things  we could purchase."    Rodriguez: "And we could import goods."    Castro: "The tax on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages  basically solved the deficit."    Rodriguez: "This year we should be able to collect some  3.300  billion in taxes on those products. However, we need 600 million  more to cover the deficit. This is basically due to the problems  that we have had with production."    Castro: "We do not have cigarettes, rum, beer. This effects  us. Back in 1970, we had enough beer and cigarettes to satisfy  the demand. There is a strong demand for those items. I recall  that in 1970, a spontaneous sort of dry law was established.  This was because some factories stopped producing. Today we do  not have cigarettes. We do not have the raw materials or  electricity to produce cigarettes. All that. Continue."    Rodriguez continues: "That is all for taxes. In this initial  phase, aimed at removing the excess money from the streets, we  do not believe that the tax system would be a significant means  of removing that excess money. It would be helpful to the  economy. The tax is not only for people, but for the  enterprises, including the mixed enterprises. We have other  sources, but these are not directly related to the excess money  in the hands of the people.    "Now, about the excess money: You asked a question about  measures that should be implemented in regard to seizure or  exchange of money. I will now tell you what I know about this. I  believe we...."    Castro: "Let us take a break here."    Rodriguez: "What?"    Castro: "Let us take a break."    Rodriguez: "If you want to."    Castro: "Let us ask the deputies what they think. Let them  tell us their views before you give us yours."    Rodriguez: "About what?"    Castro: "Seizure of money; we want to hear some ideas  without  putting this matter to a vote. Also ideas about the exchange of  money. Ideas as to whether we should give up some of these ideas  if your mechanisms do not solve the problem."    At 0250 GMT Ricardo Alarcon is heard to say that there are  several deputies who wish to express their views on the subject.  The first deputy to speak is Leonel Gonzalez from Cabaiguan  Municipality. Castro immediately interrupts him to ask: "How  many of you have thought this problem out? How many of you have  discussed this problem among yourselves? Be honest and raise  your hands. Fine. Those of you who have not thought about this,  raise your hands. This does not mean that you agree with the  measures. Just if you have thought about this. We cannot ask you  to give your opinion; all we want to know is who has thought  about this problem and discussed it. Fine. Continue, comrade."    Gonzalez begins to speak about the exchange of money. Castro  interrupts to ask: "First of all, in your opinion, what is an  exchange?" Gonzalez continues to explain what he thinks an  exchange is and what he believes should be done. Gonzalez  suggests that the government freeze the money that is in the  bank, to which Castro responds: "The money that is in the bank  does not affect the phenomenon created by the excess of money on  the streets. We have launched campaigns for people to save money  in the bank. If a man earned 100,000 pesos and put it in the  bank, he is not in the least affecting the situation. The  problem is the person who has 100,000 pesos and is spending it  on the black market; buying cheaper and selling for a profit. We  promote savings. It keeps the money off the street. Inflation  and trouble are caused by the money on the streets, not the  money that is saved. Many countries encourage their citizens to  save as a means to keep inflation down. Let us call the excess  of money an inflationary phenomenon. This would happen here if  we did not have the ration book for certain articles, if there  were free sales. But, you are just expressing your views. As far  as you are concerned, you would put a freeze on excess money."    Gonzalez continues to express his views. Next, Ricardo  Alarcon recognizes Ramon Fernandez as the next speaker.  Fernandez mentions the fact that there are too many workers in  certain sectors and suggests that the excess manpower be put to  work in other areas or on the land to produce food, to which  Castro replies: "Then we start running out of land and we  transfer them to Guira de Melena and there are too many people  already in Guira de Melena. For the first time, and only since  the creation of the UPBC, are we finding that some of these  agricultural enterprises are admitting that they have too many  workers. What do we do with the excess manpower?"    Fernandez admits to Castro that this is a challenge. Castro  asks: "What kind of a challenge -- to a sword fight, to a  shootout?" Fernandez adds that for these cases, the government  has implemented a system to protect laid-off workers.    The chair then recognizes Tomas Pagan who also presents his  views on the exchange of money and comments on Jose Luis  Rodriguez' statement on outstanding debts among the various  state enterprises. Castro interrupts to ask Rodriguez: "We have  mentioned the worrisome issue of the outstanding debts among the  enterprises. Are these outstanding debts included in the 7  billion utilized to subsidize various sectors? We are not very  clear on this. What happens to that money? It is said that it  could be a source for shifting of money from one place to  another as well as other things. What is clear is that we must  cover those 7 billion and that this represents 54 percent of the  deficit. These outstanding debts, as far as I understood,  represent losses for the state. When does this represent a loss?  Can you tell us how much of those losses have unavoidably been  covered by the budget? It would be nice to know how much;  whether it is 800, 500, 900 million or 1 billion."    Rodriguez: "We are looking into this. The problem is that we  have not been able to...."    Castro interrupts: "When we speak of approximately 3 billion  in subsidies to the Ministry of the Sugar Industry [Minaz] and  the agriculture sector are we talking only subsidies?"    Rodriguez: "Subsidies."    Castro: "Is this based on bills that must be collected?"    Rodriguez: "Some of it could."    Castro: "Some of it?."    Rodriguez: "Some of it."    Castro says: "You mentioned 7 billion in three years."    Rodriguez: "Yes."    Castro: "But a few days ago the Minaz and Agriculture  ministers told us that those two areas received 3 billion in  subsidies. What would happen if we cut off all subsidies?"    Rodriguez: "Commander, I will answer that for you. A few  days  ago we made up a list of the enterprises that are making no  profit. If you should cut off subsidies to those enterprises,  you would be cutting off subsidies to 69 percent of the  enterprises in the country; 31 percent of our enterprises are  profit-making and 69 percent make no profit."    Castro: "In other words, we would lose those enterprises. We  would have to close them."    Rodriguez: "Well, we either close them or do something else.  However, if their subsidies are cut, they would not have the  money to operate."    Castro: "We would have to close the 158 sugar mills. They  fall under that category. The sugar mills are not making  profits. Can we close them? What should we do? What happens if  we close our 158 sugar mills?"    Rodriguez: "We cannot do that. What we should do is...."    Castro interrupts: "What happens if we close the Moa and  Nicaro mines?"    Rodriguez: "You do not have to do that, but we could do what  was done this year. You can stop the operations when it is not  profitable to produce for export purposes."    Castro: "Of course, when it is not profitable, but the  workers are getting paid."    Rodriguez: "Exactly."    Castro: "And you have to find the money to pay the workers."    Rodriguez: "That is correct. That case is perfectly  justified. The only subsidies that are not justified are those  allocated to poorly managed areas. Those are the areas we must  pinpoint here."    Castro: "Yet I believe that the measures adopted in the area  of agriculture will considerably reduce subsidies to that area."    Rodriguez: "Correct."    Castro continues: "Perhaps even more than all you can  collect  in taxes."    Rodriguez: "Probably."    Castro: "Now tell me, of the subsidies allocated for the  sugar industry how much goes to the sugar mills and how much  goes to the agriculture sector."    Rodriguez: "This year the agriculture...."    Castro interrupts: "The sugar cane agriculture."    Rodriguez: "In 1994 we are allocating approximately 300  million in subsidies."    Castro: "And the sugar mills?"    Rodriguez: "The sugar mills will be receiving approximately  400 million."    Minaz Minister Juan Ramon Herrera: "In the past, the sugar  cane agricultural sector received 600 million. With the [words  indistinct] we had calculated 600 million for the sugar cane  agriculture. Approximately 400 million are to be allocated to  the sugar industry; that involves all the sugar activities."    Castro: "Only a few days ago you told me that subsidies to  your area were in the amount of 1.2 billion."    Herrera: "No, it is 1.002 billion."    Castro: "One billion plus 2 million?"    Herrera: "That is correct. Not 1.2 billion but 1.002  billion."    Castro: "And what about the agriculture sector."    Rodriguez: "We have estimated we will allocate this year  approximately 300 million to the sugar cane UBPC."    Castro: "By this year do you mean 1993?"    Rodriguez: "No. We do not have the Minaz' 1993 breakdown for  the agricultural sector."    Herrera: "Minaz will close 1993 with 1.7 billion."    Castro continues: "You will close with 1.7 billion. And how  much did you allocate for 1994?"    Rodriguez: "We suggested a reduction for 1994. We suggested  reducing subsidies to the sugar industry, Agriculture Ministry,  and UBPC by 800 million."    Castro: "You have already included this in the budget?"    Rodriguez: "Yes."    Castro: "You included the reduction in the 1994 budget?"    Rodriguez: "Yes, we have."    Castro: "That is an adopted measure."    Rodriguez: "Yes, it is."    Castro: "Is it the measure or one of the measures?"    Rodriguez: "One of the measures."    Castro: "Right. Alarcon, this is very interesting. The  comrades are talking among themselves about what is being said.  [laughter] Listen to them, they are talking." [laughter]    Ricardo Alarcon recognizes Deputy Agustin Delgado who once  again broaches the issue of exchange and his opinion of how this  problem can be solved. He asks whether anyone knows how much  excess money is out on the streets. He believes the "enemy of  the Revolution" is encouraging the people to refrain from  putting the money in the bank, thus undermining the Revolution.  Delgado stresses his trust in the economists to which Castro  says: "You do, but I do not. [laughter] Economists frighten me.  There is only one thing I know a little about and that is  politics. That has been my job, the most important job I have  had. I believe that things must be viewed through politics. The  ideas presented by the specialists must be analyzed from a  political viewpoint. Our best economists are those who can  suggest and draft measures with a political meaning. If they are  going to propose something that technically may be good, but  politically catastrophic, our mission and duty is to stop them  and reject what they are proposing. We must combine economy and  policy.    "I would like to say as well that I know peasants who have  never sold a single pound of their products on the black market  and have hundreds of thousands of pesos in the bank."    Delgado: "Commander, but if...."    Castro interrupts: "I know some. Great people."    Delgado: "But commander...."    Castro: "Not all peasants are like that. For the past 20 or  25 years they have been harvesting tubers, vegetables, and  potatoes. They are self-sufficient and do not have too many  expenses. These are the people who make you stop and think. I  wish that peasant's money had a little mark on it. There are  some who have much money but who did not earn that money  legally. They got the money through manipulations and the black  market.    "Now regarding those of you who are advising others to save  or not to save, I will say nothing about that. I will not take  sides."    Delgado: "Excuse me commander, if that honest peasant...."    Castro: " If we are going to adopt measures, we must not  overlook your suggestions and opinions. That would not be  correct. I truly believe we should adopt measures, but we have  not reached a final decision. We have not covered every single  angle. However, we are very interested in knowing what you think  about this. It is necessary that we know how each of you feel  because this helps us reach a decision on what measures to  adopt. This helps create an awareness.    "It is quite obvious that once this meeting has concluded we  will leave this meeting place with much more information, a  clearer view of the problem. We will know more about the problem  than we did when we walked into this hall this morning."    Delgado: "That is correct and this is why...."    Castro: "This is why it is important that we know how you  think. However, I also believe that it is too soon for us to  commit ourselves. However, it is extremely valuable to learn how  you think.    "There is something the people believe in and they are not  mistaken in doing so. Above all, the Revolution will protect the  interests of the people. That will always come first. The  Revolution will leave no one unattended. This is an  unquestionable principle." [applause]    Ricardo Alarcon then gives the floor to Deputy Marcia  Febles,  Trinidad Municipality, Sancti Spiritus Province. Febles reports  on developments in her area and her views on the exchange. The  chair then recognizes Deputy Raul Gomez Cabrera, who also  expresses his views on the exchange of currency.    The chair recognizes Deputies Hector Rodriguez Almaral and  Luis Oscar Galvez, who also express their views on the topics  broached, in particular the seizure or exchange of money.    Castro then says: "I wish to clarify something. I brought up  the issue of seizing money. In 1961 we seized the money in the  country and we seized the money of the bourgeoisie. They did not  have their money in the banks. Back in 1961 we did not touch the  money in the banks; we only seized some of the money, not all of  it. I talked about this and exchange because they are two of an  arsenal of measures that could be adopted. I also talked about  taxes. I wanted to find out about taxes, how much these taxes  would yield, how much tax the people would have to pay, how much  we would save if the people had to pay for school uniforms, if  we did not pay for plastic surgery operations, and if we did not  cover the costs of the special schools for girls interested in  taking classes in gymnastics. I do not know how the National  Institute for Sports feels about all this. Perhaps we should  hear what they have to say about this, about their schools. I  imagine they have their own schools, just as the music sector  does.    "We wanted to be specific; however, since this is one of  the most touchy topics in this arsenal of possible measures, we  wanted to discuss it. It is an important topic and we have been  [words indistinct].    "You have said something that is true. No country announces  currency exchanges; no country announces devaluations. No  parliament in the world discusses problems of this nature. I  believe this is the only parliament in the world where issues  such as these are discussed, as we are doing. We are discussing  the issue in front of you, the world, and the press. One must  have courage to do something like this. We can do it. But the  fact that we can do it does not mean that we will not do it. If  we wanted to, we could announce a currency exchange tomorrow.  There are ways to do this. We could do it tomorrow and it would  cost us only a few dollars. It would be senseless for us to  suggest this as one in the arsenal of measures, if it were  impractical or too costly. We are discussing this matter from  the political viewpoint. We are trying to establish whether or  not it is an appropriate move, whether or not it would be a  savings. We are discussing the measures' advantages and  disadvantages. We are discussing them to get all the information  we need, not because it is impossible for us to do. It will also  be up to us whether we seize part of the money and leave the  rest.    "There are many solutions. What we need is awareness and  knowledge. One of the reasons we are discussing all this is  because there are many people who want the problem confronted  and solved but do not agree with the measures that would solve  the problem. As I said earlier, it is very necessary that we  have the people's understanding of the measures to be adopted.  There is no doubt that the measures adopted must be intelligent  measures. We are discussing and questioning because we hope to  find the best solution to this delicate problem. This problem is  the result of the situation we are experiencing. You must  realize that we are looking for solutions to the problem of  excess currency under abnormal conditions. The other countries  are experiencing normal conditions, yet they are devaluating  their currency. Mexico did it. When Mexico devaluated its  currency, it was exporting in large quantities, had a lot of  oil, and was not experiencing a blockade. Devaluation is the  same as seizing currency. The Mexican peso was 12.5 to a dollar,  and from one day to another, it went to 250 pesos to a dollar.  Devaluation and seizing currency are the same things.  Devaluation is a systematic seizure of money and workers  everywhere fight for raises. If there is 10-percent inflation,  they ask for at least a 9-percent, even 8-percent, raise. As  inflation goes up, the workers continue to ask for raises. They  get raises, but their wages are really getting cut by 50 percent.    "We do not know what an inflation phenomenon is all about.  We  have been lucky to have the sacred ration book, the blessed  ration book. Perhaps one day, someone will explain how it has  been possible for the Revolution to do all that it has done. All  that was done has not been based on foreign cooperation alone.  Simply put, the people in this country have been the ones who  financed the building of schools, roads, and so forth. When we  did not have the money to build a hospital, that hospital would  be built. Why? Because we had the ration book. Without the  ration book, our budget would have required complete balance to  keep the prices down. We built thousands of schools, hundreds  and hundreds of hospitals, many things, and the liter of milk  never went up a single cent. The price of meat and food did not  go up. I am talking about that golden era when the products in  the ration book were much more numerous than today.    "I have always been aware that the people financed the  social  and economic development of this country. We did not have a  budget; we had no income to build these things. The amount of  currency on the streets increased, but the people continued to  get their products every month, and always at the same price.    "I never heard anyone in this country ask if we had a budget  for [words indistinct] and the people's governments know this.  Ever since the people's governments were established, all they  have done is build and do things, invent things. Ever since  1976, the people's governments have done everything they wanted  to do. However, no one ever asked if the state had a budget for  what they wanted to do. They never asked if there was money for  what they wanted to do. Just having the plan and the need was  enough. Back then we had enough cement, steel, and lumber. The  wages, the money to pay those wages, came from the Ministry of  Finance. And this had been the case for these past 30 years.  Under normal conditions, the people financed all the work done.  This was done without inflation. Prices were never freed. Had we  freed our prices we would not have been able to do all this. Had  we freed our prices we would have had a constant increase in  prices. Only as the years went by did the prices of certain  products go up.    "Today we are facing a problem similar to the one we had in  1970. There is an excess of money. There is so much money that  the people are not interested in money. Many people can live  with the wages earned by one member of the family. This also  happened in 1970.    "You have talked about encouragement for work done. You  should also talk about the need to work. Man works because he  needs to work. Excess money results in some people not working  because they do not need the money. Others do not work -- like  the comrade from Trinidad said -- because they would rather be  self-employed. Another comrade mentioned the risk of all workers  in the crafts sector deciding to become self-employed. However,  I have asked the people responsible for the crafts centers about  this and they have told me that not too many workers have left.  Many workers have grown accustomed to the centers; they get the  raw material they need, and they are being taken care of. We  must struggle to keep those workers and make sure they stay with  us. I believe that gathering up that excess currency will  contribute to the people needing work. Encouragement is  something else. There is not much material encouragement we can  give, but whenever we can, we do give it.    "We are talking about finding a financial balance and  solving  the problem of excess currency at a time when the socialist bloc  no longer exists and our imports have dropped by 78 percent. We  are talking about all this at a time when the blockade is  stronger than ever, and during the special period. We are  talking about all this amid an international economic crisis.  When other countries faced similar problems, they did not endure  what we are enduring. It is much more difficult for us. However,  we are not afraid to tackle the problem. The Revolution demands  that we do what we must with the support and understanding of  the people.    "I can recall that the cigarette issue underwent much  discussion. It was an issue on which we could not agree, so we  decided to ask as many people for their opinions as we could. We  even asked the people's councils for their views on this and  that. The opinion of others has not always been the best  solution to our problems. I could mention many things we  discussed, and the solutions derived from these discussions  turned out to be worse than if we had not discussed them. The  decision we made on cigarettes is one of them. The decision we  made on cigarettes is one of them. [Castro repeats himself] We  found ourselves facing the problem of [words indistinct] find a  way to increase the price of cigarettes. We had a standing quota  and it was not appropriate. The Executive Council had reached  specific conclusions, but when we broached this issue with the  commission responsible for organizing the last congress, we  could not reach an agreement; we could not get a consensus. It  was then that we decided to consult other people, including the  people's councils, but no agreement was reached. The truth, the  big truth, is that another cigarette quota was implemented. That  crazy quota of providing cigarettes to everyone who was 18 years  of age and above. But it is impossible to keep an inventory of  who smokes and who does not smoke; everyone 18 years of age or  older got cigarettes. Since many of those people do not smoke,  they would sell their cigarettes. The black market now has more  sources. Today we have more sources. Anyone who can get his  hands on a pack of U.S.-made cigarettes is a source for the  black market. People receive new or worn clothes and sell them  here at outrageous prices. Anyone traveling today and bringing  back 10 kg of medicine -- something we authorized to help those  who needed medicine that the State could not provide because it  did not have the money to buy it -- becomes a source for the  black market. All the money that comes into the country today,  every single dollar that finds its way to a store, becomes a  source for the black market. Anyone receiving $100 can purchase  products at the foreign exchange stores and sell those products  for thousands of dollars. There are many factors that promote a  black market. Excess currency is not the only factor, even  though it worsens the problem. There are many factors that  promote this situation [words indistinct] evil, a sickness that  we have to live with [words indistinct] finding solutions under  the most difficult conditions. I believe that what we are doing  is the most appropriate, honest, and loyal thing we can do for  the people.    "We are only interested in the people knowing what we are  doing. Whose understanding do we need? The people's. Those who  have illegal money do not know what to do with it. They are  being creative with their money. If they get nervous, that is  their problem. It is their problem if they do not have a clear  conscience. However, the honest people of this country should  harbor no worries at all. [applause] [Words indistinct] from the  arsenal of things. Adopting some of these measures will  represent a sacrifice. If you are going to charge the people for  uniforms, that will represent a sacrifice. Perhaps the lady who  has 100 pesos will have to buy a uniform. I do not know. Some  here have suggested that we subsidize the people without making  a commitment to subsidize them. This does not mean that the  person who earns minimum wage and must buy uniforms, if uniforms  are subsidized, must go to the social security office to get a  ticket [preceding word in English] and pay for the uniform. If  we were to do this, we would never get rid of our excess  currency.    "Taxing of certain articles increases the price of the  article. I believe this tax should be applied to nonessential  products, but any cut in subsidies would increase the price of  essential products. We must check and see how high those prices  would be and make sure that the people can still afford to  purchase those articles. Any of those measures, such as taxing  certain articles, will represent a sacrifice for the people. No  matter how minimal the tax, if we implement a general tax, such  as the one Jose Luis said was abolished in 1967, it will  represent a sacrifice.    "I see no possibility of us straightening out this mistake,  this unavoidable mistake [words indistinct] someone's whims. It  is precisely the Revolution's basic sense of justice, its basic  need to protect the people, the basic need to maintain the  rights and achievements of the Revolution, that force us to make  sure that no one is left unattended, that not a single recently  graduated university student is jobless, that a middle-level  technician be jobless. And this is what has led us to this  situation. This is nothing new, we could see it coming. It led  us into the special period. This situation was unavoidable.  Yesterday we were talking about recovering the sugarcane  industry. The situations are quite similar. Did someone here  whimsically or capriciously cause the drop in production? We  were actually attempting to increase our production. We were  seeking to produce 10 million [not further specified]. We were  seeking to produce 10 million, using the same amount of land.  The drop in sugar production is the result of the special period  and as we said yesterday, we are seeking to increase production  in accordance with the special period. That is why we kept  asking so many questions about land, fertilizer, yields, et  cetera.    "However, we must all know that, despite the measures we  adopt, it will not be possible to straighten out this situation  if we do not solve all the problems first, and everyone must  know that we will not be able to solve them immediately. It will  take some time to solve all these problems and it will not be  possible to solve them without some sacrifice. We must be aware  of this and the people must be aware of this.    "We are going to continue debating all this. We are going to  continue debating. And there is something else. As I explained  before, measures on this subject are already being taken. We  cannot wait to have a complete package. It is even possible that  it might not be appropriate as a package, but as a group of  successive measures inspired by certain specific principles.  These are the principles we are trying to define here. We do not  have to wait for another meeting. Perhaps we need to meet again  just for this, and to continue the discussion. The next time we  will be more knowledgeable, will have a higher level of  information. Perhaps we can meet for two days and discuss  principles. I do not think you would mind meeting here again. I  do believe some of the principles have been clarified. Jose Luis  talked about measures to be adopted this year in the hope of  reducing expenditures. We are working hard to create UBPC's.  This should represent a reduction in expenditures. We must work  to curb increases. Whatever we can save in the budget is an  adopted measure. We must then work on the other measures. We  must decide whether we tax certain articles; whether we should  implement a general tax; whether we should eliminate certain  gratuities, not because they would represent a savings, but  rather because they would create an awareness, which must be  strengthened in these times. Once we have overcome this  situation, we will be much more efficient. We will no longer be  thinking of the millions we can make, but will rather create an  economic awareness among the people, so they value what they  have. Let us wait and see what comes out of this meeting, what  the rank and file have to say, what the people have to say about  this. I hope our media will report on this broadly, thus helping  you and all of those deputies the people will elect in the next  election.    "The next time we meet, everyone will have a great deal of  information on all these ideas so that we can continue to  discuss principles. I repeat, this does not mean that we will  not begin to adopt measures as of now, basic and obvious  measures aimed at saving. No one is going to object to this. No  one will object to attempts aimed at increasing production.  However, I can assure you that the efforts we are making are  truly desperate efforts aimed at increasing production. Have no  doubt about this. No comrade has been sitting with his arms  crossed. Everyone is working in all areas to increase  production. Everyone is doing his best to achieve this despite  the situation.    "It is obvious that we cannot discuss all our problems here.  There are many things that must be done with discretion. Marti  was very clear when he said: There are things that must be done  discreetly or they will not get done because the enemy will  sabotage them. There are things we must do, and whatever we do  cannot be sabotaged. They [the enemy] will be even less able to  do so if the people are aware, if the people understand them  [the measures]. We need the people to understand them. We do not  expect the people to applaud. Everytime we need to make a  sacrifice, the people feel it. And if we have to make certain  sacrifices, what we need is for the people to understand them  because these sacrifices are unavoidable, sacrifices that we  have to make. What we have to attain is the people's support for  these policies. That is what we must seek.    "Before the other deputies speak, I suggest that we start  thinking about an extraordinary meeting to discuss these issues.  I suggest that the meeting be held as soon as possible.  [applause] The enemy will then find out if we are or are not  brave. The hoarders and peddlers will then realize that they  cannot fool the Revolution, that the Revolution is stronger and  has more resources than they imagine.    "I do not think we need to take a break. How many more  speakers are scheduled?"    Alarcon answers: "Twenty-two."    Castro exclaims: "What do you mean, 22? Ducks do not play 22  in the lottery [en la charada 22 no es pato]." [laughter]    Unidentified speaker: "Frog plays 22."    Castro: "Frog? No it cannot be. Goats play 28? I used to  play  the lottery. I believe someone suggested the establishment of a  national lottery to solve the budget problem. I do not know if  they want to include the illegal lottery [bolita] as well. We  must respect the comrade's idea. I do not wish to hurt his  feelings, I am just citing his idea as an example. When the  provincial meetings were held, all this was discussed.    "Alarcon, analyze this idea thoroughly and decide if your  deputies need a break, or if they can continue. If you think  they want to continue, we will continue, otherwise we will take  a short recess so that everyone can make a technical stopover.  Then we can continue to talk about all this."    Ricardo Alarcon declares a 20-minute recess. When the  meeting  resumes, Alarcon recognizes and gives the floor to Carlos Lage  who wishes "to make a specific proposal." Lage supports Jose  Luis Rodriguez' statement on the amount of money owed among the  various enterprises. He asks that a list be made with the names  of the enterprises and the amounts owed by them and owed them  for these to be "discussed at the extraordinary meeting."    At approximately 0500 GMT, Alarcon asks the deputies if they  wish to speak or would rather wait until the extraordinary  session is held. The deputies relinquish their right to speak  and Alarcon begins to summarize Castro's views on the various  topics, suggesting that all debates be postponed until the  extraordinary session. He asks that the deputies study what has  been said and be prepared to continue these debates "when we  take up the subject again at the extraordinary session."    The second ordinary session of the ANPP concludes at  approximately 0520 GMT with the singing of the national anthem.</p>

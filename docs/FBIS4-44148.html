			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by </F> Guenter Schmidt at the EU summit in Corfu on 25 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Schmidt] Mr. Chancellor, in the days preceding  this trip to Corfu, there was a controversy over competence in  Austria. Do you have the impression that this controversy  affected the work here and, in particular, the goodwill Austria  had in Europe after the success in the referendum?    [Vranitzky] No, it has not had an affect. This so-called  competence discussion was conducted only by a few people in  Austria and was unduly exaggerated in the media. For me, this  has not been a discussion. We have done our job here in Corfu,  and we have done it in the interest of our country, which was  our duty. This is the main subject that one should discuss.    [Schmidt] In St. George's Chapel, where you signed the  treaty yesterday, one could hear many friendly and positive  words about Austria and about the role Austria can play in  Europe in the future. What is your overall impression? Where  these mainly Sunday speeches or was there more behind them?    [Vranitzky] No, these were certainly not Sunday speeches.  All in all, this EU [European Union] summit, in which we  participated for the first time -- this time still as observers  -- has yielded a most favorable result. It was not just the  signing of a treaty between the Republic of Austria and the  European Union and all its members, but here, for the first  time, a productive meeting has been held between the EU members,  including ourselves, on the one hand, and President Yeltsin, on  the other. An agreement on economic cooperation, peace, and  stability was signed. Second, and this refers to us Austrians,  in particular, one hour ago, the basic document was accepted,  which states that, for example, the major railroad construction  projects -- in our case, this is the Verona- Munich line -- have  been included in the list of EU projects. There was some debate  on the issue, but it was finally accepted. Third -- and this is  of particular importance to me -- for the first time, as far as  I know, the European Union discussed the issue of Chernobyl in  this form. It may not have done so in a way that is absolutely  satisfactory, but at least it was indicated that something has  to be done and that we must defend ourselves against these  faulty power plants.    One must certainly also note with satisfaction what was  decided and discussed with the next Council president, our  neighboring country Germany -- namely to attribute particular  attention to the issues related to internal security. We will  launch joint actions in the sphere of fighting international  crime, narcotics smuggling, money laundering, and many other  issues.    [Schmidt] Mr. Chancellor, you have mentioned the  Verona-Munich railroad connection, which also includes the  tunnel beneath the Brenner Pass. EU projects tend to take a  long time, because they involve much and profound discussion.  What schedule can one expect for this project?    [Vranitzky] We must do the necessary preliminary work at  home, which is what we have done. On 4 May, we concluded a  basic agreement at the level of the federal and Tirolean  provincial government and the Austrian Federal Railways. As far  as the planning is concerned, the work has already started.  This is, of course, taking some time in our own country, too.  Land has to be bought, the authorities must carry out the  necessary licensing procedures, and then there are hearings  involving affected citizens. We do not have to say that the  European Union is taking a long time, because we have to do our  job at home first. Besides, this applies also to the major  projects in eastern Austria. I have to emphasize this again and  again that the transport projects include, of course the Inn  Valley, but not only. Other areas of our republic are also  struggling with heavy and even heavier traffic. There, too, one  has to take the necessary precautions for the future.</p>

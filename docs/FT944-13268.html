			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Review of exam gradings to go ahead Sir Ron Dearing, the government's chief adviser on the school curriculum, yesterday received approval for a sweeping review of the system for grading GCSE exams, taken by all 16-year-olds in England and Wales. He has unveiled a range of measures to be implemented by the end of this year, when the next GCSEs are to be taken, and is also examining more radical measures for the future. The immediate measures are: Ensuring that the rules for determining grades are clear, consistent and robust. Improving communications between examining groups. Producing national sets of candidates' work to help define grade standards in key subjects. Introducing piloting of any important changes to awarding schemes. Sir Ron was given leave to investigate GCSE marking by Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, after discrepancies emerged in the marks required to gain 'B' and 'C' grades in mathematics and science. There is no question of retrospectively altering candidates' marks as a result of this investigation. Sir Ron suggested that in the longer term a national archive of GCSE papers should be set up to guarantee greater consistency in marking between examination boards. The School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, chaired by Sir Ron, appears anxious that there may be too many examining boards. Since GCSEs were introduced in 1988 the government has added the requirement that they test the national curriculum for 14-to-16-year-olds, and more standardisation of different boards' syllabuses may now be required. Sir Ron suggested that exam groups could work together to produce a smaller number of syllabuses and share some papers. The Southern Examining Group - one whose results showed a change in the proportion of B and C grades in maths and science - said: 'We already have the most closely monitored exam system in the world.' Mr David Blunkett, Labour's new education spokesman, said it was 'critically important for the credibility of our examination system' that discrepancies between exam boards were ironed out. He urged Mrs Shephard to 'restore commonsense' by doing away with the 'A-starred grade' for the highest achievers, which was introduced by Mr John Patten, her predecessor. He said: 'Parents, employers and pupils want grades they can understand. An A is an A and a B is a B, and we must stop undermining achievement by complicating the issue with A-starred grades.'</p>

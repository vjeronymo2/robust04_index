			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Ukraine troops 'sent to Crimea' Crimea's rebellious regional authorities last night claimed Ukrainian special forces had occupied strategic and administrative points in the capital of Simferopol and the naval base of Sevastopol in an attempt to impose Kiev's choice of regional interior minister. The reports were denied by the Ukrainian government. The Crimean parliament confirmed in office its own choice as interior minister of the region, and the attempt to impose the Ukrainian candidate was called off. However, Ukrainian officials insisted that the forces of law and order in Crimea fall under Kiev's jurisdiction. A number of Ukrainian officials are believed to have entered the Crimean interior ministry yesterday. The reports on the deployment of Ukrainian troops came from Mr Yuri Meshkov, the Crimean president. They follow weeks of growing animosity between Simferopol and Kiev over the appointment of the interior minister and over the growing links between Crimea and the Russian authorities. Mr Meshkov was elected earlier this year by the large Russian majority in the region on a ticket of union with Russia - a goal which he has since played down but never abandoned.</p>

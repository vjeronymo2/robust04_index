			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Arts: Francesca da Rimini - Opera in concert Riccardo Zandonai's Francesca da Rimini may not be a first-rate opera, but it is one of the best pieces of its kind and the Chelsea Opera Group, which places us all in its debt with regular concert performances of neglected works, made a good case for it at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Saturday. Operas by Puccini's younger and lesser contemporaries have received a bad press here recently - Giordano's Fedora at Covent Garden got a decided critical unwelcome last month - but Francesca, a more deserving cause than any of Giordano's operas, does not seem to have had a chance to prove itself in England since it reached Covent Garden just five months after its Turin premiere in February 1914. Francesca has fared better elsewhere: it is done from time to time in Italy, the Metropolitan Opera revived it ten years ago, and it turns up next month at the Bregenz Festival. D'Annunzio's late-Romantic elaboration of the story from Dante's Inferno gave Zandonai (who died 50 years ago this month) rich scope for atmospheric writing. Francesca is thickly scored - consistently colourful, seldom cloying - and the orchestra rose to it, despite some tentative playing in the 'silent love duet'. The chorus projected the battle music - irrelevant, but a spectacular diversion - effectively. Though the lush score substitutes melodramatic gesture for dramatic urgency, Nicholas Braithwaite conducted a lively, loving performance. In the title role, Hannah Francis gave an expressive performance, using her creamy soprano to make the most of the character's surprisingly undramatic music. The three brothers in the plot were all clearly characterised: the tenor Richard Berkeley-Steele (ENO's recent Lohengrin) sang Paolo, the handsome brother with whom Francesca falls in love, with plenty of unforced tone; the brutal Gianciotto, who Francesca is tricked into marrying, was taken with vivid power by the bass Phillip Joll; and the unpleasant Malatestino, who out of jealousy alerts Gianciotto to the lovers, was sung with tenorial venom by Gareth Lloyd. Two soprano ladies-in-waiting, Jillian Foster as Garsenda and Helen Astrid as Biancofiore, stood out from the rest of the large cast for their lively performances.</p>

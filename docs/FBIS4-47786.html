			<p>BFN     [Text] Massive international and local support is building  up for the acceptance of Liberia's newly appointed foreign  minister, Mrs. D. Musuleng-Cooper, in the transitional  government. Local press reports in Monrovia itself are calling  on the Council of State to immediately accept Mrs. Cooper's  appointment, to accelerate the peace process.    In its yesterday's editorial, the independent EYE newspaper  said it is frankly not in agreement with the decision of the  Council of State to appoint a neutral person to head the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The EYE newspaper said any attempt  to do so by the Council of State would be in contravention of  the Cotonou Accord, which gives the parties the right to  distribute cabinet posts after consultation among themselves.    The EYE editorial said it is of the belief that the council  can be forceful in pinning down the parties to reach an  agreement on the issue, instead of circumventing the accord.  The newspaper then asked if the Council of State feels it has  the power to appoint cabinet minister -- then why didn't it do  so ever since. The EYE editorial continued: If it is true that  such a thing were agreed to have prompted the NPFL [National  Patriotic Front of Liberia] to withdraw Counselor Momolu Sirleaf  and replace him with Mrs. Musuleng-Cooper, then it is fair  enough to accept the conditions agreed upon. Doing otherwise  will only show bad intention, which will certainly create  problems for the peace process, the paper said.    The EYE newspaper said it suspects problems will develop if  attempts are made to outmaneuver others on what has been  negotiated and agreed. The paper then implored the Council of  State to be bold and act without committing itself to  consciously breech the Cotonou Accord.    Meanwhile, the man representing the NPFL in the Council of  State, Vice Chairman Isaac Musa, has asserted that Mrs.  D.Musuleng-Cooper will not be changed by the Council of State.  Vice Chairman Musa said the Cotonou Agreement does not give any  right to the council to reject any nominee from the party.    On the question of appointing a neutral person to the  Foreign  Ministry, Mr. Musa repeated that, directly or in directly, all  Liberians took part in the war, and will therefore not go along  with the council's decision to reject the NPFL nominee. Vice  Chairman Musa noted that our people have suffered too long,  saying the council should try to find means of ending the war  and see how displaced people and the refugee problem can be  solved. He said the council is wasting time on issues that have  been dealt with. Vice Chairman Musa said prices of local  commodities on the local market are very high, noting that the  council should do something to handle such problems.    Meanwhile, the leadership of the NPFL says any drift in the  Cotonou peace accord could lead to a total breakdown on the  peace process. The NPFL says Council Chairman David Kpomakpor  should stop making decisions without the knowledge of other  members of the council, saying this is unacceptable. The leader  of the NPFL, Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor, has repeatedly asserted  that the council has no dismissing or firing powers.</p>

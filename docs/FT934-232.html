			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Receivers urge move to fund job cuts Two of Britain's leading insolvency specialists have called for the creation of statutory company-funded schemes to finance redundancies when companies run into difficulties, Richard Donkin writes. Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, corporate recovery partners at Arthur Andersen, say that this would allow troubled companies to reduce their workforces when otherwise they might find themselves unable to fund necessary redundancies. The partners, who have handled some of the UK's biggest receiverships including those at Leyland Daf and Ferranti, said they often found that managements had wanted to cut workforces much earlier but had been unable to find the money to do so. The result is that receivers have found themselves bearing the brunt of criticism by unions. In November both partners were censured by an industrial tribunal for failing to meet their statutory obligations over 2,400 redundancies at the Leyland Daf truck plant in Lancashire. Employment law requires managers to give workers 90 days' notice of their severance but none had been issued by the company. The receivers said their priority had been to keep the businesses alive, leaving no alternative but to issue redundancies without the statutory notice. The partners were left in the same position last month when they took over the receivership of defence group Ferranti International and soon afterwards announced 630 redundancies. 'As with Leyland, the company was stuck in this vicious spiral where it had an excess headcount but could not afford to fund redundancies,' Mr Mc-Killop said. The partners propose that a scheme could be devised, possibly based on a company pension scheme or an extension of one, that would cover redundancy payments. 'In order to make sure that it is money that is not frozen it would have to be linked into something such as pensions. The concept is that it would include an obligation to an employee for back-service,' Mr McKillop said.</p>

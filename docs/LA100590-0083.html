			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REDONDO FILES NOISE CHARGES AGAINST EDISON  </P> <P> The city of Redondo Beach has filed criminal charges against Southern  California Edison for allegedly violating the local noise ordinance.  </P> <P> City Prosecutor John Slawson said Thursday that the seven counts he filed in  South Bay Municipal Court this week concern noise from Edison's Redondo Beach  electric plant in September.  </P> <P> He said the charges carry a maximum of $3,485 in penalties and fines.  </P> <P> Sebastian Nola, Edison's South Bay district manager, declined Thursday to  discuss the case. However, he said Edison is spending $2.5 million to make the  local power station quieter, installing acoustic housings and panels around  turbine generators, fans, boiler feed pumps and other loud equipment. Nola said  most of that work has already been done.  </P> <P> But Richard Gould, who lives in a condominium unit facing the power station,  complained Thursday that loud noise from the plant continues.  </P> <P> "It's like you have a dishwasher on your patio running all the time," Gould  said. "It's really annoying. I no longer sleep in my master bedroom. I have to  sleep in one of the secondary bedrooms on the back side of the house. . . .  Last night the noise even woke me up in there."  </P> <P> The City Council, spurred by residents' complaints, decided Sept. 11 to ask  that Edison be prosecuted. The charges mark the second time the city has taken  the utility to court over noise.  </P> <P> The city lost the first case last year -- partly, officials said, because their  measurements did not adequately distinguish plant noise from other sources of  noise. This time, though, officials said, they are confident that sound  measurements were carried out correctly.  </P> <P> "I feel that we have a very solid case," Slawson said.  </P> <P> Arraignment has been set for Oct. 23 before Municipal Court Judge Sandra  Thompson.  </P></p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Dublin brokers celebrate buoyant year for equities - Tim Coone looks at Ireland's high performance This year, champagne corks will be popping at the Christmas parties of Dublin's stockbroking community as never before. After a gloomy 1992, the Irish market has mounted a sustained rally throughout the year, rising by almost 50 per cent. Market turnover is approaching the IPounds 6bn level, almost twice that of 1992, and some 40 per cent up on the previous record high of IPounds 4.3bn in 1987. At this time last year, the ERM currency crisis and speculative assaults upon the punt had driven up Irish interest rates to levels which cast a long shadow over Irish corporate earnings and the domestic equity market. Brokers sighed over their mortgages and their disappearing commissions. But as every cloud is professed to have its silver lining, the 1992 gloom made Irish equities appear very cheap by comparison with other markets. The two main factors which, since then, have driven this year's bull market are the 10 per cent devaluation of the punt last January and an unprecedented influx of around IPounds 700m from overseas investors, nearly matching the cash flow from domestic institutions. The latter has been boosted by the inclusion of Irish stocks in the Morgan Stanley Capital International Index last May, attracting more US funds to the market, and the steady drop in Irish interest rates since the devaluation which has boosted growth forecasts for the Irish economy over the next two to three years, putting it near the top of the EU league table. So can the rally be sustained into 1994? Goodbody, the Dublin stockbrokers, anticipate a 20 per cent growth in Irish corporate earnings in 1994 and a 10 per cent increase in dividends. A robust domestic economy and recovery in the UK and the US, which together account for around 90 per cent of the earnings base of the Irish market, are expected to underpin further growth in market capitalisation into 1994. But NCB stockbrokers in Dublin point out that the 1993 rally has done no more than bring the market back into line, on a three-year basis, with other markets (with the exception of Japan). They, along with other Dublin brokers' reports published in the past month, warn of the risk of overseas profit-taking in the not-too-distant future, with the spring targeted as the market high. While overseas interest in the Irish market has been welcomed by brokers and corporate executives alike, as a counterbalance to Irish institutions continuing to move into overseas markets with the final removal of all exchange controls at the start of the year, there is a recognition that overseas holdings of Irish equities are more speculative and therefore more volatile. Forecasts for 1994 vary between a more modest high of 20 per cent growth in the ISEQ index from Davys stockbrokers, to a low of 12 to 14 per cent from Goodbody. NCB come in between at 17 per cent. NCB expects Irish industrial stocks to outperform financial issues in the second half of the year. Riada, the stockbrokers, also opt for a 17 per cent growth forecast. Mr John Clarke, an analyst with Riada, says: 'The growth in 1993 has been within historical parameters and has come from a low base. On a price/earnings ratio basis, the market still looks cheap. We have not run ahead of the others.' The prospective 1994 for Irish equities, according to all these brokers, is somewhere around the 13 mark. Market forces at work during the coming year, counteracting lower overseas interest, will be greater liquidity in the domestic market and fewer cash calls from Irish companies. Fundings and placings of around IPounds 700m this year have absorbed most of the domestic cash flow to Irish institutions. But only IPounds 350m to IPounds 400m is expected to be called for in 1994. Brokers point out that Irish quoted companies are well capitalised in the case of the banks and financial institutions, while the industrial stocks are lowly geared and have a relatively healthy dividend cover - 2.4 for the Irish market compared to 2.0 and below for many of the others. While cash flow into institutional unit funds is still only at a trickle, it is expected to increase through 1994 as interest rates fall to an anticipated 5 per cent by the year-end. So while market buoyancy is expected to result in a moderate demand for funds for expansion and opportunistic reasons, this 'will not cause any major digestion problems for the market', according to one of Dublin's leading brokers. That said, whether brokers will be breaking open the champagne a year from now remains to be seen.</p>

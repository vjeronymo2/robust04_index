			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Yerevan, April 12 (SNARK)--Last night two  Azerbaijani military planes dropped bombs on the large  industrial centers Goris and Kapan in the south of Armenia. As  SNARK was informed in the Defence Ministry today, there is some  destruction in the suburbs of Kapan. According to the  preliminary data, there are no fatalities.    The Armenian Air-Defence Service tried to prevent the  air-raid, but the Azerbaijani planes, flying at low altitude,  managed to get away.    Over the last 48 hours this was already the third attack of  the Azerbaijani Army at the cities of Nagorno-Karabakh and  Armenia, located far from the confrontation line.    Yesterday Levon Zurabyan acting in the capacity of the  Armenian President's press-secretary in his interview to SNARK  qualified those actions as terrorist acts against the peaceful  population, caused by Azerbaijan's disability to succeed at the  battle field.

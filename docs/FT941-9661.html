			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Sixty die in clan battles in Somali port About 60 people have been killed and more than 5,000 others driven out of Somalia's southern port city of Kismayu in fierce battles between rival Somali clans, Reuter reports from Nairobi. The Somali Salvation Alliance, a group of 12 factions aligned to Ali Mahdi Mohamed, blamed the clashes on Mr Mahdi's rival, south Mogadishu warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed. Gen Aideed's spokesman denied the charges and said he had condemned the latest violence. Gunmen yesterday ambushed a UN convoy in Mogadishu and killed an Egyptian soldier. Other gunmen kidnapped two Italian aid workers in central Somalia.</p>

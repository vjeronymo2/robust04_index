			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH CALLS FOR SOVIET OPENNESS;  </P> <P> URGES GORBACHEV TO TAKE SPECIFIC MOVES TO BETTER RELATIONS  </P> <P> President Bush, declaring that "a new breeze is blowing across the steppes and  the cities of the Soviet Union," challenged Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev on Friday to make concrete moves now toward a new openness with the  West, including Kremlin agreement on allowing unarmed spy planes to fly over  the countries of the Eastern and Western alliances.  </P> <P> In his first major speech on the Administration's view of relations with the  Soviet Union, Bush expressed encouragement -- tempered with caution -- about  the prospects for greater cooperation between the superpowers.  </P> <P> He unveiled a series of tit-for-tat proposals intended to push the Kremlin  toward a more open society, matched by reciprocal gestures from the United  States, following much the same course as former President Ronald Reagan did.  </P> <P> "A new relationship cannot be simply declared by Moscow or bestowed by others,"  the President said in a commencement address at Texas A&amp;M University.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Promises Not Enough  </P> <P> Specific deeds are now necessary, he said, because "promises are never enough."  </P> <P> Bush's address summed up the results of a four-month Administration review of  the U.S.-Soviet relationship. It provided the first pronouncement of policy on  the East Bloc and offered a framework for future proposals as well as a  counterpoint for recent Soviet overtures on arms reductions.  </P> <P> Sounding a note of wariness about the true depth of the reforms sweeping the  Soviet Union, Bush said: "The Soviet Union has promised a more cooperative  relationship before, only to reverse course and return to militarism. Soviet  foreign policy has been almost seasonal -- warmth before cold, thaw before  freeze."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Chill of Distrust'  </P> <P> In the United States, he said, "We seek a friendship that knows no season of  suspicion, no chill of distrust."  </P> <P> Many of the steps Bush proposed are already being undertaken to some degree by  Moscow or have been promised as the Soviet Union undergoes the political  openings of Gorbachev's glasnost campaign and perestroika, the economic  restructuring of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> In the address, Bush called on the Soviets to:  </P> <P>  -- Reduce their military forces. In December, Gorbachev announced a 10% cut in  Soviet armed forces personnel, and on Thursday he told Secretary of State James  A. Baker III in Moscow that he would remove 500 nuclear warheads from Eastern  Europe. Bush said that the Warsaw Pact has more than 30,000 tanks, more than  twice the artillery of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations and  hundreds of thousands more troops. "They should cut their forces to less  threatening levels," he said.  </P> <P>  -- Allow self-determination for all the nations of Central and Eastern Europe.  In a symbolic move, a section of barbed wire on Hungary's border with Austria  was torn down by Hungarian troops earlier this month. "One day it should be  possible to drive from Moscow to Munich without seeing a single guard tower or  a strand of barbed wire. In short, tear down the Iron Curtain," Bush said.  </P> <P>  -- Work with the West "in positive, practical -- not merely rhetorical --  steps" toward resolving regional disputes. The Soviets have withdrawn troops --  but not military supplies -- from Afghanistan and worked with the United States  to oversee an agreement to withdraw Cuban troops from Angola. While saluting  such efforts, Bush said, "there is much more to be done."  </P> <P>  -- Establish lasting political pluralism and respect for human rights in the  Soviet Union. Praising the "limited, but freely contested, elections" and the  "greater toleration of dissent" there, Bush said: "Mr. Gorbachev, don't stop  now."  </P> <P>  -- Join the United States in fighting environmental problems and "the  international drug menace."  </P> <P> The President's proposals reflected an effort to join more aggressively in the  battle for international favor between Moscow and Washington. In recent months,  Gorbachev has served up one proposal after another for wider cooperation and a  reduced military threat, while Bush has held back and awaited completion of  in-depth studies of the United States' relations around the world.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Idea Raised by Eisenhower  </P> <P> The President's proposal to open the skies of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact  nations, as well as those of NATO members, to surveillance flights reached back  to an idea posed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1955. It was rejected at  that time by the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "Let us again explore that proposal," Bush said. ". . . Such unprecedented  territorial access would show the world the true meaning of the concept of  openness. The very Soviet willingness to embrace such a concept would reveal  their commitment to change."  </P> <P> He said that the flights "would provide regular scrutiny for both sides."  </P> <P> But Administration officials, including retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Brent  Scowcroft, the President's assistant for national security affairs, and a  senior Pentagon official described such a move as primarily symbolic.  </P> <P> Spy satellites already provide virtually all of the intelligence that such  overflights would offer, they said.  </P> <P> The White House said that the idea has not been explored in detail with the  NATO allies. Scowcroft indicated that it has been presented to the Soviets, who  have not yet responded.  </P> <P> In seeking greater U.S.-Soviet economic cooperation, Bush offered a broader  trade relationship, which he said in the past was "stifled by Soviet internal  policies" and efforts to steal Western technology under "the cloak of  commerce."  </P> <P> He said that he would work with Congress to temporarily lift a 1974 U.S. trade  sanction denying special benefits to the Soviet Union if that nation codifies  and enforces its emigration laws to guarantee that citizens seeking to leave  can do so.  </P> <P> The Jackson-Vanik Amendment denied the Soviet Union "most-favored-nation"  status, which would give it the same trade preferences and tariff concessions  that the United States extends to most major trading partners.  </P> <P> A White House official, noting a recent upsurge in Soviet emigration, said that  departures had reached 87,000 in 1988, including 19,000 Jews, and that in the  first three months of this year, Soviet citizens were being allowed to emigrate  at the rate of 9,700 a month -- a rate well above last year's. In the peak  year, 1971, 51,000 Jews were allowed to leave, a White House official said.  </P> <P> While much of the U.S.-Soviet relationship has been built on arms control,  there were no new proposals from Bush in this field.  </P> <P> But Scowcroft, speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One as Bush flew here  from Washington, was critical of Gorbachev's proposal to remove 500 nuclear  warheads from Europe. He said that the offer was "designed principally to  create problems" within the Atlantic Alliance.  </P> <P> The proposal was made as NATO leaders are about to gather at a 40th anniversary  summit at the end of the month, torn by a West German proposal to move toward  speedy negotiations with the Warsaw Pact to limit short-range nuclear forces in  Europe. The United States objects to such a plan out of concern that it would  leave the West at a disadvantage in the military balance because of the Soviet  Bloc's superior conventional forces.  </P> <P> Reflecting on the impact that the changes in the Soviet Union have had on NATO,  Scowcroft said: "The glue which has held the alliance together . . . has been  the kind of overwhelming threat from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "Now as the perception of that threat diminishes, then the glue tends not to be  there, and what we need to do is to replace it by a sense of mission for the  alliance itself for the future," he said.  </P> <P> The President's speech was the first of three commencement addresses he is  giving this weekend. He is scheduled to deliver two more speeches in  Mississippi today. And, leading up to the NATO summit in Brussels on May 29-30,  he will speak on additional foreign policy subjects at Boston University and  the Coast Guard Academy over the next two weeks.  </P></p>

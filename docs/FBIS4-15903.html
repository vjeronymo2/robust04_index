			<p>BFN     [Text] We have learned from reliable sources that the  situation in Zugdidi Rayon has been aggravated recently by a  campaign conducted in Gali Rayon by Abkhaz separatists. The  Abkhazians are trying to persuade the local population to  influence their relatives, who fled to Zugdidi and neighboring  areas, to return to Gali Rayon. They say the tragedy which took  place in Gali Rayon was just a misunderstanding between the  Abkhazians and Mingrelians and that it is necessary to restore  traditional kinship ties between them.    At the same time, the Abkhazians promise to introduce the  Mingrelian language [spoken by Georgians in Mingrelia and  Abkhazia] in Gali Rayon schools and to register the local  population as Mingrelians. Refugees who have returned to Gali  Rayon were issued with a so-called registration card, giving  their nationality as Mingrelian.    It seems that the agreements on the return of the refugees  and on a peaceful settlement of the problem of Abkhazia reached  at the recent talks have caused anxiety among the most extreme  Abkhaz separatists. Therefore, they resorted to the dirtiest  trick of all and decided to pit the population of Mingrelia  against the rest of Georgia.</p>

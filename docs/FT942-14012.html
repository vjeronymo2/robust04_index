			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Gore offers greenhouse warning Global climate change is more dangerous to the US than the British navy was to the American colonists in their war of independence, Vice-President Al Gore warned yesterday in a call for more action to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. 'Our enemy is more subtle than the British fleet. Climate change is the most serious problem our civilisation faces,' Mr Gore told government and business officials working on climate change issues, who he described as 'the Paul Reveres of the environmental movement'. But as Mr Gore issued his warning, scientists were questioning whether the US was doing enough to reduce its own emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which are widely believed to contribute to global warming. The US, like other signatories of the Global Climate Treaty agreed in Rio de Janeiro two years ago, is committed to bringing emissions of greenhouse gases down to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The US produces around one fifth of the world's greenhouse gases.</p>

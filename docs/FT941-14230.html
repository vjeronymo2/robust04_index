			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Gas users predict tighter regulation The Gas Consumers Council has predicted that regulation of the gas supply industry will need to be tightened as the domestic monopoly controlled by British Gas is opened to full competition in 1998. Mr Ian Powe, council director, will tell a conference today that Ofgas, the industry regulator, will have to oversee the sector's transition away from the present regulatory regime under which government bodies from the Department of Trade and Industry to the Office of Fair Trading have occasionally conflicting roles in the sector to one of 'controlled competition' in which Ofgas should be the sole authority. He adds: 'Whether we like it or not, we are going to see more regulation, not less, as competition grows.' He says the main challenge for Ofgas will be to hold down prices to the consumer while managing the transition of the industry to a strict cost-related structure to encourage competition and consumer choice. Mr Powe attacks British Gas in his speech, accusing it of 'scaremongering' during last year's debate on the future of the industry. He rejects the notion that consumers should pay for British Gas' corporate reorganisation years, and warns against relaxing the present price-setting arrangement, based on on the retail price index minus five percentage points.</p>

The newspaper AL-'IRAQ reported today that the people of  Rawandoz in the Irbil Governorate recently staged demonstrations  to express their resentment and to protest their deteriorating  living conditions. They also protested their intense suffering  as a result of the services, administrative, and health problems  they have been experiencing for the past two years due to the  corruption of the agent and subversive cliques and their theft  of the economic, health, and service infrastructures in the  Kurdistan region, which were built by the 17-30 July revolution.    The paper said that the demonstrators chanted slogans about  the Kurds' poverty and inability to obtain their food  requirements, saying: "We want bread. We want freedom." This  prompted the agent and subversive cliques to open fire on the  demonstrators to frighten and disperse them, the paper added.</p>

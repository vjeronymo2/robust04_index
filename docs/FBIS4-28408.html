			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Folly of Puppet Precipitating Self-Destruction" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim  Yong-sam called a "meeting of the National Security Council" on  June 8 and let out a string of bellicose words over the "nuclear  issue" of the North, crying that "a tough action for a solution  through UN sanctions" must be taken now and "there is no other  solution to the nuclear issue of the North but sanctions",  according to a radio report from Seoul.    His outburst is a malicious challenge to the North and an  anti-national criminal act that cannot be overlooked.    The Kim Yong-sam clique is crying for "sanctions" against  the  North more hysterically than outside forces.    The puppets are foolishly trying to increase the intensity  of  pressure and "sanctions" against the North by misleading  unbiased public opinion with outcries over "challenge". But  this is of no use and pressure and "sanctions" have no effect on  us. Such method cannot lead to a solution to the issue but may  drive the situation to a catastrophe.    It is a gross mistake, if they intend to attain their mucky  political aim through "sanctions" against fellow countrymen,  joining hands with outside forces, clean indifferent to the  interests of the nation.    The Kim Yong-sam clique must clearly know that should they  choose an adventure, pinning hope on the notion of "not by any  possibility", it will bring the "civilian" regime to destruction.</p>

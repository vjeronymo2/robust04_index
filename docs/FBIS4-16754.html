			<p>BFN     [Text] Boris Nemtsov remains the governor of the Nizhniy  Novgorod region in Povolzhye. At the same time, President Boris  Yeltsin dismissed Nemtsov from the post of presidential  representative in the Nizhniy Novgorod region which he had so  far combined with the post of governor. This was reported to  INTERFAX by Yevgeniy Krestyaninov, who was appointed by Yeltsin  as presidential representative in the Nizhniy Novgorod region.    Krestyaninov was chairman of the former Nizhniy Novgorod  regional council of people's deputies. Together with Nemtsov on  December 12, 1993, he was elected a member of the Federation  Council of the Federal Assembly from the Nizhniy Novgorod region.    According to Krestyaninov, he was recommended to the post of  the presidential representative by Nemtsov. "Our region was the  only one where the posts of the presidential representative and  the governor were combined," he explained.    Krestyaninov noted that he and Nemtsov had good business  relations which he hopes will promote further development of  constructive relations between the Nizhniy Novgorod region and  the federal authorities. In the meantime, the press attache of  the Nizhniy Novgorod regional administration Mikhail Levin told  INTERFAX that Nemtsov himself proposed to dismiss him as the  presidential representative in the Nizhniy Novgorod region.    He was appointed as presidential representative in the  region  by Yeltsin's decree in the autumn of 1991. Later by another  decree Nemtsov was appointed the governor of the Nizhniy  Novgorod region, in contradiction of the previous decision.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Nocil profits slip to Rs50m NATIONAL Organic Chemicals Industries (Nocil), the Indian petrochemical group in which Anglo Dutch oil group Royal/Dutch Shell holds 33.3 per cent and the local Mafatlal Group holds 14 per cent, suffered a first-half setback, writes R. C. Murthy. Net profits slumped by nearly two thirds to Rs49.8m (Dollars 1.75m) in the six months to September 30, from Rs132.2m a year earlier, on sales marginally ahead at Rs2.72bn against Rs2.7bn. Gross profits fell to Rs182.7m from Rs378.9m. Shell has given Nocil the go-ahead for the first phase of a Rs4.32bn convertible bond issue to finance the building of a Rs30bn naphtha cracker.</p>

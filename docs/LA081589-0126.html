			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POLISH LEADER CALLS MEETING TO END CRISIS;  </P> <P> SOLIDARITY WILLING TO FORM GOVERNMENT WITH COMMUNISTS  </P> <P> President Wojciech Jaruzelski called today for an urgent meeting to end  Poland's political deadlock, and the Solidarity opposition said it was ready to  form a government with Communist participation.  </P> <P> Jaruzelski said he wanted all Poland's main political groups to meet as soon as  possible and break the crisis that flared Monday when Prime Minister Czeslaw  Kiszczak gave up his efforts to create a Communist-led administration.  </P> <P> Solidarity leader Lech Walesa softened his previous terms for entering a  coalition government by saying the opposition would accept a deal that allowed  the Communist Party to keep the defense and interior ministries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rising Concern in Moscow  </P> <P> "The most important ministries which are the base of the physical continuity of  the state should stay in the hands of the Communist Party," Walesa told  reporters at his home in the Baltic port of Gdansk.  </P> <P> Walesa's statement sought to ease rising concern in Moscow over Poland's  crisis. The Soviet newspaper Pravda, in its first attack on Walesa in the  current turmoil, criticized him Monday for refusing to join a Communist-led  government.  </P> <P> Walesa said Solidarity had no intention of taking Poland out of the Soviet-led  Warsaw Pact military alliance. He said the opposition wanted to run economic  ministries in order to implement reforms of which the Communists were  incapable.  </P> <P> Kiszczak, the first Eastern European Communist leader to declare that he could  not form a government, said Monday he was handing the task to Roman Malinowski,  leader of the United Peasants' Party.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Obedient Allies  </P> <P> The UPP and the Democratic Party are two small parties that have been obedient  allies of the Communists since the 1940s. In the current climate of rapid  reform, they have made clear they want a more independent role.  </P> <P> Walesa called last week for a wholly non-Communist government uniting  Solidarity with the UPP and the Democratic Party. But Solidarity sources said  the union's main concern had been to stop Kiszczak from installing his own team  in office.  </P> <P> Kiszczak was unacceptable to Solidarity because, as a former interior minister,  he was Jaruzelski's right-hand man in 1981 when the authorities imposed martial  law and interned thousands of union activists.  </P> <P> Under the deal being hammered out by Solidarity and the non-Communist parties,  the opposition would nominate a prime minister and the UPP would have the  foreign ministry, with the Communists taking care of Polish-Soviet security  affairs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Important Power Brokers  </P> <P> The UPP and the Democratic Party have become important power brokers because  they have 22% of Parliament's seats. Neither the Communists, with 38%, nor  Solidarity, with 35%, can form a majority without their support.  </P> <P> Walesa said he did not want to become prime minister. But "if society wants it,  I must do it. I would prefer to have someone else," he said.  </P> <P> Speaking to reporters, Walesa named Tadeusz Fiszbach, a Communist reformer who  is deputy speaker in Parliament, as one party leader whom Solidarity could  accept as a partner in government.  </P> <P> Solidarity and other non-Communist politicians said the crisis looked certain  to continue because Malinowski, a deputy prime minister under martial law, was  scarcely more acceptable to the opposition than Kiszczak.  </P></p>

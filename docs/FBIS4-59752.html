			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah by </F> Taj-al-Din 'Abd-al-Haqq in Abu-Dhabi; date not given]    [Text] ['Abd-al-Haqq] In view of the fact that you have  rejected mediation in the current conflict, what message are you  carrying for the Arab leaders on your current tour?    [Basindwah] Actually, the leaders in some Arab states have  been influenced by hostile media. The evidence is that they  view Yemen's unity in the same way as they viewed  Egyptian-Syrian unity, and they fail to understand that Yemen is  one country and one people, not two countries and two peoples.    Some Arab countries have also been making another mistake in  that they describe the legitimate forces as the northern forces  and the rebel forces as the southern forces, but the legitimate  forces are forces from all over Yemen. The new defense minister  comes from Abyan Governorate.    That is why I must explain to the Arab leaders the  circumstances and how the fighting started, who started it, and  how the political crisis in Yemen was a prelude to what is  taking place now; and also explain that the crisis was  fabricated in order to achieve peaceful secession, but when that  failed the "mutineers against constitutional legitimacy" used  the military card, hoping that Arab states and Arab forces would  intervene and ask every side to return to its pre-unity  positions.    ['Abd-al-Haqq] So, on your tour, you are not seeking any  kind of Arab mediation and you do not want any intervention in  the current conflict in Yemen.    [Basindwah] Arab mediation would be pointless in our  situation because what is happening now is that the legitimate  authority is confronting rebel elements. We do not reject any  endeavor to bring about a cease-fire provided there is adherence  to international legitimacy and the Constitution, and provided  the rest of the armed forces return to the legitimate command of  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.    The other side is trying hard and desperately for a  cease-fire because it knows that its end is near. Anyone who  believes that what is happening in Yemen is a protracted civil  war is mistaken. What is now taking place in Yemen is a combing  operation.    ['Abd-al-Haqq] When the fighting started you said that the  war would last two or three days. Over 10 days have passed and  the war is still continuing. How do you explain that?    [Basindwah] We have actually discovered that while we were  preoccupied with our own problems the "secessionist" elements  were building fortifications in sensitive and important  locations in the southern governorates in preparation for the  implementation of their secessionist scheme.    Anyway, what has been achieved over the past 10 days  confirms  that there has been great progress and that the legitimate  forces are getting very close to Aden. I believe that the media  have reflected that in their reports and filming proving that  the "legitimate forces" are not far from Aden, some being 20 km  and some 40 km away.    As the commander of al-'Amaliqah forces said, these forces  are waiting for the order to advance on Aden.    Ample proof that the "rebel" forces are on their way toward  surrendering is the fact that their leader announced two days  ago that he was prepared to abdicate power, which means that he  is preparing to flee.    ['Abd-al-Haqq] Do you believe that the current fighting  has eliminated any possibility of dialogue with the Socialist  Party [YSP] leadership?    [Basindwah] I believe that there are some people in the YSP  leadership and grass roots support unity, and we would welcome  dialogue and cooperation with them provided they change their  positions now before it is too late.    ['Abd-al-Haqq] By leadership I meant [Vice President] 'Ali  Salim al-Bid.    [Basindwah] Some leaderships are no longer acceptable, not  even within the YSP. If it were not for the fact that the  circumstances do not allow some of the party's leaders and grass  roots to express their views, they would have taken frank and  specific stands against the party's old leaderships.    ['Abd-al-Haqq] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Middle  Eastern Affairs Robert Pelletreau [title as published] has  stated that, in his view, the conflict cannot be settled by  military means. Do you believe that statement reflects a U.S.  stance regarding the Yemeni Government?    [Basindwah] Pelletreau himself said subsequently that when  he made that statement he was expressing his own personal  opinion, not that of the U.S. Administration.    When he said that the military solution was not the right  solution and that there had to be a political solution, he meant  that political victory required a political solution to  consolidate it.    That is true. When we fight imperialism in any country and  are triumphant against it, such victory must be crowned with a  political solution.    My understanding of Pelletreau's statement is that he did  not  mean that the legitimate forces would not be able to score a  military victory, but he was emphasizing the need for the  military victory to be followed by a political solution. That  stems from the American view of unity as they experienced it  during the war between the northern and southern states. But I  believe that the situation in Yemen is different. There are no  southerners and northerners but only Yemenis divided by  imperialism and the rule of the imams, Yemenis who can only be  distinguished by having been born in one governorate or another.    ['Abd-al-Haqq] The eight-point proposal made by the YSP  leadership has been received with Arab understanding. Is there  any possibility on your part of accepting all or part of that  proposal.    [Basindwah] People alien to Yemen who do not know the  realities of Yemen may show understanding of the proposal. At  any rate, some of these proposals are obsolete and no longer  valid. I believe that the best thing the "mutiny leadership"  could do is surrender to constitutional legitimacy to ensure  that it gets a fair trial, because I do not believe that the  Yemeni people would accept elements involved in the fighting,  and there is no possibility of dealing with them.    ['Abd-al-Haqq] A cease-fire is a priority for all the Arab  states making efforts to settle the conflict in Yemen. In what  circumstances would you accept a cease-fire?    [Basindwah] We do not insist on a continuation of the  shooting, but we will not agree to a cease-fire that would  rehabilitate the "mutineering and renegade elements" or that  would lead to the destruction of Yemeni unity. It must be  understood that Yemeni unity is there to stay and no power can  turn the wheel back. Yemen's unity goes on despite the  suffering. Our people have a right to be united and to unite  their homeland. I do not believe that this is too much to ask.    ['Abd-al-Haqq] It has been claimed that the Yemeni forces in  the north have received military aid from abroad, particularly  from Iraq, and that some elements have been captured. What is  your reply to that?    [Basindwah] My reply to that is that a few days ago we  received a memorandum from the Iraqi ambassador in Sanaa saying  that Aden forces arrested some sailors of two tankers held at  Aden since the Gulf crisis after the sanctions were imposed on  Iraq. Of course, we could do nothing to release these people,  who have been presented as Iraqi elements fighting alongside  government forces. That is a fabricated story and is not the  first story to be fabricated by the media of the "renegade"  elements. They have claimed that there are some Sudanese too,  but we challenge them to produce a single one of those.    Let me give you another example of the false claims made by  the mutineers' media to win the sympathy of the Arab states.  Three months ago, during the political crisis, I received a  message from Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa asking me to  work for the release of a number of Islamic Jihad members and  hand them over to Egypt. He said that they were arrested in  al-Marrakishah area in Abyan Governorate and that Aden's former  governor, Salih Munsir al-Musayri, said that he was holding  them. The Egyptian ambassador brought the message, whereupon I  immediately asked brother Yahya al-Mutwakkil, the interior  minister, to draft a clear memorandum to the former Aden  governor asking him to hand these people over to Egypt.    The Yemeni consul [as published] indeed took the interior  minister's memorandum to the former governor of Aden, only to  discover that there were no such members of the said  organization and that the aim of that fabricated story was to  set Egypt against us.    I raised this matter during my recent meeting with President  Husni Mubarak. That was confirmed in my presence by Ambassador  Badr Hammam, the Egyptian assistant foreign minister, who  verified that the entire story was false and that its aim was to  drive a wedge between us and Egypt.    ['Abd-al-Haqq] You met in Damascus with [former South Yemen  President] 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, and it has been claimed that you  offered him a post in the Yemeni Government.    [Basindwah] That is not true. I did not offer him anything  and I did not discuss any such topics with him at all.    I visited him in the company of brother Faruq al-Sahr', the  Syrian foreign minister, and the reason was that he was in  hospital. I had no offer to make and I had no authorization to  make any offer.</p>

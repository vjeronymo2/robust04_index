			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (15): Looser controls from Beijing - Centre/Provincial relations MR LIU ZHONGLI, China's finance minister, found himself this summer in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces on the south-eastern coast. Sent by vice-premier Zhu Rongji to help in enacting measures to slow down rampant economic growth, he was shocked at what he saw. 'In one place the government was planning to establish ten golf courses,' he said in an interview with the Financial Times. In another, the local government had unilaterally lowered the tax on enterprises, which had in turn reduced the revenue coming to his ministry. Mr Liu and other top officials dispatched by Mr Zhu found that many local governments had used money advanced by Beijing to pay farmers for their produce had been diverted into real estate speculation. The central government was forced to advance Yn2bn to help pay off IOUs given to farmers, which had caused widespread unrest including riots in Sichuan province. The economic boom's wilder excesses, which Mr Zhu has been seeking to curb, are a result of increasingly decentralised management of the economy. Looser controls from Beijing have allowed provinces to develop rapidly and provide powerful engines for growth. Coastal provinces such as Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang have benefited enormously from massive inflows of investment since their economies were liberalised and opened up during the 1980s. However, privileges granted to the coastal regions have prompted other provinces to compete, particularly after Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's leader, endorsed rapid growth early last year. They have sought to boost local economic growth and tax revenues so that they could, for example, finance much-needed improvements in infrastructure. Local authorities which have offered incentives and finance indiscriminately, particularly for real estate development, are a key target of Mr Zhu's measures. This confrontation is likely to heighten tensions which have already arisen because of the widening gaps in living standards between different regions. Money pouring into the booming south for real estate or other investment has actually contributed to a transfer of resources from poor to rich provinces. Statistics show that the provinces which have improved living standards most are those which have managed to: Lower the proportion of state ownership by boosting non-state industries. Intervened the least in micro-management of the economy. Hung on to the most tax revenue. Attracted the most foreign investment. THE BIGGEST source of tension between Beijing and provincial capitals is the breakdown in orderly fiscal relations. Until 1980, all revenues were remitted to Beijing and then distributed back to the provinces according to the spending requirements set under central planning. The various arrangements which replaced that system have degenerated into ad hoc annual contract negotiations with each province, to Beijing's increasing disadvantage. The govrenment is sensitive to these problems and is taking a number of steps to counter it: Inland provinces have been opened up so that they can offer investors the same privileges as those on the coast. Mr Zhu's 16-point programme to rein in economic growth, announced in July, seeks to re-establish macro-economic and monetary control particularly by curbing excessive lending activities of provincial branches of banks including the People's Bank, which is to become a full-fledged central bank. A new tax-sharing system between the centre and the provinces is intended to come into effect next year. Mr Xiao Yang, governor of Sichuan, the most populous province with 120m people including 90m peasants, said in an interview that the Zhu programme will 'be good for the development of economic life because it will balance investment between the provinces.' Asked about political tensions arising out of widening income gaps, Mr Xiao  -who is a firm adherent of faster economic reform - says: 'I think this is a very big problem. The difference between coastal and inland provinces should be narrowed. If the country wants to maintain high-speed development within a reasonable structure, we should find measures to deal with the problem.' Most provincial officials agree that Mr Zhu's measures to deal with overheating are good, but deny that excessive speculation is a problem in their particular area. Mr Lin Dezi, vice-director of the Yantai economic commission, says: 'The influence of the macro-economic controls has not been very great in Yantai. There were a few signs of overheating, but we maintain strict control ourselves on development, so there is no obvious adverse impact.' Mr Chen Zhenggao, vice mayor of Dalian, says 'this is not an austerity programme - this is an attempt to exercise control over finance and things like illegal investments, which would be forbidden even in foreign countries.' However, there are indications that the Zhu programme has aroused opposition in the provinces which have forced its austerity to be toned down. Mr Wei Liqun, secretary general of the State Planning Commission, said Mr Jiang Zemin, China's president and communist party general secretary, and other leaders have been touring provinces since late September to reassure local leaders that controls on the economy will not be too tight. 'Our leaders wanted to see the effects of the macro-economic controls and to reassure provincial leaders. The local leaders didn't criticise the central policies, but they made some suggestions,' says Mr Wei. Economists at the International Monetary Fund, in a recent paper entitled China at the Threshold of a Market Economy, point out that it may be difficult for other provinces to replicate the extraordinary growth of Guangdong province. They note that exports have contributed a large part of its growth, that proximity to Hong Kong and Macao has boosted foreign investment, and that its role as a laboratory for reform has allowed it to be more aggressive in reforming the economy than other provinces.</p>

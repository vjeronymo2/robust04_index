			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Clinton embarks on broad review of US trade laws - Anti-Bribery Act Under Scrutiny THE Clinton administration has embarked on a broad review of US trade laws and practices to root out internal obstacles to American exports. 'We are looking at A-Z,' said Mr Kenneth Brody, chairman of the Export-Import Bank and co-chairman of the inter-agency Trade Promotion Co-ordinating Committee, which is conducting the review. Among laws under scrutiny are the US export control regime and the foreign corrupt practices act, which forbids US companies from bribing local officials. The US export licensing system and the anti-bribery law have long been seen by American business as burdens not borne by their foreign competitors. Export controls are time-consuming, expensive and uncertain. The anti-bribery law is considered vague and ambiguous and troublesome to small companies which cannot afford high legal fees. 'If bribery is acceptable form in another country and every other country in the world accepts that and we don't, what does that mean for our exports?' Mr Brody said. Business lobbyists say it is a particularly critical issue for operations in the former Soviet Union, where US investment is being encouraged but, by most accounts, it is impossible to operate without bribery. The administration is working closely with its business sector to examine these obstacles and to co-ordinate the more than 150 export promotion programmes spread over 19 agencies in the US government. In part, this new pragmatism is a recognition by the administration that this is no longer a world of two superpowers but one in which 'our economic strength will determine our diplomatic and foreign strength,' Mr Brody said. It is also an indication that the US may do more than pay lip-service to the ideal of an open trading system. Many trade experts see exports as the best medicine available for the manufacturing sector, which needs to supply overseas as well as domestic markets if it is to achieve the highest levels of efficiency. The Trade Promotion Co-ordinating Committee, which is headed by Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, was created by Congress last year to produce by next September a strategy to promote US exports and a unified budget consistent with trade priorities. One of its early targets may well be the US budget for promotion of farm exports. The General Accounting Office last year released a study finding that Dollars 2bn, or 74 per cent of total US outlays for trade promotion, went to support agriculture, which comprises only 10 per cent of US exports. The political might of the congressional agriculture committees accounts for the distortion, and it is not clear the administration can alter it.</p>

"Terrorists are criminals. They  must be treated like criminals," Johannes Gerster, deputy  chairman of the CDU/Christian Social Union Bundestag group, told  DIE WELT. "Anyone who commits murder and acts of terrorism  cannot expect special treatment."    The justice minister had repeated the position, which is  often voiced by the FDP, at the inauguration of Chief Federal  Prosecutor Nehm. Gerster countered that in particular the head  of the Justice Ministry should "not" turn the treatment of  criminals "into a media spectacle." The state is in danger of  making itself an "ally" of violent criminals.    In dealing with terrorists, too, law and order, which keep  the door back into society open for everyone, must be the  state's maxims for action. Since the RAF has affirmed that it  intends to continue its fight against society, all means of law  and order must be used against it also in the future, Gerster  said.</p>

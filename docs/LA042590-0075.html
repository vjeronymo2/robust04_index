			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> A Wonderful Life: Jimmy Stewart was honored yet again Monday night, and, with  almost 82 years and more than 70 films behind him, he once again refused to  admit he might deserve it. "I'm just such a lucky man!" the master of movie  understatement said at a fund-raiser for the Film Society of Lincoln Center,  where a sold-out crowd of usually hard-nosed, big-city Easterners paid homage  to him. Testimonials came from George C. Scott, Dorothy Lamour, June Allyson,  Janet Leigh, Kim Novak and Jack Lemmon. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

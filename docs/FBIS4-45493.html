Yu Tak Ching Gloria, a British citizen residing in Hong  Kong,  was detained by Lithuanian customs officials early Tuesday after  a large quantity of unidentified medicaments was detected in her  baggage.    The British tourist was carrying to Poland 23 brands of  tablets and 7 brands of medical oils. After testing 6 brands,  tablets of two of them tested heroin positive and another two  proved to contain cocaine, according to the daily LIETUVOS  RYTAS. Any final conclusions about the nature of the  confiscated drugs have been put off until more thorough tests  are carried out.    The British citizen has been detained for a three-day period  by a sanction of the prosecutor of the Lazdijai district where  the border checkpoint is located. Yu Tak Ching Gloria was  advised to stay at the local hotel at her own expense. The  British Embassy in Vilnius has been informed about the incident.    Two other residents of Hong Kong were detained at the  Lazdijai border crossing earlier in the year carrying  medications suspected to contain narcotic substances. Two women  were detained in each of the previous cases, and both times more  careful tests denied any suspicions. In all three cases,  including the latest, the tourists claimed to be on the way from  Helsinki to Germany. They had all successfully passed the other  Baltic countries.    Illegal drugs trafficking businesses, are in search of new  transit routes through Lithuanian territory, according to the  Lithuanian Border Intelligence Service. It is speculated  residents of Hong Kong and other Asian countries are sent via  Lithuania with narcotic-like substances in order to test the  watchfulness of Lithuanian customs services.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Ramon Velasquez opened the meeting of  mayors this morning, and state decentralization will be the main  topic of discussion. For the first time an administrative  mechanism has been created that allows cooperation and  coordination between central and regional governments. The  value-added tax [VAT] and its application also became a leading  topic of discussion at the meeting.    [Begin recording] [Caracas Mayor Aristobulo Isturiz] We  demand what the Constitution stipulates. The Constitution says  that all taxes must have a common characteristic; that is, they  must be progressive and fair. In other words, people who earn  more should pay more taxes; those who earn less should pay less;  and those who have nothing should pay nothing. That is fair.  The VAT taxes everyone equally. People who earn more pay the  same as those who earn nothing. This policy has critical  consequences because the Venezuelan Constitution still stresses  the role of the state by noting that the state has  responsibilities toward the citizens and that the citizens have  basic rights.    [Maracaibo Mayor Fernando Chumaceiro] The process of  administrative decentralization, which basically had been a  transfer of power from the central government to the state  governments, has been expanded. This is positive progress, but  it is insufficient. Full decentralization takes place once  decentralization reaches municipal levels, and then from  municipal levels to parochial levels.

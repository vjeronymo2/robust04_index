			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Management: Russian ups and downs / A look at Otis's joint ventures in the former Soviet Union Russia may have its political problems, but there is no denying the engineering skills of its workers, according to Rudolf Kunert, senior vice-president at Otis Elevator International. 'They even found mistakes in our drawings - that shows how good they are,' says Kunert of some of the liftmaker's new partners in its four Russian and one Ukrainian joint ventures. Assessing the skills of Russian workers is just one of many management tasks facing a western company planning to move into the former Soviet Union. Otis, part of United Technologies, is well ahead of the game - its ventures, one of which started as early as 1990, already employ about 14,000. The scale and breadth of these operations means that the company's experiences in the former Soviet Union have a relevance that goes beyond the lift industry. Between them, the ventures - Shcherbinka Otis Lift near Moscow, Otis St Petersburg, Rus Otis, Mos Otis and UKR Otis in Kiev - are doing everything from manufacturing lifts and spare parts to servicing and refurbishing old Soviet-designed lifts in provincial cities. There is manufacturing on greenfield sites, as well as in existing factories that have become part of a joint venture. Otis first developed a presence in the former Soviet Union in 1990 when it formed Shcherbinka Otis Lift with what was then a unit of the national liftmaking agency. By 1991, it had two joint ventures, and was looking to expand its presence, based on the vast market it saw for new lifts, and refurbishing and servicing of existing lifts in apartment blocks, hospitals and small offices. Otis's thinking was that it was less likely to be affected by political upheavals than companies selling less humdrum products. As George David, then Otis chairman and chief executive, said in 1991: 'There are lots of national events . . . but meanwhile people eat, sleep and ride in elevators.' This strategy remained intact through the failed coup of summer 1991, the collapse of the old Soviet Union, and the recent upheaval in Russia culminating in President Boris Yeltsin's bloody victory over rebel parliamentarians. The overriding messages to come out of Otis's experience are the importance of recognising both the similarities and differences between western and former Soviet workers, markets and customers and of being patient, rather than trying to force the pace of change. Otis did not see why it should treat Russia differently from other markets in requiring the specialised approach to manufacturing that has been common for two or three decades in the west. Having made commitments to invest in Kiev, St Petersburg and Moscow, it wanted to avoid repetition, says Kunert. Consequently, lifts are being put together in St Petersburg from electronic parts made there, from driving machines made in Moscow and doors and other parts produced in Kiev. This is an alien concept for most of Russian industry, whose factories are used to making everything themselves. Consequently, results cannot be achieved overnight. Now Otis has reached the point, says Kunert, where 'there's something real and tangible at all five of the ventures.' At Shcherbinka, for example, the first lift driving machine passed its quality test only a few weeks ago. There are several reasons why western investors should have a realistic timetable. Organising supplies of materials and components is difficult because there are so few specialised subcontractors in Russia. 'The factories have capacity, but don't have the ability to sell their capacity,' says Kunert. Producing the right mix of local and western skills in the joint ventures also takes time. According to George Channin, Otis' area director for eastern Europe, the Russians' engineering, scientific and maintenance skills were excellent and thus the transfer of western technology into the ventures went relatively smoothly. 'But people with skill weren't always provided with the right tools,' he says. 'The skills gap is greatest in management, sales and marketing and accounting.' The Otis approach has been to appoint a general manager for each venture from the staff of the local partner, and typically to have three expatriate executives. These would be a financial expert, a generalist who can work alongside the general manager and help with sales and marketing, and then - depending on whether it is a manufacturing or service joint venture - a technical or a marketing development expert. The 'twin concept', where the Russian executives works with a partner/teacher, is also used. In one of the companies, for example, there are two financial managers, one expatriate and one Russian. According to Kunert, expatriates are especially needed to help set up an organisation that goes out to sell to the customer. 'In the past, having something to distribute was a privilege - 'If you are nice to me, we'll give you something' was the rule,' he says. It clearly helps if western companies can draw on experience gained in other parts of the world, where at least some of the circumstances may have been similar. To help the joint ventures cope with inflation, for example, Otis has brought in one of its expatriate financial managers from Latin America. The pattern, says Channin, is for Otis to start reducing the expatriate team at the end of the second year; in the longer term, he would expect each venture to have only one foreign executive. Already, there are encouraging signs indicating how the joint ventures are coming of age. Kunert recalls how, in the early stages, Russian managers were very keen to come to the west on training courses. 'Now they are saying 'Please don't put us on too many training courses, we also have to do our job here'.' This self-sufficiency is being stimulated in turn by Otis. 'We were a little gentle in the first year or two,' says Channin, 'but now the local manager is responsible for the training costs and travel expenses in his business plan, so he is more conscious of the costs and benefits, and making decisions accordingly.' Sometimes the similarities between the west and the former Soviet Union are stronger than the differences. The first priority of customers outside the big cities is still to ensure that Otis can deliver on time, and after that they discuss the price. But you might find a similar attitude in a small town in northern Canada, says Channin. As for the lift industry people, you could put them in a room with their western counterparts and they would share the same concerns, says Channin.</p>

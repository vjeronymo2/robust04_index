			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE;  </P> <P> LUGINBILL TAKES DEFENSE TO WOODSHED  </P> <P> The Aztec defense, already ranked last in the country, got a couple of  scoldings from Coach Al Luginbill during practice Wednesday.  </P> <P> "We'd have been better off if we had not even practiced today," an exasperated  Luginbill said afterward.  </P> <P> "I don't know what it was. (Tuesday) we were flying around, and we made a few  errors, but it was Tuesday. Wednesday we should be getting sharper, and we  didn't. . . .  </P> <P> "We've got to come out of it by (Thursday). We've only got one more day. What  we're doing is so simple, it's almost scary. I'm concerned about it, obviously,  because we haven't done this before at this time of year."  </P> <P> Luginbill stopped practice about three-quarters of the way through to chew out  the defense and then got after them again when practice was finished.  </P> <P> Sophomore defensive lineman Vaea Santos fractured his right foot during  practice Wednesday and will undergo surgery today. Luginbill had already  planned to redshirt him. Team physician Dr. Robert Straumfjord also examined  running backs Tommy Booker (sprained ankle) and Curtis Butts (neck  strain/sprain) and cleared both to practice today, according to head trainer  Brian Barry. Both Booker and Butts are available for Saturday's game against  Air Force. Freshman linebacker Jamal Duff (bruised thigh) was cleared to start  running today. Offensive tackle Nick Subis (sprained right knee) and Carlson  Leomiti (bruised foot) is probable. . . . Vickie Larsen, SDSU ticket manager,  said she is expecting a crowd of about 20,000 Saturday. The game with Air  Force, which begins an hour earlier than usual at 6:05 p.m., will feature a  pre-game paper airplane throwing contest and a post-game concert by the group  America as well as an appearance by the Famous Chicken.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RAIDERS: BACK TO OAKLAND;  </P> <P> WIN OR LOSE, THEY THREW THE STATUS QUO FOR A LOSS;  </P> <P> CHRONOLOGY: LINKING EARLY SUCCESSES AND RECENT FAILURES WERE EIGHT YEARS OF  UNPREDICTABILITY.  </P> <P> The agony, the ecstasy -- the Raiders.  </P> <P> It gets so mixed up in this zaniest of organizations. That's how it has been  for eight seasons in Los Angeles, all soaring highs and plummeting lows.  </P> <P> Two years after their arrival, the Raiders gave Los Angeles its only Super Bowl  victory. In the last four seasons before announcing their intention to return  to Oakland, they have failed to post a winning record or make the playoffs, the  longest such slump in their history.  </P> <P> They list seven 90,000 crowds in the Los Angeles Coliseum. They played to as  few as 32,111 -- five weeks before they won Super Bowl XVIII -- and 10,708, for  the first "replacement" game during the 1987 strike.  </P> <P> They got into fights, suits and snits -- with opponents, the league, the  newspapers, and, of course, one another.  </P> <P> A highlight was promotions director Mike Ornstein's punching of executive  assistant John Herrera at camp in Oxnard in 1986. In another organization, it  would have been hushed up, or heads would have rolled. These are the Raiders  and no action was taken, internally. Herrera signed a criminal complaint.  Ornstein pleaded no contest.  </P> <P> Ornstein was fired two years later -- for sounding out the Rams about  employment. Some things Al Davis simply couldn't forgive.  </P> <P> This is how it was, year by unforgettable year.  </P> <P> 1982  </P> <P> Disaster hits right away when the ticket-location procedure becomes hopelessly  messed up, the skeleton Raider front office overmatched by the task at hand. A  former Raider official says it was widely acknowledged that if they hadn't  opened seven weeks late, thanks to that year's strike, they would never have  been ready.  </P> <P> The team lives in, practices in and commutes from Oakland.  </P> <P> The Raiderettes fly down from Oakland, too. They're all Oakland girls, none  from Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The Raiders play their first home game in the L.A. Coliseum Nov. 22. A crowd of  55,060 sees them fall behind the Chargers, 24-0, then rally to win, 28-24.  </P> <P> The Raiders go 8-1, the NFL's best record. Rookie Marcus Allen rushes for 697  yards.  </P> <P> On Dec. 18, they beat the Rams in their return to the Coliseum, 37-31. A crowd  of 65,776 makes this the NFL's first million-dollar regular-season gate.  </P> <P> Regular-season attendance averages only 56,798. However, 90,037 -- with only  651 no-shows -- watch the Raiders' AFC semifinal against the New York Jets.  </P> <P> The Raiders seem headed for a Super Bowl matchup with the Redskins in Pasadena  but are upset by the Jets, 17-14. Jim Plunkett throws an interception to  linebacker Lance Mehl, ending the last threat.  </P> <P> Afterward, Jet Coach Lou Michaels charges that Al Davis, up to his old tricks,  called Michaels on a pay phone outside the Jets' dressing room at halftime.  </P> <P> Davis denies it.  </P> <P> After most writers have left, a man calls the same pay phone and says it was  he. He's in a bar in Queens.  </P> <P> 1983  </P> <P> The Raider players move to Los Angeles but tell anyone who asks that they miss  Oakland.  </P> <P> The team goes 12-4.  </P> <P> Average attendance stays in the mid-50s during the season, but for the  playoffs, the Raiders get 92,434 and 92,335.  </P> <P> In a Super Bowl highlighted by Jack Squirek's interception, Derrick Jensen's  punt block, Ray Guy's leap to catch a high snap, Marcus Allen's 191 yards  rushing, and too many more feats to mention, they squash the Redskins, 38-9,  the largest margin of victory in a Super Bowl until then.  </P> <P> Allen is the game's MVP after a frustrating season, during which he confronted  Davis and asked to carry the ball more.  </P> <P> Pete Rozelle is forced to present the Lombardi Trophy to his arch-foe for the  second time in four years. The world waits to hear what Davis will say after  moving, suing, winning the suit and now the championship of football, too.  </P> <P> Davis, smiling hugely, says, "Just win, baby."  </P> <P> The phrase becomes more popular than "One small step for a man, one large step  for mankind."  </P> <P> Davis also says: "Ah believe the greatness of this team lahs in its fu-chuh."  </P> <P> Lots of people agree. The Raiders have a fine old quarterback, Plunkett; a  highly regarded young one, Marc Wilson; enough depth for two offensive lines;  the greatest cornerback tandem ever in Mike Haynes and Lester Hayes; young  Howie Long, old Lyle Alzado, zany Ted Hendricks, Rod Martin, Matt Millen, Cliff  Branch.  </P> <P> What could go wrong?  </P> <P> 1984  </P> <P> Attendance skyrockets. Four of the eight home games draw better than 80,000.  The season average is 70,023, the team record.  </P> <P> They start 7-1.  </P> <P> They face 7-1 Denver in the Coliseum, with John Elway out and Gary Kubiak  subbing before 92,496, the largest crowd in Raider history.  </P> <P> The Broncos stun them, 22-19, in overtime. The Raiders blow a chance to kick  the winning field goal when fullback Frank Hawkins fumbles inside the Denver  10.  </P> <P> A week later, the Raiders take a fearsome pounding in a 17-6 loss at Chicago.  The young Bear defense KOs Wilson, who leaves with a right thumb injury, then  breaks David Humm's jaw. Wilson returns while Guy warms up on the sidelines.  </P> <P> Wilson's thumb bothers him for weeks but he pulls out of it with a brilliant  game in Miami. The Dolphins come in 12-1 and the Raiders upset them in a wild  45-34 shoot-out. Dan Marino passed for 470 yards. Haynes returns an  interception 97 yards for a touchdown. Everyone thinks the Raiders are back.  </P> <P> But the season ends in a desultory 13-7 loss to the lowly Pittsburgh Steelers  in the Coliseum. The field is a swamp, USC and Notre Dame having ground what  remained of the turf under in a storm the day before. The Raiders try drying it  with a helicopter. Wilson looks so bad, Tom Flores pulls him for Plunkett, who  has been out with a groin injury for much of the season.  </P> <P> The Raiders finish 11-5. With the last game, they've lost their chance to play  at home in the wild-card game and must go to Seattle.  </P> <P> Is Flores worried?  </P> <P> He starts Plunkett.  </P> <P> The Raiders get beaten, 13-7. The Seahawks rush for 205 yards, led by a plodder  named Dan Dornik who gets 126.  </P> <P> Raider defenders point fingers all over the locker room.  </P> <P> "We had no offense, so we got beat," says Alzado. "It's as simple as that."  </P> <P> 1985  </P> <P> Attendance climbs higher still, to an average of 70,360, another record.  </P> <P> The Raiders start 1-3.  </P> <P> Game 4, against the 49ers, is a home game televised in Los Angeles, with 92,487  tickets distributed before the 72-hour deadline.  </P> <P> The 49ers murder them, 34-10.  </P> <P> Defensive end Jeff Stover drives Plunkett to the ground, dislocating his right  shoulder and ending his season. Plunkett is put on the golf cart for the ride  to the dressing room. Equipment man Run Run Jones puts it in reverse by  mistake, giving Plunkett another jolt.  </P> <P> Wilson plays shakily -- his first pass the next week at New England is  intercepted. The team rallies behind its stellar defense and Allen, en route to  a league-high 1,759 yards rushing, plus 67 pass receptions for another 555  yards. Raider insiders still say it's the greatest season a back ever had,  since his line was mediocre.  </P> <P> They finish 11-1. They'll be at home through the playoffs and figure they're  headed for a Super Bowl matchup against the Bears in New Orleans.  </P> <P> In their playoff opener against the Patriots, the Raiders lead, 17-7 -- and  fall, 27-20. Wilson throws three interceptions and misses half a dozen open  receivers. The Patriots score the winning touchdown when Sammy Seale fumbles  into the end zone on a kickoff return.  </P> <P> Millen swats Patriot General Manager Pat Sullivan on the head with his helmet  in a row on the way to the dressing room.  </P> <P> No one knows it, but the Raiders have just bade adieu to the playoffs for the  '80s.  </P> <P> 1986  </P> <P> For the second consecutive year, the draft washes out. The year before, it  started Jessie Hester-Tim Moffett-Stefon Adams. This time, it's Bob  Buczkowski-Brad Cochran.  </P> <P> Attendance remains high: 70,010.  </P> <P> Marc Wilson remains the starting quarterback, Flores having urged Davis to  quash a trade to the Eagles.  </P> <P> Wilson plays brilliantly in a season-opening 40-38 loss at Denver.  </P> <P> A week later, he gets beaten up in a 10-6 loss at Washington.  </P> <P> The Raiders make it 0-3 the next week, losing at home to the Giants. Allen  suffers a sprained ankle and his record string of 100-yard rushing games is  broken at 11.  </P> <P> Allen will rarely be sound again. He has had one 100-yard game since.  </P> <P> The Raiders, though, rally to 8-4.  </P> <P> Wilson struggles until he's pulled at halftime at Dallas. There are reports  Davis sent a note to the dressing room, ordering it. Plunkett comes off the  bench and throws two touchdown passes to Dokie Williams to win the game.  </P> <P> The eighth victory is recorded at San Diego. Allen wins it with a 29-yard  touchdown run in overtime, dragging several Chargers across the goal line.  </P> <P> The playoffs appear a lock. The Raiders will play three of their final four at  home, including games with the lowly Eagles and Indianapolis Colts.  </P> <P> The Eagles stun them, 33-27 in overtime. With the winning field goal in sight,  Allen fumbles at the Eagle 12 and a defensive back runs it back into the end  zone.  </P> <P> The Raiders go to Seattle for what is now a big game. The night before, a  couple of team officials ask Hawkins, the most indomitable of players, if the  team is ready.  </P> <P> Hawkins shrugs and says they have no chance up here. Give that man a cigar.  They lose, 37-0.  </P> <P> They drop their next two, at home to the Kansas City Chiefs and Colts, finish  8-8, and miss the playoffs.  </P> <P> 1987  </P> <P> Excitable Rusty Hilger takes over at quarterback and plays erratically in  victories over the doormat Packers and Lions.  </P> <P> The strike ensues. The Raiders field a powerful strike team, with Vince Evans  and vets Howie Long and Bill Pickel, but are upset by Denver's no-names. A week  later, Evans throws a game-losing interception to San Diego's Elvis Patterson.  When the strikers return, the team is 3-2 instead of the 5-0 it expected, and  everyone in angry at everyone else.  </P> <P> It shows. The Raiders lose seven in a row.  </P> <P> An official is heard in the press box at Minnesota, saying, "Mr. Davis wants a  new quarterback." Exit Hilger, hello Marc Wilson.  </P> <P> Bo Jackson helps end the streak with his 221-yard game at, of all places,  Seattle.  </P> <P> Jackson leads a 34-21 wipeout of improved Buffalo a week later.  </P> <P> Suddenly bursting with momentum, the Raiders wonder if they can finish a  respectable 8-7?  </P> <P> Nope. Jackson goes back to Kansas City where his baseball fans feel betrayed  and boo him. He sprains an ankle, runs off to the dressing room to be treated  but returns for only a few plays. The Raiders lose. Jackson doesn't play at all  in season-ending home losses to the Browns and Bears.  </P> <P> The Raiders finish 5-10, their worst record in the Davis era.  </P> <P> Attendance plummets to 53,727.  </P> <P> 1988  </P> <P> Tom Flores resigns as coach, not under pressure, he says.  </P> <P> Davis goes outside the organization for the first time for a coach: Denver  assistant Mike Shanahan.  </P> <P> Wilson, whose contract is up, is waived after refusing to attend minicamp.  </P> <P> Davis wheels and deals. He gets Willie Gault and Jim Lachey, trades Lachey for  quarterback Jay Schroeder.  </P> <P> Schroeder struggles. The Raiders stumble to 7-8, but need only beat Seattle in  the finale at the Coliseum to make the playoffs.  </P> <P> They lose, 43-37.  </P> <P> Attendance comes back only to 57,480.  </P> <P> 1989  </P> <P> Unsettling reports precede the season: Davis is talking to Oakland and  Sacramento; Davis is unhappy with Shanahan.  </P> <P> The Raiders go 0-4 in exhibitions.  </P> <P> After they beat the lowly Chargers in their opener at home, a taut Shanahan  says they'd had their "backs to the wall."  </P> <P> At 1-3, Davis, who has never fired a coach, cans Shanahan after 20 games and  appoints Art Shell.  </P> <P> The players rejoice at a return to the Raider Way. With Bo Jackson running  wild, they start 4-1 under Shell, losing only when Jeff Jaeger misses a couple  of medium-range field goals at Philadelphia.  </P> <P> With two games left, they're 8-6. One more victory will put them in the  playoffs.  </P> <P> They lose at Seattle and in the Meadowlands to the Giants.  </P> <P> Attendance drops to 51,000.  </P> <P> 1990  </P> <P> Davis finally announces his choice: Oakland, but probably not until 1992.  </P></p>

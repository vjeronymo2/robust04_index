			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Survey of The Principality of Liechtenstein (9): Nicely, thank you - Banking services Foreigners who think of Liechtenstein as an offshore banking centre and tax haven are often startled to discover that the principality has only five banks, all of them locally owned and controlled, writes Ian Rodger. Moreover, Liechtenstein cannot really be described as a banking centre in itself. Rather, it is a part of the much larger Swiss banking scene, using the same currency and, by and large, the same rules. Until two years ago, the principality counted only three banks, Bank in Liechtenstein (BIL), the largest, which is owned by the royal family, Verwaltungs- und Privat-Bank, a bank set up by a prominent trustee-lawyer in 1956, and Liechtensteinische Landesbank, which is state owned. The government long held a policy of rejecting applications for new banking licences on the grounds that the principality was too small and had insufficient labour to staff and supervise any more banks. This attitude was relaxed slightly two years ago in anticipation of the country joining the European Economic Area, and since then, two new banks, Neue Bank and Centrum Bank, have started up. While the three original banks are licensed as universal banks, the main business of all of them is asset management for individual clients, with most referred from local trustee-lawyers. VP Bank, for example, says three quarters of its clients are from outside Liechtenstein. Over the past few years, the banks have prospered enormously from this arrangement. In 1980, the combined balance sheets of the three stood at SFr4.4bn. At the end of last year, the five had combined total assets of SFr22bn. Even the entry of two new banks appears to have been well timed. 'It has been a good time to set up. A lot of money came from Switzerland to Liechtenstein last year,' says Mr Heinz Batliner, chairman of VP Bank. However, the cosy arrangements of the past are about to be jostled a bit. Assuming that the principality joins the EEA, it will have to open the way for banks registered in any EEA country to set up an office in Liechtenstein. Opinions vary on how many EEA banks will choose to take advantage of this opening, but most people think the number will be small. 'In my view, we will not see an influx of credit institutions,' says Mr Hubert Buchel, a senior official in the economics ministry. 'The principle of home country control means that they would be supervised by their home country anyway. And people bringing money to Liechtenstein will probably continue to prefer to put it in an institution supervised by Liechtenstein,' Mr Buchel predicts. Mr Batliner points out that any newcomers would also have difficulty finding adequate staff. BIL, which itself has a large international presence, welcomes the idea of more newcomers. 'We have no problems with more competition. We are present throughout the world. If other good banks come here, that will make us even better,' says Mr Fritz Buhler, chief executive. The more substantial concern is how long and to what extent the principality will be able to hold on to its key advantages as an offshore financial centre - mainly bank secrecy and its very low taxes. The Swiss, for example, are currently pressing the Liechtenstein authorities to accept Swiss practice in terms of due diligence. This would require banks to know the identity of the beneficial owners of all their accounts. Under Liechtenstein practice, this rule is waived if the account has been referred by a registered local lawyer-trustee. Although the difference seems marginal, Liechtensteiners acknowledge that a lot of money has flowed from Switzerland to the principality in the last couple of years since the Swiss tightened their disclosure requirements. In the longer term, bankers suspect that pressure from other EEA countries will build up to raise taxes on the letter box companies to normal levels. That would gradually dry up the flow of funds from the lawyer-trustees and force the banks to become more competitive fund managers. 'We set up a sales department five years ago to sensitise our staff to the likelihood that we will not always be able to count on new clients coming through the door,' says Rene Ott, international director of BIL. In anticipation of joining the EEA, Liechtenstein is updating many of its financial laws. A law making money laundering from drugs or insider trading activity a criminal offence was passed two years ago and will come into effect automatically with the entry into the EEA. The government intends to widen it to cover all types of money laundering. It is also revising its investment fund law, with the hope of stimulating this so far undeveloped sector. And a new law on insurance supervision is being planned. At the moment, the principality has no insurance industry, and some financiers see opportunities in the offshore captive reinsurance field.</p>

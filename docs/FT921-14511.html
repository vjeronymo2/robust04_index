			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Greycoat temporarily loses chief through illness GREYCOAT is losing the services of Mr Geoffrey Wilson, its founder and executive chairman, for a number of months following successful heart by-pass surgery on Monday. The property company's share price has been under pressure in the past fortnight due to rumours that the company was likely to break its banking covenants and that it would not be able to refinance its Embankment Place office block in the bond market. During that time the price has nearly halved. Mr Wilson will take some months to recover from the operation, which was not preceded by any illness. Analysts expect that Mr Richard Guignard, finance director, will take charge in Mr Wilson's absence. The issue will be decided by a board meeting at the end of the week. It is also likely that the company will consider a permanent split between the roles of chairman and chief executive. The company has denied that it has breached it covenants. It said that its Embankment Place bond issue, which is being handled by Dumas West, is progressing smoothly and is likely to be signed at the end of the month.</p>

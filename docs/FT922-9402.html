			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: USAir reaches tentative deal with pilots USAIR said it has reached a tentative agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association on a four-year contract, Reuter reports. The company said the agreement calls for immediate salary reductions for a 12-month period, 'considerable improvements in pilot productivity and cost savings in health care', which will provide USAir with short-term cost savings. It said pilots would receive a series of pay increases at the beginning of September, 1993. USAir said the tentative deal would be submitted to the ALPA executive committee for ratification on May 13. It said it would provide no further details until then.</p>

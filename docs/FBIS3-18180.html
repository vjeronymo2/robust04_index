			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] While Turkey was searching for tolerance and peace  on the eve of the local elections scheduled to be held in 30  days, a distressing development for democracy took place in  Ankara today. With a surprise decision, the Democracy Party  [DEP] announced that it was withdrawing from the 27 March local  elections.    This is how DEP leader Hatip Dicle announced this decision,  which was made following a two-day Party Assembly meeting and  shocked the political arena:    [Begin recording] [Dicle] Following a two-day meeting, the  Party Assembly overwhelmingly decided to withdraw from the 27  March 1994 nationwide local elections, in which we were being  forced to participate only for show after our wings were clipped  under the oppression of the village guards, special teams,  soldiers, and police so as not to become tools of these  anti-democratic policies that aim at eliminating our people's  will.    Despite the importance of the elections, our Party Assembly,  moved by the consideration to assist in the holding of  democratic and free elections, made this decision in the belief  that the local elections have now lost their legality and that  no other alternative was left open to the party. I hereby  announce this to the public. [applause]    [Unidentified reporter] May I ask something?    [Dicle] Friends, I am making the following request from the  reporters: Our party's decision and everything else are found  in these [video shows Dicle holding a two-page statement from  which he read the party decision]. There is no need for  questions.    [Unidentified reporter] There is something missing there.    [Dicle] No, everything is there.    [Unidentified reporter] Is the decision to withdraw in the  form of boycotting the elections, or.....    [Dicle, interrupting] It is a withdrawal from the elections.  This is what the Party Assembly decided.    [Unidentified reporter] So, your electors are free to vote  for any party?    [Dicle] There is no such thing. We had already announced  that our party will cast no votes for any of the regime's  parties. [end recording]    This decision made by the DEP was voted on and adopted after  two-day marathon discussions. The DEP's second consultative  meeting took place at the very time when all the attention was  focused on this party. While the party's provincial and  district chairmen, assembly members, municipal candidates, and  parliamentary deputies were attending this meeting, the public  was still discussing Hatip Dicle's statement on the Tuzla  massacre. Before the meeting, there was talk that the wing  opposing Dicle was going to raise the question of the party's  leader. But, during the meeting the cadre problems were put  aside and the proposal to withdraw from the local elections were  put up for debate. Though the candidates from the western  provinces opposed the decision to withdraw, upper-level party  officials put their weight in favor of a withdrawal. And the  withdrawal decision was made when 36 members of the Party  Assembly joined the leaders.</p>

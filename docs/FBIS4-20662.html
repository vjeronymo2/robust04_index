			<p>CSO     [Text] On the 19th, Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd. made its first  shipment of uranium fluoride VI (UF[.sub]6[/]) produced at  the uranium enrichment factory at Rokkasho-mura in Aomori  Prefecture. The uranium product was sealed into 15 cylinders and  loaded onto a specialized truck bound for the reprocessing  factory in Tokai-mura in Ibaraki Prefecture. This is the first  shipment since operations began almost two years ago. The  industrialization of uranium enrichment has entered into a new  phase.    The uranium products in this shipment are to be used by  Tokyo  Electric Power Co., Kansai EPC, and Chubu EPC. After the uranium  is converted into uranium dioxide at the reprocessing plant, it  will be assembled into fuel assemblies at nuclear fuel  processing plants in Tokai-mura, Kanagawa Prefecture, and Osaka  Prefecture, and will then be shipped to the various power plants  for use as fuel. There are no further shipments planned for  FY93, with the prospects for the next delivery coming in FY94.    Regarding the transportation of this shipment, Japan Nuclear  Fuel Ltd. said, "In the transport of this uranium we satisfied  the country's technological standard from the outset, and  carried it out taking total safety measures, such as forming a  convoy which included escort vehicles in front of and behind the  transport vehicle."    The enrichment factory, which began operations in March  1992,  currently produces enriched uranium at a rate of 450 ton  separative work units (SWU) per year, but they are aiming at  increasing production by an additional 150 ton SWU/year after  April 1994. Ultimate plant capacity would be 1,500 ton SWU/year,  however, permission from the government has only been obtained  for 1,050 ton SWU/year. Operations to produce this level are  scheduled to begin in FY98.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (27): Charges separate them - Closed-end virtues / Investment trusts and unit trusts both spread the risk. But there are important differences, which investors should take into account - Investment Trusts INVESTMENT AND unit trusts both claim to be the best route for people who want to dabble in shares, but who have only a few thousand pounds, or even a few hundred. Both allow you to spread your risks. The trust itself will have a large portfolio of perhaps 20 or 30 shares - a range which, as a small individual investor, you could not possibly duplicate on your own, as the stockbroking charges involved would be prohibitive. But with a pooled investment, such as a trust, you buy a proportion of this portfolio. There may be some bad performers - for example, quite a few fund managers had British &amp; Commonwealth in their portfolios at the time of the company's collapse - but at least they can be counter-balanced by healthy shares. However, there are important differences between investment and unit trusts, which investors should take into consideration. An investment trust is really a listed company that owns a portfolio of shares. It is known as a closed-end fund, because the size of the portfolio cannot be increased by simply selling new shares. Investors can only buy or sell shares among themselves. As with any other company on the stock exchange, supply and demand have an important influence on the share price. Because of this, the price of shares in an investment trust is very rarely the same as the value of its underlying investments (known as the net asset value, or NAV). Normally the share price will stand at a discount to NAV, although if this gets too wide, predators may be attracted. A unit trust is an open-ended investment, which means that its total size is determined by the number of investors willing to buy units, which are bought and sold from the managers. Every time someone buys new units in the trust, the managers need to buy new stock to increase the size of the portfolio; and when investors sell their units the reverse is true. So, when there is a stock market crash, as in 1987, and small investors panic and sell their units, it means that the trust managers have to sell off a substantial part of the portfolio. The value of the units always reflects the value of the underlying investments. The most visible difference between these two forms of collective investment is performance. The accompanying table shows that, on average, investment trusts have tended to outperform unit trusts. Why? One reason is the charges. A unit trust usually makes a front-end charge of between 5 and 6 per cent, and an annual management fee of between 1 and 1.5 per cent for equity-based funds (to be fair, money-market funds tend to have much lower charges). These high charges are used partly to cover the cost of marketing unit trusts. With an investment trust, you pay stockbrokers' commission to buy the trust shares, and the annual management charge is about 0.5 per cent. This means that, over one year, unit trusts invest far less of your money in shares than investment trusts, so that the difference in performance is particularly pronounced. The affect accumulates over a long period, as more of your money is actually invested in the stock market by an investment trust than by a comparable unit trust - in other words, less is eaten away by management charges. Another important point to bear in mind is that investment trusts have more freedom when it comes to how they invest their funds. An investment trust, unlike a unit trust, is allowed to borrow against its assets or 'gear up'. This means that when stock markets are at low levels - as they were, for example, during the Gulf crisis - investment-trust managers can borrow money in order to buy cheap shares. Gearing can be risky, however, in a falling market, as some trusts discovered at the time of the 1987 crash. Unit-trust managers, on the other hand, cannot gear and are often faced with having to sell part of the portfolio when unitholders redeem their units in times of crisis. Investment trusts are allowed to invest in a wider range of shares, including those in smaller markets and in unquoted companies. For example, when eastern Europe started to open up to western investors about 18 months ago, unit trusts were restricted to investing in quoted European companies which stood to benefit from increased trade or business ventures in eastern Europe. Investment trusts, on the other hand, were free to invest in actual eastern European ventures. Obviously such investments are risky. However, given that unit trusts must invest in shares which are easy to dispose of, in case unitholders suddenly liquidate their holdings, investors who are particularly interested in small specialist markets will find a wider selection of funds available in the investment-trust sector.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              AVERAGE PERFORMANCE COMPARED (TO END FEB)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                1     3     5 Sector                         yr    yrs   yrs  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- International capital growth: Investment trusts             -3.3  38.9  79.0 Unit trusts                  -14.2  13.1  33.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- International income growth: Investment trusts              4.8  50.5  94.1 Unit trusts                  -11.3  11.8  27.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UK capital growth: Investment trusts             -8.6  11.1  92.8 Unit trusts                  -12.8   0.5  40.5 UK income growth: Investment trusts             14.1  52.7 106.7 Unit trusts                   -5.3  14.8  69.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- North America: Investment trusts            -10.5  30.5  23.0 Unit trusts                   -9.0  18.2   7.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Japan: Investment trusts             -4.4  14.8  93.2 Unit trusts                  -21.7  -2.3  77.3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Europe: Investment trusts            -12.5  64.1  52.9 Unit trusts                  -15.6  40.0  46.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures are % growth.

This is within the framework of what the PLO  Executive Committee decided in its recent meetings regarding  sending envoys to Western countries to explain its [PLO]  conditions for resuming talks with Israel on the implementation  of the agreement on Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.    A French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said yesterday that  France, who is chairing the [UN] Security Council this month,  was hoping for the Security Council's approval of a resolution  very soon. The spokeswoman raised the [issue of the] need for  the immediate implementation by the Israeli authorities of the  measures taken against the settlers and those to the benefit of  the Palestinians.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Karpov: "Yeltsin and Kohl Have Attempted </F> To Peer Into the Future: This Thought Is Suggested by a Close  Inspection of the Results of the Visit"]    [Text] Bonn-Moscow--It is customary to consider that the  main content of the Russian president's second visit to Germany  was defined by a set of several mutual problems with the tinge  of a row in the making, primarily the withdrawal of the troops  and restitution. It was to these, in the main, that the material  of journalists accredited to the visit were devoted. In actual  fact, the range of issues was incomparably wider. NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA has already written about the jointly formulated  approaches to Russia's membership of the Council of Europe and  its affiliation to the Partnership for Peace, its participation  in the political aspect of the Naples G-7 meeting, and the  expansion of the number of permanent members of the UN Security  Council.    The range of problems lacking a tie-in with the present  moment was not confined to these. The ceremonial act of 31  August in Berlin will definitely dot the "i" in the culminating  stage of Russian-German relations. Will it be conclusive for the  sphere of the Russian Federation's dealings with the rest of  Europe and the world? Yeltsin believes that it could be dotted  in December in Budapest at the meeting of heads of state and  government of the participants in the CSCE. There, the president  believes, it will be essential to harmonize the principles of  the international arrangement on the basis of which we enter the  21st century. Simultaneously Yeltsin's approach will give a good  boost to the more assertive activity of the CSCE, for which  other abbreviations have more often been substituting in the  international arena as of late.    Next year the world will commemorate the 50th anniversary of  the end of World War II, which also could be seen as the  starting position for the building of the new world order. But  there are certain apprehensions as to whether Russo-German  relations might by this time have lost their present quality.  The victory of the Social Democrats, who are currently in  opposition, is expected at the November Bundestag elections. And  much water will have flown in Russia also in this time.  Optimists are rejecting the possibility of a cardinal change in  the foreign policy course of both countries since they are in  exceptional need of one another for a strengthening of their own  authority in the world. Pessimists are certain of the appearance  of a new balancing act. The position of Germany, following its  release from the stigma of vanquished state, will, they  calculate, become tougher and more demanding. In respect to  Russia the arguments will amount to its increasingly distinct  desire to demand respect for its geopolitical interests. There  is no escaping differences under such conditions, it would seem.  But the point is that this outline forgets the objective  prerequisites of the joint actions of the Russian Federation and  the FRG in the international arena. And no political forces can  disregard them. Boris Yeltsin, incidentally, is, by all  accounts, preparing for a change of guard in Bonn. The  invitation to visit Moscow extended to a favorite in the  struggle for the office of chancellor, Rudolf Scharping,  chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and prime  minister of the land of Rhineland-Pfalz, testifies to this. And  this did not, it would seem, appear tactless in respect to Kohl  but testified merely to Moscow's desire, given any political  alignments, to preserve the "special" character of the  relationship with Bonn, which will require serenity and  farsightedness. Nor is there any desire for a loss of the latter  on the Rhine, where a readiness to meet with Russian politicians  of various stripes has been stated--who does not realize that  the political era of Boris Yeltsin is not infinite?    Thus a fitting continuation of what has been started may  perfectly well be expected in the future also. A different  situation could arise in international affairs. One example: The  response to the announcement of Germany's decision to support  Russia in its aspirations as regards the G-7 on the part,  primarily, of the United States and Japan was guarded, to say  the least. It softened a while later, it is true. But the  possibilities of this discrepancy or the other arising in the  future also cannot, it would seem, be ruled out.    The vectors of temporary contradictions could take shape in  other directions also. Removing the chance of their emergence if  only in some is possible only by constant work on the future,  into which Yeltsin and Kohl attempted at the time of the visit  to peer.</p>

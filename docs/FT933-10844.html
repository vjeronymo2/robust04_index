			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Hunt holds line against VAT rebels THE GOVERNMENT yester-day signalled its determination not to backtrack on plans to impose value added tax on domestic fuel but vowed to be more receptive to criticism of its policies. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said he would not favour any 'jiggling around' with proposals to levy VAT on fuel at 8 per cent from next April and the full 17.5 per cent from 1995. But he acknowledged that the plans had been a factor in last week's crushing defeat of the Conservatives in the Christchurch by-election. Speaking on BBC television's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Hunt said the Tories had bounced back from by-election setbacks before because they had been prepared subsequently to listen to what people said. 'We listen or we die,' he warned. 'My view after Christchurch and indeed after Newbury is one really of deja vu rather than desperation. We have been through this before.' Admitting that the government was failing to explain itself effectively to voters, Mr Hunt said: 'We do need to explain things in language that people can understand and we have to redouble our efforts to do just that.' His remarks came as Tory critics of the proposals for VAT on fuel expressed increasing confidence that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would announce a U-turn in his first Budget, which is in November. Mr William Powell, the Conservative MP for Corby, said it was clear there would have to be some reform. 'Everybody knows there is going to be a retreat.' He added that the government was holding its existing line only because it had no choice until it decided what its new line was going to be. Mr Powell - who was one of two Tories to rebel over the government's plans when MPs voted on them in May - said he expected Mr Clarke to use the Budget to make clear that the rate at which VAT would be levied on fuel would be restricted to 8 per cent or less. This announcement would be tempered by a significant broadening of the range of goods on which the tax was imposed. Mr Powell added: 'It is quite obvious VAT will be put on newspapers and magazines.' Meanwhile, a fresh indication of how much ground the government has lost came with the publication of a poll putting the Tories in third place behind the Liberal Democrats. The poll - conducted by MORI and published in yesterday's Sunday Times  - puts the latest state of the parties at Labour 41 per cent, Liberal Democrats 28 per cent and Conservatives 27 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PAROLEE DOUBTED AS KIDNAP SUSPECT  </P> <P> A 48-year-old parolee who was arrested Sunday in the kidnaping of a 6-year-old  Santa Ana girl has been virtually ruled out as the suspect in a series of eight  attempted child kidnapings in Los Angeles County, according to police in three  of the four cities involved.  </P> <P> While Hawthorne police have not made a final determination, authorities in  Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach and Pico Rivera said child witnesses reviewed  photographs of the suspect, Eduardo Uzcanga, and none identified him as the man  who tried to lure them into his blue pickup by telling them their parents had  been injured.  </P> <P> "By looking at the photographs, it was a very strong negative," said Redondo  Beach Lt. John Nelson. "We're not going to just close the book on this guy, but  we're going to have to speed up in some other areas to try to find the right  person."  </P> <P> All the Los Angeles County kidnaping attempts, which occurred between Sept. 13  and Sept. 28, involved a dark-haired man with a mustache who drove up to  children in a blue vehicle, often described as a foreign-made, compact blue  pickup with a white camper shell.  </P> <P> Uzcanga also drove a blue pickup with a white camper shell, but that vehicle is  a full-sized Chevrolet. Also, Uzcanga is considerably older than the Los  Angeles Couny suspect, who is described as being in his 30s.  </P></p>

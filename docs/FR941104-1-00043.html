			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any proposed amendments to the Appendices adopted by the Parties will become effective on February 16, 1995, unless the United States enters a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reservation before that time. The Service will publish a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement such amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments and Decisions on Possible Species Proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Decisions about suggested U.S. proposals discussed in the previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice of January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3832) are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Species Proposals Not Submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Narwhal ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Monodon monoceros <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed that the narwhal be transferred from Appendix II to Appendix I of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CITES. The range of the narwhal is circumpolar in Arctic waters, mostly north  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 65 degrees North Latitude, although it occurs in greater densities in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waters north of the Atlantic than in waters north of the Pacific Ocean. There  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is some north-south seasonal movement in response to climate and ice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development. Between Canada and Greenland, narwhals summer in high densities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the eastern Canadian Arctic and off northwest Greenland, with smaller  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summering groups occurring in many other locations. Narwhals also occur in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some concentration along the east coast of Greenland. There is evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggesting that the populations on the east and west coasts of Greenland  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> belong to separate stocks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three populations of narwhals were reviewed in 1992 by the Small Cetacean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sub-Committee of the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission (IWC): (1) Hudson Bay, including northern Hudson Bay and western  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hudson Strait; (2) Baffin Bay, including the eastern Canadian Arctic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Archipelago and western Greenland; and (3) East Greenland and the Barents Sea.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Hudson Bay stock has been conservatively estimated at 1300 animals. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Small Cetacean Sub-Committee estimated the Baffin Bay stock at 27,580 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42,520. No good estimates are available for the East Greenland/Barents Sea  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population, although it is considerably smaller than the other stocks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Relatively small numbers of narwhals are reported from other parts of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species' range. Because of the difficulty in surveying narwhals, most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abundance estimates for the species have large variances and require careful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Narwhals are hunted for maktag (blubber/skin), meat, and their tusks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maktag is consumed by the Inuit, and meat is (or has been in the past) used as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dog food, although both commodities are also sold on a limited basis. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tusks are utilized domestically for carving, and are sold as souvenirs, either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as carved products or as intact tusks. (Females only occasionally develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tusks.) The majority of tusks taken in Canadian waters apparently remain in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the country, while the bulk of narwhal ivory taken in Greenland is shipped to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Denmark (perhaps as much as 90 percent annually) where much is exported to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other countries in the European Union (EU).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1976, Canada imposed quotas on the take of narwhals, which it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulates by issuing tags to be affixed to each animal taken. Tusks from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these animals that enter trade must have the tag attached to show that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animal from which it was removed was legally taken under the quota system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Greenland Home Rule Government sets no quotas for narwhals and no tracking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except for those animals that enter international trade, and, therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require CITES permits. Since 1985 Greenland has not been a member of the EU,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore a no detriment finding is necessary for the issuance of CITES export  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits by the Greenland Home Rule Government, and for import permits by EU  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> countries under EU regulations, even though the narwhal is an Appendix II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species. However, Greenland sets restrictions on who is allowed to hunt and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the manner in which hunts are conducted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eight comments were received during the comment period, five favoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amending the listing of narwhal from Appendix II to Appendix I, and three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposed to this change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Society for Animal Protective Legislation (SAPL), The Humane Society  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the United States (HSUS), the American Humane Association (AHA), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Defenders of Wildlife (Defenders), and EIA all expressed support for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix I listing of the narwhal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HSUS indicated that Canada and Greenland continue to hunt narwhals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and export tusks in large numbers (Greenland being the largest exporter), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the annual net trade in tusks nearly doubled from 1985&hyph;1990. (Prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1985 when Greenland began issuing its own CITES export permits, the movement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of tusks from Greenland to Denmark was not considered international trade,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore pre- and post-1985 trade figures cannot be compared equally). They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also state that trade figures do not reflect the total numbers of narwhals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken because for each actual take there are three to four injured or killed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animals lost. Even though information is limited, HSUS believe that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reproductive rates among narwhals is low, and that in 1981 the world  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population was estimated at approximately 20,000 animals and declining. HSUS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asserted that narwhals should be listed in Appendix I as a precautionary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure because status information is limited, information on reproduction and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural mortality is lacking, and information on actual numbers hunted is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unavailable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

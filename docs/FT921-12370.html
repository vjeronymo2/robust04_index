			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Construction Contracts: Teignmouth sewage treatment COSTAIN OIL, GAS &amp; PROCESS has been awarded a Pounds 5.65m contract by South West Water Services to install a major sea outfall at Teignmouth in south Devon. The outfall - 2.35km long and 965mm in diameter - forms an integral part of South West Water's Teign Estuary coastal sewage treatment scheme, which is being undertaken to improve the environment in the estuary and to bring the coastal water's bathing quality up to European standards. The Teign scheme is one of over 30 coastal sewage improvement schemes in the company's 'Clean Sweep' programme. The contract will be carried out by Costain Oil, Gas &amp; Process's pipeline and offshore division - formerly Land &amp; Marine. Work at the site will start in early February with the construction of a temporary jetty at Shaldon where the pipe strings will be fabricated. The pipes will be pulled offshore in a trench which will be dredged in June/July. Once the pipe is installed, selected stone backfill and previously excavated material will be placed over it and the trench refilled to original bed levels. Ancillary works include a short landline section and valve chambers connecting into the main collecting system. Consultant for the project is ACER of Plymouth.</p>

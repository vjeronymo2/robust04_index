			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Escom forms alliance with SNI Escom, one of Germany's fastest-growing personal computer companies, is to team up with Siemens Nixdorf (SNI), the loss-making information technology arm of the Siemens group. SNI will buy a 10 per cent stake in Escom during a rights issue due in November, and make between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of the smaller company's PCs and notebooks, according to Mr Helmut Jost, Escom sales director. 'At the bottom line, we will be left to concentrate on sales and marketing, which has always been our main goal,' Mr Jost said. The group, which last year sold 300,000 PCs and laptops, virtually all under its own name, has more than 250 Escom Office retail outlets - about half in Germany - was also negotiating a distribution agreement with the Otto Versand mail order group, Mr Jost confirmed. But it was reviewing other potential partnerships and franchise deals to expand distribution. Although Mr Jost could not rule out SNI increasing its holding, he stressed the 10 per cent level was fixed to ensure Escom could maintain an arm's length relationship. Many of SNI's early problems stemmed from a culture clash between the conservatism of the Siemens group and the entrepreneurial Nixdorf management. Losses have piled up since the 1990 merger, although restructuring helped reduce the SNI deficit to DM419m (Dollars 272m) last year on sales of DM12bn. Escom, aiming for sales of DM1.55bn and about DM30m profits this year, is Germany's second-largest PC retailer after Vobis, and last year had an 8 per cent volume share of the domestic market. The aim of the company's founder, Mr Manfred Schmitt, who will retain a majority stake after the rights issue, is to win a 10 per cent to 15 per cent stake in the European market. According to Mr Jost, this has become more realistic now the company could concentrate on selling. 'We went into the Netherlands last year and became number one within nine months,' he said. Speed is Escom's hallmark. Sales have increased at an annual average of 80 per cent since it was founded in 1989 but its enthusiasm outstripped its ability to finance its ambitions from its resources. Following last year's reversal into a stock exchange quotation via the takeover of the Hako photo and video group, Escom's debts rose to DM251m from DM56m Although the company had no problems with its banks, Mr Jost said, he admitted the Siemens tie-up would make life easier in financial circles. The link with SNI may free Escom's hand in its search for marketing partners. Although Otto Versand remains keen, Mr Jost is not sure computers-by-post is such a good idea. He is unperturbed by this month's arrival in Germany of Gateway 2000, the large US direct-seller.</p>

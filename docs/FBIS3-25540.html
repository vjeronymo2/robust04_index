			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Following the increasing insecurity noted recently  [words indistinct] the assassination last night of Minister of  Public Works and Energy Felicien Gatabazi, the town of Kigali is  practically a ghost town this 22 February 1994. Markets  remained closed, and shops in the commercial area have not  opened, public and private offices are almost completely  paralyzed.    The increased insecurity began on Sunday [20 February] when  unidentified elements barricaded the roads leading to the  Nyamirambo regional stadium in order to hinder the holding of an  Republican Democratic Movement meeting organized by Faustin  Twagiramungu, who is the president of the party. The insecurity  was aggravated yesterday afternoon when members of the CDR,  Coalition for the Defense of the Republic, practically occupied  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, barring all  access to it by road.    The CDR wants to obtain the code of ethics documents that  every political party has to sign in order to take part in the  transitional institutions. As we shall see later, the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation claims not to possess the  documents. The security forces have been able to clear the area  around the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and have freed about 40  employees who had been detained as hostages.</p>

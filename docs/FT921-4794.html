			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Jobs to go as receivers are called in at Monotype MONOTYPE CORPORATION, the typesetting systems company which is one of the oldest names in the printing industry, has been put into administrative receivership. About 100 of Monotype's 300 employees in the UK have been made redundant at the company's base in Redhill, Surrey. The receivers, Mr John Talbot and Mr Anthony Brierley of accountants Arthur Andersen, intend to keep the company's worldwide distribution network while they look for a buyer for the business as a going concern. Monotype provides integrated publishing systems. It produced the initial hot-metal Monotype typesetting machine in 1893, and changed to phototypesetting in the 1950s. The company has an annual turnover of Pounds 30m, but said that after unsuccessful attempts to reduce losses and obtain additional funding, the directors had no alternative but to request its bankers to appoint receivers. Monotype was floated on the USM in 1986 and moved up to a full listing in 1988. In 1990 King Black Associates, a US-based investment group, paid Pounds 34.2m for the company - topping an offer from the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Two of Monotype's UK subsidiaries, GB Techniques and Sinclair Imaging Systems, are not in receivership - although the receivers are expected to put them up for sale.</p>

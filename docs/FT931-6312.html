			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Ashcroft company problems MR JOHN ASHCROFT, former Coloroll group chairman, confirmed yesterday that Survival Aids, the outdoor clothing company which was his first acquisition following Coloroll's collapse with debts of about Pounds 350m, is having problems over refinancing. Mr Ashcroft, chairman of the Cumbria-based company, declined to elaborate. He said rumours that receivers had been called in were incorrect. 'The refinancing had been agreed but there was a bit of trouble,' he said. It had not yet been completely sorted out,' he added. In January, Mr Ashcroft said he had not been happy with Survival Aids' payment situation and was nervous about trading prospects this year. Last month, he stepped down as managing director making way for Mr Hugh Lapham, a former B&amp;Q director.</p>

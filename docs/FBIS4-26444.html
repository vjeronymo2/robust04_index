			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 21 (CNS)--China's State Councillor  and Minister of National Defense, General Chi Haotian, met  Zambian guests today touching the Taiwan issue. He stressed  that Taiwan was one of the provinces of China and the government  of the People's Republic of China was the sole legitimate  government of China. Any move aimed at splitting Taiwan away  from China and practicing the policy of "One China, One Taiwan"  was impermissible.    -- Mr Chi said China appraised highly of the correct stance  held by Zambia on this issue.    -- Mr Chi said China emphasized on friendly relations with  Zambia and hoped the two countries and the two armies would  continuously develop their friendly cooperative relations.    -- Mr Chi also said he was very glad to accept the  invitation  extended by the Zambian national defense minister to visit  Zambia.</p>

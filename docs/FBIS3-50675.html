			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Francilino Diaz; from the "Telemetro Reports" </F> newscast]    [Text] Ray Bishop, Local 907 Armed Forces Employees Union  secretary, has challenged any firm or institution that operates  in the Panama Canal reverted areas to prove that their workers  do not favor either the permanence of the military bases in  Panama or the candidacy of Ruben Dario Carles for president of  the Republic.    [Begin Bishop recording] [Word indistinct] the sectors that  disagree with the position held by the vast majority of the  workers are precisely the managers who are also businessmen. I  even challenge them.... [pauses, changes thought] We represent  the workers of the military bases. We are answering for those  workers, and 85 to 90 percent of them support the candidacy of  Professor Ruben Dario Carles, not only because his political  campaign is based on protecting jobs on the military bases but  also because he is inclined to protect the positive economic  revenues that enter our country due to those bases. [end  recording]    Bishop said that the individuals who oppose these two issues  want to divide the reverted areas among themselves and continue  with the ongoing negligent attitude after the year 2000.    [Begin Bishop recording] This is the end of the line. Here,  Panamanians as a whole must demand that the government that will  take the helm of our country in 1994 effectively legislate in  favor and to the benefit of the majority of Panamanians, not  just a small group of businessmen and politicians. [end  recording]    Bishop's recent statements in this same vein prompted  several  sectors to state that Local 907 cannot speak for all workers of  the reverted areas. Bishop says, however, that those who oppose  his views have never been interested in the needs of the  Panamanian people.    [Begin Bishop recording] Together, let's try to restructure  our country as Panamanians and, those who are elected in 1994,  as public employees. [sentence as heard] [end recording]</p>

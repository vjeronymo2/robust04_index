			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Chinese Dissidents Wei Jingsheng, Bao Ge, and </F> Yang Zhou Have Been Released After Detention, at Least Other  Four Are Still Under Detention"]    [Excerpts] Democracy activists Wei Jingsheng, Bao Ge, and  Yang Zhou have been released after a short detention by the  Chinese authorities. It is believed, however, that a few  dissidents are still being detained. U.S. President Clinton has  criticized the detention of Wei Jingsheng and has asserted that  this incident will affect Sino-U.S. relations. U.S. Secretary  of State Warren M. Christopher has denied that he would cancel  his visit to China -- scheduled for this week -- because of this  incident. [passage omitted]    When interviewed by a MING PAO reporter yesterday, Wei  Jingsheng's family said that he had phoned them yesterday  afternoon to send his regards to his father and tell them that  he himself was quite all right. Wei Jingsheng did not mention  that he had been taken away by the police, and his father  refused to further confirm his whereabouts.    An assistant to Wei Jingsheng said that she received a phone  call from Wei Jingsheng around 1200 yesterday. Wei was calling  from somewhere in the suburbs of Beijing, asking her to convey  the message that he had been released. Wei said that he would  return to the downtown area in the evening after meeting with a  friend at Changping in the northern suburbs of Beijing.    Wei Jingsheng was one of the key figures in the 1978  Democracy Wall Movement. He was sentenced to 15 years of  imprisonment by the authorities and was released on parole in  last September. He was taken away by three policemen from his  younger brother's home in the morning of the day before  yesterday. Since that time, his whereabouts have been unknown.    During yesterday's phone call, Wei Jingsheng confirmed to  his  assistant that he had been officially "summoned, detained, and  interrogated" by the public security sector. He was allowed to  go home by the time he made the call, but he did not say whether  his movements would be restricted, and he did not explain why he  had been detained and interrogated. He just said that he had  been treated well. Wei Jingsheng's family and his assistant  believe that the purpose behind his detention and interrogation  was to embarrass the United States, which has consistently been  pressuring Beijing to release political prisoners.    Meanwhile, Bao Ge, another dissident who has been calling  for  war reparations by Japan, was also released yesterday afternoon  after being detained by the Shanghai public security bureau for  22 hours since Thursday [3 March] evening.    Bao Ge said he had earlier planned to arrange for a meeting  with visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Shattuck through  a go- between, but he was detained before any arrangements were  made. Although those who interrogated him did not mention  Shattuck by name, they warned him not to meet with any foreign  officials and strongly warned Bao Ge not to try to organize any  demonstrations during the Japanese prime minister's visit to  China.    On the other hand, Shanghai dissident Yang Zhou, who had  arranged an appointment with Shattuck through the U.S. Embassy  [as published] in Shanghai, found his home under surveillance by  some plain-clothes men the day before yesterday, and he dared  not go out for the appointment. He was later taken away by some  uniformed policemen and detained for 24 hours until his release  yesterday.    Yang Zhou said that, as far as he knows, at least five other  dissidents were detained, specifically, Yang Jingheng, Dai  Xuezhong, Bao Ge, Ma Wei, and Gong Xingnan. [passage omitted]</p>

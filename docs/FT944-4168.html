			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / GUS gives Pounds 300m back to shareholders in special dividend Great Universal Stores, the mail order, retail, property and financial services group, is to hand Pounds 300m of its Pounds 1.5bn cash pile back to shareholders in the form of a 30p per share special dividend. The proposed dividend was announced as the group revealed a 5.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30, from Pounds 213.2m to Pounds 225m. But with the special dividend payable only to those holding shares yesterday, and the smaller than expected profits - GUS shares fell 35p to 496p. Mr Richard Pugh, deputy chairman, said the group had been seeking ways of redistributing some of its cash for some time. It decided a special dividend was the 'most equitable' way of giving money back to shareholders, but had to stay 'within certain parameters' to gain approval from the Inland Revenue. The move by GUS last year to enfranchise its non-voting shareholders sparked hopes in the City of a change of culture in one of the more conservative and low-profile FT-SE 100 companies. Speculation that GUS might launch a share buy-back resurfaced following the Pounds 508m buy-back by fellow retailer Boots last month, and some analysts were disappointed that GUS instead chose a special dividend. Other analysts were disappointed by the size of the payout and suggested GUS might pay further special dividends in future. Mr Pugh said the group would continue to look for appropriate ways of using its cash. It was still seeking an acquisition 'which complements our existing business and has a good, continuing management'. He added that GUS was ready to use its strength in mail order to launch electronic shopping services, once the infrastructure - national fibre-optic cabling - was in place, and consumer demand was strong enough. 'We have got the systems ready, they have been tried and tested, but the public demand is not there yet,' Mr Pugh said. Group turnover rose from Pounds 1.39bn to Pounds 1.54bn. The trading profit increased 11.2 per cent to Pounds 176.7m, although interest receivable fell from Pounds 51.6m to Pounds 46.3m. Sales in the home shopping division, which includes the Kays and Marshall Ward catalogues, increased 6 per cent to Pounds 868.1m. Operating profits grew 13 per cent to Pounds 77.5m, thanks to cost control. Sales in the Burberrys and Scotch House clothing and retailing division grew from Pounds 85.4m to Pounds 102.2m. The overseas retailing division increased sales 9 per cent to Pounds 96.5m, and operating profits from Pounds 11m to Pounds 11.8m. Profits from property rentals grew from Pounds 26.8m to Pounds 29.4m. Turnover in the finance division, which includes consumer and corporate finance, banking and business information services, jumped from Pounds 398m to Pounds 472.5m, with profits up from Pounds 36.5m to Pounds 40.4m. The interim dividend, which will be paid together with the special dividend, rose from 4p to 4.5p. Earnings per share rose from 14.1p to 14.8p. Lex, Page 18</p>

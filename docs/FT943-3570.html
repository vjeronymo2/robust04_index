			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (1): The priority now must be to spread wealth - Angus Foster considers the challenges and opportunities facing Brazil's economic heartland It is sometimes tempting to imagine, sitting amid the opulence and consumerism of central Sao Paulo, that Brazil is a developed country. The city's rich are among Latin America's wealthiest and dine nightly at expensive European-style restaurants. Sao Paulo's companies make satellites, fighter aircraft and family saloon cars and are run by overseas-educated managers. In the city's commercial areas, portable telephones and computers are commonplace. So it may at times be hard to understand, amid the poverty and hardship of the city's many shanty towns, how such vicious contrasts in wealth and opportunity can exist so close to each other. In the shanty towns, some families go weeks without meat, spend half their monthly wages on transport to and from work, and have to save up to telephone relatives in other states. But these contrasts, the result of rapid urbanisation and one of the world's worst income disparities, are so common in Brazil that it is easy to become immune to their implications. For Sao Paulo, which has spent the last 50 years establishing itself as the country's economic and commercial centre, the urgent priority is to spread the wealth it is generating to a greater number of people. Sao Paulo state is about the size of the UK. It is home to 31m people, of which roughly half live in and around Sao Paulo city. The state accounts for just under 40 per cent of Brazil's output, suggesting Sao Paulo's economy is slightly larger than Turkey's but slightly smaller than Belgium's. Its companies are among the most dynamic in Latin America and nearly half Brazil's biggest 50 private companies have their head offices in the state. Its financial system has developed rapidly into the most important in South America. Sao Paulo is home to four of Brazil's five biggest private banks, and its stock exchange accounts for more than 90 per cent of trading in Brazilian shares. Together, Sao Paulo companies exported more than Dollars 13bn of goods and services in 1992, more than Argentina. Despite these impressive numbers, Sao Paulo has had a tough few years as Brazil's overall economic crisis mounted. Deep recession from 1990 to 1992 squeezed domestic sales. Falling import tariffs opened some sectors of the economy to foreign competition. Industry laid off more than 500,000 people during the period as companies tried to improve productivity and adjust to an economy slowly opening to the outside world. The improvement in the economy last year - Brazil saw real growth of 5 per cent - was significantly due to the car industry, one of Sao Paulo's most important. Helped by tax cuts and pent-up demand, the car industry reported its best year since the 1970s and production increased 30 per cent to 1.39m units. Industry also gained from an improvement in retail sales, and evidence that companies were starting to invest in expanding capacity. Both trends have accelerated this year following the launch in July of Brazil's new currency, the Real. This has led to a sharp drop in inflation from about 50 per cent a month to less than 5 per cent. If Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former finance minister who has the support of most businessmen, wins next month's presidential elections as expected, there is likely to be a further sharp increase in business confidence. His main opponent, the left-winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is opposed by business groups because of his union links and radical plans in areas like land reform. Whoever wins the election, the Real is the first rather than the final step in a programme to modernise Brazil's economy. The country's creaking tax and social security systems also need thorough reform. With the federal government facing a mounting budget deficit from next year, and claiming it cannot cut spending further, economic forecasting for even the short term is difficult. For Sao Paulo's state government, the situation is equally troubled. While net debt has risen to Dollars 31bn, of which part was inherited from the previous regime, the state's main source of income, state value added tax, has fallen from Dollars 11bn in 1989 to Dollars 9bn because of economic recession and companies moving to other states. These financial problems have seriously undermined the capability of the present government, under Mr Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho. They are also likely to hamper his successor, who is due to take office in January following elections next month. The winner is expected to be Mr Mario Covas, a former senator for Sao Paulo and a close ally of Mr Cardoso. Mr Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira, president of the Sao Paulo Federation of Industries, says Mr Covas will 'suffer a lot. He will have to spend the first one and a half years recovering the government's finances. That's his priority,' he adds. But plenty of other priorities will land on Mr Covas's desk. Mr Vincent Paulo da Silva, president of the CUT union congress, says: 'State governments only act in the case of emergencies or for electoral reasons. What we need, instead, is a government which does much more in terms of building infrastructure and providing education.' Mr Pedro Jacobi, who studies urban problems at the private Cedec institute in Sao Paulo, says his research shows that people's biggest concerns are air quality, violence and the lack of health centres. 'What is worrying is that nearly 70 per cent of people said they expected the state to solve these problems, even though we are being told the state must shrink and is without the money,' he says. Given the speed of Sao Paulo city's growth as industrialisation gathers pace, taking the urban population from 1.3m in 1940 to 9.5m today, some of its achievements are impressive. Illiteracy, which in the 1950s extended to half the state's population, has fallen sharply to under 10 per cent of persons aged 10 or more. Sao Paulo is also one of only a few states in Brazil to have enough school places for all its children, although there are complaints about the quality and wages of its teachers. But the challenges now are in areas more associated with developed economies as well. Sao Paulo needs to create secure and well-paid jobs rather than continue to rely on an expanding informal economy. Environmental concerns are only starting to be addressed. Meanwhile, about 1m people still live in shanty towns, usually without adequate sewerage, and watch as the gap between rich and poor continues to widen. The poorest 50 per cent of Brazilians saw their share of national income fall from 15 to 12 per cent over last decade. They now earn less than the country's richest 1 per cent. 'What you see clearly is a level of social disintegration. It's a result of the lack of jobs, the effects of drugs in the slums and the extent of the social problems, and these have been increasing rapidly,' says Mr Jacobi.</p>

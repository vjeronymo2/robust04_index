			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder buys Dutch food interests for ADollars 200m GOODMAN Fielder Wattie (GFW), the Australian foods group, is set to become one of the largest flour millers in continental Europe following agreement to acquire assets from Wessanen, the Dutch foods producer, for some ADollars 200m (USDollars 149m). The assets to be acquired include four flour mills, three bakeries and one starch plant and will be made through GFW's Dutch-based subsidiary, Meneba. GFW expects to complete the deal in about three months. Mr Michael Nugent, GFW managing director, yesterday described the purchase as the largest and single most important step in the company's European development since the Meneba acquisition in 1988. 'GFW's share of the Dutch flour market will increase from about 35 per cent to about 62 per cent and its share of the Dutch baked foods market will increase by about 3 percentage points to 25 per cent,' he said. 'GFW's stated strategy in Europe specifically targets milling and baking as the key areas for development.' The agreement caps a week of deals for GFW. The company has announced the ADollars 330m acquisition of Uncle Tobys, the leading Australian cereals group: and it has given details of a planned ADollars 330m flotation for Wattie, its New Zealand-based arm. Mr Nugent said the three deals would increase GFW's sales, profits and earnings per share in the first year. The company's gearing ratio was also expected to return to its current level of about 65 per cent within a year. Wessanen said yesterday that it wants to use the money generated by the sale of its grain division to finance acquisitions in Europe, Reuter reports from Amsterdam. 'We hope to have made some acquisitions before the end of this year,' the company said. Acquisitions are sought in the cheese, breakfast cereals, ice cream and frozen snacks sectors. Wessanen is in talks with several European companies, Wessanen said.</p>

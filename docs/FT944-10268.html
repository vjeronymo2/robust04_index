			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Information from NRA Sir, The NRA has been accused by the Campaign for Freedom of Information ('River information paid for by the piggy bank', November 9) of overcharging the public as a means of inhibiting the release of information which they are entitled to have. This is not so. The NRA is an open organisation. Every regional office holds a register of information which the public is entitled to inspect free of charge. The typical charge for photocopies from the registers is Pounds 1, which includes up to 10 copies. Only where complex investigations are required, or where information is requested for commercial purposes will a higher charge be levied. The NRA makes no profit from these charges which are based on actual costs incurred. We do not charge school children. There is a comprehensive education pack available free to every primary school in England and Wales and many of their requests can be satisfied from our 600 reports and leaflets, many of which are free of charge, and which we supply willingly. Ed Gallagher, chief executive, National Rivers Authority, 30-34 Albert Embankment, London SE17TL</p>

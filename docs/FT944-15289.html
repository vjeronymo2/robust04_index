			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Leading Article: N Korea on trust Any assessment of North Korea's nuclear agreement with the US has to be tentative while the fine print remains shrouded in obscurity. Yet the outside world should start out by willing the accord to work. It would be easy to dismiss the agreement on the grounds that it sets a poor predecent to reward a country - with aid and recognition - after it so wilfully flouted the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It could still be years before North Korea is obliged to reveal the full extent of its nuclear weapons development. Meanwhile Pyongyang could still perfect the manufacture of bombs. In short, it seems in no way a reliable recipient of sensitive western technology. Such arguments will doubtless appeal to hawkish politicians, especially in the US. But they must also consider the alternatives. No agreement of any sort would be possible without some trust in North Korea's good faith. There are certainly risks in the present approach. It is far from clear whether North Korea will in practice agree to reopen bilateral talks with South Korea on de-nuclearisation, or that it will agree to spot inspection of its facilities. South Korea will have a long wait before it can feel secure. Yet these risks are small compared with those of allowing the status quo to continue. There would be little regional support for a policy of confrontation, so economic sanctions would never stick. The agreement has merit in giving the west leverage over Pyongyang. Concessions are to be phased in as a reward for good behaviour, with the establishment of a US liaison office in the North Korean capital - and the de facto recognition which that implies - coming late in the process. Meanwhile, North Korea will become increasingly dependent on the west, needing oil imports during the switch to the new light-water technology and access to imports of enriched uranium thereafter. That should encourage it to open up its economy. Similarly, the fact that South Korea is to supply the nuclear equipment, and probably a large chunk of the finance as well, will give it influence in the North at a sensitive time of economic and political transition. It is in everybody's interest that that transition should be orderly. By agreeing to the use of South Korean/US technology rather than that supplied by Russia and Germany, North Korea has made a considerable concession. This is perhaps the strongest indication of its desire to conclude an agreement that sticks. If so, it is also a sign that Mr Kim Jong-il, who seems formally about to take over North Korea's leadership, is seeking some kind of rapprochement. It would be foolish now to drive his country back into isolation.</p>

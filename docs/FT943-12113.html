			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Legal position of receivers changed The legal position of receivers over their liabilities to staff was yesterday brought into line with that of administrators following the controversial Paramount Airways case. A High Court judge ruled - in a decision involving receivers for Leyland Daf and Ferranti - that receivers have the same personal liability to employees as administrators and are equally liable for holiday and severance pay and other benefits in staff contracts. In the Paramount case earlier this year the Court of Appeal ruled that administrators were personally liable to employees in these areas. Its ruling prompted protests from the insolvency profession, which warned that administrators would have to approach their jobs in a radically different way to avoid these liabilities and that this would threaten thousands of jobs. The House of Lords is due to hear the Paramount case in December.</p>

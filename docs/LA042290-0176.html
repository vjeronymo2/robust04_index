			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> DEFINING INDUSTRY'S ENVIRONMENTAL ROLE  </P> <P> Less than a decade after one of the most toxic chemicals known to mankind was  cavalierly sprayed on the roads of Times Beach, Mo., turning it into a ghost  town, businesses across the nation have rallied to the cause of the  environment. Today's celebration of the 20th anniversary of Earth Day has more  corporate backers than its founders ever imagined.  </P> <P>  But how far has business really come in terms of forging a proper  environmental role? Sharon Bernstein asked six leading executives, economists  and environmentalists for their wish list of what corporate America should do  to improve the environment:  </P> <P> ALICE M. RIVLIN  </P> <P> Economist at the Brookings Institution, chairman of the governing council of  the Wilderness Society and a director of Union Carbide  </P> <P> I'd like to see business, particularly major businesses that have an impact on  the environment, take a long-range view. In the long run, business can't  operate profitably if it is degrading the environment. From the quite selfish  point of view of the individual company, it needs to have not only an image,  but a real program for being a responsible environmental citizen. This means  taking care of toxic waste, avoiding pollution and other damaging emissions. It  means working with communities to avoid environmental damage.  </P> <P> It's sometimes difficult for companies to be as environmentally responsible as  they'd like to be, because it's costly in the short run. That's part of the  general problem of short-run focus in American companies. But I think if they  take a long-range view, especially with the rising concern about the  environment in the general public, it's clear that long-term profitability will  be aided by environmental responsibility.  </P> <P> FRED KRUPP  </P> <P> Executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund  </P> <P> Corporations should recognize that there's an exploding demand from individuals  and societies for them to invest in developing environmentally sound products,  not just in developing ad campaigns that sound environmental. Seventy percent  of consumers polled say they want products that are environmentally sound. Some  corporations have realized that those who produce the truly good products to  meet this demand will be the most competitive. The stakes are not only  environmental quality but the very competitiveness of the American business  sector. Because if our own businesses don't wake up to this demand, our  consumers will have to seek foreign sources for these products.  </P> <P> Because the greenhouse effect is an environmental problem of overriding  importance, the most important products that corporations need to supply us  with are high efficiency appliances, high mileage automobiles and ways of  powering our society with renewable energy.  </P> <P> The advertising agencies have given us a throwaway society and effortless  housekeeping, where instead of rubbing the stains out, we spray them away with  more and more toxic cleaners. We've got to move to nontoxic products. We've got  to stop pretending that choosing between paper and plastic bags in the  supermarket involves any real choice, and instead start doing what the  Europeans have been doing for years: use convenient string bags. We've got to  move away from disposable razors and disposable pens, and toward durable goods.  </P> <P> The economy of the next 40 years will have to go through a massive  restructuring. There will be certain goods that will be produced in much  smaller quantities, but there will be whole new markets for environmentally  sound goods. It's a major transition, but we've done it before. We've gone from  candles to electric lights, we've gone from wood burning stoves to coal, and  from coal to oil.  </P> <P> DEAN L. BUNTROCK  </P> <P> Chairman of Waste Management Inc.  </P> <P> I would like to see every company take a fresh look at the relationship between  its business and the environment.  </P> <P> The board of Waste Management adopted a new, strong environmental policy on  March 7, which includes principles for compliance, pollution prevention and  nature conservation, as well as for positive public policy, environmental  education and cooperation with environmental groups.  </P> <P> It also sets forth a commitment to report annually on our environmental  performance. I would like to see other companies adopt similar environmental  policies, tailored to their specific businesses.  </P> <P> I would like to see federal and state agencies implement enforcement programs  that more effectively ensure that everyone subject to environmental laws is in  compliance.  </P> <P> I would like to see business, government and environmental groups, whenever  appropriate, make more of an effort to work cooperatively on solving  environmental problems.  </P> <P> Warfare in the press and courts often simply creates barriers and delays  finding solutions to environmental problems.  </P> <P> RICHARD J. MAHONEY  </P> <P> Chairman and chief executive, Monsanto Corp.  </P> <P> I would like to see business as part of the solution and not as part of the  problem. We have decided we're going to be part of the solution -- for Monsanto  to have zero affect on the environment. That takes time. We started with a very  important pledge on air emissions, to reduce them 90% by the end of 1992. But  our real intention was to reduce air emissions to zero. And we have similar  programs for all of the environmental effects of Monsanto.  </P> <P> I can't speak for everybody in the business community and I can't speak for all  issues because there are some very intractable problems that don't befall us at  Monsanto. But I think if you're in a leadership role you can call on your own  people's creative energies to solve the problem, rather than waiting for some  person, whether regulator or legislator, to thrust on you a solution that may  not be appropriate to you.  </P> <P> When you cut all through it, maybe the simplest answer is that it's the right  thing to do.  </P> <P> In the last couple of weeks, I find very troublesome the amount of pot shots at  corporations as somehow having newly discovered Earth Day. There are some very  sincere efforts to do what the public and we want to do, and ours is one of  them. These are not publicity stunts.  </P> <P> WILLIAM D. RUCKELSHAUS  </P> <P> Chairman and chief executive of Browning-Ferris Inc., a Houston-based waste  disposal company, and former director of the Environmental Protection Agency  </P> <P> Fundamentally, the most important thing business could do is comply with the  rules and regulations established by the government for the conduct of their  activities. If every business did that, our environment would be an appreciably  cleaner place.  </P> <P> I think the really big environmental problems that we are going to face in the  future are global problems, and what business could do on its own that would  have the most beneficial effect would be to make sure that whenever they  establish any kind of facilities abroad, they hold themselves to the same  standards that they would be held to at home.  </P> <P> Otherwise, the resulting environmental problems could threaten, if not mankind,  then at least free institutions.  </P> <P> J. MICHAEL McCLOSKEY  </P> <P> Chairman of the Sierra Club  </P> <P> Businesses ought to realize that they can better assure their future in  American society and prosper more by being environmental leaders. They ought to  do what StarKist did in saying it's only going to sell dolphin-safe tuna, or  what Conoco did in saying that their new ships are going to be double hulled.  </P> <P> It's not enough to wait for and comply with regulations. The regulations can  never adequately catch up with what they're really doing. Thousands of new  chemicals are developed every year and processes and products keep changing.  The burdens to the environment keep changing all the time with a dynamic  economy.  </P> <P> Frankly, American industries have not been good environmental citizens. Some of  them have been, but too many of them thought they could get away with whatever  they could and postpone the day of compliance as long as possible.  </P> <P> Thank goodness there are some industrial leaders that recognize that a time for  a change has come. We need more of them.  </P></p>

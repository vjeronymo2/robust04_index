			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BID TO FOUL OLD FAITHFUL WATER FAILS  </P> <P> Tests of the vandalized Old Faithful water treatment plant found no  contamination and visitors to Yellowstone National Park were told they could  resume drinking the water, a park spokeswoman said today.  </P> <P> An Oregon man who allegedly was caught damaging the plant Sunday was still in  jail at Mammoth, awaiting transportation to Cheyenne to face a federal criminal  charge. "He's still not talking so we don't have a motive," park spokeswoman  Marsha Karle said. "The water was not contaminated so we're turning all the  drinking fountains back on."  </P> <P> A ranger on routine patrol caught Michael J. Willett, 38, of Sumpter, Ore.,  damaging the equipment used to treat water for the Old Faithful area about 9  a.m. Sunday, Karle said. The damage was estimated at $10,000 to $25,000 and  officials decided to ban water consumption in the popular area around Old  Faithful Geyser in the west-central part of the park.  </P></p>

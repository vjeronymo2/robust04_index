			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC ADMISSIONS  </P> <P> As the University of California notifies freshmen applicants of their admission  status, a pattern of discrimination becomes increasingly obvious. Asians and  whites are rejected in favor of blacks and Hispanics with far lower GPAs and  SAT scores and fewer advanced placement courses.  </P> <P> In fact, only 60% of the incoming freshman class is accepted solely on the  basis of competitive GPA/SAT criteria.  </P> <P> UC officials invariably cite Assembly Concurrent Resolution 83 to justify such  admission policies. ACR 83, however, calls for actions that "will strengthen  the college preparation of low-income and under-represented minority students."  It does not call for racial preference in admission policies.  </P> <P> Racial admission quotas were expressly prohibited by the Supreme Court in the  1978 Bakke decision. While UC speaks in terms of "goals" and not the forbidden  word "quotas," there appears little distinction between the two in practice.  </P> <P> Practicing discrimination in the name of fighting discrimination is wrong. To  assert otherwise is to deny equal protection of the laws and affirm the  proposition that two wrongs make a right.  </P> <P> ALAN BENSON  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P></p>

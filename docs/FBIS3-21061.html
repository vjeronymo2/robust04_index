The Trust Agency had already  written them off. "Incapable of reorganization," was the  assessment of the privatization agency of Berlin in May 1991.  They made a fundamental error.    For a long time, the Samag Maschinenfabrik Sangerhausen  GmbH,  located on the southeast edge of the Harz Mountains in  Saxony-Anhalt, has been making hefty profits. This year, the  profit is expected to be five million marks. By the end of next  year, the company will employ 1,400 people -- 100 more than  before the unification. At this time, it employs 1,150. In 1995,  it plans on moving onto the stock market.    Rescue came in the form of the South Tyrolean industrial  scion Kurt Mayer, 50, who took over the operation two years ago.  Using sugar production systems, the professional in barter trade  first pepped up the regular Eastern European customers who had  broken away. The people from Sangerhausen supplied centrifuges  and pulp presses. The customers, Russians and Ukrainians, paid  with oil, high-grade steel, and sugar.    With part of the proceeds from this barter, the  white-bearded, shaggy-haired dynamic individual with the baroque  figure expanded environmental engineering "to the second pillar"  of the company. Mayer calls it "a gigantic growth market." In  the meantime, systems for sewage sludge disposal and sewage and  effluent handling make up one third of production.    The people from Sangerhausen want to turn a hefty profit.  They have more than tripled their revenue from 1991 to about 200  million marks today, primarily with a newly developed recycling  system that detoxifies soil, slags and building rubble. A lot of  contracts are beckoning.    At the end of October, Federal Minister for the Environment  Klaus Topfer presented the draft for the soil conservation law.  This law would obligate the party responsible to eliminate  hazardous waste from the past. The Federal Environmental Office  in Berlin estimates that the restoration of about 240,000  locations suspected of containing hazardous waste from the past  in Germany will consume up to 390 billion marks. Of these  locations, 80,000 are in the New Lands.    The Samag engineers are particularly proud of the fact that  in their washing method, no residue remains that must be placed  in a landfill. The dissolved pollutants which, at the end,  adhere to tiny grains of earth and stone, are sealed. In  technical language, they are immobilized. This happens, for  example, by adding insoluble phosphates into the wash water. The  encapsulation is so dead-certain, swear the engineers, that even  acid rain could not rinse the poisons out in a thousand years.    The immobilized granulate can then be used as building  material for example for curb stones and noise abatement walls  or it can be mixed with gravel. "With the hundred percent reuse,  we are ahead of the competition by a nose," says Mayer joyfully.    There is something to this. In the high-pressure soil  washing  system of Klockner Oecotec GmbH in Duisburg, one of the market  leaders in Germany in cleaning contaminated soils, after washing  1000 metric tons of contaminated earth, 100 metric tons still  end up in landfills for hazardous waste. "We must reduce this  amount," promises the marketing director Winfried Brull.  Immobilization such as that practiced by the people from  Sangerhausen is one conceivable method.    The Samag tinkerers also view themselves as having an  advantage over thermal methods of soil cleansing such as that  offered by Ruhrkohle Umwelttechnik GmbH (Rut) in Bottrop. This  is because incineration only renders organic pollutants harmless  but not heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury.    Decontamination costs 250 to 800 marks per metric ton,  depending upon the degree of contamination. This amount is about  the same for Samag and its competitor Oecotec. To protect the  procedure against imitators, the people from Sangerhausen  operate their mobile recycling system which, depending upon the  design, can cost between 25 and 32 million marks, "in principle  by ourselves," says Mayer. The 40 to 60 modules are built in at  most four weeks on location, assured Rainer Sonnenberger,  director of environmental engineering at Samag.    The system passed its baptism by fire in Wolfen near  Bitterfeld. There, under contract to the Trust Agency, they are  cleaning up to 1000 metric tons of building rubble daily from  demolished buildings of the Orwo film factory. Hot steam and  water, mixed with lyes and surface-active agents, dissolve heavy  metals and acids from the heavily contaminated rocks in several  washing stages. Finally an attrition mill, a type of vibrating  machine, rubs particularly difficult toxic substances from the  fine-grained debris left after passing through sieves several  times. The toxic water in the closed circuit of the system is  extensively cleaned again and again.    "The system can be easily modified so that it cleans every  contaminated material optimally," enthuses the Samag boss Mayer.  The necessary analyses come from their own laboratories.    After Christmas, a second recycling system will start  operation on the ground of Chemie AG in Bitterfeld. This system  is to decontaminate the soils, building rubble and industrial  sludge of the former chemical combine. In addition, there are  four orders from Italy, one from New York, and two from the New  Lands.    Precisely there is where the business is particularly  difficult, complains Mayer. "East Germans still have a very low  opinion of East Germans." Even worse, the old boys' network  makes sure somebody in the network gets the lucrative contracts  for restoration of hazardous waste from the past. According to  Mayer, "We have to fight with a knife between our teeth."    The go-getting entrepreneur also had trouble with the  chairman of the board of the Wolfen Vermogensverwaltung AG  (WVV), Rolf Rattunde, who was placed in that position by the  Trust Agency. Mayer wants to create three new operation with 450  jobs on some of the land of the Orwo film factory that he has  restored:        -  a precast concrete form factory in which the  immobilized granulate from the recycling systems is to be reused,    -  a system for solvent recover from the Orwo film production,    -  a system to obtain biological diesel from the sewage sludge  and  rape.       However, Rattunde has been dragging his feet for five months  over the sale of the necessary land, grumbles Mayer. However,  such objections cannot turn the steadfast South Tyrolean from  his expansion plans. Mayer is not going to make the same error  committed by many eastern companies that fired research and  development personnel by the dozens. "Only with innovative  marketable products will we be able to stand on our own two feet  again," he recognized early on. He employed 62 engineers,  brought experts from Italy and the Czech Republic. To obtain the  best know-how fast, he hired scientists from the universities in  Tubingen, Milan, Graz, and Berlin. In the next year, Mayer will  put another 20 million marks into research.    The investments are bearing fruit. The Samag boss firmly  expects acceptance of the bid for renaturation of the Silbersee  near Wolfen that was completely contaminated by the sewage and  effluent from the nearby Orwo film factory. With a water  purification method, Mayer will restore the sewer for 80 million  marks and, so he promises, "make the lake odorless." He has  spent 2.5 million marks on the development of this water  purification method.    The people from Sangerhausen have proven that the method  works using a demonstration system. They have pumped large  quantities of air into the lake through hoses. The oxygen  contained in this air activated bacteria that ecologically  annihilate the stinking sulfur gases rising from the sludge  layer at the bottom of the lake.    Actually, the decision regarding restoration of the  Silbersee  should have been made at the beginning of December. However, the  fall of the government of Saxony-Anhalt stopped the project.  Temporarily, Mayer believes, who would rather look toward the  future. "If we succeed with the Silbersee trial, millions of  marks in business beckon us in restoring dead waters."</p>

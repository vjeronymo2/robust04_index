			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ['News Focus' by Keiji Urakami: "Multimedia Tests To Hasten </F> New Technology Era"]    [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Both the government and the  private sector are preparing to launch full-fledged experiments  on multimedia across the nation from this summer in a move that  will quicken the advent of the multimedia society in Japan.    The Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), major backers of multimedia  projects, say they are inundated with various inquiries from  businesses aiming to tap an area with huge growth potential  toward the next century.    "We are groping for ways to make multimedia services  commercial," said Masashi Kojima, president of NTT, which  recently outlined three types of experiments on the joint use of  multimedia networks.    Test operations of high-speed, wide-band "backbone" telecom  networks will begin in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya and seven other  major cities across the nation from September, using a  technology called the asynchronous transfer mode for the first  time in the world.    The idea is to build high-speed local area networks, a  large-  amount file transmission system and a high-speed data retrieval  system, an NTT official said.    A test of multimedia networking for general public use will  be conducted in the 10 cities from the spring of 1995 to  establish systems for high-grade electronic mail services and  electronic newspaper.    NTT also plans to conduct an experiment on cable television  services in seven urban areas from the spring of 1995,  envisaging video-on-demand services that enable viewers to  access movies and other video programs at their discretion.    Interested third parties will be invited to take part in  each  experiment, the NTT official said.    "By speeding up these experiments, we should lay a  foundation  that will lead to actual business opportunities," NTT president  Kojima said.    The Electronic Industries Association of Japan forecast the  market for multimedia-type hardware and software will grow to  17.66 trillion yen by 2015, a 4.6-fold jump from 1992.    Including infrastructure-related business, the sum will be  123 trillion yen, the posts ministry predicted.    A foundation set up by the posts ministry unveiled a 5  billion yen experimental project earlier this year to build a  next- generation telecommunications network in Japan.    The project will offer a variety of information and  communications services, such as teleconferences, visual phones  and video-on-demand services, for three years from this summer  in an area in Kyoto, choosing 300 households as model users.    "The experiment is intended to clarify economic feasibility  and other problems involved in laying a nationwide optical-fiber  network in the 21st century," said the foundation, called the  Association for Promotion of New Generation Network Services.    Remote-control services in medical areas that use integrated  services digital network (ISDN) technology will be tested by a  government-private joint entity from this summer in Osaka and  other kansai areas.    Nikon Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and several other companies are  researching, for example, ways of transmitting X-ray images  taken at home to remote medical facilities, jointly with Kyoto  University and Osaka University, said the Association of  Broadband-ISDN Business Chance and Culture Creation.    Remote services under study by the association also include  mail- order services using electronic catalogs, housing designs  made by remote-operated computer graphics and remote editing and  printing of books.    The city of Okazaki in Aichi Prefecture has been designated  by the posts ministry as Japan's first model city for  experiments of a multimedia network offering education and other  public services.    Using the existing cable-TV network, students at selected  schools will be able to access from this fall a vast amount of  educational information collected by the city in the past 40  years, a spokesman in Okazaki said.    "Major school events like a student board meeting may be  conducted via a teleconference system in the future," said the  spokesman.    Analysts say the social infrastructure needs to be upgraded  more in Japan for these multimedia experiments to be smoothly  converted into commercial services in the near future.    Chuck Goto, a senior analyst at S.G. Warburg Securities  (Japan) Inc., said the penetration of cable television, for  example, is very low in Japan compared with the United States.    Software for multimedia also needs to be developed.    The Ueda Municipal Government in Nagano Prefecture has been  assigned by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to  run a multimedia information center. The center will make  citizens familiar with the convenience of multimedia by  providing them with the opportunity to design audiovisual  software using multimedia equipment.    But the project is on hold since nobody in the local  government has expertise in multimedia operations.    "We are at a loss about what to put in the planned center,"  said an Ueda Municipal Government official.</p>

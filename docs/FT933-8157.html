			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minero plans to sell Ilo copper refinery THE state-owned mining firm Minero Peru has given notice that it intends to sell off its copper refinery in the southern port of Ilo, where Southern Peru Copper Corporation refines its mineral into copper blister, Reuter reports from Lima. The refinery is to be sold through an international tender in late November, and Minero Peru will require interested parties to assume certain minimum commitments in developing the refinery, an advertisement by the Minero Peru privatisation committee said. The refinery, located some 1,100km (660 miles) south of Lima, has capacity to process 190,000 tonnes of blister a year. The advertisement said the sale would be open to national and international investors through a pre-qualification process. Radio Programas del Peru, in a report from its correspondent in Ilo, quoted Mr Rafael Toledo, the head of the Minero Peru privatisation committee, as saying that Southern Peru was interested in buying the refinery. Neither Southern Peru nor Minero Peru officials were available for comment. Southern, with two mines in nearby Cuajone and Toquepala, produces two-thirds of Peru's copper. Toledo was also quoted as saying there would be a 10 per cent reduction in personnel at the refinery prior to the privatisation. Minero Peru plans to sell the Cerro Verde copper mine on October 13 and has announced the sale of two copper deposits for the end of the year. Later, it will auction off a gold deposit at San Antonio de Poto and a zinc refinery at Cajamarquilla.</p>

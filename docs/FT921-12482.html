			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Polls indicate narrow lead for Tories THE TORIES edged into the narrowest of leads yesterday after a frenetic week of pre-election campaigning, with two opinion polls giving them leads of 1 and 2 percentage points respectively. The polls came as the Tories gave a taste of likely manifesto pledges, with news of plans to extend proposed leasehold reforms in a way that would particularly help people in London and the south-east. Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, is expected to announce the move next month, although the scheme has not yet received final ministerial approval. The plan would enable private tenants with leases of 50 years or less to buy new leases of up to 99 years at market values. It would be available to those who did not qualify for the scheme announced last summer to extend rights for tenants of private flats in blocks collectively to buy leases, possibly at their market value. Extending leases would help to ease the difficulties of selling those with less than 50 years to run because of difficulties of obtaining mortgages for such properties. Labour and the Conservatives were poised for more campaigning at the weekend as the polls suggested there was still everything to play for. A Harris survey in today's Daily Express shows the Tories on 41 per cent, with Labour on 40 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 14 per cent. A Gallup poll in today's Daily Telegraph gives the Tories 40 per cent, compared with Labour on 38 per cent. The Liberal Democrats are on 16.5 per cent. There is some comfort for Labour, however, in that a similar Gallup poll published a week ago showed the Tories with a 4 1/2 -point lead on 42 per cent while Labour was on 37 1/2 per cent. The Liberal Democrats were then on 16 per cent. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, kept up the pressure on the government's economic management with a further attack on 'the rose-tinted view which put Britain into recession and will now do nothing useful to foster recovery'. He also warned that a cut of 1p in the basic rate of income tax in the Budget would mean little to most earners.</p>

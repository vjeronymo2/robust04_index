			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Denmark unveils plan for treaty compromise DENMARK last night unveiled a plan aimed at solving the impasse in the European Community over the Maastricht treaty on monetary and political union. The plan is designed not only to reverse the Danes' rejection of Maastricht in a referendum in June but also to give momentum to ratification of the treaty in other countries, notably Britain. The carefully phrased package of proposals, backed by seven of the eight parties in the Danish parliament, includes opt-outs from a future common currency and from a European defence force. The Danish government hopes it can persuade its EC partners to go along with the proposals and then win a Yes vote in a referendum next year. The Danish 'national compromise' plan was disclosed just as Mr John Major was fighting to win over waverers in Britain's Tory party. By revealing its stance now, the Danish government has neutralised arguments in both the Conservative and Labour parties that a British vote on ratification should wait until the Danes have shown their hand. The Danes' narrow vote against Maastricht threw the Community into disarray, which deepened in recent months as France showed itself passionately divided over the treaty and as currency turmoil led to the withdrawal of sterling and the Italian lira from the exchange rate mechanism. Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, said Denmark was seeking legally binding wording for opt-outs, without a time limit, but the opt-outs would not be irreversible. The demand for an opt-out from a common currency was largely expected. The Danes have also expressed reservations about common citizenship and law enforcement. The Danes want guarantees with sufficient political weight to win a referendum, while meeting their EC partners' insistence that the Maastricht treaty should not be renegotiated. If the Danes insist on a separate protocol covering an opt-out on monetary union, this might amount to a treaty amendment requiring further ratification.</p>

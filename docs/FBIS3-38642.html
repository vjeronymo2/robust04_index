"The use of  targeted military measures, as offered to the United Nations by  NATO on 9 August 1993, must no longer be ruled out," German  Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said in Bonn today.    The German Government most strongly condemned the bloodbath  among the civilian population, he said. The brutal attack on  innocent women, men, and children showed an "incomprehensible  contempt for human lives on the part of those responsible." The  German Government expressed its sympathy to the relatives and  declared its willingness to support U.S. efforts to provide  medical care for the surviving victims wherever possible. This  act of violence clearly shows "the urgent need for an immediate  peace settlement in Bosnia-Hercegovina."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Orestes Perez Perez] </F>   [Text] [no dateline as received] -- After intense and  constant diplomatic lobbying, Colombia gave Latin America the  good news that it had been selected to chair the next Nonaligned  Movement's (NAM) heads of state and government conference to be  held in 1995.    The Colombians will be in charge of preparing this  outstanding event. Before being selected, however, they had to  sidestep several obstacles preventing Latin America from  obtaining the Presidency of that organization. Egyptian  President Husni Mubarak wanted the position after ending his  term as the head of the OAU, said accredited diplomatic sources  in Cairo.    After the sixth NAM summit held in Havana, Cuba, in 1979,  Latin America had to wait 15 years to be able to preside over  this movement again, which was founded in Bandung, Indonesia, in  1956 and which currently comprises more than 100 states.    Latin America declined to assume the NAM directorship in  1991, when Nicaragua was selected and its government explained  that it was going through a very serious internal crisis that  did not allow it to organize the event. The principle of  rotating the Presidency of NAM, will, on this occasion, allow  the governments in this part of the world to give special  attention to the economic and social inequalities in the region,  among other points, diplomatic sources have commented.    During the first summit (Belgrade, Yugoslavia in 1961), Cuba  was the only full Latin American member in the movement.  Brazil, Bolivia, and Ecuador participated as observers, and the  continent was only mentioned once during the meeting to condemn  the U.S. occupation of the Guantanamo Naval Base in the eastern  part of Cuba.    At the second NAM summit held in Cairo, Egypt, in 1964 nine  observers from this part of the world attended the event, in  addition to Havana, and topics related to Latin America were  given greater attention. However, it was not until the 1973  conference in Algiers that the Latin Americans had significant  representation. At that meeting, Argentina, Guyana, Peru,  Jamaica, Trinidad-Tobago, and Chile entered NAM. Six years  later, Havana brought in 11 effective members and 10 observers  from Latin America, and in New Delhi, India, in 1983 the  region's representation increased to at least 25 countries, of  which 13 were full members.    The NAM summit held in Cuba not only marked Latin America's  complete identification with the fundamental principles of  nonalignment but also the failure of 20 years of U.S. efforts to  isolate Cuba from the rest of the continent.    Latin America's growing participation in the movement  increased its geographic and ideological dimension. Its  contribution was essential for NAM to take a stand on the  sovereign rights of states, drug trafficking, and terrorism,  among other issues.    Asked about Colombia's appointment to chair the heads of  state and government meeting in 1995, Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina said to PRENSA LATINA that "it is a tough  commitment for Latin America at a difficult moment in the  movement."</p>

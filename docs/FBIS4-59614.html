			<p>BFN     [Text] Algiers, May 15 (AFP) -- The chairman of the  Arab-Islamic Rally party has been murdered after being abducted,  press reports said here Sunday [15 May].    Laid Grine, 49, who was also an Algiers lawyer, was found  Saturday morning near Algiers with his throat cut, the reports  said.    The lawyer had been captured the previous day by  unidentified  abductors from his house at Bordj El Mokhfi east of Algiers.    There has been no official response to his kidnapping and  murder, but press reports said he had succeeded Wednesday in  gaining the acquittal of an Islamic fundamentalist being tried  by one of the country's special "anti-terrorism" courts.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (13): Forget about the old up and down cycles - The recovery may be full of surprises, argues Albrecht Schmidt Germany is in the process of recovering from the worst recession it has known. But the economic upswing must not be allowed to conceal the fact that in the medium and long term our country must learn to deal with problems of a quite different order from cyclical ups and downs. Germany is confronted with dramatically sharpened competition in which three overlapping developments combine to create an historic challenge: the economic future of our country depends on our ability to master it. The intensification of global competition through breathtaking advances in communications technology, the removal of global trade barriers and competitive pressures emerging from south-east Asia. The process of deepening and widening the European Union. The emergence of wholly new competitors on our threshold following the fall of the Iron Curtain in eastern Europe. These developments confront us with both opportunities and risks. Germany, itself rich in human and investment capital, will be able to benefit in future from improved international distribution of labour. The enlargement of markets as a result of the fall of the Iron Curtain and the expansion of the European community will allow greater series-production in manufacturing which will generate appreciable cost-savings. Nor should we under-estimate the possibilities presented by the variety of products we have to offer - thanks to the Mittelstand companies forming the backbone of the economy. Germany's geographical position in the centre of Europe should also be especially beneficial. But the greater the opportunities, the greater the risks of reacting wrongly to them. Private business must take care to adapt to the new circumstances: reorganisation is already under way in many sectors. But doubts must be raised over the government's will and ability to react adequately and the readiness to be flexible on the part of wage negotiators. With these doubts in mind, I see the need for thorough-going reforms in five areas of policy. Less protectionism: Germans have to come to terms with the fact that our industries in which we are less productive than other countries will shrink. It is even more important that we accept contraction in those sectors where, even though we may be more productive than foreigners, our lead is relatively narrow. I offer mining, the steel industry, agriculture and textiles as possible examples, although I admit the latter already have a large part of the necessary adjustment process behind them. But only if we take Ricardo's theory of relative cost advantage seriously can we realise the hoped-for trading profits from improved international distribution of labour. To date economic policy has tended mostly to hamper structural change necessary in our labour market, and it is time to call a halt. It is absurd to subsidise jobs in mining with annual funding sufficient to send each of our 150,000 mine workers on a year-long holiday to Majorca. Deregulation: The most important way we can arm ourselves for new competitive conditions is to reduce and thin out the dense mass of state regulation. It is not the job of the state to act as aide and agent to private enterprise which wants to protect itself from unwelcome competition by means of excessive restrictions on access to markets. There are more than enough examples of inefficient regulatory measures. Is it really necessary, for example, to insist that an individual must have a master craftsman's certificate as a precondition to setting up in a small business? Is it really not enough for the would-be proprietor to demonstrate five years' experience as a journeyman carpenter, bricklayer or whatever? Should a plumber really be forbidden from re-laying the tiles he removed while fitting a new bath, or rebuilding the wall he pulled down to get at the pipes behind? The skilled crafts associations and guilds complain about the increase in illicit work. But isn't the proliferation of working 'on the black' merely a natural reaction to excessive regulation of the market? Cost-benefit analysis instead of book-keeping: It is not possible to make an exception of the state at a time when individuals and all other institutions are having to adapt to new conditions. Progressive tax rates have led to an insidious increase in the state's share of gross domestic product, and at the same time the obligation to use tax revenues economically has been put to one side. Special interest groups infest the parliamentary environment and have found ways, out of public view, of gorging themselves on the taxation honeypot. The jungle of new legislation grows as every generation of parliamentarians responds to the perceived need to justify its existence. Party political democracy is stuck fast in a tangled web of interests. How can the excessive growth of state involvement be contained, and how can we ensure its internal efficiency? This is not a matter which can be resolved by better book-keeping: it would be far more effective if every large state spending project were subjected to a cost-benefit analysis. The profitability criteria of the market economy can in many instances be applied effectively to governmental regulatory measures. Consider environmental protection: in Germany we try to protect the environment by prescriptions which lay down technical standards and procedures for business activities which burden the environment. These standards are inefficient because while they present no problems for some companies, they impose conditions on others which cannot be fulfilled. The application of the so-called 'bubble concept' in the US demonstrates that you can have cheaper and more efficient environmental protection. The concept is based on limited geographical areas - the bubbles - within which tradeable pollution licences permit the transfer of pollutant discharges between the companies operating within the bubbles. Improving the efficiency of the state also involves letting light into the legislative jungle. Rather as Bavaria has done in drastically cutting its building regulations, all legal systems need to be thinned. A secondary goal here would be to transfer more responsibility to individual citizens. Responsibility' self or state? Reinforcement of individual responsibility is also a necessary part of the reforms to the social welfare system. The state cannot be responsible for every slight mishap or loss of earnings. In order to avoid any misunderstandings: no-one wants to sacrifice social welfare. But it has to be acknowledged that the German system is on collision course with every principle of efficiency in the book, and is no longer affordable in its present form. The essence of the 'social state' lies in the insurance cover it offers its citizens. Accordingly, as with every form of insurance, state protection reduces the insured person's incentive to make personal efforts to reduce damage or risk. In the end the benefits of insurance fall not only on those who have stumbled into difficulties through no fault of their own, but also those who failed to bother to take any precautionary measures. The private insurance industry solves the problem generally by offering partial-cover contracts under which the insured accepts responsibility for part of the risk. Transferring this technique to the social welfare system will increase both its efficiency and the popular sense of responsibility. An obvious example is the case of the much-discussed Karenztage system of funding sick pay. (The principle is that workers staying at home through sickness should not be paid for the first day or days, thus ensuring that people with minor illnesses, or hangovers, think twice before taking time off.) Unemployment insurance can also be made more efficient in similar ways: the interest among employees and employers in reducing joblessness can be strengthened by transferring some of the financial and management burdens associated with the problem to the so-called social partners which negotiate wages pacts. In principle there are two extreme ways of arranging unemployment insurance: a wholly centralised form as we have now with the Federal Labour Office in Nuremberg, and a fully decentralised version comprising a multiplicity of smaller insurance schemes organised on sectoral basis or according to regional pay scales. The optimal answer certainly does not lie in the marginal solution chosen in Germany. But we might consider, for example, a system in which only a portion of the responsibilities and contributions remain with the federal labour office. A further portion could be distributed to special funds established for individual industrial sectors and regions which would then be responsible for managing their individual affairs with their own budgets. The effective insurance cover against structural unemployment would be somewhat reduced in this construction. But I believe the jobless total would fall because there would inevitably be more moderate pay settlements which in the end would reflect a better balance between the interests of the employers, the employees and the unemployed. Shares instead of pay: Whatever else happens, moderate pay deals will be forced on the market in future. You do not need to be a prophet to see that more than 10-fold pay differentials such as we have in the European Union are not sustainable. That means German wages must undergo considerable adjustment: at the very least they cannot continue to rise as quickly as they have until now. The development of Germany so far has been characterised by the shrinking labour force's ability to demand steadily increasing scarcity premiums while economic growth allowed the accumulation of ever more capital. Although the availability of human labour hardly increased, the sum of earned incomes in general terms grew just as quickly as gross domestic product and investment earnings. This will change in future. According to everything economists know about competitive processes, future growth in the German economy will be marked by a far-reaching uncoupling of investment and earned incomes. Any distribution policy seeking to fulfil its aims via pay increases will provoke mass unemployment which would be a far greater threat to the social peace than any change in the way earnings are distributed. One promising solution might involve changing the distribution of wealth to the benefit of wage earners. There are many possibilities for increasing property ownership among employees, and pay policy has an especially important role to play. The motto for pay talks for the coming years should be 'Savings not cash' (Sparlohn statt Barlohn). If pay rises are paid in share certificates rather than in cash, the advantages are not limited to improved liquidity for the companies. The employees benefit too: with the right to dividends and profit-sharing they gain a second income stream in addition to their wage or salary.

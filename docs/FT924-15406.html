			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Arts: Arcadian dreams - Architecture The idea of arcadia has interested me for a long time. 'Arcadia' means a place of rustic happiness that relies upon nature for its inspiration, but is itself man made. In his Georgics, Virgil understood the need for men to be inspired by the seasons, by the moods of nature and by bucolic pleasures that are not easily at hand in cities. Ancient Romans who went to their villas wanted to be close to nature, both to observe it and to control it. Life in the villa was often highly sophisticated, and part of this sophistication was the affectation of simple rustic values and the acceptance of the country as a place of innocence and the home of 'truth.' In England, the development of arcadian ideas is inextricably tied up with the growth of the culture of the country house and so it is entirely appropriate that The National Trust should arrange a travelling exhibition entitled An English Arcadia. This display of drawings and water colours concerned with the designs of gardens, landscapes and garden buildings comes mainly from the Trust's collections, selected by Gervase Jackson-Stops, the Architectural Adviser to the Trust. The purpose behind the exhibition is to raise funds for the Stowe Landscape Appeal to restore the landscape and garden buildings of this major example of English landscape history, which the Trust acquired in 1989. The exhibition has already toured the US and is currently in London at Hazlitt Gooden and Fox, Bury Street, St. James's, SW1. It will go on tour in England later in the year. Landscape and garden history are fast replacing architecture and interior design as cult subjects of study. probably. I am sure this is linked to both the new green consciousness and the economic recession. Almost everyone can plant a seed, and the national pastime of gardening is now looking for some academic roots. Planting trees is less expensive, and often more satisfying, than erecting buildings. If only the one third of the architectural profession that is currently out of work would take up landscape the world would rapidly become a richer and greener place. The drawings and water colours in The English Arcadia exhibition are paper evidence of a passion for natural order and perfection. The arcadian sentiment is used to make an evocative title, but the idea of arcadia is, alas, not really explored at all. However, it is perfectly possible for the visitor to explore the idea with his own eyes and mind. Indeed, this is the perfect exhibition for imaginary journeys. There are 125 exhibits, beginning with 17th century drawings and going on to the 1980's with an example of the work of Quinlan Terry. The Westbury Court garden on the banks of the Severn in Gloucestershire is shown in the form of an engraving by Johannes Kip which was published in 1712. Here you have the contemporary printed evidence for a garden that has now been restored by the National Trust as the perfect example of a Dutch-inspired water garden. Westbury was in the hands of a property speculator in the 1960's and was very nearly lost for ever. Today it represents a triumph of restoration that has been much helped by the existence of the contemporary views and the account books that show the botanical nature of the planting. Westbury is small and perfect. It is still improving, and its history demonstrates the vulnerability of gardens: they can so easily completely disappear. The small but perfect vision of a garden is intriguingly typified by the drawings by Sir James Thornhill (1675-1734), of sketches for a trompe l'oeil garden. He proposed a series of painted views to go on the walls of a house in London's Bloomsbury Square. This is the imaginative vision of a personal arcadia that would remain imaginary because it would add an illusion of space to a small town garden. Modern designers please copy. The drawings were found at the National Trust's property at Erdigg in North Wales. Plans of great 18th century parks and landscapes are an important element of this exhibition and they certainly deserve a lot of study. Initially they just look like trees and grass in plan, but in the catalogues there is often an accompanying legend that helps you to visualise the full extent of the changes planned to the English landscape. Stowe is well represented here by the work of the French artist Jaques Rigaud, who was invited to England by the landscape designer responsible for Stowe, Charles Bridgeman. John Claude Nattes is another artist who left behind hundreds of views of Stowe that will be of enormous value in the restoration of the landscape and temples. His views have great charm even if they lack great artistic merit. There is often more charm than art in many representations of landscape and garden buildings. It is important to remember that, although the inspiration for much of the English arcadian vision came from artists like Claude, Poussin and Watteau, it was often created by gentlemen amateurs and their gardeners. There is so much of delight and interest in this exhibition. Humphry Repton, Edwin Lutyens, William Burgess - they are all represented. If the particular strengths of the collected drawings lies in the 18th century, that is because the arcadian spirit was then at its height and had not be swamped by Romanticism or plantsmanship. The National Trust has a responsibility for a quite remarkable slice of artistic and creative history - this exhibition shows how much of the richness of the vision survives on paper. Much still exists to delight us on the ground, but we must neverforget how vulnerable this created landscape actually is.</p>

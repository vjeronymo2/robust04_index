Instead of the approximately 36,000  housing units that were the subject of an agreement, it is now  expected that approximately 45,000 units will be built at 40  different locations. They will be handed over at the end of  1994.    The Federal Government had originally made 7.8 billion  German  marks [DM] available for apartments, technical and social  infrastructure, certain production facilities, and housing  construction combines. Last year, a further DM550 million was  added to the housing program. According to figures provided by  Hinrichs, contracts for over 40,000 housing units at 37  different locations have been signed. A further four or five  locations where 5,000 housing units are to be built are still at  the planning stage. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / BA surges but warns on USAir: Pre-tax profits up 63% - Return of business traffic. Further gains expected British Airways yesterday reported a 63 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to more than Pounds 300m for the year to March, but warned it may have to make provisions on a Pounds 275.3m investment in USAir, its troubled US partner. The future of BA's 24.6 per cent stake in USAir remains the biggest cloud over the UK carrier's short-term prospects. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, said USAir's future hinged on it negotiating concessions from its labour force. If this was not achieved, BA directors believed a provision for permanent diminution in the book value of the investment would be necessary. Sir Colin described the airline's overall performance as a 'significant improvement' in a highly competitive market. He added that BA expected to show a 'further recovery in earnings' this year. Annual pre-tax profits totalled Pounds 301m, compared with Pounds 185m in 1992-93. In the last quarter, BA made a Pounds 1m pre-tax profit, turning around a Pounds 62m loss, with operating profits of Pounds 55m against a Pounds 25m loss. Sir Colin said BA's performance contrasted with the rest of the airline industry, which last year lost Dollars 4.1bn (Pounds 2.7bn) on international scheduled services. BA's progress reflected its cost-cutting drive, increased revenues and a 6 per cent recovery in first and business class traffic. Turnover rose 13.2 per cent to Pounds 6.3bn, while operating profits increased 60 per cent to Pounds 496m. BA carried 30.6m passengers last year, up 8.9 per cent. Gains were made across all its routes, with European services showing a Pounds 69m operating profit; the Americas Pounds 129m; Africa, the Middle East and Indian sub-continent Pounds 203m; and the Far East and Australasia Pounds 95m. However, disruption caused by the IRA terrorist attacks on Heathrow airport in March cost the airline about Pounds 10m. Among its global alliances, only Qantas, the Australian airline, was making any money. Mr Robert Ayling, BA's managing director, said improvements were expected at the French affiliate TAT, following the launch of a restructuring and job cutting programme, and at the German affiliate Deutsche BA. Overall, losses from associates declined by Pounds 6m to Pounds 11m last year. The losses at TAT and Deutsche BA were offset by BA's share of profits from Qantas and by preferred dividends from USAir amounting to Pounds 16m. USAir's losses are not consolidated. Earnings per share totalled 31.3p, against 23.1p. A final dividend of 7.92p gives a total of 11.10p, up 9.3 per cent. BA employees will receive a share of the profits equal to 1.08 weeks' basic pay in cash or shares, or a total of Pounds 21m. The last profit-sharing was for 1991-92 when employees received two weeks' pay. Lex, Page 18; The USAir shadow, Page 23</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE RANCH . . .  </P> <P> Amid the bulldozed hills and subdivisions-in-progress, a horse ranch has arisen  in Calabasas.  </P> <P> Rancho del Puma, a 100-acre complex in the Santa Monica Mountains, is the  creation of developer Larry Dinovitz, who put his cousin, 20-year-old  show-jumper Candice Schlom, in charge of the operation.  </P> <P> The private facility, which opened a year ago, has a knotty-pine stable with 16  horses, a 250-by-300-foot sand ring, a terraced grand-prix derby field and a  partially covered patio for spectators. At least two show-jumping competitions  a year will be held at the ranch.  </P> <P> "This is a duplication of other facilities in other countries where our horses  will be competing in international competitions," Dinovitz said.  </P> <P> Dinovitz has been involved with horses most of his life. In the 1960s, he and  his wife owned and operated the Rocking K, a dude ranch in Bishop, Calif.  </P> <P> The surrounding mountains provide privacy but also have another benefit. "We do  a lot of riding in the mountains for the horses' muscles," Schlom said.  </P> <P> As for the name of the ranch . . .  </P> <P> "There's a puma in these mountains," Schlom said. "We've seen it once." JEFF  MEYERS  </P></p>

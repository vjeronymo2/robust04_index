			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIFFERENT VIEWS ON 'MINORITY MOM'  </P> <P> To Janis and Harry Kerker: You are right on in your choices and your judgment.  </P> <P> It seems inane to me for a couple to have children, then farm them out to be  nurtured by (1) a person who sometimes does not speak the family language, (2)  a person with a below-standard education, (3) a person who does not possess the  family's goals, objectives and approach to life.  </P> <P> I could say a lot on the subject of raising children -- because my three are  grown college graduates. My life was one of marriage, divorce, single head of  household raising children -- the whole nine yards, but it has been done.  </P> <P> ROBBIE SALOMON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

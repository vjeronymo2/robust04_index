			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Company News This Week: Signs that jam will soon sugar the pill - Dutch Chemicals The two Dutch chemicals groups, Akzo Nobel and DSM, are expected to confirm growing signs of recovery in the European chemicals industry when they release their second-quarter results on Wednesday. Of the two companies, DSM is expected to see the stronger rise, mainly because its position as a commodities chemicals producer meant that its performance in the corresponding quarter of 1993 was particularly weak. Analysts are looking for net profits of between Fl 35m (Pounds 12.9m) and Fl 70m compared with a profit of just Fl 4m a year ago. Akzo Nobel, whose presence in sectors such as pharmaceuticals means that its second-quarter figures are less cyclical than DSM's, is forecast to show a rise of 25 per cent or more from the same quarter of 1993. Both companies are expected to benefit from Europe's emergence from recession. The two companies' results are regarded as important pointers for other cyclical sectors on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Shares in both companies rose sharply early in 1994 as investors began to focus on sectors likely to benefit most from higher economic growth in Europe. The weakness of the dollar sent the shares lower in early summer, but they have since recovered to trade within reach of 12-month highs set in the spring.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / ITN radio franchise bid unlikely Independent Television News has almost certainly decided not to bid today for the third UK national commercial radio licence for a predominantly speech-based service. ITN, which had been planning a bid with Planet 24 - the independent production company - is still interested in radio, but has been put off, it is believed, by two factors. One is the uncertainty over precisely what format the BBC is planning for its news and sport service on Radio 5, Five Live. The other is the announcement by the Radio Authority that a fourth national radio service is now an option. Fears, particularly of an INR4, are likely to reduce the number of serious bidders for the INR3 licence to four or five, though it could be developed as an all-news and talk station. There is also considerable doubt that either GWR, the Bristol-based radio group, or London's Capital Radio, whose two licences are soon to be re-advertised, will put in a bid. There is also growing doubt whether Classic FM, a rumoured runner, will go forward. 'The phones are still red hot. Everyone is still talking to everyone else,' said one radio industry executive, who added that some decisions may not be taken until this morning. Firm bidders include: Associated Newspapers together with SelecTV and the Radio Trust, a consortium of radio interests. Apollo Radio, a consortium that includes Chiltern Radio, Radio 702 of Johannesburg and two financial institutions. A consortium led by Mr John Whitney, former director-general of the Independent Broadcasting Authority. LBC, a company that has little choice but to bid. The London commercial broadcaster goes off the air in October, having lost its licences to London News Radio.</p>

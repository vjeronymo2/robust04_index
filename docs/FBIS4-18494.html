			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dominique Garraud: "Defense: Leotard Presents </F> Estimate]    [Editorial Report] Between 657 and 664 billion francs for  military equipment expenditures over 6 years. The army got a  considerable amount, but they are not truly satisfied, for the  programs already launched are bottomless pits. This somehow  expresses the general philosophy of the forthcoming 1995-2000  military planning law. [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard  announced yesterday at the Polytechnic School that "the final  version is definitely ready."    According to our information, the planning law envisions an  annual increase of 0.5 percent per year in defense equipment  allocations on the basis of the 100.4 billion francs mentioned  in the 1994 budget. It will thus be a deviation from the 5-year  law aimed at reducing budgetary expenditures, which advocates a  yearly drop of 0.5 percent in public spending. For the part  covering the last three years (1998-2000), military planners  even envision an annual increase of 1.5 percent in expenditures  if economic growth permits this. That is, an overall figure  between 657 and 664 billion francs in current terms over 6 years.    At the outset, the general staffs and the Defense Ministry  had asked for a minimal increase of 3 percent per year to  maintain the large armaments programs already launched.  According to a report by French Democratic Union (UDF) deputy  Arthur Paecht, these programs will swallow up about 574 billion  francs over 8 years, of which about 150 billion were already  allocated before the end of 1993.    According to a senior military official, the army will thus  be compelled to economize "on operational costs and abandon  small programs," but also to cut major programs and delay those  it wants to launch as soon as possible. Briefly put, it will  have to dream of strong growth for better days ahead.    A compromise will be proposed to [President] Francois  Mitterrand, who has expressed the hope that the ballistic  missile M5 designed to replace the M45 on nuclear  missile-launching submarines should not be sacrificed. The  Defennse Ministry also proposes to delay putting this missile  into service from 2005 to 2010 so as to limit its allocations in  the next 6 years. On the other hand, studies will begin next  year to modernize the Albion Plateau where Francois Mitterrand  wants new nuclear missiles deployed in 2003, while numerous  experts propose that this land component of the (nuclear) strike  force be purely and simply abandoned.    In contrast, no decision will be made regarding the  construction of a second nuclear aircraft carrier before 1997.  This second aircraft carrier was requested by the Navy to  replace the Foch, after the Charles de Gaulle, taking over from  the Clemenceau, enters into service in 1999.    One of the most threatened programs, the NH90 European  transport helicopter --launched in cooperation with Germany, the  Netherlands, and Italy--will be the object of serious review  next year. According to a military official, the specifications  of this helicopter intended for the Navy and the Army will be  reviewed so that the program's total cost (9 billion francs, of  which 4.2 billion will go to industry and the state) be reduced  by 20 to 30 percent.    The planning law does not envision new delays for the  delivery of the Dassault-built Rafale fighter aircraft to the  Air Force and the Navy in the year 2000. However, the number of  aircraft may be reduced. This program alone is estimated at 178  billion francs on the basis of 320 aircraft for the French  armies.    The Leclerc tank may be scaled back. While 1,400 units were  originally envisioned for the Army, the present target is 650,  and there is even talk of 400 tanks.    The Army is also concerned about its total force. It should  have 233,000 soldiers in 1997, compared to 290,000 in 1990 and  241,000 in 1994. The Budget Ministry would like to reduce this  number even further.    Prepared by the Defense Ministry in conjunction with the  general staffs and the General Armaments Delegation (DGA), the  bill will still be discussed next week by the office of the  prime minister. It will be reviewed by the defense council and  Francois Mitterand at the beginning of April, presented to the  council of ministers at the end of April, and submitted to  Parliament at the end of May.</p>

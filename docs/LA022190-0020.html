			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLD SNAP'S DAMAGE TO CROPS LESS THAN FEARED  </P> <P> Reports from San Diego County farmers suggest that last week's cold spell did  relatively little damage, contrary to initial fears, according to Bill  Snodgrass, the county's assistant agricultural commissioner.  </P> <P> Farmers now believe that an estimated 5% of the county's $100-million avocado  crop was damaged during the cold spell that broke with the arrival of last  weekend's rainstorm, Snodgrass said.  </P> <P> Strawberry and cucumber crops appear to have fared even better, according to  farmers' reports, Snodgrass said.  </P> <P> "There hasn't been any more damage since last Wednesday or Thursday. But we're  waiting for reports on some of the borderline stuff."  </P> <P> Farmers are now trying to determine if fruit that remains on trees has been  damaged by the cold.  </P> <P> "One thing they look at are if the cells on stems have been damaged," Snodgrass  said. "If there's been stem damage, the good fruit can fall off."  </P> <P> Mature avocados that fall off trees during cold spells can often be salvaged,  he said. Consequently, consumers should enjoy an increased supply -- and  possibly, lower prices -- during coming weeks. But, longer term, the cold will  reduce the size of this year's avocado crop, Snodgrass said.  </P> <P> The recent cold snap was "nothing like the freeze we had 2 1/2 years ago," he  noted.  </P> <P> "Then it was so bad there was nothing to pick."  </P></p>

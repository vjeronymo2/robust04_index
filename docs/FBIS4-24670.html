			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 30 (CNS) -- Statistics from China's  customs show that China's agricultural products lack  competitiveness in the international market and its export of  such products will not be optimistic this year.    According to the statistics, China's export value of  agricultural products was U.S.$10.11 billion last year, 2.5  percent up over the year before and making up 11.1 percent of  the total export value in the country, indicating that such  export was basically in a wandering state. Though the country  saw a great growth in quantity of most agricultural products for  export since there had been three years of good harvests in the  country, resulting in a big increase of agricultural products  and animal livestock, the country's export value of general  trade, which is the main way for agricultural exports, was  U.S.$7.61 billion last year, dropping by 12.4 percent.    Experts said that the decline in China's agricultural  product  competitiveness in the international market mainly resulted from  the low quality and low prices of such products and the growth  of such exports in the country mainly depended on the increase  in amount of exports.</p>

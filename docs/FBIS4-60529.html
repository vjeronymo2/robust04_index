			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] One of the parties to the Sudanese conflict, the  Sudanese Peoples' Liberation Movement/Sudanese Peoples'  Liberation Army [SPLM/SPLA], today claimed that the suspended  Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development peace  talks on the Sudan were a waste of time and accused other  parties attending the talks of not having faith in the peace  negotiations. At a press conference in Nairobi this afternoon,  the deputy leader of the SPLM/SPLA delegation to the talks,  Yusuf Makki, said the Sudanese Government representatives  declined to discuss any cease-fire arrangements during the  week-long consultations. The faction also announced the  establishment of new administrative organs to be headed by  SPLM/SPLA leaders to manage the affairs of a section of the  Sudan, which they referred to as new Sudan. The faction said  the new Sudan, comprising five regions in southern Sudan, may in  future secede from the Sudan. [passage omitted]</p>

Comrades in charge of political and legal affairs work from  across the province conscientiously studied a series of  important instructions issued by a number of central leaders  with regard to maintaining political stability and social order;  analyzed in an in-depth manner the province's present political  and legal affairs work on the basis of summing up last year's  work; and laid down the tasks for 1994 in light of Qinghai's  realities.    Provincial party committee Secretary Yin Kesheng delivered a  speech at the closing session in which he stated: Over the past  year, political and legal affairs workers across the province  have made strenuous efforts and scored noticeable achievements.  We are going to accomplish more onerous tasks in 1994. Given  the fact that the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee adopted the "Decision on Several Questions on Building  a Socialist Market Economic Structure," we are bound to witness  speedier reform and construction in 1994. We are facing an  excellent opportunity for faster development on the one hand and  a rigorous test and challenge on the other. In order to narrow  the gap between Qinghai and the rest of the country and more  successfully push ahead with reform and construction, we should  comprehensively step up political and legal affairs work and  strive to maintain social stability.    Speaking of Qinghai's political and legal affairs work in  1994, Comrade Yin Kesheng noted: We should understand more  clearly the importance of political and legal affairs work in  the new situation; unswervingly adhere to the principle of  firmly grasping two types work at the same time; and make every  possible endeavor to maintain provincewide stability. To this  end, Yin Kesheng added, efforts should be made to strengthen  leadership; conduct work in a down-to-earth manner; and strive  to open up new vistas for the province's political and legal  affairs work in 1994. First and foremost, the provincial  political and legal affairs committee should strengthen  leadership over all political and legal affairs departments  across the province; strengthen coordination among and  supervision of public security, procuratorial, and judicial  organs at all levels; and work hard to open up new vistas for  the province's political and legal affairs work. Second, party  committees at all levels across the province should strengthen  overall leadership over political and legal affairs work while  governments at all levels should render unreserved support to  political and legal affairs work with a view to further pushing  ahead with the province's political and legal affairs work in  1994.    Comrade Yin Kesheng noted: The political and legal affairs  workers in Qinghai are loyal to the party and the people. Over  the past many years they have made indelible contributions to  Qinghai's stability and development. Nevertheless, problems  have also been discovered within the ranks of political and  legal affairs workers. In view of this situation, it is  necessary to make every possible endeavor to turn the province's  contingent of political and legal affairs workers into a  contingent that is politically reliable, professionally  competent, and capable of fighting tough battles and  withstanding all tests and is supported and cherished by the  broad masses of the people across the province.    Comrade Yin Kesheng maintained: It would be impossible to  successfully further political and legal affairs work in the  absence of the party and government's leadership and support.  Thus, party committees and governments at all levels in Qinghai  should continue, as always, to attach great importance to and  support political and legal affairs work; constantly guide  political and legal affairs work with correct principles and  policies; assist political and legal affairs departments to  independently investigate and handle cases in accordance with  the law as well as strictly enforcing the law under the guidance  of the party's basic line; show concern for and help political  and legal affairs departments tackle problems in work; and  assist public security, procuratorial, and judicial organs in  updating technological equipment and improving working  conditions.    Comrade Yin Kesheng stated: The whole society is undoubtedly  duty-bound to step up political and legal affairs work and  improve social order. All areas, departments, trades, and  professions as well as all social strata should give support to  and enhance cooperation with political and legal affairs  departments and join them in successfully strengthening  management of comprehensive social order. All units, urban  district offices, and neighborhood committes, as well as rural  and pastoral villages and townships across the province, should  make continued efforts to establish and perfect a responsibility  system aimed at stepping up comprehensive social order  management with a view to creating an overall social atmosphere  for maintaining social order and improving the general social  mood, wherein all bad deeds and people will be invariably  opposed, thereby: Exerting more social pressure on all types of  criminals; improving social order across the province in a  comprehensive way; and lowering the province's crime rate to a  minimum.    Chen Yanqin, Tang Zhengren, and Doba, provincial party  committee standing committee members; Huanjue Cenam, provincial  people's congress standing committee chairman; provincial Vice  Governor La Bingli; and other comrades also attended the closing  session.    Lu Haiping, provincial political and legal affairs committee  deputy secretary, made a summing-up speech at the closing  session.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Despatches: Hold the front page . . . again WHILE the British press sought last week to establish its freedom to define what is the public interest and what is common prurience, the Russian media was engaged in a more fundamental battle: to establish its right to an independent existence of any kind. As the anniversary of the August putsch approaches, it becomes clear that the post-communist politicians, as well as the post-communist editors and post-communist readers , have no settled view on what constitutes a proper relationship between them. At the heart of the struggle is the newspaper Izvestia, for nearly 75 years the organ of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and since the putsch a self-declared independent publication. Under Igor Golembiovsky, its chief editor, it has established itself as the closest thing to a paper of record - as Golembiovsky puts it: 'The political paper for the intelligent part of our society' - both for Russia and the former Soviet republics. Its sympathies are pro-reform, broadly supportive of Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president and the cabinet of Yegor Gaidar. It cannot, however, escape its past, when it was an organ of the Supreme Soviet. The takeover by the staff on August 23 1991 of the paper is now being challenged by those who consider themselves the successor to the Soviet - that is, the parliament of Russia. In particular, Ruslan Khasbulatov, its leader, has made it his particular mission to bring Izvestia back under parliamentary control and to force it once again to be the 'Izvestia (news) of the Supreme Soviet of Russia' - a kind of daily Hansard. Last Friday, the parliament voted heavily to repossess the paper - a decision which has sparked what could turn out to be a momentous clash between the legislative power on the one hand and the presidential and government powers on the other. On Wednesday, Mikhail Poltoranin, the information minister, said with Yeltsin's backing, that he would defy parliament. Golembiovsky was called tothe parliament, where he argued that the editorial staff had acted legally, had not appropriated state property and were merely renting it. But the deputies were not mollified. An example: Khasbulatov: 'How come you get the chance to take part in a discussion for hours on TV about the problems of your paper, which is only of interest to you and those who think like you?' Golembiovsky: 'Ruslan Imranovich, you well know that I don't run the TV. They asked me so I went.' Khasbulatov: 'Well, that's clear. They asked you. And why did they ask you? Why not some of the deputies who have been concerned with this for months? Its clear why they asked you - because you've waged war on the Russian government.' Golembiovsky: 'That's not true . . .' Another deputy complained: 'A group of us deputies from Kabardino-Balkaria tried for three months to get you to publish our view of the inter-ethnic relations in the Northern Caucasus. You refused: why?' The debate clearly had elements of farce. But beyond the farce is a threat. Hardly one of the Russian papers is actually free of the state: most - including Izvestia - receive millions of roubles of state support each year: even those which are supposedly independent must print on state-owned presses and get state-allocated paper. Yeltsin seems to have supported the new press, without demanding sycophancy as his price: but there is little in the way of institutions, or of tradition, to stop him changing his mind. Golembiovsky says: 'The press is the only democratic institution in Russia now, and it is weak. The traditions left to us by the Soviet period are servile: we must reach back to the 19th century, when there were papers which did express themselves freely'. Nor is the state the only threat. Many of the 'business' papers are owned by the new commercial institutions, especially the commodity and stock exchanges: they are hardly to be expected to be critical of these institutions, which is why the formerly Communist journals such as Literaturnaya Gazeta do most to expose business corruption. But bribery of journalists is widespread. Russia's press, after its liberation from the Communist Party, has shown diversity. Liberal papers like Nezavisimaya and Commersant jostle with the still-Communist Pravda, the nationalistic Sovetskaya Rossiya and the near-fascist Dyen. Indeed, it contrasts well with the press of other former Soviet republics. But it is fragile. Golembiovsky says he has been heavily criticised recently for printing the Ukrainian or other republics' points of view when he should be a Russian paper. He says: 'There is going to be a huge struggle for power in the autumn; the government will be under attack; there will be a fight over a new constitution. The economic situation will be worse: there will be a real threat of authoritarian rule. The press is in danger'.</p>

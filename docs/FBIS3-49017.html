			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic after </F> talks with (Sergio Demel), adviser to UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali, in Pale on 3 January -- recorded]    [Text] We have agreed that there is no animosity between  the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] and the Serb side, that the  Serbs are very cooperative in that respect, but that some  [humanitarian] convoys are being delayed because of  irregularities in the convoys themselves. Either there is no  permission to search the entire convoy, or there are too many  people or things, and our soldiers abide strictly to what they  have on their lists. We might show a bit more flexibility  toward UNPROFOR there. However, we do have to be somewhat  cautious since the Muslims are doubtless getting weapons and  ammunition, that is beyond any doubt.    We would never accuse the UNPROFOR Command. We know that  General Briquemont and all his officers are exceptionally  professional and honorable soldiers, but individuals are  probably smuggling arms for money. We have to be very cautious  there as we do not want the war to be prolonged.</p>

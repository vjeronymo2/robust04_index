This was stated to journalists by Richard  Nixon after his speech at the State Duma committee for  international affairs. "I held meetings with a number of  leaders and concluded that right now there is no one who would  be ready to take his place," the U.S. ex-president stressed.  "They will appear but for the moment there are no people like  that," ITAR-TASS reports.    Speaking of his meetings with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy and Sergey  Shakhray, Richard Nixon noted: "They are both young, vigorous,  and highly educated. I think they can be viewed as potential  leaders. But I would not rule out others with whom I met. In  particular I was impressed by the Communists' leader Gennadiy  Zyuganov. But he will not become president since Russia does  not intend to return to communism."</p>

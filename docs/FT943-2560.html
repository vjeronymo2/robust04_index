			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Outlook for jobs buoyant Employment opportunities for the last quarter of this year are the best of any last quarter for five years, the latest Manpower survey of employment prospects shows. The survey - based on responses from 2,100 employers - shows 27 per cent of employers forecasting job increases and 13 per cent forecasting losses. The net balance of 14 per cent is double the 7 per cent for the last quarter of last year, although below the 15 per cent of the third quarter of this year. No region is forecasting job cuts in the three months to the end of December. The home counties is the most optimistic region with a positive net balance of 20 per cent. Only two regions are forecasting a worse position than last year - Scotland and the north-east. The private service-sector is the most buoyant with retail, hotel and catering, and transport and distribution all showing traditional strength in the run-up to Christmas.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text]  <H3>  Introduction of Test Facility for Space Station JEM (Ultra  High Speed Collision Test Facility) </H3>   A large number of meteorites and debris created by  explosions  of rockets are floating around the earth. The amount of debris  is increasing each year and is becoming a threat to space  shuttles and satellites that are flying around the earth. In  addition to numerous reports of dents and scratches found on the  windows of shuttles, there is even a report of a near miss  between a shuttle and a huge piece of debris.    In light of the fact that the space station is expected to  stay in orbit for 30 years and that there will be four-eight  people living in it all the time, protecting the space station  from meteorites and debris is an extremely serious matter. The  debris in the space station's orbit, which is about 400 km above  the earth, is moving at a speed of about 7.7 km/sec, and the  relative speed toward the space station can be as high as 15.4  km/sec.    The debris, classified by size, is as shown in Table 1.    Pieces larger than 10 cm have been identified by radar  observation, and the orbit of each of them has been calculated,  so that the space station's orbit is changed to avoid the  collision if the space station is expected to come in contact  with one of them.    The debris of the size range of 1-10 cm is a big problem for  the space station program, and no effective means of protection  has been found yet against them; our plan is to avoid potential  collisions with them through an intensified observation network.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-10A></FIG>                A bumper will be placed around the experimental module and  important equipment to soften the impacts of the debris smaller  than 1 cm. The ultrahigh-speed impact test equipment being  discussed here is designed to evaluate the protection capability  of such a bumper and pressure bulkhead.    This equipment was manufactured as a part of the basic  experiments associated with the development of the JEM  pressurized module and is installed at the Sagamihara Plant of  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries; the preliminary test to collect the  basic data with helium gas has been completed. At the moment, it  is undergoing a modification to make it suitable for the tests  using hydrogen gas, which has a faster expansion rate than  helium.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Operating principle of ultrahigh-speed collision test  equipment    Fig. 1 shows the schematic drawing of the ultrahigh-speed  collision test equipment.       The phenomena that occur between the ignition of the  explosive and the impact on the specimen are as follows:    (1) ignition of the explosive in the combustion chamber;    (2) breaking of the diaphragm by the combustion gas;    (3) acceleration of the piston as a result of the pressure  of  the combustion gas;    (4) compression of the light gas by the piston;    (5) breakage of the diaphragm by the high- pressure gas;    (6) acceleration of the projectile by the high- pressure  gas;    (7) separation of the sabot from the debris as a result of  gas resistance;    (8) measurement of the debris speed by a laser oscillator;    (9) impact on the specimen.    The sabot is a case that holds the debris; the use of the  sabot and the debris as separate pieces enables one to test  debris of various sizes and shapes. A good amount of experience  is required to achieve a successful separation between the sabot  and the debris.    2. Main specifications of ultrahigh-speed collision test  equipment    The specifications of the equipment using hydrogen gas are  as  follows:    Total lengthapprox. 22 m    Max. speed8 km/sec (target)    Max. debris diameter8mm    Max. debris mass0.5 g    Equipped with sabot separator    3. Test results up until now    Fig. 2 below shows the typical test example.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-007LC-10B>           Fig. 2 </FIG>     The picture shows the bumper at the left and the pressure  bulkhead at the center. The debris went through the bumper and  the pressure bulkhead as well, leaving a hole approximately 7 cm  in diameter. The test conditions were as follows:    Debris collision speed4.87 km/sec    Debris mass1.73 g (AI)    Distance between bumper and bulkhead10 cm    4. Future test plan    Since the design of the bumper surrounding the pressure  bulkhead has not been finalized yet and it is urgent that the  structural design of the pressurized unit itself be finalized,  the evaluation test of the pressure bulkhead will be conducted  first; the evaluation test of the bumper will be conducted next.  In the meanwhile, we also plan to accumulate data in  coordination with NASA and ESA.</p>

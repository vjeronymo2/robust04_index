			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE: FRESH AIR THROUGH WINDOWS 3.0  </P> <P> Microsoft's Windows 3.0, unveiled Tuesday, may turn out to be the most  significant development in the nine-year history of IBM and compatible personal  computers. The software, which works with the MS-DOS operating system, makes it  possible for millions of those machines to use an attractive graphical  interface similar to that on the Apple Macintosh.  </P> <P> Windows 3.0, with a suggested list price of $149, is neither a program nor an  operating system. It is an operating environment. As such, it governs the look  of the screen, the way users interact with programs and even the way programs  operate. It runs under the regular MS-DOS operating system on any IBM  compatible with an Intel 286, 386 or 486 central processing unit. Machines must  also have a hard disk, a graphic display and at least 1 megabyte of memory.  Although Windows will work with regular MS-DOS programs, it works best when  used with software designed especially for Windows.  </P> <P> Windows 3.0 has four primary advantages over regular MS-DOS. First, all  programs written for Windows have a similar look and feel. Once you learn how  to use one Windows program, you have a head start on the others. Second, the  graphical environment assures that programs operate in a "what you see is what  you get" mode so that what you see on the screen looks like what you'll get on  paper. Third, Windows, as does the Mac, makes it easy to transfer data from one  program to another. It's as simple as highlighting the information with the  mouse, copying it to the clipboard and pasting it in another program.  </P> <P> Finally, Windows 3.0 is a multi-tasking operating environment. That means it's  possible to load several programs into the computer's memory and switch between  them with a single command or mouse movement. You can even have several  programs share the screen, each in its own window. As I write this article, I  am simultaneously transmitting data to another computer. What's more, my  spreadsheet and drawing programs are in memory so that I can switch to them in  less than a second without having to stop what I'm doing.  </P> <P> Windows 3.0 can take advantage of up to 16 megabytes of memory. Regular MS-DOS  programs can use only 640K. I'm not suggesting you buy that much memory for  your system, but the more memory you have, the more programs you can run at one  time. Extra memory also increases performance in some situations.  </P> <P> Users whose machines are equipped with an Intel 386 or 486 CPU will be able to  use Windows to run several DOS or Windows applications in the background, with  each program behaving as if it's running in its own dedicated PC. It's also  possible for 386 users to allocate part of their hard disk to simulate random  access memory. This so-called virtual memory allows the 386 to continue to run  programs even after you've run out of regular memory.  </P> <P> I doubt if anyone but a software reviewer would do this, but as a test, I used  Windows on an 8-megabyte 386 to run WordPerfect, WordStar, Microsoft Word,  Lotus 1-2-3, Prodigy, Quattro, Word for Windows, Excel, Microphone II and  several other Windows and non-Windows programs -- all at the same time. Each  behaved perfectly. The only program I couldn't run was the one that controls my  compact disc drive. Ironically, that software was developed by Microsoft -- the  same company that developed Windows.  </P> <P> You can't run Windows 3.0 on a PC or PC/XT equipped with an Intel 8088 or 8086  CPU. However, most of those machines can be modified with faster CPUs.  </P> <P> If you buy Windows you should also count on buying new Windows-compatible  software. It's possible to use your old software, but the programs will look  and operate just like they always have. They will not offer Windows' graphical  user interface, although you will be able to use Windows to copy and paste  information between regular DOS programs or between DOS and Windows programs.  Some programs written to run under previous versions of Windows must be  modified before they can run properly with the new version.  </P> <P> Windows 3.0 comes with several free programs to get you started, including a  basic word-processing program, a calculator, a couple of games, a reasonably  good communications program and a personal organizer, called Daybook. Daybook  includes a place for your schedule, address book and "to do" list.  </P> <P> Early versions of Windows were criticized as being slow and ugly. What's more,  there has been a dearth of software. The new Windows is a lot faster and a lot  prettier. I've been using a prerelease copy for about a month and I'm extremely  impressed with its features, performance and reliability. I didn't get out my  stop watch to perform any timing tests, but its performance on my 386-based PC  seems at least as good as what I'm getting on a similarly equipped Macintosh  IIci -- a machine with a street price that's more than twice the cost of my PC.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well Windows performed on a minimal  configuration when I tested it on a machine with a 286 CPU and 1 megabyte of  random-access memory. If you shop around you can find such machines, equipped  with a hard disk and a high-resolution color monitor, for about $1,000.  </P> <P> Microsoft and other software companies are rushing to provide software to run  under Windows. Microsoft has already released Windows versions of its  spreadsheet (Excel) and word processing (Word) software. Software Ventures has  announced a forthcoming version of its Microphone Communications software, and  WordPerfect Corp. is working on a Windows version of its best-selling word  processing program. hDC Computer Corp. of Redmond, Wash., has released some  very good utilities programs for Windows, including one that makes it easier to  locate and run programs. Asymetrix, of Bellevue, Wash., has already released  ToolBook, a software development tool that is somewhat similar to Apple's  HyperCard language.  </P> <P> In an effort to add value to its systems and simplify the lives of its dealers  and customers, Zenith Data Systems is loading Windows 3.0 along with ToolBox  and DOS 4.0 on the hard disks of all its 286 and 386 desktop machines. Zenith  is also including a mouse as standard equipment.  </P> <P> Zenith, along with Microsoft, commissioned a study that concluded that  graphical user interfaces such as Windows and Macintosh cause users to work  faster and better and achieve higher productivity and lower frustration than  those using a regular, non-graphical interface.  </P> <P> Novice users of a graphics-based system completed 42% more tasks than novice  users of a non-graphics system, according to the study conducted by the  research firm Temple, Baker &amp; Sloane. Experienced users were 35% more  productive, according to the report.  </P> <P> The new version of Windows is an exciting and important development, bringing  many advantages of the Apple Macintosh to lower-priced IBM compatibles. It  breathes new life into the old MS-DOS operating system and has turned me into a  born-again DOS user.  </P></p>

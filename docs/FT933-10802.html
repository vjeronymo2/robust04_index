			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Management by machismo The message from IBM and a number of other big concerns could not be more clear. Jobs in almost any type of western company, at any level, are no longer secure in today's brutally competitive global marketplace. But what is less well understood is the need for companies to replace naked insecurity among their workforce with a redefined set of relationships to motivate those employees whom they wish to retain. The nature of those relationships, explicit and especially implicit, will dictate each company's productivity, flexibility, creativity and competitiveness. The pressures to cut, cut and cut again have become irresistible in certain industries and companies - especially those, like IBM, which have taken far too long to adjust their corporate strategies to the new realities of their particular marketplaces. Even strategically healthy western companies, such as US General Electric, have delayered, 'downsized' and refocused their activities, redefined their core 'competences' and businesses, and sold or subcontracted the rest. Many companies are now moving onto some form of 'business process re-engineering', which in plenty of cases will reduce jobs further. In the Anglo-Saxon economies, unlike Japan, a further source of pressure comes from enthusiastic shareholders, who cheer each successive cut as a sign that the company is getting itself in shape. Employee morale Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM's new chairman, is undoubtedly right to be wielding his hatchet. But this is not a sustainable way to run a company over time. Academic research has shown consistently that, while fear may motivate in the short term, prolonged uncertainty creates a fall in employee morale and productivity which is hard to halt, let alone reverse. Many of the best employees leave, while the rest are inclined to put their heads down and cease to give their all. Companies which take this approach are practising the antithesis of the adage that 'our employees are our greatest asset'. Their behaviour contrasts starkly with the continued striving of large Japanese companies, even in their current straitened circumstances, to hang on to the employees in which they have invested so much. Many are doing so by 'insourcing', pulling work back in from their suppliers. For an organisation to remove the insecurity of its employees and re-motivate them, while retaining the flexibility to adjust its size as necessary, it must first of all involve them more in decision-making. If people feel at least in partial control of their affairs, they are better able to accept that change has become a way of life. Just as necessary is a re-definition of the type or types of relationship, formal and implicit, which the organisation wishes to have with the people who work for it - not all of whom will remain as internal employees. Sideways careers There are plenty of models to choose from. One of the best-known is Professor Charles Handy's 'shamrock', with its three leaves: 'core professionals', 'the contractual fringe' and 'part-time or temporary workers'. Three characteristics, in particular, are common to all the models. First, the need for many people to develop 'sideways' careers and a 'portfolio' approach, instead of expecting to climb steadily within a single company and remain with it throughout their working life. Second, the consequential need for each employer to provide everyone with the time, opportunity and resources for continuous professional development, so that their skills remain up-to-date and tradeable. Third, the need for all kinds of flexible working arrangements to be encouraged within each category. None of this is mere theory. Silicon Valley companies have been applying various elements of it for some time, as have some architectural practices since recession forced them to slash their permanent staffs. One of the most striking examples is the external 'managed contracts' under which Manpower, the employment services company, provides staff for various companies, including IBM. Not all organisations will wish to be 'mixed' or flexible. But they all need their employees' commitment, and must take steps to re-engage it.</p>

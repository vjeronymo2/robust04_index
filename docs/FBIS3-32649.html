			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The split in the Senate of the Republic has been  confirmed. The members of the new office, presided over by  Senator Bernard Sansaricq, took possession of the administration  of the Senate. The operation was possible with the help of a  justice of the peace. Upon his return from Washington, Firmin  Jean-Louis, who had obtained U.S. support, will find his office  taken over by Bernard Sansaricq. Edner Jean, who followed the  case, filed a report:    [Begin recording] The operation took place on the afternoon  of 9 February, a few minutes after the news conference by Sen.  Sansaricq. This time, unlike the earlier, unsuccessful attempt  on 7 February, journalists were not invited to cover the event,  the second takeover of the office of the Senate of the Republic.  The only witness to the operation remains the justice of the  peace from the Department of the North who was executing an  order from the deputy public prosecutor.    To enforce their power in the Senate, the members of the  Action Group for the Recovery and Defense of National  Sovereignty [GARD] [vernacular not currently available] were not  moderate in their methodology. They simply broke down the doors  to the offices of the president of the National Assembly and the  quaestor. Then, on Wednesday afternoon, 9 February, they  installed a second president in the Senate of the Republic.    Today, 10 February, it is with a huge smile that Sen.  Dupiton  relates the facts. [passage omitted]    Now that the contested 18 January elected took effective or  fictitious control of the administration of the Senate of the  Republic, the solution to the crisis is only days away, if one  would believe Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton, who could care less  about the position of the international community or of  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Thomas Eddy Dupiton, spokesman  for GARD, told Radio Metropole that their decision will be  imposed on the nation. [passage omitted]    While serious questions are being raised on the legality of  the actions taken by the office of Sen. Sansaricq, a deputy from  the Constitutionalist bloc, Samuel Madistin, revealed that Sen.  Ebrane Cadet told him that the Army was behind this movement.  [passage omitted]    All things considered, with this new split within the Senate  of the Republic, it is the very survival of the parliament  itself that is being questioned. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Rank Organisation If the new accounting standards were already in force the Rank Organisation would have reported net earnings for last year of 6.8p instead of 37.8p. If respectable companies face such earnings volatility, it will be easy to overlook real transgressions in the transition. Rank has been refreshingly candid, but it has also used the opportunity to take a discreet Pounds 57m provision for diminution of assets which would not otherwise have shown up in the profit and loss account.</p>

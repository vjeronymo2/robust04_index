			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television There is a lot of comedy on Thursday nights, though not all is either new or good. Last Of The Summer Wine (8.00 BBC1) was exploiting the subject of pensioners long before it became trendy in series such as 'One Foot In The Grave'. Foggy, Compo, Clegg and the rest have been around for so long that virtually everyone must have decided whether they like the series. This is of course a repeat. So is Porridge, which begins another run. My guess is that, once again, it will get huge ratings. Clement and le Frenais have never written anything better than this prison saga and Ronnie Barker has never given a better performance than as Fletcher, the crafty old lag (10.00 BBC1). Between the two comes Us Girls (8.30 BBC1), which looks as though it is on screen because it is about black people and not because it was better than everything else on offer. The Big One, with Sandy Toksvig and Mike McShane as unlikely flatmates, is much the better choice (8.30 C4). Capable of being the best of the evening if the script is on form, Red Dwarf V takes us into outer space and a parallel universe to 'Star Trek" and all that.</p>

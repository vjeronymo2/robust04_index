			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (5): Backbenchers turn up the heat - Politicians describe British energy policy as too narrow and inadequately funded The UK was one of the most complacent nations in the world when it comes to energy efficiency - 'and that runs from the top to the bottom,' said Mr Robert Jones, a Conservative MP and the chairman of the influential House of Commons environment select committee. Mr Jones was launching a highly critical report on the government's approach to energy efficiency. The committee report blasted government conservation initiatives as being 'neither a sufficiently comprehensive nor an adequately funded programme of action'. It is unlikely to be swayed by Mr Kenneth Clarke's move in the Budget to increase funds available to p+ensioners for energy saving measures. The UK government has set a target for arresting the growth in its carbon emissions and even reducing them from 170m tonnes in 1991 to 160m tonnes by the end of the decade. Around half of this target is due to be met by energy efficiency. But the select committee was very sceptical that these targets could be achieved. In addition, the committee called on the government to establish a rolling programme of emission reduction targets beyond 2000 since carbon outflows are expected to increase significantly at the end of the decade. Government should also lead by example, the committee stressed. It criticised the government for having few clear targets on cutting energy use by its own departments - Whitehall's energy consumption actually rose last year. One of the key problems highlighted by the committee's report is the lack of funding available for some government plans such as the Energy Saving Trust which has been set a target of cutting out 2.5m tonnes of carbon emitted by 2000. The trust told the committee it would need Pounds 1.5bn to meet its objectives, but this year it is expected to spend Pounds 5m-Pounds 6m. In the year since it was set up, the trust has initiated four programmes for saving energy including offering grants to households for the installation of gas condensing boilers and setting up energy advice centres, but these have so far been fairly minor measures. Funding has come so far from British Gas and the electricity companies which are allowed to pass it through to consumers on their bills. Mr Colin Myerscough, director of the government's energy efficiency office, says a big contribution should come from further changes in the electricity pricing formula. He is predicting a spend of Pounds 300m to Pounds 400m for the trust by the end of the decade. But this depends on whether gas and electricity regulators go along with the idea - the MPs pointed out that valuable time was being spent by trust officials negotiating funding with the gas and electricity regulators. Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, acknowledged that the trust's targets were 'extremely challenging,' and that it would only be able to achieve them with support from regulators and utilities. Another critique of financing plans for the trust rests on the part played by consumers. Households are likely to be put off investing in making their homes energy efficient in order to save money on fuel bills when they have to pay a general levy for energy efficiency. Mr Myerscough admits there will be a period in the mid-1990s when consumers are paying around 1 to 2 per cent more for their fuel because of energy efficiency provisions. 'That's pretty rough, but after that, benefits will start to kick in,' he claims. If the trust achieves savings of 2.5m tonnes of carbon as planned, that represents Pounds 1bn off household energy bills. However, there is little public enthusiasm over the Government's decision to levy Value Added Tax on energy bills. Although the energy efficiency office believes the imposition of VAT will encourage conservation, Mr Myerscough says the public concern over it 'highlights the difficulties of using the price mechanism to control energy demand'. The select committee has called on the government to come up with a comprehensive programme to improve energy efficiency for low income households to counteract the effects of higher bills. While the trust has focused its attention solely on energy use by households and small businesses, MPs on the select committee want to see its influence spread to the industrial and transport sectors, where great savings could be made. The energy efficiency office has so far spearheaded the government's approach to industrial savings with various initiatives to encourage business leaders to express a commitment to conservation. One initiative, which the office has dubbed 'Getting energy efficiency out of the boiler room into the board room,' encourages senior company officials to nail their colours to the mast of conservation. 'This gets top managers thinking about energy efficiency and giving their personal commitment to it,' says Mr Myerscough. He has already signed up more than 1,600 organisations including some notable corporate heavyweights such as Sainsbury, British Sugar, Marks and Spencer, Wellcome and IBM to the programme. The government also expects to spend Pounds 1.7m this year on offering energy management advice to small businesses. So far, the office has had applications from more than 1,000 companies. One of the most important planks of the government's energy efficiency policy is a planned increase in the amount of electricity to be produced by Combined Heat and Power schemes from a current 4,000 MegaWatts to 5,000 MW. In short, although the government has some ambitious plans for combatting global warming with energy efficiency measures, funding appears to fall far short of what is required.</p>

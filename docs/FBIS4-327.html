			<p>BFN     [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi says he has information that hit squads were sent to  assassinate him in recent weeks. Dr. Buthelezi is quoted in the  British newspaper, THE DAILY STAR. In an exclusive interview,  Dr. Buthelezi said members of the South African Communist Party  who were also members of the ANC were guilty of the attempts.  He told the newspaper that he had little hope that the talks  with the state president, F.W. de Klerk, and ANC leader Nelson  Mandela today would produce any result.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 39/94] </F>   [Text] The Foreign Ministry is preparing an objection to  Russia's unilateral intent to mark the border line between  Estonia and Russia, ministry spokesman Juri Arusoo said. He  referred to a statement by head of the Baltic bureau of the  Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Prikhodko, who has accused  Estonia of unwillingness to mark the border jointly with Russia.    The Russian claims of Estonia's unwillingness are  groundless,  Arusoo said. Estonia is willing to settle the border issue as  soon as possible, but it cannot be done on Russia's terms and  before Russia has recognised the Tartu Peace Treaty, he pointed  out. The Russian propositions have only concerned the present  provisional border line, Arusoo explained.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman further pointed out that  Russia has actually already started the construction of border  control facilities and expressed his opinion that this may be an  attempt to anticipate a possible international discussion of the  issue.    Head of the Russian delegation Vasily Svirin accused Estonia  of delaying the negotiations in a Russian TV news broadcast on  Thursday [24 February]. He claimed that Estonia is unwilling to  hold constructive negotiations or to discuss issues important to  Russia.    The Svirin statement is another example of Russia's  negotiation tactics, secretary of the Estonian delegation Ago  Tiiman commented. He added that Estonia is willing to discuss  any problems, while the Russian delegation understands  negotiations as Estonia accepting any idea suggested by the  Russian side. "Our partners forget that the entire world has  found our tactics to be correct. But the Russian side does not  respect the international opinion and only cares of its own  position," Tiiman said.    The next round of negotiations is to take place in Lohusalu  on March 1-2.</p>

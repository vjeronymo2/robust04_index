			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (18): Optimism over UK equities - The professionals / The four look forward to interest rate cuts that will be a precursor to recovery from recession JOHN MAJOR's general election victory in the UK drew deep sighs of relief from our professionals, all of whose performance depends critically on that of the UK equity markets. Howard Beaufort, at Newton, was probably not untypical in saying that the Conservative victory was 'a necessary prerequisite for an economic recovery in 1992'. The only one to react materially was Douglas McDougall, at Baillie Gifford, who lifted UK equity holdings to by 4 per cent in the wake of the result. But then, Baillie Gifford has the smallest UK holding of all our professionals, so its response was perhaps not unexpected. Over the first quarter, portfolio performances were bound to have been muted, because of their heavy dependence on the London market: this has drifted, with a tumble after the budget being recouped in the rally following Mr Major's victory. Elsewhere, the past quarter has been mixed. Gains in Europe and South East Asia (particularly Hong Kong) have been more or less neutralised by traumas on the Tokyo market. Bond markets have drifted down. While the US markets have trodden water, a strengthening dollar has provided a boost for sterling-based investors. Turning to the quarter ahead, a cautious mood still prevails. 'Markets at the moment seem to be for long-term investors only - those who are both prepared and can afford to live with short-term price volatility,' says Tim Howe, at Singer &amp; Friedlander. All are nevertheless now optimistic about prospects for the UK equity markets. The pressure on sterling - and on interest rates - that had been predicted in the event of a Labour election victory is expected to abate. All are looking forward to interest rate cuts that will be a precursor to recovery from recession. Other European markets remain pinned down by high German interest rates, and the cost of German re-unification: hopes now focus on interest rate cuts in the second half of the year. 'There is a risk of short-term consolidation, but the upside is too great to merit being too clever,' says Paul Myners, at Gartmore. There is altogether more caution about prospects in the US, where they feel the equity market has run ahead on the expectation of a recovery that is likely to be more anaemic than forecast. As Tim Howe notes: 'The market now needs evidence of an earnings upturn to justify current prices. If the forecast recovery does not take place, political uncertainty will grow ahead of the November election.' Howard Beaufort nevertheless points out that a lack of investment alternatives in the US will continue as interest rates remain so low. He feels the 'sheer weight of money' may drive Wall Street 'significantly higher' in the weeks ahead. The small Japan holdings have been burning a hole in all portfolios, but none of our professionals is willing at this stage to sell. Elsewhere in Asia, prospects are seen to be good, with strongest interest in Hong Kong, where a re-rating is under way as investors come to grips with the territory's potential gains from economic liberalisation in China. There is consensus that European bonds will be good performers over the coming quarter, though US bonds will not. Their French bonds remain sturdy performers. Douglas McDougall, at Baillie Gifford, boosted his UK holdings by 4 per cent to 44 per cent in the wake of the election, predicting an early interest rate cut and a return of confidence among markets, consumers and businesses. He sold 2 per cent of his European equity holdings, and 2 per cent in South East Asia. Paul Myners, at Gartmore, has kept his portfolio unchanged. He is avoiding UK gilts, but otherwise favours bonds. In the US, he is switching to big cyclical stocks from small growth companies. In spite of strong performance by his Pacific Rim holdings, he 'sees no reason to take profits . . . The heavy overseas exposure has worked well, and remains our preferred option.' Howard Beaufort, at Newton, has halved his French bond holdings to 6 per cent in order to buy a 4 per cent holding in Far East equities. His cash holdings - all sterling and Deutsche Marks - have been lifted to 10 per cent. 'Emerging markets as a whole, in Asia and South America in particular, should enjoy a very good year in 1992,' he notes. Tim Howe, at Singer &amp; Friedlander, has similar thoughts on the Pacific: half of his 4 per cent holding in the Pacific region is now in Latin America: 'Both are areas of potentially dynamic growth, but the high risk/reward nature of investment suggests the use of collective investment schemes to spread the risk.' He has cut 1 per cent from his UK equity holdings, to 60 per cent. US equity holdings are up by 2 per cent to 5 per cent, while Japan has been cut by 2 per cent to 4 per cent. He has sold his 5 per cent UK bond holding, instead boosting his holding of continental bonds by 4 per cent to 12 per cent. Cash holdings have risen by 2 per cent to 5 per cent.  ---------------------------------------------- HOW THEY ALLOCATE THEIR ASSETS  ---------------------------------------------- BG  ----------------------------------------------                            % 1 UK Equities             44 2 Europe Equities         23 3 SE Asis Equities        13 4 Japanese Equities        5 5 Long French Bonds       15 Last time: UK Equities (40%), Europe Equities (25), SE Asia Equities (15), Japanese Equities (5), Long French Bonds (15)  ---------------------------------------------- GARTMORE  ----------------------------------------------                            % 1 UK Equities             50 2 European Equities       15 3 Pacific Rim Equities    12.5 4 US Equities              5 5 Jap.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Antoine-Pierre Mariano: "Survival of the </F> Fittest"]    [Text] Once again, the world is in the throes of a monetary  crisis. More precisely, of a dollar crisis, the umpteenth since  15 August 1971, when it stopped being convertible into gold.    What are the symptoms? Depreciation of the dollar compared  with the other currencies (a drop of more than 10 percent in six  months against the franc) and a resulting drop in currency  values on the Stock Exchange, which was almost continuous  yesterday. There is no talk of a crash but people are thinking  in those terms.    The main cause of this new collapse of the dollar is the  increase in long-term interest rates in the United States and,  even more, the fears of the consequences which could result from  this upward readjustment of interest rates. In short, the  operators fear they have reason to be afraid.    Two observations:     -  The European Monetary System, in its  adjusted form set up last summer, is holding firm. That is a  good sign;    -  The drop in interest rates on the markets is being  carried out without any panic. Small bearers now know that will  only lose if they sold and they are accustomed to weathering  squalls.     However, this new summer storm ought not to be taken  lightly.  It is particularly unwelcome at a time when we are seeing that  the recovery of European economies well underway.    Edouard Balladur, who yesterday explained his policies for  the next six months, has tried to be reassuring. It is true  that, if you simply looked at the economic indicators of the  French economy and the forecasts of the independent  institutions, there would be no objective reason for the Stock  Exchange falling. But, if the disturbances were to persist, they  would eventually jeopardize this recovery. Investors do not  like troubled times and, in the long run, a de facto devaluation  of the dollar would jeopardize all the international activities  of the United States' trading partners, be it sales of Airbus  planes or oil, Ariane launch costs, or the purchasing power of  raw materials exporters. The United States is therefore giving  itself a considerable commercial advantage beside which the  concessions it has from GATT are insignificant. It is survival  of the fittest.    However, it is considered certain that, after spectacular  interventions by the central banks to curb the speculation and  perhaps the few records which will be registered by the traders,  order will be restored. Only those who lost their cool and  hastily rid themselves of a hot potato will come off badly.  Others will have gained that lost money.    The world will only avoid these recurrent monetary crises  when everybody lives within their means and when a coherent  exchange system is established. There is no need to reinvent a  single standard, but if we started by creating a few simple  mechanisms which would organize the floating of currencies or  would penalize speculation, we would at least avoid a great deal  of chaos.    That can be done at any time. On one condition: provided  Washington is willing.</p>

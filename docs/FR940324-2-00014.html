			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 353.25(d)(2) of the Department's regulations permits the Department to conduct an administrative review under &sect;353.22(f) based upon an affirmative statement of no interest from the petitioner in the proceeding. Section 353.25(d)(1)(i) further provides that, if the Department determines that the order under review is no longer of interest to domestic interested parties, the Department may revoke the antidumping duty order. In addition, in the event the Department concludes that expedited action is warranted, &sect;353.22(f)(4) of the regulations permits the Department to combine the notices of initiation and preliminary results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with sections 751 (b)(1) and (c) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.25(d) and 353.22(f), based on an affirmative statement of no interest in the proceeding by Smith Corona, the Department is initiating this changed circumstances administrative review. Further, based upon the facts of this case and on the representations made by Smith Corona that other U.S. producers and potential producers of this merchandise (Nakajima All Manufacturing Limited, Canon Business Machines, and Brother Industries (USA), Inc.) consent to revocation of the order, we have determined that expedited action is warranted, and we have preliminarily determined that the order no longer is of interest to domestic interested parties. Because the Department concludes that expedited action is warranted, the Department is combining these notices of initiation and preliminary results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department determines that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the requirement for revocation based on the changed circumstance that the order no longer is of interest to domestic interested parties has been met. Therefore, we are hereby notifying the public of our intent to revoke the antidumping duty order on portable electric typewriters from Japan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event this revocation is made final, the Department will terminate the administrative reviews covering the following periods: May 1, 1990 through April 30, 1991 (initiated on June 18, 1991 (56 FR 27943)); May 1, 1991 through April 30, 1992 (initiated on June 18, 1992 (57 FR 27212)); and May 1, 1992 through April 30, 1993 (initiated on June 25, 1993 (58 FR 34414)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, in the event that this revocation is made final, the following will take place. For all companies for which an administrative review has been requested but not completed, the effective date of revocation will be May 1, 1990. May 1, 1990 is the first day after the most recent period for which an administrative review has been completed for all of these companies. For all other companies subject to this antidumping duty order, the effective date of revocation will be May 1, 1993. May 1, 1993, is the first day for which automatic liquidation instructions have not been issued for these other companies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

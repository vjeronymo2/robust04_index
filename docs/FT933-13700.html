			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TECHNICAL action shook stock index futures which have recently been treading water and brisk selling was followed by a rally that left the September contract at a healthy premium to the cash market, Christine Buckley writes. The expiry yesterday morning of the July contract on index options stimulated dealers to gauge their positions in futures. The contract opened at 2,840 and quickly fell to 2,827 as selling started. It stayed around that level until 10.30am signalled the end of the July contract and then futures set off upwards. Some bounce came from the lower-than-expected public sector borrowing requirement figures. The contract closed at 2,847 putting it just over 8 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of 7 points. Volume was 7,512 lots. Traded options kept a steady volume at 26,418 lots with the July contract expiry triggering action in index options - the FT-SE 100 option was 8,254 and the Euro FT-SE 100 option at 4,991.</p>

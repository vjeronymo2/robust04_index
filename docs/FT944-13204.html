			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Allied to sell Dutch breweries Allied Domecq, the UK drinks group, is negotiating the sale of its Dutch brewing subsidiary, known for its Oranjeboom beer, to Interbrew of Belgium. A successful deal would mark a further consolidation among European brewers. Interbrew, which brews Stella Artois, would become the second largest brewer in the Netherlands with almost 16 per cent market share. Heineken has a 50 per cent share and Grolsch has 14 per cent. Interbrew is currently ranked fifth with 7 per cent, behind Allied Breweries Netherlands with just under 9 per cent, according to Canadean, the drinks consultant. 'They will never beat Heineken in its home market, but being a stronger number two helps,' said one London analyst. The deal, which the companies hope to complete before the end of the year, could be worth about BFr4bn (Pounds 80m), analysts estimate. After the sale, Allied's sole brewing interest, once its mainstay, would be Carlsberg-Tetley, its UK joint venture with Carlsberg, the Danish brewer. Allied is concentrating on spirits and wines. This summer it put its extensive food and beverage businesses up for sale. Analysts estimate they could be worth up to Pounds 900m. Dalgety, the UK food and agribusiness group, confirmed yesterday that it was interested in DCA Food Industries, Allied's US food ingredients subsidiary, which could fetch between Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m. Heinz of the US and Grand Metropolitan of the UK are thought to be among other interested parties. Allied moved into Dutch brewing in the late 1960s. Its main brewery now is in Breda, where a relatively modern plant produces 1m barrels (1.63m hectolitres) of beer a year. It also has a small specialist brewery in Arcen. The operations generated trading profits of about Pounds 7m in 1993-94.</p>

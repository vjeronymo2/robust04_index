			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: BASF declares interest in Boots pharmaceutical arm BASF, the German chemicals and drugs group, yesterday said it was 'looking at' the pharmaceutical division of Boots, the UK high-street chemist and retailer, but refused to comment on reports that it had made a takeover offer. BASF is one of several companies that have discussed buying the Boots' pharmaceuticals division. A management buy-out team has also shown interest. Boots has one of its regular main board meetings later this week and the future of the pharmaceuticals division is certain to be discussed. Mr Jens-Uwe Bliesener, a corporate development executive at Knoll, BASF's main healthcare subsidiary, said Boots was one of the top 50 companies worldwide which had been examined in the group's well-publicised search for potential partners. He declined to say whether the UK business was still of interest or if talks were under way. 'We have no official statement,' he said. However, Mr Bliesener conceded that BASF was trying to fill gaps in its market coverage, including the UK and France. Japan, where Knoll is unrepresented, was also of interest. Boots pharmaceutical sales are largely in the UK, the US and Commonwealth countries. Its main products are Synthroid, a thyroid drug, and ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory and painkiller. Knoll, with annual drugs and medication sales of about DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn) compared with DM11bn at Hoechst, is considered too small to compete efficiently with other research-based pharmaceutical companies. Its research budget this year is expected to be about DM300m. It has no obvious successor products to replace top-seller Isoptin, a heart treatment on which the European patents expire in 1996. Sales last year totalled more than DM500m. Knoll's main advantage is that it has an immensely-rich parent group whose chairman, Mr Jurgen Strube, refuses to contemplate withdrawal from the drugs business. Recent efforts to improve prospects include belated entry into the German generics markets with a new company, BASF Generika.</p>

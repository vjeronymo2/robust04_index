			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Model is no quick fix for hospitals Sir, I was interested in the article, 'Production line treatment for patients' at the Karolinska Hospital, Sweden (January 7). The suggestion that this experience is unique is incorrect. Many hospitals, initially in the US but increasingly in the UK, have adopted 'patient focused' organisational models which are, indeed, derived from approaches to res-tructuring in the motor industry. The widespread enthusiasm for these models (including that of the UK secretary of state for health) should not obscure the fact that the long-term cost/benefit outcome is ambiguous. The undoubted attractions of patient focused care should be considered carefully against the potential risks, which we identified in our report 'Patient focused care - a suitable case for treatment'. What hospitals have to learn from the motor industry is that there is no quick fix and no alternative to a sustained commitment to quality.

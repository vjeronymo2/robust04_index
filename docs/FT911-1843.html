			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: Apple Computer's shares dive after profits warning APPLE Computer's stock price plunged again yesterday when the company said it expected an earnings decline in the current third fiscal quarter as a result of exchange rate changes and the higher proportion of low-priced computers it is selling. Apple said its earnings may be below those for the third quarter of 1990 when net income was Dollars 119m, or 96 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 1.4bn. Analysts had projected earnings of around Dollars 1.18 a share for the current quarter. The announcement precipitated a 13 per cent decline in Apple's share from a Tuesday close of Dollars 55 to Dollars 47 1/4 by the close yesterday. The share price fall followed a similar decline two weeks ago when disappointing second-quarter results were revealed. In all, Apple's shares have lost one-third of their value in the past two weeks amid concerns about the earnings outlook. In the second quarter, Apple raised 52 per cent of its revenues outside the US. The rising value of the dollar against foreign currencies will, however, reduce the profitability of these overseas sales in the current quarter, the company acknowledged. Apple said demand for its Macintosh personal computers remained strong, but profit margins were under pressure. In addition to declining currency exchange rates, Apple's profit margins have been reduced by its introduction of a range of lower-priced Macintosh personal computers last year. 'Clearly, we are succeeding at our overriding business objective: we are attracting new users to the Macintosh platform and increasing our share of the personal computer market,' said Mr Joseph A. Graziano, Apple's chief financial officer.</p>

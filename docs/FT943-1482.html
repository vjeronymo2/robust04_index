			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Abbey National delays launch of first global eurobond issue Volatile bond market conditions have forced the Abbey National Building Society to delay the proposed launch of its first global eurobond offering. It had planned to launch a Dollars 1bn-Dollars 2bn global offering of bonds with a five to 10-year maturity in the last two weeks of October but it will wait until conditions improve, officials said yesterday. 'These are not the right conditions to launch an issue of this size, especially when it is your first global offering,' said Mr Gareth Jones, the Abbey National's treasurer. 'We are going to wait for a substantial improvement in market tone before we revive the offering.' However, he said this did not represent a threat to the building society's funding programme. Abbey National has raised a total of Dollars 8bn this year. Mr Jones said: 'Our borrowing is in pretty good shape and we do not need extra money. We have no plans to raise significantly more this year.' Abbey National is still seeking SEC registration to enable it to sell bonds into the US. The volatile state of government bond markets last week forced the World Bank to delay its Dollars 1.5bn global offering of five-year bonds, which finally came to the market earlier this week. Lebanon is likely to launch its long-awaited offering of three-year fixed rate eurobonds late next week, lead manager Merrill Lynch said yesterday. Interest in the country's first eurobond offering, which will be at least Dollars 150m, has been significant, Merrill Lynch said. Demand has been seen from a broad range of investors, including emerging market funds, Swiss banks and Japanese investors, officials said. In the Ecu sector, the European Investment Bank launched a Ecu300m offering of five-year bonds priced to yield two basis points above French government bonds. At least half of the bonds were sold to institutional investors, with a strong UK bias, lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation said. The pricing spread widened to six basis points when the bonds were freed to trade. However, the relative scarcity of such an issue and the attraction of the current coupon of 8 1/4 per cent means that the bonds will soon trade below French government bonds, the lead manager said. The offering marks the EIB's return to the Ecu sector for the first time since March 1993, and the first time it has tapped the five-year area since 1989.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Both sides in Bosnia threatened with UN air strikes The United Nations threatened yesterday to call in air strikes on both Serb and Bosnian positions for exchanging artillery fire within the weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, accused both sides of 'serious breaches' and estimated that 400 artillery shells and mortar rounds had landed within and just outside the exclusion zone which surrounds the city. UN officials say that Moslem-led government forces fire into the 12-mile-wide zone from the north, while Serb gunners return fire from within the zone, aiming at Bosnian-held Visoko and other targets. This is the first time that the Bosnian government has been warned since the zone was first established last spring and is a reminder that both sides are expected to honour it. However, Bosnian forces have become more assertive since Belgrade cut ties with the Bosnian Serbs last week following the latter's refusal to accept a western-brokered peace plan. The Bosnian Serbs have faced increasing military pressure from Moslems, who appear to be gaining ground. The battle focused on the main highway linking Sarajevo, which is again under siege, and the central town of Olovo. For Sarajevo, the road is an important supply link especially during the hard - and approaching - Balkan winter. Confirming an improvement in morale and organisation, the Bosnian army yesterday cornered the breakaway Moslem enclave of Bihac. Troops advanced further into the northwestern zone as several thousand refugees continued to flee into Croatia. Mr Fikret Abdic, Bihac's leader, rejected Bosnian amnesty offers. His chief military commander was killed by a tank shell yesterday as Bosnian troops built on gains made on Tuesday, when it captured two towns on the Croatian border. Mr Abdic, a former Bosnian president, broke with Mr Alija Izetbegovich, the current president, last year by urging peace with Serbs and Croats. Their split exposed the deep fissures within the Bosnian Moslem community. The Bosnian Serb media also reported an offensive on Brcko in northern Bosnia at a narrow point of an east-west supply corridor controlled by the Serbs. A frequently violated ceasefire expired yesterday and the UN said it would not attempt to negotiate a new one. Sniper fire and shelling on Tuesday killed three civilians in Sarajevo but the UN has resumed the halted food airlift into the Bosnian capital. Snuffing out a separatist movement will only strengthen the Bosnian hand. The army apparently cornered Mr Abdic, the Bosnian president's main rival, in Velika Kladusa and met little resistance. The refugee flight has raised fears that Serbs in the potentially volatile Serb-held Krajina region of Croatia, who had supported Mr Abdic after his break with Sarajevo, could step in to oppose the Bosnian army. Mr Abdic vowed to fight on in Bihac. 'I will stay with my people to fight for autonomy,' he said. 'We cannot be defeated. We are unbeatable.'</p>

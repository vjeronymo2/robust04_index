			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / 'Wise man' attacks wisdom of fellow economists THE AUTHORITY of the government's new panel of economic advisers, who are known as the 'seven wise men', has been thrown into doubt by a blistering attack by Professor Tim Congdon, a member of the group, on the intellectual capabilities of his fellow members. In an open letter to the other six members of the panel, Prof Congdon says his colleagues are 'like literary critics who read prose but never look at poetry, or mathematicians who understand arithmetic but are bewildered by algebra'. The letter, to be published next week, says his fellow panellists' lack of understanding of economic theory led them mistakenly to advise the Treasury two weeks ago against a tax rise in the March 16 Budget. Prof Congdon, alone of the group, wants a Pounds 12bn tax increase in 1993-94 to curb the growing fiscal deficit. A leading monetarist, he is an adviser at Gerrard &amp; National, the City discount house, and a part-time professor at Cardiff Business School. In the 12-page letter to be published in Gerrard &amp; National's monthly economic review, he suggests that in adhering to the general theories of the UK economics community his fellow panellists have been 'grossly incompetent' in failing to take adequate account of money balances. His caustic lack of regard for his panellists - who he believes should go back to examining basic economic textbooks - is likely to put a question mark over the group's deliberations. Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University, another panel member, said Prof Congdon's view that he did not pay attention to money was 'crazy and possibly libellous'. Mr Andrew Sentance, economics director at the Confederation of British Industry, and another panel member, said the remarks by Prof Congdon were 'unhelpful'. The Treasury played down the argument, saying the panel members were 'free agents'. Prof Congdon said he wanted to expose 'fundamental misunderstandings' among many supposed experts in economic theory. He wanted to remain on the panel, which met first only two months ago, but felt it vital for the group to change its remit to look more fully at money supply. He believes economic demand is influenced largely by the amount of money in the economy, controlled by interest rates and other measures. As a result, a tax rise would not necessarily prevent a recovery.</p>

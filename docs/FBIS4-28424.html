			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Provokers Must Stop Acting Rashly" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The Japanese police  raided the Kyoto Prefectural headquarters of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) on June 6  on the false charge of violation of the "land act" and, at the  same time, searched 27 places including houses of Chongnyon  officials under the headquarters.    A NODONG SINMUN analyst today condemns such surprise raid  and  search of Japanese police against the Chongnyon organization and  officials as an unjustifiable, illegal fascist outrage and an  act of political suppression.    This is part of the hostile campaign for stifling the DPRK  which the Japanese authorities have stepped up maliciously  through collusion and tieup with the United States and the South  Korean puppets, and a deliberate and premeditated criminal act  to destroy the Chongnyon organization and block its patriotic  activities, the news analyst says.    Recalling that the Japanese authorities have launched into a  heinous anti-Chongnyon campaign whenever the anti-DPRK moves of  the United States and the South Korean puppets got hysteric, he  goes on:    The Japanese authorities have intensified crackdown on  Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, motivated by their hostile  policy towards the DPRK, joining the United States and the South  Korean puppets in their clamor about "nuclear suspicion against  the North" and crying for "sanctions".    Nothing can justify the Japanese authorities' crackdown on  Chongnyon, an authoritative and dignified organization of  overseas citizens of the DPRK which enjoys unanimous support of  the world people including broad sections of the Japanese.    We will surely call the Japanese authorities to account for  their criminal acts in intensifying crackdown on Chongnyon by  taking advantage of the United States and South Korean puppets'  moves to stifle the DPRK.    Nobody can go scotfree after provoking Chongnyon, a  dignified  organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK, and Koreans in  Japan.    The Japanese authorities must ponder over the consequences  to  be entailed by their anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign and stop  it at once and apologize for all the criminal acts they have  committed hitherto.</p>

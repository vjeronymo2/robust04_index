There is no point  in debating which is more important," Hungarian Foreign Minister  Geza Jeszenszky said in Budapest on Wednesday [23 February] at a  session of Parliament's Human Rights Committee.    He went on to say that "a good relationship with our  neighbors is inconceivable in places where the minorities are  oppressed, on the other hand, settling the situation of national  minorities naturally brings an improvement in relations."    As regards Slovakia, Jeszenszky said Budapest has committed  itself to a Hungarian-Slovak compromise, although this is  inconceivable without protection for Hungarians living in  Slovakia. Jeszenszky noted with regret that his visit to  Slovakia, which he hoped would clarify many hotly debated issues  and which was planned for last autumn, did not come about.    One of the issues which torpedoed the visit was Slovakia's  binding of an earlier agreed-upon opening of new border stations  to a deportation agreement that was unacceptable for Hungary.    Hungary took a reserved position when Slovakia became a  member of the Council of Europe, advancing its goodwill to  Bratislava. However, events of the past months have not  justified this advance confidence.    According to the foreign minister, the greater part of  Slovak  society would prefer good relations with Hungary and is inclined  to settle the minority situation. However, it is very difficult  to represent sobriety against the nationalistic emotions whipped  up in Slovakia.    The Hungarian Government continues to be ready for  compromises, and Budapest expects someone to grasp its extended  hand. Hungary calls for both bilateral and multilateral  minority protection agreements.    The foreign minister also said the best solution would be  for  the legislatures of the countries concerned to themselves enact  internal laws for the protection of minorities. Such legal  measures could ensure bilingual education, and the use of the  mother language in public administration.    Jeszenszky voiced his regret over the fact that no such  legal  measures have been created in Slovakia, Romania, or Yugoslavia.  He indicated that he is ready to hold talks about tasks related  to minority protection legislation with the neighboring  countries, and Hungary does not insist on the "principle of  reciprocity."</p>

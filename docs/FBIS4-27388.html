			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- Faced with growing  pressure from the United States for opening the automobile  market, the government has decided to take a set of measures to  open the market step by step ahead of the original schedule.    As an initial step, regulation of the floor space and number  of foreign automobile sales outlets will be removed and  restrictions on foreign car advertisement lifted in the  foreseeable future. A government trade official said on Tuesday  the government would also positively mull lowering automobile  import tariffs and refix other taxes on imported vehicles.    A comprehensive motor market opening plan will be prepared  shortly through consultations among relevant offices so that it  could be presented to U.S. negotiators at a Korea-U.S. economic  council meeting slated for June 22 in the United States.    The official noted that originally control of the floor  space  and number of foreign automobile sales outlets is set to be  removed completely in January 1996 under the five-year  investment opening plan made public last year. "But, we have  tentatively agreed to move up the time of the removal to the  most possible extent in view of the U.S. demand for the opening  of the automobile market," he said.    However, conflicting views have been aired among offices as  to the issue of whether to reduce automobile tariffs and  readjust other taxes on imported vehicles, the official added.</p>

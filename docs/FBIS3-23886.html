			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview, under the rubric "The Republic of Khakassiya," </F> with Vladimir Nikolayevich Shtygashev, chairman of the Supreme  Soviet of Khakassiya, conducted by Natalya Pachegina; time and  place not given]    [Text] Vladimir Shtygashev, the chairman of the Supreme  Soviet of Khakassiya, which has been awarded two orders and in  July 1991 was transformed from the Khakass Autonomous Oblast  which was part of Krasnoyarsk Kray into a republic, is a subject  of the Russian Federation. And 4 months after the October events  in Moscow he continues to believe that "you cannot build a just  society on an unjust action." What is the basis of the obstinacy  of the republic, which did not hold a referendum on the draft  Russian Constitution on 12 December? Is it remoteness from  Moscow or the natural obstinacy of the Khakass Shtygashev (on  principle he refused to participate in the elections to the RF  Federal Assembly)?    [Pachegina] Vladimir Nikolayevich, your name, along with the  name of the president of Kalmykiya, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, has been  among those which are considered untrustworthy for some time. Do  you somehow sense a special attitude on Moscow's part toward the  republic and toward you in particular?    [Shtygashev] Do you know the nasty way all this is being  handled now? In medieval times the battle was a forthright one,  but today the tactics have changed; aloud they say that yes, the  republic must be supported, but when credits are distributed and  in tax policy, in particular deductions into the federal budget,  it turns out that the people are being "punished." We are  opposing the discriminatory measures to the extent we can by  adopting decisions that contradict them in our government, but  the "law of the telephone" remains an all-powerful means for  influencing the unruly. Blackmail is used. Soon after the  October events, a representative of the supreme power visited  the republic and made us understand that the republic could only  benefit from showing loyalty, although we understand very well  that we will not be given anything more than is proper.    I feel uncomfortable in Moscow; although I do not hear any  direct attacks against me, I sense the hostility with every cell  of my body. There are now two feelings fighting within me: on  the one hand to leave and abandon everything so that at least in  my republic there is no antipathy toward me, and on the other, I  always remember that there is nowhere for me to go from here, I  will be buried in this land. Can I leave the people at this time?    [Pachegina] I suspect that your impressions as an eyewitness  of the October Moscow events were unlikely to have been  solicited.    [Shtygashev] Yes, I would like to share them. Even now I  consider Ruslan Khasbulatov a great patriot of Russia.  Especially since the president and Chernomyrdin are now saying  that Khasbulatov fought for 2 years. Now they are even assuring  Clinton that they intend to build a socially oriented economy.  But back then, Khasbulatov, not any kind of prophet but simply  knowing the sentiments of the country's people well, expressed  their interests.    It is painful for me to remember October. Even now I insist  that the future cannot be built on an unjust action. And the  edict and all the events which followed it, including the  elections to the Council of the Federation, are all illegal and  unconstitutional. And let them prove to me that the revolution  being conducted by Yeltsin is justified and that the reforms are  unrealizable without these upheavals.    I have made up my mind, but people, well they are different,  and each one has to make up his mind for himself. At the meeting  of the Council of the Federation, I asked Ilyumzhinov: so you  are going to vote for Shumeyko? And he gestured helplessly and  said: they promised to reconstruct the airport in Elista. That's  your answer.    [Pachegina] Vladimir Nikolayevich, how did it come to be  that  you were on the side of the defenders of the White House but  ended up outside its walls?    [Shtygashev] I had already left for the Siberian conference,  and when I returned to Moscow the "assault" was underway. But on  the 4th [October] I was a witness to the disgraceful vote in the  government. Even now I am ashamed to remember it. Chernomyrdin  proposed to all the representatives of the republics to adopt  some kind of resolution on the "communist-fascist forces which  had ensconced themselves in the White House" there. Forty people  raised their hands. Chernomyrdin asked, anyone opposed perhaps?  I was the first to stand up. About 40 people supported me. The  others sat there and put their heads in their hands, and some  closed their eyes. Perhaps they were ashamed or perhaps they  were cowards. It was a nightmare.    I became a parliamentarian that way. At the Constitutional  Court, 60-70 people gathered in Zorkin's office. Some little  priest from Aleksiy ran in. I said to him: Are you going with us  to stop the blood? He said: Yes, yes, of course. I removed the  small white silk blind from the window of the Constitutional  Court. Only eight of these representatives of the republics  went. Ilyumzhinov's Lincoln and a Volvo started to the White  House. All the cordons, including the third one, under the  bridge, galloped by, and our motorcade was at a firing position.  There was filthy language--I never heard such a thing. We were  ordered, the soldiers told us, to maintain heavy fire, and you,  get over there, to the wall.    [Pachegina] Excuse me, but was there return fire from the  White House?    [Shtygashev] There was no return fire, everything was quiet  from that side. Listen further. The commandant of this sector  allowed Aushev and Ilyumzhinov into the White House. After  holding me at gunpoint for 20 minutes, they allowed me to go to  the foot of a stairway where a field hospital had been set up. I  managed to get close to our cars. Then Aushev and Ilyumzhinov  came out of the White House with a white flag. And at that  moment OMON [Special Militia Detachment] withdrew its cordon and  the whole crowd of 300 people raced toward us. They fired  pistols point-blank and tried to tip over the cars. Ilyumzhinov  was still arguing when the guard took him and literally threw  him into the car. The Kalmyk fellows threw Aushev and me in  there too at one stroke. People were firing at us and throwing  rails and stones. We finally escaped. The Lincoln, of course, is  a powerful car and held out.    [Pachegina] Vladimir Nikolayevich, the government which  adopted that resolution remains almost the same.    [Shtygashev] I consider myself a member of the Russian  intelligentsia, and I cannot reconcile myself to the idea that  not one of them refused to participate in the shameful business  and not one of them repented.    [Pachegina] Apparently, then, you do not believe in the  viability of the Council of the Federation or the State Duma?    [Shtygashev] There is an auction going on in the Council of  the Federation. I do not think that such methods can be used to  achieve consensus. Although I believe that the Council of the  Federation can play a positive role in pacifying the country.  But in the State Duma the viewpoints of politicians who have  assembled there are in such opposition that counting on  consensus is altogether naive. The only thing that can save us  is a unified surge of emotion in the name of Russia, but once  again the make-up of these organs eliminates any illusions.    [Pachegina] Well, is there anyone in Moscow to whom you  would  entrust the helm of the Russian state?    [Shtygashev] The only person is perhaps Yuriy Skokov. A  statesman. And absolutely decent.    [Pachegina] Vladimir Nikolayevich, your obstinacy did not  come out of nowhere. You must have very strong support to allow  yourself to dare to oppose Moscow.    [Shtygashev] You know, without false modesty I can say that  if I ran for the Federal Assembly of Russia, I think I would do  well. I am doing everything that I can in my post, and I am not  ashamed to look into the eyes of the people of Khakassiya.  Moreover, I really do have strong support, as you said. The  republic is sixth in the Federation in terms of production of  output. We are fully self-supporting in agricultural products.  So the economic slump has had a very negligible effect on the  republic. Fortunately, we do not have interethnic conflicts. Our  indicators on privatization of enterprises and the housing fund  are almost the highest in the country, although I am called a  conservative.</p>

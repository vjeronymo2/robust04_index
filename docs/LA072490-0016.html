			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT: A CLASS OUTING;  </P> <P> IT WAS BACK TO SCHOOL FOR PARTY-GOERS CELEBRATING 'THE FRESHMAN' PREMIERE  </P> <P> The Scene: Thursday night's premiere of "The Freshman," a new comedy from  Tri-Star Pictures. After a screening in Westwood, guests rode shuttle buses to  the John Thomas Dye School at the top of Bel-Air for an al fresco buffet  supper.  </P> <P> The Buzz: Marlon Brando and Matthew Broderick weren't there, but another star  of the film was: Mzee, a 66-inch-long monitor lizard from Thailand. The  reptile, which belongs to the second-largest lizard species on Earth, stumped  around the grass on a leash and lolled in the arms of trainers Jim Brockett,  Jules Sylvester and Gina Perry.  </P> <P> Wild Kingdom: What does a Hollywood lizard eat on the set? Catered food? "He  eats whatever he wants. He's a carnivore," explained Sylvester blithely.  (Actually, Mzee looked like more than one producer in Hollywood.)  </P> <P> Who Was There: At the party were producer Mike Lobell (not one of your  lizard-like producers); writer/director Andrew Bergman; stars Bruno Kirby and  Penelope Ann Miller; Tom Brokaw; actors Maria Conchita Alonso, William  Atherton, Gary Busey, Cathy Lee Crosby, Woody Harrelson and Mimi Rogers.  </P> <P> Dress Code: Lightweight blazers and pantsuits. One man redefined casual  trailer-park chic with his clam digger-length cutoffs, accentuated with  knee-high black hose.  </P> <P> Entertainment: Dancing to Glenn Miller, Nat "King" Cole, Madonna and a '70s  disco-funk medley that sounded just fine until we got to Barry Manilow singing  "Copacabana."  </P> <P> Chow: Pizza, pasta, tortellini, garlic bread, salads and lethal chocolate  marzipan brownies provided by Parties Plus cooks, who had baked loaves of bread  shaped like lizards for the occasion.  </P> <P> Quoted: "Oh, he's so cute," exclaimed one lizard-loving woman, who quickly  changed her tune when Mzee flicked her face with his four-inch Jacobsen's organ  (the forked "tongue" that enables reptiles to smell). It added a new dimension  to the old Hollywood sport of cheek-kissing.  </P> <P> Triumphs: With the dearth of good premiere party locations in Los Angeles,  Tri-Star found one in the Dye School, a rolling hillside in Bel-Air that  provided a view of the city lights perfect for a clement summer night.  </P> <P> Glitches: A lot of people made the movie and skipped the party. Why? Could it  be the prospect of riding in shuttle buses is a little bit too egalitarian for  Hollywood's swells? Come on now. If we're going to have celebrities hectoring  us endlessly about environmental awareness, the least they can do is use  semi-public transportation.  </P></p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / GrandMet sells Express Foods GRAND Metropolitan, the UK-based food and drinks group, yesterday completed the disposal of its Express dairy operations with the sale of Express Foods, the UK cheese and food service business, to a management-led buy-out team for Pounds 96m. GrandMet put its dairy interests up for sale late last year as part of its strategy of focusing on developing international branded products in the food, drinks and retailing sectors. The sale of Express Foods, one of the UK's biggest cheese manufacturers, means GrandMet has raised a total of around Pounds 550m from the sale of its dairy operations. The liquid milk and short-life dairy product businesses of Express Dairy and Eden Vale were sold to Northern Foods in February for Pounds 359m and the Irish businesses were sold to Waterford Foods and Carbery Creameries for IPounds 99m (Pounds 108m) in July. Express Foods, which had trading profits of about Pounds 13m on turnover of Pounds 270m in the year to September 30, will become an independent company for the first time since it was established in the 1950s. The Express Dairy businesses were acquired by GrandMet in 1969. Mr Roger Davenport, chief executive, who led the management buy-out supported by Mr Simon Oliver - a leading entrepreneur in the dairy industry who has been appointed non-executive chairman - expressed confidence yesterday that the profitability of the business could be further improved. Funding for the deal was arranged by Electra Kingsway and comprised loans of Pounds 45m and equity investment of Pounds 51m. The equity was underwritten by Electra Private Equity Partners and Prudential Venture Managers, while the debt and working capital has been shared equally between Bank of Tokyo, Union Bank of Switzerland and Bank of Scotland. Mr Tim Syder, a director of Electra who will represent the institutional investors on the board, said the deal represented one of the largest MBOs this year. However, he said it was also 'much more conservatively funded' than many earlier management buy-outs, and the purchase price represented a significant discount to net assests, which totalled 'well over Pounds 100m'.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A BITTERSWEET 'CHOCOLAT'  </P> <P> In her first film, "Chocolat" (at the Nuart Friday), co-writer/director Claire  Denis, who has worked closely with Jim Jarmusch and Wim Wenders, treasures the  elliptical and the allusive. She makes her portrait of 1950s white French  colonials in black Cameroon out of fragments, snapshots ragged at the edge,  snippets of observation.  </P> <P> "Chocolat" is a film of some subtlety. It has good, even memorable moments to  it, and it's beautiful looking. It is very, very, very French, which may or may  not be your cup of chocolat. It is also a suffocatingly precious film, enough  to try the patience of an oyster, and one that primly refuses to detonate the  mounting numbers of erotic situations it sets up.  </P> <P> That is precisely Denis' way; to do otherwise would clearly be a vulgarity in  her eyes. Yet it may have an opposite effect. By denying her black central  character, Protee, any outlet for the sexual rage and humiliation building up  in him, instead of the statement Denis imagines she is making, she actually  takes away his humanity. He becomes ennobled, pure and beautiful as a living  statue and as objectified.  </P> <P> The film is one long flashback, a truncated, brooding return to the places of  her childhood by a reflective adult, France Dalens (Mireille Perrier). Her  reveries as she speeds across this shimmering landscape move her back roughly  25 years, to when her youngish father, Marc Dalens (Francois Cluzet) was the  colonial district officer for the area. (Cluzet is familiar to Americans as  Dexter Gordon's stalwart French fan in " 'Round Midnight.")  </P> <P> His position provides Dalens and his beautiful, tensed-up wife, Aimee (Giulia  Boschi), with a big, pleasant house, soldiers under Dalens' command and a house  staff, including the enormously capable African "boy" Protee (Isaach de  Bankole), frequently in charge of the house during Dalens' excursions.  </P> <P> Protee and the 7-year-old France (Cecile Ducasse), an observant child, mostly  silent under her little straw helmet, spend most of their time together in  mutual invisibility. They are friends, although as Denis, who co-wrote the  screenplay with Jean-Pol Fargeau, sees France, the child is already an  imperious little white colonial too. Frankly, it doesn't leave us many people  to give a tinker's damn about. Marc Dalens, who loves the country and possibly  even its people and is prescient enough to know that the French will not be  astride it forever, is the best of the bunch but he's not the world's most  charismatic leader.  </P> <P> It might help if the film makers let us in on the Dalenses' relationship.  Mostly, lonely, bored mamman smokes, drinks endless cups of espresso and  alternately yearns for and is imperious toward Protee. (Boschi was Christopher  Lambert's bride in "The Sicilian," and the jury is still out on whether her  attitudes constitute acting but she certainly is decorative.)  </P> <P> About a third of the way into the film, the emergency landing of a small plane  brings its passengers to the Dalens household, while mechanical parts are sent  for and a runway is built. They are, in varying degrees, a loathsome bunch,  arrogant and condescending, with an ingrained, unearned sense of superiority.  The foulmouthed, bullying coffee planter, Delpich (Jacques Denis), seems the  worst of the lot. Then, in the film's best scene, as Delpich lounges under a  canvas with a few of the men after their noontime meal, he unexpectedly sings a  refrain from a childhood song. Coming from such a despicable soul, his voice is  unexpectedly sweet and poignant; it's a surprising, humanizing moment.  </P> <P> Actually, the most dangerous guest is Luc Segalen (Jean-Claude Adelin), a  muscular ex-seminarian currently walking across the continent, who prides  himself on truth-telling and a "simple" way of life more native than that of  the natives. More precisely, he's a sexual predator who has already cut a  considerable swath among the French ladies at one after another remote outpost.  Anyone with a good memory for the '70s will recognize Segalen; he's a variation  on the earnest young Americans who became more Indian than the Navajos; more  peaceable than Gandhi. Today they are commodities traders and movie producers.  </P> <P> "Chocolat" is a compendium of telling moments, so self-consciously pointed that  they form a connect-the-dots map of colonialism. What makes it a bore is that  audiences are encouraged to think that by picking up these vast, looming clues,  they are on to something deep.  </P> <P> Jarmusch works in fragments, too, but they finally lead to something, and his  films have a buoyancy that comes from his bushwhacking humor. Denis is  cautious, joyless, as though she regarded levity from her film's few possible  comic moments or characters (Segalen is one) as inappropriate to the toniness  of her message. So the film's natural light moments are stifled.  </P> <P> "Chocolat" broods, it teases with consummate adroitness, then it skitters away  from confrontation. (The film is MPAA rated PG-13 for brief nudity.) It has no  driving rhythm to it, only nicely captured moments in isolation. In a slightly  different context, Denis has called her film "suffused with a sense of  frustration." Audiences may agree with her completely.  </P> <P> 'CHOCOLAT'  </P> <P> An Orion Classics Release of a Cinemanuel/Marin Karmitz -- MK2  Productions/Cerito Films/Wim Wenders Produktion/La S.E.P.T./Caroline  Productions/Le F.O.D.I.C./TFI Films Production co-production, with the  participation of the Centre National de la Cinematographie and Sofica Sofima.

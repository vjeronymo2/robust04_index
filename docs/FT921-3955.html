			<p>920312 FT  12 MAR 92 / Serbian students demand removal of President Milosevic Thousands of students yesterday gathered in Belgrade for a second time this week to demand the removal of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. The students rallied to mark the anniversary of anti-government demonstrations last year, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. They demanded fresh elections and an end to socialist control of the media. Serbia yesterday gave no offical reaction after Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, appeared to herald recognition of four Yugoslav republics as independent states. Mr Baker said the US would consult the European Community on the question of recognition.</p>

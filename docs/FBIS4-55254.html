			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 12 (AFP) -- Fighting raged Thursday  [12 May] between the mainly Moslem Bosnian army and Bosnian Serb  troops about 40 kilomtres (25 miles) southeast of Tuzla, UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Eric Chaperon said. He  said the fighting was concentrated along a strip running north  and south that separates territory controlled by the two  belligerants along the region of Sapna and the towns of Olovo  and Brgule.    Chaperon said "30 detonations were reported in the region of  Sapana Wednesday, 73 in Brgule and 11 in Olovo." He said  farther north in Brcko, five shells fell in the region of  Posavina around 1730 GMT Wednesday without claiming any  casualties. Two of the shells hit the town's main power  generator.    Chaperon added that the situation was also tense in the  western enclave of Bihac where both sides were reported to be  bringing in reinforcements. He said eight soldiers wearing  civilian clothes had attempted to enter the UN-imposed exclusion  zone around the eastern town of Gorazde Wednesday carrying light  weapons and a machine gun hidden under a blanket but were  stopped by UN soldiers and turned away.    In Sarajevo, the UNPROFOR said the "usual" ceasefire  violations were continuing in the capital with small arms fire  and a few detonations. Chaperon said that an UNPROFOR vehicle  was targeted Wednesday afternoon at the Sarajevo airport.  "Fifteen shots were reported," he said adding that there were  no injuries.    The latest fighting came as foreign ministers from the  United  States, Russia and five European Union countries including  Britain and France prepared to meet in Geneva Friday to try to  revive the stalled Bosnian peace process.</p>

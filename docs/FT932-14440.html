			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Letter: Nothing comic about wasted initiatives Sir, The Pounds 1.5bn Training and Enterprise Councils initiative was launched in the UK on March 10 1989 - coincidentally Comic Relief day. For many in the private sector involved in some of the earlier initiatives such as the Small Firms Service, Enterprise Agencies, Business in the Community, the Business and Education Initiative, the Training Commission, the Manpower Services commission, and Pickup (Professional, Industrial and Commercial Updating Programme), the Tecs did, indeed, promise relief. The Tecs were intended to rationalise what the then chairman of Courtauld's described as 'the great variety of initiatives now around'. Many of us involved in them greeted them with sceptical optimism. At least an umbrella organisation was in place and it should be given a chance. You yourselves had doubts. And within two years of the Tecs going live your own survey described 'widespread dissatisfaction over the levels of government funding'. On February 28 1992 (Management: 'Making it a game of skill, not of luck') you reported 'a great deal of frustration over the inability of the Tecs to fulfil the valuable role for which they were established'. You now report ('Pilot 'one-stop' business advice centres chosen', April 15) a further umbrella initiative. Five Tecs and other bodies 'are to carry out a Pounds 500,000 study part funded by the government. . .aimed at establishing a central London one-stop shop' (business advice centre). If the costs of these abortive initiatives were totalled, the EBRD extravagances would pale into insignificance. Ansel Harris, MBA Partners, 23 Ferncroft Avenue, London NW3 7PG</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by LIEN HO PAO news team: "CPC Bans the Media From </F> Reporting on Dark Aspects During the Two Sessions"]    [Text] Beijing, 8 Mar -- Several days ago, the CPC  Propaganda Department instructed the mainland media not to  report on dark aspects of society during the sessions of the  National People's Congress [NPC] and the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], and not to discuss  controversial policies, but to disseminate the slogan of  "stability overwhelming everything." In this year's propaganda  work, the CPC has particularly stressed the importance of  stability, and this has been rare in recent years.    Prior to these two sessions, the CPC held a "national  propaganda and ideological work meeting," asking the localities  to maintain unanimity with the Central Committee in propaganda  work. Recently, it particularly urged the media to focus on  "stability" when reporting on the two sessions, instead of  providing news that might lead to social instability. The news  to be banned from coverage includes:    -- Inflation: Despite the CPC plan to control inflation  below 10 percent this year, commodity prices in many big Chinese  cities had increased by more than 20 percent in the first two  months of this year. People are anticipating price increases,  and many NPC and CPPCC deputies are concerned about price  increases. With the principle of "stability overwhelming  everything" in command, the CPC will not allow the media to  report on inflation.    -- Pay arrears: State-owned enterprises have suffered from  losses for many consecutive years and many units have been  unable to pay wages. Although the CPC has announced pay  increases, many enterprises cannot even pay the pre-increase  wages. In addition, some retired workers are earning small  pensions, and their welfare and insurance have been abolished;  this has caused resentment among medium- and low-wage earners.  The CPC has instructed the media not discuss these problems,  which might cause instability in society.    -- Deterioration of social order: Social order is generally  worsening in mainland cities and rural areas. Not long ago,  looting of grain occurred in Hunan, and looting of oil happened  in Shanghai. Social news is the favorite of the mainland media  and the scale of coverage has increased. Therefore the CPC has  restricted such coverage.    -- New theoretical controversy: Last year, there was much  controversy in mainland academic circles and among government  officials over ownership rights and development rates. The CPC  has urged the media not to discuss these unconcluded issues,  and everything must proceed according to the decision of the  14th CPC National Congress.    Moreover, the CPC also has instructed the media not to  provide news on high consumption, waste and extravagance, or  high educational fees, for fear of evoking resentment among  low-wage earners. In addition, the CPC has urged the media to  have confidence in the "combat against corruption" and to  continue providing positive coverage.    This year the CPC will introduce a number of reform measures  that will involve the redistribution of major interests and may  cause turbulence in society. Therefore in propaganda work the  CPC will pay more attention to "stability" than the previous  years, and will chant the slogan "stability must take precedence  over everything."</p>

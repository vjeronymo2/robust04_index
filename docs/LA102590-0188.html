			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> MGM/UA Accepts Pathe Bid: The board of MGM/UA Communications Co., up for sale  for two years, accepted Pathe Communication's $1.3-billion buyout offer, paving  the way for yet another sale of a U.S. studio to a foreign owner.  </P> <P> Pathe, controlled by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, is likely to take  ownership of the venerable studio by Friday. It marks a big victory for  Parretti, whose ability to secure financing to complete the deal was in doubt  ever since an initial agreement was announced in March. MGM/UA is controlled by  financier Kirk Kerkorian.  </P></p>

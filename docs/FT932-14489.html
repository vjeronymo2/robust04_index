			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / BA offers deal for part-time working BRITISH AIRWAYS said yesterday that it will give a lump-sum payment of six months' salary to any of its 6,000 ground staff at London's Heathrow airport who accept an offer to work part-time as part of the airline's drive to cut costs and make its operations more flexible. It said many employees, who include baggage handlers and check-in staff, had expressed interest in working part-time. BA wants to streamline its Heathrow workforce to fit in better with the peaks and troughs of daily traffic. Most flight activity at Heathrow comes in the morning, when long-haul flights arrive from the Far East and the Americas, and in the evening, when many depart. Shuttle and business traffic is also heaviest at these times. News of BA's offer comes as the UK and US governments hold talks today aimed at restarting negotiations on greater access to each other's skies. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, is expected to repeat that more US access to regional airports in Britain can be agreed only if the US grants the same to UK airlines. Mr MacGregor is likely to say at the meeting this afternoon with Mr Federico Pena, US transportation secretary, that the UK wants to operate to destinations beyond the 22 main hubs such as New York. So far the US has been reluctant to allow this. Lufthansa, the German airline, has also complained about restricted access to airports in the US. BA yesterday gave no indication about how many people it expected to accept its Heathrow working proposals. Under BA's proposals there would be two schemes for those prepared to move to part-time working: 'Switch', for the under-50s wanting to shorten their working week, and 'Wind Down', for those over 50 who want to work less as they approach retirement. The offer of six months' extra pay applies to both schemes. Those in the 'Wind Down' scheme would have their pension rights protected. BA started asking staff earlier this year if they wanted to change to part-time working and expects to know by the end of this month how many are interested. It declined to say yesterday how many employees it expected to take up the offer, how many it would like to see on part-time working, or whether the schemes could be extended to other parts of BA.</p>

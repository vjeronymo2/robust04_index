			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Du Pont earnings up 12% in first quarter DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group, yesterday reported first-quarter 1993 net profits of Dollars 493m, or 73 cents per share, a 12 per cent increase on the Dollars 439m, or 64 cents, of income recorded before special charges were taken a year ago. In the first quarter of 1992, Du Pont recorded a net loss of Dollars 4.4bn due to non-cash accounting charges. With these charges and one-time credits stripped out of the quarters for both years, Du Pont's net income was 20 per cent higher in 1993. The company's revenues of Dollars 9.07bn in the first three months of 1993 were down by Dollars 90m, or 1 per cent, due to reduced sales and selling prices in areas of the group other than petroleum. Mr Edgar Woolard, chairman of Du Pont, said the earnings performance was better, notwithstanding the slow US economic recovery and very weak market conditions in Europe. 'The improvement results from better petroleum earnings as well as from cost-reduction and restructuring efforts that are paying off,' he explained. The Conoco petroleum division had earnings that were 77 per cent higher in the quarter at Dollars 200m. This was due to higher crude oil and natural gas production outside of the US and lower exploration costs. The chemicals division's earnings were 17 per cent better at Dollars 69m. Fibre earnings were down by 25 per cent at Dollars 102m. Polymer division earnings were 10 per cent lower at Dollars 77m. The diversified businesses unit improved earnings by 13 per cent to Dollars 107m. Looking ahead, Mr Woolard said the extent of the improvement in the full-year results would depend on the timing and magnitude of an economic upturn in western Europe. On Wall Street, Du Pont's share price was Dollars 1 1/4 higher at Dollars 53 1/8 before the close.</p>

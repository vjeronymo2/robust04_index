The increase is authorized by amendments to the Egg Research and Consumer Information Act must be approved by egg producers voting in a referendum. This proposal would also make a conforming amendment to regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before August 16, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments are to be mailed to Janice L.

It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 14 of the Act, a person subject to an order may file a petition with the Secretary stating that such order, any provisions of such order or any obligations imposed in connection with such order are not in accordance with law; and requesting a modification of the order or an exemption therefrom. Such person is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which such person is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, has jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint is filed within 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Effect on Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, 618 egg producers pay assessments to the American Egg Board (AEB). A proposed rule to increase the exemption level from 30,000 to 75,000 laying hens was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 22, 1994 (59 FR 13460). The increased exemption level would exempt 253 small egg producers who represent 41 percent of the egg producers currently paying assessments, but only 4 percent of AEB's total assessment income. It is anticipated that the 75,000-hen exemption level would be in place before the referendum on the assessment rate increase. Therefore, a change in the assessment rate would affect only egg producers owning more than 75,000 laying hens. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are an estimated 365 producers who own more than 75,000 hens. Currently, egg producers must pay a mandatory assessment of 5 cents per 30-dozen case of eggs marketed to fund the research and promotion activities authorized by the Act. The present 5-cent assessment is equivalent to approximately 0.231 percent of the wholesale price of a 1-dozen carton of Large eggs. An assessment rate of 10 cents per 30-dozen case would be equivalent to approximately 0.463 percent of the wholesale price of a <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1-dozen carton of Large eggs. This is based on the Economic Research Service's 3-year average wholesale price for New York City Grade A Large cartoned eggs (1991&hyph;93) of 72 cents per dozen. AEB collects approximately $7.5 million annually from the 5-cent assessment, and it is estimated that it would collect $14 million for a 10-cent assessment. It is estimated that any additional costs would be offset by the benefits to be derived from strengthened research and promotion programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Information collection requirements and recordkeeping provisions contained in 7 CFR Part 1250 have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned OMB Control No. 0581&hyph;0093 under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No additional recordkeeping requirements would be imposed as a result of this proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Proposed Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 14, 1993, the Egg Research and Consumer Information Act (7 U.S.C. 2711) was amended (Pub. L. 103&hyph;188) to increase the maximum rate of assessment, raise the exemption level, and provide for research project funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

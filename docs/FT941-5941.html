			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Balladur softens line on youth training but stands firm on pay The French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday agreed to improve training for young apprentices, partly caving in to union pressure, but stuck to the principle of his new law that young people on training contracts can be paid less than the national minimum wage. The government compromise was reached after all-day talks between Mr Balladur, six ministers and the unions, in the course of which the communist-leaning CGT federation stalked out and several thousand students demonstrated. Even the other unions insisted after the meeting that they had given no formal approval to Mr Balladur's changes, which the government is to publish as a decree within a month. At the meeting, Mr Balladur agreed to scrap the provision in last autumn's labour law which would have allowed companies to pay young people, even with university degrees, up to 20 per cent less than the so-called Smic minimum wage, currently FFr5,886 (Dollars 985) a month. Qualified workers under the age of 26 will, after all, get the Smic minimum. Young workers without any qualifications can, by contrast, be paid as little as 30 per cent of the Smic (in the case of 16-17 year olds), provided companies spend the saving on training them. What Mr Balladur promised the unions yesterday was to monitor the training to check that it was effective, but he seemed to have left the unions unconvinced. The government's rationale is that one in four people under 26 are out of a job - a higher proportion of youth unemployment than in most European countries - partly because in the past 20 years the Smic has, for social welfare purposes, been raised by successive governments twice as fast as average wages. This, it reasons, has priced less skilled and inevitably younger workers out of the job market. In last autumn's labour law the government thought it had quietly circumvented the taboo against touching the Smic by associating pay cuts with training. But growing popular disenchantment with Mr Balladur over other issues such as educational reform evidently emboldened the unions to make an issue of the Smic changes when decrees implementing the 1993 law were published last month.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> NUN WINS SPORTS CAR IN RAFFLE  </P> <P> A Roman Catholic nun won a $13,000, fire-engine-red sports car in a raffle to  benefit her school.  </P> <P> Sister Rebecca Berghoff, 65, said she was aghast when she was declared the  winner in the raffle for the St. Joseph-Marquette School, where she is  principal.  </P> <P> She said she bought 30 $1 tickets for Saturday's drawing. About 32,000 tickets  were sold for the school, which has 300 pupils in kindergarten through eighth  grade.  </P> <P> She returned the Geo Storm to the dealer and said the refund will help ease the  school's budget problems.  </P> <P> Besides, she said, it wasn't appropriate "for a nun to be streaking around in a  car like that."  </P></p>

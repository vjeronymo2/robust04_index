			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / French Elections: End of road for Dumas ONE of the first casualties of the Socialists' defeat last night was Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign minister, who lost his seat at Sarlat in the Dordogne to Mr Jean-Jacques de Peretti, the local Gaullist mayor. The loss of his constituency brings Mr Dumas, 70, to the end of a long political career in which he has been as influential in his personal role as a confidant of President Francois Mitterrand as in his professional ministerial posts. Mr Dumas spent his early career in journalism but went into politics in the late 1950s. He served as minister of European affairs during the first Mitterrand government from 1981 to 1983, moving on to external relations until 1986 and becoming foreign minister when the Socialists returned to power in 1988. The Foreign Ministry has been something of a poisoned chalice in French politics, given that the president is active in foreign affairs. Mr Mitterrand has been no exception. But Mr Dumas managed to carve out a role for himself, thanks partly to his close relationship with the president but also to his own expertise, particularly in oriental studies. The raffish side of his nature became a distinct disadvantage in the parliamentary campaign. His bid for re-election has been dogged by a blaze of publicity over his friendship with Ms Nahed Ojjeh, daughter of Mr Mustapha Tlass, the Syrian defence minister, and by the revelation that her family paid for a new Pounds 1m scanner at a Sarlat hospital. Mr Dumas does at least have the consolation that his links with Mr Mitterrand seem to be intact. When the president last week came under pressure from the Gaullists to resign, he turned to two trusty Socialists to communicate his views. One was Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, the other was Mr Dumas.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh AKP June 13 -- His Majesty King Norodom  Sihanouk has asked the government to release women and sick  prisoners from its jails.    In his statement dated on June 10 and faxed from his  residence in Beijing to the Cambodian co-premiers the king said,    "this current report brings me to ask that you free, for  humanitarian reasons, the very sick prisoners and more  particularly those who, in general, have not committed serious  crimes or violent crimes".    "Many defendants who are particularly impoverished, notably  the women, have stagnated in preventative detention for months  or even years awaiting judgement", Sihanouk said in the  statement, which was dated Friday.    Sihanouk said the freeing of sick prisoners would enable the  country's penal authorities to improve prison conditions while  waiting to find adequate financial means for the creation of new  detention centres".</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S&amp;L BAILOUT MAY HIT $600 BILLION, SEIDMAN SAYS  </P> <P> The final cost to taxpayers of the savings and loan bailout may reach $600  billion, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman indicated  Saturday in an interview.  </P> <P> Seidman, who also is chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., said on the CNN  television program "Evans and Novak" that the costs would swell because of  interest paid on money borrowed to finance the bailout.  </P> <P> Asked what the total price tag would be for taxpayers, Seidman said: "We talk  about upfront dollars -- that is, if we had all the money to pay today -- I  think the best estimate is between $175 and $200 billion."  </P> <P> But Seidman said that excludes interest paid on money that the government will  have to borrow.  </P> <P> "Probably if we borrowed for 30 years at 10%, why that could roughly triple the  figure," he said.  </P> <P> The head of the two major banking regulatory agencies also discounted the  chances for an even bigger problem with the commercial banking industry despite  recent financial problems of varying degrees at such major banks as Chase  Manhattan, the Bank of New England and others.  </P> <P> Seidman said that while bank problems appeared to be spreading down the East  Coast because of weakness in commercial real estate markets, "there's very  little possibility of (a major bank crisis)."  </P> <P> "Of course, if we have a major depression, recession over a long period of time  it will strike heavily against the banking system," he said. "But at that point  I don't think that will even be the most serious problem we have."  </P></p>

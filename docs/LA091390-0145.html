			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: DUARTE;  </P> <P> BAN ON HOUSE ADDITIONS  </P> <P> Homeowners who want to add a second story may have to wait until February  because the City Council has decided to extend an urgency ordinance that  temporarily prohibits such additions to single-family homes.  </P> <P> The extension, approved Tuesday, will be in effect until Feb. 1, to give city  staff members move time to study the issue. However, if the study is finished  before Feb. 1, the moratorium may be lifted earlier.  </P> <P> The ban went into effect July 24 to allow the city to determine whether new  regulations are needed to ensure that second-story additions do not infringe on  the rights of neighboring properties.  </P></p>

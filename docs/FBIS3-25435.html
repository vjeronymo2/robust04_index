			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Manuel Tome, Frelimo Central Committee </F> secretary for mobilization and propaganda, by Almiro Santos;  place and date not given]    [Text] Dhlakama gave a warning before he spoke.    He said: "I am going to make a serious accusation." And he  did.    He said that the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] was  not interested in elections being held this year.    However, Manuel Tome, Frelimo Central Committee secretary  for  mobilization and propaganda, believes the accusations that have  come from the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] are  "baseless, unfounded, and unnecessary."    What is more, they mean that Renamo gauges itself in terms  of  its ability to make such baseless, unfounded, and unnecessary  accusations.    The most important thing, though, is that the Frelimo Party  is interested in participating in the elections in October.  Manuel Tome noted that "there is no one, and in particular  there is no official -- President Joaquim Chissano, in this  instance -- interested in delaying holding elections."    The Frelimo Central Committee official added that "Frelimo  has been ready for elections since last year."    [Santos] Is Frelimo ready for elections or is it not?    [Tome] I answered that very same question at the beginning  of  last year. My reply was that the Frelimo Party was ready, even  at that time. Now, in addition to being ready for elections,  the Frelimo Party will also do everything to ensure they will be  held as scheduled.    Had Mr. Afonso Dhlakama read that interview, he would  probably have had some reference for guidance, at least.    However, when we talk about being ready, we need to note  that  there are various levels of preparedness. There is  organizational, conceptual, and strategic preparedness for  elections. At another level, there is also the involvement of  militants and sympathizers, the people who will after all  implement the electoral strategy devised by the party.    With regard to the fundamental things, we are both organized  and prepared. There are, it is true, some details about which I  cannot talk because, obviously, one cannot go about broadcasting  what the party's electoral strategy or organizational approach  will be or, eventually, we would be helping others defeat us.    [Santos] You have said that the Frelimo Party has been ready  for elections since last year. Has anything changed that state  of affairs?    [Tome] I would not say that it has changed. We were ready at  that time because, for instance, basic conditions were already  in place. Since then, those conditions have become more solid.  You must be aware that we started preparing ourselves with a  view to elections being held last year.    Obviously, there are certain things that you should only do  when you are certain that elections will be held at the  appointed date, or you may end up wasting money and the efforts  made by party militants on work that will serve no purpose  whatever. I am talking, for instance, about what is commonly  referred to as the precampaign and the electoral campaign  itself. That is where you put up money and use the militants'  efforts.    In addition to that, there is a level of involvement by the  militants themselves, who are full time workers with the party.  Obviously, they are involved in the party's work, but the  intensity of their commitment to that work tends to grow.    [Santos] So, Frelimo believes that elections will be held in  October?    [Tome] I believe elections will take place in October,  barring last minute obstacles caused by people acting in bad  faith. Frelimo wants elections held this year as scheduled, and  there are many reasons for wanting to do so.    You know that the movement of Mozambicans being repatriated  from other countries is greatly limited by the uncertainty we  currently experience. People want elections to be held so they  can then start working to restore normality in the country.    Economic activity will not occur at the pace or with the  effectiveness we would desire, if uncertainty continues to beset  this country for the next two or three years. Then, there is a  third factor: psychological saturation. That means that people  will no longer tolerate this whole situation and that could yet  have some effect on voter turnout. Postponements make people  start to lose confidence in the process and when the time for  elections comes, they will say: I am not going to vote because I  do not trust this process any more.    Thus, it is imperative that elections be held at the  appointed date and I would like to believe that, should the  aforementioned obstacles appear, they will be promptly dealt  with and removed, whether it be done by the Mozambican or the  international community.    [Santos] That would mean, then, that there is no truth to  Renamo's view that Frelimo is making time to try and rid itself  of its Marxist image?    [Tome] I do know whether the Renamo president knows what it  means to be a Marxist or whether he knows the meaning of the  word Marxism. When the Frelimo Party held its Fifth Congress  in 1989, it decided to withdraw Marxism as the party's official  doctrine. It was not taking a stand against Marxism. That must  be made clear. We have a party that is pluralist within itself,  meaning that people have the freedom to think, to propose  things, and to make choices, as long as those ideas do not  contravene the principles and the program of the party.    We have no need to clean up any image. In fact, were I to  ask the journalists how many Marxists Frelimo had.... We have a  very big party, with more than 850,000 members and it cannot be  supposed that all those 850,000 members are Marxists. In other  words, at the time, we had the party's official doctrine, which  did not even correspond to the party's great mass of militants  in real terms.    Marxism is a philosophy and a conception of an economic  system, and so forth, and I fail to see that we need to rid  ourselves of it, as is often said, because nothing causes us any  guilt or any other complexes. To my knowledge, there are  Marxist parties to this day. What is more, there are even  communist parties. There is a communist party in neighboring  South Africa. There are communist parties in Portugal and  Greece. Such parties do exist. There are other parties that  have adapted and even changed their names, like Italy's  Democratic Leftist Party, for instance.    As far as I know, no one has ever been condemned for being a  Marxist, though I know that many people have been condemned and  continued to be condemned the world over for terrorist  practices. That much I know.    [Santos] Are you talking about anyone in particular?    [Tome] I have not mentioned any name in particular. However,  we shall soon see if the cap fits somebody in particular.    [Santos] If the elections are not held at the appointed  date,  do you think we will be faced with a chaotic situation?    [Tome] I would not say chaotic, because if there were to be  chaos it would have happened during the war. During the war,  there were far more reasons for chaos. Yet, we did not have  chaos even then. And if we did not have chaos then, that was  because the government of this country, the Frelimo government,  was able to govern in a situation of war. I am not implying in  any way that it was a spotless government. I do not have any  such pretension, but it is true that the Frelimo government was  able to run the country despite the war. To refute that is to  refute factual evidence: this country is still standing and it  is moving toward regaining normality.    Now, chaos can be created, just as war can be created. That  is what I mean, there is the need to prevent people who act or  intend to act in bad faith from creating obstacles to this whole  process. After all, what is it that we want with elections? We  want the country to move toward a new situation, whereby all  Mozambican citizens, irrespective of their political,  philosophical, or religious beliefs, can participate in the life  of the nation and seek to realize their individual aspirations.  I would have preferred to say that elections must be held by  October, instead of trying to imagine a hypothetical situation  in which elections would not take place.    I think that everyone -- the international community too --  is interested in seeing them go ahead. UN Special  Representative Aldo Ajello has said elections must be held. The  president of the Republic has said the same. We have been  saying soHevery day and we reiterate it now.    [Santos] One of the things Renamo has been saying is that it  does not have money to participate in the elections. Does the  Frelimo Party have money?    [Tome] The costs involved in an electoral campaign are so  massive that I do not believe there is any party that can claim  to have enough funds for a campaign. I do not believe that,  particularly in light of the situation the country is in, at  this time.    It is true that Frelimo has existed for a lot longer, it has  been in existence for the better part of 32 years, so it has  greater financial stability. However, greater financial  stability does not mean that it has enough money. It has  greater financial stability than the other parties which have  surfaced lately and which are probably still organizing their  financing sources.    I have talked about organization which does indeed include  gathering money. That is normal and it happens with any party  in the world. We are doing work, ranging from small to rather  mroe complex tasks, that involve studies and serious work with  experts.    A militant can set up some sort of gathering, he or she can  invite other militants to join in and the money can be turned  over to the party, or it can be a bigger thing, like a musical  show, for instance.    [Santos] Is Rovuma Hotel one of the Frelimo Party's sources  for gathering funds?    [Tome] Rovuma Hotel is one of the institutions owned by our  party, but we have several sources for gathering funds. Many  people think that Rovuma Hotel is a great source of revenue, but  the truth is that it is not. We have in excess of 800,000  members and those members pay their fees. It is true that we  must take note of the fact that many members do not pay their  fees, basically because of organizational reasons. We have many  militants on the ground. There are displaced people who do not  even have the means to survive on, let alone to pay their dues  to the party. Nonetheless, militant fees are an important  source of revenue to the party.    [Santos] One of the consequences of the one-party system is  the following: the state is confused with the party and with  the government. Does the Frelimo Party continue to use state  property for its own operation?    [Tome] No. What property? We use no state property at all.  We can talk about that because there is nothing that has not  been made public, even the party's secretary general has already  talked about it. There is a small portion of our budget that is  financed by the state, taking into account the fact that we are  in the Assembly of the Republic. It is true that it is a  one-party Assembly, but that situation is already history  because we are going to have a new Assembly with other parties  and they will get their share in line with the seats they get in  that institution.    However, we do not use state property. Reports that we use  state-owned vehicles and all the rest are rather unwarranted  claims. In this instance, I am talking of people, but there also  certain political parties.    A party's capacity, maturity, and quality cannot be measured  in terms of its ability to make accusations. Those qualities  must be assessed in terms of its ability to present a convincing  program to the people. They are assessed in terms of the  ability to adapt to the political situation and make important  contributions to the country.    It is true that, by definition, the opposition must oppose  the ruling party. Were it not so, the opposition party would be  a part of the ruling party and we would not be interested in  that. In fact, I must tell you that, as a Mozambican, I would  be proud if I heard people say, whether inside or outside this  country, that the Mozambican parties are strong, mature, and  have clear goals.    You, the journalists, are here to present Renamo's  accusations, most of which are unfounded, which means that  Renamo assesses its own capacity in terms of its ability to make  unfounded, baseless, and needless accusations against the ruling  party.    So, we do not need to make secret moves at that level. Such  moves are for the police and other such institutions. When I  say secret, I mean things that must be kept from public  knowledge.    The Frelimo Party will continue to adopt a serious stance in  this process. We are not going to follow up each and every  accusation. I think it more important for us to mobilize and  train our militants so they become more knowledgeable about the  situation in the country and about concepts concerning the  electoral process.    I think it must be made clear to all that those who accuse  must produce evidence. I must not come here and say that  journalists are liars, now prove that you are not. I must  produce evidence to the effect that someone lied at a certain  point, on a certain page, and in such and such edition.    It is said that Frelimo does not want elections held this  year. Who has said so? Frelimo's supreme leader has said that  elections must happen this year and he continues to say so. In  addition to the party work he has done, he has also made  personal efforts, because he has more than just the  responsibility of participating in the management of the peace  process. He has the responsibility of managing the whole  country. No leader -- President Joaquim Chissano included -- is  interested in seeing the current situation continue.</p>

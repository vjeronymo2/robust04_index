			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Moscow less in love with west: But foreign policy has no truck with extreme nationalism Those in the west who have been watching Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Russia's ultra-nationalist, tour the former Yugoslavia and talk of secret weapons to protect Serbs, may well be asking whether his remarks in any way reflect Russian foreign policy. The unequivocal answer is that they do not. Mr Zhirinovsky is seen as a dangerous lunatic by most of Russia's political establishment and his talk of a secret weapon, denied by the Defence Ministry in Moscow when he last referred to it a month ago, is not new. Only on Tuesday, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, reiterated that his Yugoslav policy was basically unchanged and joked that Mr Zhirinovsky's one skill was to 'create an atmosphere of hysteria and suspicion'. Mr Zhirinovsky's remarks, however, do coincide with a change of tone from Moscow, which more seasoned Russia watchers had been expecting for some time as an overdue adjustment of policies which had become so unequivocally pro-western they were no longer sustainable politically. Nowhere has that change of tone been clearer than from Mr Kozyrev, long singled out as enemy No. 1 by Russian nationalists who dominate the new parliament elected in December. Although most ordinary Russians do not share the strident nationalism of many of their MPs, they display the natural sensitivities of citizens of a great nation humiliated by the collapse both of their economy and of the Soviet Union. Despite western alarm over a non-binding parliamentary vote opposing military action in the former Yugoslavia, Russia's willingness to continue supporting what are viewed as increasingly incredible threats by western governments there is not the best test for judging consistency on foreign policy. If anything, long-standing Russian scepticism about the value of air strikes or other military intervention appears increasingly justified with the passing of every month these threats are not carried out. Most Russians do not even care about what happens in former Yugoslavia - its conflicts are not brought into people's living rooms every night by the sort of media coverage of Bosnia which is common in the west. But they could be made to feel upset if east European states, or those of the Baltics, joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and Russia was left to its own devices. Last week Mr Kozyrev used a visit to China to announce that he was fed up with lectures from the west. The week before, he had expressed anger at US and Baltic protests over comments he had made to say that Russia could not tolerate western military might filling the 'security vacuum' left open by retreating Russian forces. With some justification, he said his remarks had been quoted out of context to alarm the west into thinking Russia would not withdraw its remaining troops from Estonia and Latvia. His deputy, Mr Vitaly Churkin, subsequently warned Estonia and Latvia against trying to stir up western pressure to expedite a Russian troop withdrawal. He said Russian forces were on their way out, but that Russia was also entitled to agreements securing the future of retired servicemen still living in the Baltics, and allowing Russia to continue manning early warning systems in Estonia. In a sign of just how jumpy the west has become and how quickly it could change its mind about Russia, Mr Kozyrev's remarks were enough to alarm Scandinavian politicians, who are closest to the Baltics, into considering sharp protests over a perceived change in policy. That was avoided only thanks to the deft work of Scandinavian diplomats in Moscow. The main priority for both the west and Russia, say diplomats, is to avoid any declarations and gestures that might fuel a fire that is being maintained at a minimum level for domestic Russian purposes. As one western diplomat pointed out: 'Russia's ideal foreign policy now would be not to have one at all.' In practice, Russia's priorities are increasingly focused on two issues: its economic crisis, and relations with former Soviet republics making up its so-called 'near abroad'. Their implications for foreign policy are long-term. If not brought under control, Russia's economic crisis could bring an ultra-nationalist similar to Mr Zhirinovsky - but probably not him because of fears for his stability - to power. Such a figure would undoubtedly turn against the west and neighbouring states to distract public opinion from painful economic problems.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Encouraging statistics showing that the consumer price index rose by only 0.3 per cent last month eased inflationary fears in the US at the end of last week, giving bonds an unexpected shot in the arm. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond shot up by nearly  3/4 points, sending the yield down from 7.65 per cent to 7.49 per cent. Nevertheless, the market remains convinced that an increase in interest rates is almost inevitable when the Federal Open Market Committee meets tomorrow. The reason is that, whatever the consumer price index may say, other economic data continue to point to inflationary pressures further back in the supply chain. Many analysts believe that the Federal Reserve will feel compelled to choke these pressures off before they feed through into rising prices. How big the increase will be is another matter. Some analysts seem to think that 25 basis points will be enough: but paradoxically, a 50 basis point rise might prove better for bonds, at least at the long end of the market. Normally, higher interest rates cause bond prices to fall, but in this instance anything less than a 50 basis point increase might be seen as insufficient to ensure that inflation had been stifled, posing the threat of even higher interest rates to come.</p>

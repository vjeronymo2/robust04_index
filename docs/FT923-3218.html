			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (11): Sugar revenues lose their sweetness - An important export needs a rethink THE MAURITIAN sugar industry is facing up to the need for a far reaching adjustment in the face of increasingly uncertain revenues for its annual production, which averages 650,000 tonnes. The prospect of a reduction in the guaranteed support price - after a seven year freeze, paid by the European Community to African Carribbean Pacific (ACP) sugar producers under the Lome Convention - has concentrated minds in the industry. Declining revenues combined with rising domestic costs of production have forced the sector into an important rethink of its external and internal policies. But hard policy decisions are politically sensitive, given sugar's pivotal role in the Mauritian economy. It contributes 30 per cent of export earnings, 15 per cent of employment and 11 per cent of GDP. Lingering distrust between government and the powerful sugar lobby makes it much more difficult to address the main issues of productivity, mechanisation, increased yields, modernisation and the role of state intervention. Yet the need for a serious overhaul of the sector is vital. A Mauritius Chamber of Agriculture report says: 'The industry has now reached a crossroads and important decisions have to be taken to ensure that the way ahead is the one which leads to greater competitiveness and productivity.' Mr Jean-Claude Tyack, the general secretary of the chamber, says the critical impetus for reform is the likelihood of stagnating or decreasing revenue from reduced prices as a result of reforming the EC common agricultural policy (CAP), and the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Under the CAP, the slash in the lower prices paid to farmers of cereals, milk and beef, and the pressure from the Gatt negotiations, are likely to have a downward impact on sugar prices in the EC. Sugar accounts for 80 per cent of Mauritian sugar exports. 'We are barely making ends meet at present and we expect there will be a new sugar regime by mid-1993,' says Mr Tyack. 'The EC can't ignore sugar for ever.' Compounding the declining profitability of the Mauritian sugar industry has been the erosion of foreign exchange gains as a result of the entry of sterling into the European monetary system, and the slowing of the depreciation of the Mauritian rupee. Mauritius and other ACP producers are pushing for EC compensation in line with what EC farmers are being paid to maintain revenues after the cut in support prices for other commodities. Hopes are also high that the end of Portugal's transition period of entry into the EC will result in a new agreement, favourable to ACP producers, for Portugal's annual requirement of 300,000 tonnes of sugar. Mr Michel Hardy, general secretary of the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate, says the island must also continue to raise the volume of high value specialty or 'natural' unrefined sugars it sells (75,000 tonnes last year), both in EC and non-EC markets, and hunt out new markets for value-added products. But the deteriorating external conditions present new challenges to the Mauritian sugar sector. Producers complain that it is overly regulated by government, is short of labour, and that the sector needs important advances in productivity and mechanisation. Producers say, too, that the first challenge is to define a new domestic environment for the private sector in order to restore profitability and competitiveness. They say that while Mauritius is moving fast towards liberalisation, the sugar industry is 'kept in a fiscal and economic strait jacket.' A government/private sector working committee is currently considering prescriptions proposed by the sugar lobby. These include liberalisation of domestic price controls; reduction in the rate of export duty on sugar; rationalisation of the tax regime to eliminate double taxation on profits; better incentives for investment in capital to modernise and mechanise the sector; easing restrictions on closure of sugar factories to allow better rationalisation and economic efficiency, and reductions in and reform of 'cesses' - the local agriculture tax. With the correct enabling environment, sugar producers say they will feel more comfortable undertaking the necessary investments required needed to raise production and cut costs. The government, however, says that the 'sugar class' protests too much. Mr Madan Dulloo, the agriculture minister, points out that government has consistently given performance-linked incentives and support to the industry; and that already this year it has provided for the issue of tax free debentures and has substantially increased domestic consumer prices. Further measures will be considered for legislation, he says, but 'because of the importance to the economy of sugar there has to be give and take and government has to balance the political, economic and social dimensions of any policy change.' Apart from the critical issue of the role of government, there is broad agreement that several other measures need to be taken. The first is to increase yields to compensate losses from the decline in area planted - each year the sugar sector loses an estimated 500-1,000 acres of land to development of housing, infrastructure and industrialisation. Producers say the present sugar yield of 8.5 tonnes per hectare on estates could be increased to 10-11 tonnes within a decade. Irrigation (especially drip and improved furrow techniques), a comprehensive water management plan for the island, increased research on new varieties, and mechanised harvesting, loading and land preparation are also extremely important. Many of these advances cannot now be applied to Mauritius's 33,000 small planters - 90 per cent of whom work plots of under two hectares - who produce about 38 per cent of the cane. Sugar yields from the smallholder sector are at least two tonnes per hectare lower than for the estate sector. Intensifying the effort to group small planters together into larger areas of at least 20 hectares (land area management units) will be vital if they are going to be able to exploit capital-intensive yield improving techniques. Modernisation of the long-neglected milling sector, increased productivity of labour, better training, and further expansion of agricultural diversification are all badly needed, too, to revive sugar's flagging fortunes.</p>

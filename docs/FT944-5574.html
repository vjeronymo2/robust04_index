			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Short-dated sector sees further offerings Continued strong demand for short-dated paper prompted further eurobond issuance in the three- to five-year area yesterday. Bayerische Landesbank and Bayerische Vereinsbank Overseas Finance launched three-and four-year offerings respectively in the US dollar sector. The Australian dollar sector saw two deals in three- and five-year maturities. This continues a trend of recent weeks, during which there has been a flood of short-dated issues as borrowers have moved to exploit a surge in demand from European retail investors. Activity has been at its most intense in the dollar sector, with investors - most notably Swiss - attracted by yields of around 7.8 per cent, which compare favourably with 10-year yields of around 7.9 per cent. 'With US inflation at around 2.6 per cent, this implies a very attractive real yield of more than 5 per cent,' said one dealer. 'There is very little incentive for investors to go further along the yield curve and demand is high,' he added. However, 'the supply at the short-end has now started to get to the point where it is overwhelming demand,' another dealer warned. Bayerische Landesbank's Dollars 200m offering, priced to yield 15 basis points over US Treasuries, was prompted by the success of its Dollars 300m issue of three-year bonds launched last week, book-runner Lehman Brothers said. Yesterday's offering drew similar demand from European retail investors and investors in Asia, it added. Bayerische Vereinsbank's Dollars 200m offering, similarly priced at 15 basis points over US Treasuries, will be taken up by Swiss retail investors over the coming days, in spite of difficult market conditions yesterday, said lead manager SBC. In the Australian dollar sector, Commerzbank Overseas Finance launched a ADollars 125m issue of five-year bonds, offering a coupon of 10.5 per cent, which met demand from Swiss, German and Benelux retail investors, lead manager Hambros said. Caja de Madrid, Spain's second largest savings bank, is to make its debut in the eurobond markets next week with a Dollars 200m offering of three-year floating-rate notes, according to JP Morgan. Pakistan is reported to be close to taking its first step in the international bond markets with a eurodollar offering of around Dollars 200m. Market sources said Bear Stearns had been mandated to lead the offering, which could come soon after Pakistan completes a series of roadshows at the end of next week.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: MP says report shows need for extra teachers AN EXTRA 6,710 teachers will be needed next year to stop class sizes in England and Wales rising, according to a report compiled by the Department for Education and leaked yesterday to a Labour MP. The report, drawn up by the Education Settlement Working Group, a body involving representatives of local education authorities and civil servants from the education and environment departments, predicts that the number of nursery and primary pupils will rise by 66,000 next year, while secondary pupils will increase by 54,000. This would lead to an estimated pupil-teacher ratio of 17.99 to one (up from 17.66:1 in 1992-93, and 17.44:1 in 1991-92). The extra teachers would be needed to stop the ratio increasing. Mr Stephen Byers, the MP who published the report, said: 'If the government is serious about providing high standards in our schools, they must respond in a positive way to this report. Failure to do so will condemn a whole generation of school children to a sub-standard education.' A demographic shift and increased staying-on rates among 16-year-olds who might previously have left school and looked for work are blamed for the increase in numbers. Local-authority associations meet Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, today to negotiate levels of standard spending. They are likely to use the estimates in calling for extra funds. The report's publication follows a letter to Mr John Patten, the education secretary, from Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, which said that pupil-teacher ratios had risen to an unacceptable level.</p>

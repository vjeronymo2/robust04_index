			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead WH Smith, the national newsagent and retailer, is expected to report on Wedesday pre-tax profits for the year ended May 31 down slightly from Pounds 113m a year earlier. Profits will be better, or at least static, in all divisions except the Do it All DIY joint venture with Boots. The losses there are likely to rise to about Pounds 12m from Pounds 2.7m a year earlier, reflecting price competition in the sector and the venture's problems. Smiths might lift the final dividend from the previous year's 9.1p but the market is not taking this for granted. Interim profits at Guardian Royal Exchange, to be announced on Thursday, should be in line with the three composites already announced. Some Pounds 65m is expected, against losses of Pounds 39m last time, indicating the recovery of UK underwriting. However, under FRS 3, investment gains will now be included above the line, resulting in a maximum headline figure of Pounds 155m. Medeva, the UK drugs company which had its stock market value slashed from Pounds 589m to Pounds 295m in July following a warning that full-year profits would be some Pounds 10m less than expected after overstocking in the US, unveils its interim results on Tuesday. Analysts are unwilling to estimate how much of the shortfall will occur in the first half. Between Pounds 16m and Pounds 18m has been tentatively pencilled in this time, against Pounds 14.1m last. Rentokil, the environmental and property services company whose hostile Pounds 75.7m bid for Securiguard, the security and cleaning group, was recommended in July, reports interim results on Thursday. Profits of between Pounds 63m and Pounds 64m pre-tax are expected, though last time's Pounds 51.5m will be restated for FRS 3 and the group is also moving to average, rather than period-end, exchange rate calculations. The dividend could rise from 0.64p to 0.78p.</p>

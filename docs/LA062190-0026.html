I misplaced my copy.  </P> <P>  -- EVELYN  </P> <P> DEAR EVELYN: The original recipe came from judge Mildred Lillie of the Court of  Appeals in Los Angeles. She developed the recipe 10 years ago because she was  tired of having to go out to restaurants to enjoy it. Chocolate mousse cake was  a rage during that period.  </P> <P> CHOCOLATE MOUSSE PIE  </P> <P> 8 eggs, separated  </P> <P> Sugar  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons vanilla  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/2 cup brandy  </P> <P> 10 ounces unsweetened chocolate  </P> <P> 2 ounces semisweet chocolate  </P> <P> 3/4 cup butter, softened  </P> <P> 1/2 cup brewed coffee  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups whipping cream  </P> <P> Chocolate Crust  </P> <P> Cherry Cordials  </P> <P> Combine egg yolks, 1 1/2 cups sugar, vanilla, salt and brandy in top of double  boiler. Place over simmering water and beat until pale yellow and thick, about  8 to 10 minutes. Remove from water and set aside.  </P> <P> Melt both types of chocolate in top of double boiler over hot water. When  melted, remove from water and beat in butter, bit at time.  </P> <P> Gradually beat chocolate into egg yolk mixture until smooth. Chocolate mixture  will congeal and become very stiff. Beat in coffee.  </P> <P> Beat egg whites (at room temperature) into soft peaks. Gradually beat in 3  tablespoons sugar until stiff peaks form.  </P> <P> Fold 1 cup beaten egg whites into chocolate mixture until thin, then carefully  fold in remaining beaten egg whites until thoroughly incorporated. Whip cream  until stiff and gently fold into chocolate mixture.  </P> <P> Pour mousse mixture into Chocolate Crust and chill overnight in refrigerator.  Garnish with Cherry Cordials.

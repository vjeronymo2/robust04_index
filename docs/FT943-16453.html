			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Bonds boost for Sweden: Finance minister hits back at the critics of fiscal policies Mrs Anne Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, yesterday warmly welcomed heavy investor interest in a big new state bond issue and hit back strongly at critics of the government's fiscal policies. 'The reaction to the national bond issue today was very satisfactory,' she declared. 'This government has done much more than was expected to cut public spending and much more than has ever been done before in Sweden.' She was speaking after the National Debt Office announced that a keenly-anticipated auction of 7-year and 15-year bonds worth SKr6.5bn (Pounds 550m) had been 100 per cent oversubscribed, with strong overseas interest. The yield on the 7-year bonds was 10.51 per cent and the yield on the 15-year bonds was 11.05 per cent. News of the auction's success knocked long-term interest rates back below 10 per cent and halted a slide on the Stockholm stock exchange. There had been worries that the auction would not be fully taken up following the announcement last week by Skandia, the Swedish insurance group, that it was boycotting government bonds in protest at Sweden's record budget deficit and fast-rising debt. Gross government debt is set to rise to 93 per cent of GDP this year. Mrs Wibble said Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia's chief executive, was not 'as well informed as he should have been' in criticising the right-centre coalition government for not taking the state of the public finances seriously enough. 'I don't think I have opened my mouth in the last couple of years without addressing the problem of the budget situation,' she told the Financial Times. She said the budget deficit in the just-completed 1993-94 July-June budget year was slightly less than the previously anticipated 13 per cent of GDP. It was expected to fall to 9.5 per cent in the current budget year. The aim was to reduce this to within the 3 per cent target set under terms of the European Union's plans for a European monetary union by 1998. 'This will be done mostly by reducing expenditure,' Mrs Wibble said. 'The scale of our medium-term programme is sometimes forgotten . . . The situation is serious. But the government is very firm in its policy to reduce expenditure and thus the deficit,' she said. She said the government has already cut SKr90bn in expenditure - equivalent to 6 per cent of GDP - in its three years in office and planned a further SKr60bn over the next four years if it won the general election in September. Mrs Wibble blamed high interest rates - long-term rates are three points ahead of German rates - on uncertainty ahead of the election. She called on the opposition Social Democrats, who hold a firm lead in the opinion polls, to outline a clear budget reduction programme. 'We would be most happy if those on the other side of the political debate would tell investors what they will do it they get into office.' But Mr Goran Persson, the Social Democratic economy spokesman, said the success of the bond auction was due only to the high rate of interest on offer. The Social Democrats have said it is absurd for the government which presided over the rise in the deficit to try to blame the opposition. Mr Persson repeated his call for an emergency meeting of parliament's finance committee to discuss the issue, but this has been resisted by the coalition parties. Analysts were sceptical about how long the rally would last. 'These yields were high enough to tempt domestic private investors and foreign institutional investors back into Swedish bonds, particularly out of Danish bonds,' said Mr Theo Hilen, investment director at Lombard Odier in London. 'But the problems with the public finances remain and we could be faced with another crisis if these investors decide to take their profits and run,' he said. 'The relief is likely to be short-lived,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg. 'We could find ourselves in the same position at the next auction in two weeks' time. With campaigning for the elections under way it is impossible for the government to introduce new savings measures and so the turmoil could last until well into November,' he said.

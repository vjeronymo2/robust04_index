			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 25 Feb (MENA)--Religious, political, and  intellectual people in Egypt have condemned the heinous massacre  perpetrated by some Israeli settlers at dawn this morning  against a group of Palestinian worshipers at the Ibrahimi  Mosque, killing scores of people and injuring hundreds.    In statements to MENA, they noted that this barbaric and  criminal act could hamper international efforts currently being  made to establish peace between the Israelis and the  Palestinians.    They called on the international community to shoulder its  full responsibility toward this heinous crime and punish Israel  for it. They held Israel responsible for the incident for not  taking the necessary security precautions that could have  prevented this crime.    Grand Imam of al-Azhar Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq  described this incident as ugly, criminal, and painful since the  perpetrators did not take into consideration the fact that the  worshipers were standing in the hands of God, performing their  duties for God at such an early hour of the morning. These evil  men, who honor no truce or covenant, harvested the worshipers  with their weapons, killing and injuring those people who were  in God's hands.    He said this incident reveals the bestiality, absence of  humanity, and deviation from the spirit of religion and emotion  that watches over people who place themselves in the hands of  God.    He added that this is a grave crime for which Israel should  be made answerable internationally. The families and guardians  of the martyrs should take Israel to account. Those involved in  the peace process should also take this crime into consideration.    Dr. Mustafa al-Sa'id, chairman of the People's Assembly's  Economic Committee, said that this incident confirms that the  cause of peace has not yet reached the mentality of the ordinary  Israeli, who still thinks he can continue his occupation of  territory and evacuating its inhabitants through violence and  terrorism which are practiced against the Arabs in the occupied  territories. He added that this was the policy pursued by the  Israelis during the first stages of establishing the so-called  State of Israel.    He noted that such an incident underlines the need for the  Arab nation to be aware of what is happening in the region now  and to take whatever step is necessary to make Israel understand  that these criminal and terrorist actions impede the peace  efforts that the Israelis claim to welcome.    He said that this painful incident is no less grave than the  Serbs' crimes against the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina. He  deeply regretted Western society's silence over the repeated  violations of human rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the  occupied Arab territories.    Kahlid Muhyi-al-Din, National Progressive Unionist Grouping  Party leader, described the crime as an ugly one and asked why  people who were kneeling in prayer and not doing anything to  harm Israeli settlers were shot at. He said that this incident  shows that keeping the Israeli settlements in the occupied  territories threatens the process to establish peace and  destroys any attempt to establish any peaceful coexistence.    Liberals Party leader Mustafa Kamil Murad stressed that this  incident indicates the increase in the number of extremist  Israeli elements whose extremism reaches the level of  criminality, bloodshed, and the violation of God's houses. He  said that shooting at people in prayer is unprecedented anywhere  except in Israel. He noted that this incident will have bad  consequences on the progress of the peace negotiations between  Israel and the PLO. He called for an international  investigation into this incident, condemnation of it, and  international punishment for it.    The Wafd Party Secretary Yasin Siraj al-Din said that this  incident confirms the barbarism of the Israelis and their  ability to challenge the world public. He noted that the  incident is aimed against all heavenly principles, including  Islam and Christianity. He said that the incident is bound to  impede all the current efforts to establish peace in the region  in general and the Gaza-Jericho Accord between Israel and the  PLO in particular. He called for halting all cooperation or  normalization between the Arabs and Israelis.    Siraj al-Din stressed the need to convene an emergency Arab  summit to be attended by kings and presidents to put an end to  these repeated criminal Israeli practices. He said if this is  unachievable, the summit must be held at the level of heads of  government to end such criminal acts effectively.    Ahmad Hamrush, chairman of the Egyptian Afro-Asian  Solidarity  Committee, said that this massacre is added to the list of  massacres committed by the Israeli extremists, starting with the  massacre in Dayr Yasin in 1947, and including the Sabra and  Shatila [in Beirut] massacres, and now the Hebron massacre.  Today's massacre comes at a delicate time when the Israeli and  Palestinian peoples are joining efforts to achieve peace in the  region.    Hamrush stressed that these extremist terrorist elements  that  perpetrated this bestial massacre aim to halt the peace process,  to incite hatred between the Arabs and Jews, and to continue the  tension and wars that have engulfed the region for 50 years. He  said Rabin should be held responsible for this massacre, as he  continues to procrastinate in the implementation of the  agreements reached between the Israeli Government and the PLO.    Continuing his statement, Hamrush said: I hope this incident  would not thwart the peaceful settlement and that we will not  give the Israeli extremists and terrorists the chance to have  the final word concerning the nations' fate. He added: We are  passing through a stage that requires self-restraint and  recourse to logic and rationalism to confront this tragedy so  that we can avert its consequences and continue the peace  process.

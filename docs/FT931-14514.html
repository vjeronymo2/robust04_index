			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Miyazawa sets out strategy for Japan in Asia MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, has promised to promote democracy, human rights and the environment as part of a new strategy for Japan in Asia. In a much-heralded speech in Bangkok at the weekend during a South-East Asian tour, he also announced plans for an international forum to co-ordinate the development of Indo-China. He indicated, though, that Japan's approach in Asia would remain pragmatic and be unlikely to offend governments of whatever political complexion. Mr Miyazawa singled out four policies important for Japan and the region: a dialogue on security; enhancing economic 'openness' and growth; the promotion of democracy, human rights and environmentalism; and co-operation on Indo-China. 'Economically, the region continues to enjoy dynamic growth,' he said. 'This Asia-Pacific region may indeed be acquiring a great potential to contribute politically and economically to the peace and prosperity of the world.' The so-called 'Miyazawa doctrine', in a speech entitled 'The new area of the Asia-Pacific and Japan-Asean co-operation', is designed to solidify Japan's relations with its Asian neighbours without antagonising the west, but it contained few surprises for his south east Asian audience. Referring obliquely to Japan's occupation of some Asian countries during the second world war, Mr Miyazawa reassured his listeners that 'Japan shall never again become a military power' and reiterated Japanese support for the continuing US military presence as a stabilising force in the Pacific. Noting that trade between Japan and the six-member Association of South East Asian Nations had been expanding at 20 per cent a year, Mr Miyazawa appealed for free trade, although he made no mention of Japan's reluctance to open its rice market to Asian and American exporters. For Asian governments sceptical about the benefits of democracy and environmentalism, the most remarkable part of Mr Miyazawa's speech was his call for environmental conservation and his assertion that 'to promote democratisation and advance fundamental human rights is a universal task for humankind'. He added, however, that Japan would take 'the approach it deems to be most pragmatic and effective in the light of each circumstance', and at a news conference afterwards said hasty, hardline action against the military junta in Burma would be 'counter-productive'.

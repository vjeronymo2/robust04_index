			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand back in black at nine months UNI Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurance group, yesterday reported nine-month profits of NKr3.84bn (Dollars 526m), against a loss of NKr3.59bn in the same period last year. It attributed the sharp turnround to a positive development in interest rates and gains on securities. After distribution of NKr2.73bn in life and pension insurance for life insurance clients, the consolidated nine-month pre-tax profit reached NKr1.11bn against a loss of NKr3.8bn in the same period last year, the company said. Group gross operating income rose to NKr18.19bn from NKr15.22bn last year as net operating income advanced to NKr16.79bn from NKr13.79bn. During the nine-month interim, the group achieved realised gains on securities of NKr2.42bn, of which NKr1bn was made during the third quarter. Unrealised gains reached NKr4.06bn. Uni said its equity capital increased by NKr466m to NKr2.56bn while its equity-to-debt ratio reached 7.81 per cent, compared with the legal requirement of 4.25 per cent.</p>

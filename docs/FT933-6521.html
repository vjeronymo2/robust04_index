			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Macedonia starts work on Russian gas pipeline MAKPETROL, Macedonia's state-owned energy company, has started building a 100km pipeline to carry Russian natural gas from the Bulgarian border to Skopje, the republic's capital. Mr Ljubomir Janev, general manager of Makpetrol, said Macedonia would cover the full cost of the Dollars 60m project, agreed while Macedonia was still part of Yugoslavia. Completion is scheduled for early 1995. He said that Macedonia could afford the project because the pipe sections were being produced by a local manufacturer, the state-owned Macedonia Pipeworks. According to Mr Janev, the pipeline would reduce the country's dependence on imported oil. It would also enable the Skopje refinery to increase its production of jet fuel and other petroleum products, because it would no longer have to produce fuel oil for industry and domestic heating. Macedonia will buy up to 800,000 cubic metres of gas annually from Gazexport, the Russian supplier. The price has not yet been negotiated but Macedonia expects to arrange a barter agreement with payment in local products. The pipeline is the first important infrastructure project to be launched in Macedonia since it broke away from the former Yugoslavia in 1991. There are plans to extend the pipeline to neighbouring Albania.</p>

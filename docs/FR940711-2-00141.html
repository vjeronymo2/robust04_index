			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The NASD has operated The PORTAL Market since it initiated operations in June 1990 without the imposition of any fees on users. The NASD is proposing to adopt a filing fee of $2,000 per security application submitted plus $200 for each security identification symbol assigned after the first symbol. Many private offerings of securities are of securities that are sold in multiple tranches, each of which is treated as a separate security, even though part of a single private offering, and assigned a separate identification symbol by The PORTAL Market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD believes that the imposition of a PORTAL filing fee will assist The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. to cover continuing costs associated with the operation of the PORTAL Market, including significant costs associated with the processing of security applications. The processing of security applications for The PORTAL Market requires an immediate review of all applications, as private placements are usually on a very short time schedule. Such review must ensure that the security meets all of the requirements in Part II of the PORTAL Rules, as set forth above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications are generally submitted the day prior to commencing the private placement or the day prior to conducting a ``road show,'' if such a road show is used, and approval is necessary within one or two days at the most. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  In addition, because of a continuing lack of knowledge regarding the procedures for obtaining approval for PORTAL designation, Depository Trust Company book-entry approval, and the issuance of a CUSIP number from Standard &amp; Poor's, The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. staff must work closely with the applicant to complete the process. Further, private offerings that rely on Rule 144A for redistribution of the securities to qualified institutional buyers are many times unique in their structure, as well as frequently involving issues related to SEC Regulation S and compliance with the CUSIP identification number requirement when an offshore offering occurs simultaneously with a U.S. private placement. Finally, there are many issues with multiple tranches, each of which must be assigned a separate security symbol. Given the efforts required by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. staff, the NASD belies that the fees as proposed are appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> In the case of private offerings, such a ``road show'' is quite abbreviated as the number of potential investors is generally no more than 75. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> (b) Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  which requires that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility or system which the Association operates or controls in that the proposed rule change equitably applies a filing fee to all applications submitted by PORTAL dealers, PORTAL brokers, and PORTAL qualified investors for the designation of securities in The PORTAL Market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 15 U.S.C. 78o <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> &hyph;3 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

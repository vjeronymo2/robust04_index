			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (12): Long night's journey into day - US giants are beginning painfully to claw back their home market THE US motor industry is emerging with painful slowness from a severe recession and heavy financial losses, but it is getting in much better shape to fight the never-ending battle against Japanese competition. The Big Three manufacturers - General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler - have collectively lost billions of dollars over the past two years. This was due to plummeting demand in North America at a time when an expansion of Japanese manufacturing capacity in the US - the so-called 'transplant' operations - was adding to the industry's chronic imbalance between potential supply and demand. The result was a fierce price-cutting war. Yet the recession has at least forced the Big Three to become much leaner in their day-to-day operations. Ford and Chrysler, having suffered financial crises in the early 1980s, had less slimming to do than General Motors, which had been shielded for years by its huge market share, a buoyant car market and its large non-automotive subsidiaries. Yet even GM, which as a group lost Dollars 4.5bn last year, has finally been forced to bite the bullet. It announced sweeping factory closures last December, while in April a coup by board members gave added urgency to the revitalisation programme. Mr Jack Smith, who in the 1980s played a major role in turning around GM Europe from losses to profit, was appointed the group's president with a mandate to speed up change in North America. One of his most striking moves has been to appoint a new Spanish head of GM's parts purchasing operation, who is seeking controversial price cuts from suppliers while at the same time trying to forge closer, long-term relations with them, in a manner reminiscent of Japanese automobile companies. Indeed, across the board a striking feature of all the Big Three companies is how much they have learnt from their Japanese rivals. Mr David Cole, director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan, says: 'the domestic manufacturers are really getting religion fast and are becoming much more viable competitors. I have a higher level of confidence about their long term success than I would have had a couple of years ago.' Chrysler, for example, has totally remodelled the way it does business after closely studying Honda. It has forged close links with suppliers, who are brought in to discussions early in the development of a new car, and created new platform teams, responsible for development of various types of vehicle, which brought together members of different disciplines. Parts of General Motors have also learnt lessons from the Japanese. Cadillac, the luxury car manufacturer, studied the methods of Dr Edward Deming, the academic behind much of the Japanese management philosophy, and won an important US quality award. And Saturn, the small car project General Motors launched in the 1980s as a stand-alone attempt to exceed Japanese methods of sophisticated manufacturing, has produced a vehicle which is one of the hottest on the US market. Embarrassingly for GM, it is also in extremely short supply. The quality of US cars is also much improved, although still a little behind that of Japanese rivals. According to the latest Initial Quality Study from the consultancy JD Powers, the average Japanese make had 105 problems per 100 cars in the 1992 model year, down from 112. The Big Three score was 136, down from 148. Still, analysts say these headline figures mask a wide range of variation among products and manufacturers, and that not all Japanese products are in the top rank. The improved quality image of US vehicles may be one factor why the Americans have been clawing back market share from the Japanese. In the first six months of this year Japanese cars accounted for 29.1 per cent of the US market, down from 29.6 per cent in the same period of 1991. When cars made in Japanese plants, but sold by US companies, are included in the tally, the Japanese share dipped from 36 per cent to 34.4 per cent. Another factor may have been the lower rate of price increases pushed through by the Big Three compared with their Japanese rivals, whose parent companies are now suffering from Japan's slowdown. Detroit, in other words, no longer sees its Japanese rivals as invulnerable. Many view this year's market share gains as a temporary breathing space, although Mr Robert Lutz, president of Chrysler, has predicted that the Big Three will take one to three percentage points of car and truck market share back from the Japanese each year through to the mid-1990s. Whatever happens, the vehicle market does seem to be recovering, with overall US car and truck sales up 5 per cent in the first six months of this year. For 1993 analysts are forecasting sales of around 14.5m vehicles, up from a little over 13m in the current year. That, in turn, should restore the Big Three to the black and give them greater financial security as they fund development of new models for the next five years. However, some major and potentially worrying unknowns still hang over the industry as regards Government policy in areas such as tighter controls over automobile emissions and greater fuel economy. In the medium term future of the industry, says Mr Cole, 'the wild card is the Government-industry relationship and the policy agenda that emerges'.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      10 BEST SELLING MODELS IN US  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Make/Model           8-months 1992   8-months 1991   % change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Honda Accord            262,614        277,569        -5.4 Ford Taurus             238,352        202,013        18.0 Ford Escort             192,527        167,776        14.8 Toyota Camry            187,102        180,293         3.8 Chevrolet Lumina        153,721        151,680         1.3 Pontiac Grand Am        152,159        108,040        40.8 Ford Tempo              149,773        124,673        20.1 Chevrolet Cavalier      147,960        192,515       -23.1 Honda Civic             143,405        154,099        -6.9 Toyota Corolla          140,731        131,730         6.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Automotive News  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

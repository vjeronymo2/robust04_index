			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Formulating an Expanded Definition of Universal Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 25. As the nation decides whether and how to redefine universal service, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important to remember that, to a large extent, the current debate represents but a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new phase in a continuing process. Although universal service has traditionally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been defined as voice-grade POTS, the minimally-acceptable characteristics of that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service have changed over the past sixty years. Thus, direct dialing became  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> popular as it obviated the need to make more expensive operator-assisted calls in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many instances and regulators mandated lower rates for directly-dialed calls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Party-line service has been replaced in recent decades by single-line service. Some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states have directed local exchange carriers to incorporate touch-tone capability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into their basic service offerings because of its importance in accessing many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information services. In short, the current interest in redefining universal service is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with past practice. The principal differences are the ever-expanding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range of services that could be incorporated into a revised concept of universal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service and the quicker pace at which policymakers must make their decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26. As noted above, there appears to be strong public support for expanding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing definition of universal service. There is, however, little consensus about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what services, features, and capabilities should be included within a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition. Witnesses at the NTIA field hearings suggested that universal service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encompass a host of different services, including: access to a basic set of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information and telecommunications services; multiple languages, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spanish and Native American languages that require special, non-ASCII <FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>  characters; set-aside resources, facilities, and capacity for public, education, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government training and use; new technologies such as video link and cellular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> telephone service; and services defined as characteristics or features, rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies. <FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>  A random survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Benton Foundation found that Americans are very interested in educational and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informational services. <FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 38 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ASCII is a uniform code used in computer and data communications systems. It employs seven binary digits (bits) to represent a specific set of letters, numbers, punctuation and special characters, plus a parity bit used in checking for transmission errors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 39 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Comments of KNME&hyph;TV (Channel 5); Prodigy Services Co.; University of New Mexico, Department of Engineering; Alliance for Community Media; Virtual City Network Project; Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana; Casey Luna, Lt.

If universal service is to be redefined as a group of services or capabilities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some mechanism or set of principles must be found to help select from the wealth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of possible alternatives. We therefore request comment on whether there is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizing principle or set of principles that can be used to determine whether a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular service or feature should be included within a modern concept of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> universal service. This is essential because redefinition is not without potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pitfalls. Adding each new component to the package deemed universally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary increases both the societal costs of making that package universally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available as well as the chances of prematurely mandating services or features that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are ultimately proven to be commercially undesirable. <FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Defining universal service to include certain services may also raise constitutional and regulatory issues. For example, government designation of certain information services as part of a universal service package could be challenged as violative of the First Amendment on the ground that it compels providers to ``speak'' or because it discriminates against other information services. Moreover, inclusion of information services within a redefined universal service could lead to regulation of currently unregulated services. We seek comment on these issues as well. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 28. One approach could be to allow the marketplace to identify, at least in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first instance, services and features that warrant inclusion in an expanded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of universal service. <FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>  Under this approach, private firms would offer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services to consumers in competition with other companies. If some service were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subscribed to by a predesignated minimum percentage of U.S. households,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government regulators would either have the authority to consider whether to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make that service universally available or be required to do so. <FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>  We seek  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on whether government should select services to be included in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanded definition of universal service and, if so, on what basis such services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be chosen? What role should the market play in determining that mix?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should there be some threshold of market penetration before a capability or service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is added to the definition of universal service? If so, what should the threshold be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and why? Are there disadvantages in relying on market forces even in the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instance?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 42 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Comments of Neil Pickett, Director of Research and Programs, the Hudson Institute, Indianapolis field hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Cf. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  S. 1822, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. &sect;102(a) (1994), which would add a new section 201A(b) to the Communications Act requiring the FCC to incorporate within universal service ``any telecommunications and information services which .&blank;.&blank;. have, through the operation of market choices by customers, been subscribed to by a substantial majority of residential customers.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 29. An alternative to identifying particular services to be incorporated into an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanded concept of universal service would be to define universal service in terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a network connection that would enable customers to access any service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available via such network. If universal service were to be defined in such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fashion, the cost of making it available throughout the country would likely be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced. Moreover, government officials would not be required to make difficult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations about the relative value of different services or equipment; instead,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it should allow the market to determine customer valuation of each service or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment item. On the other hand, government officials may have to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equally difficult decisions as to the type of network connection that should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30. We request comment on the notion of defining universal service in terms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a network connection. Would such an approach effectively spur deployment of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advanced telecommunications infrastructure? Would it give all sectors of society a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chance to participate in the information revolution? If this approach were adopted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what sort of connection should be specified ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in terms of capacity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmission speed, signalling, etc.)?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 31. The notion of defining universal service as customer access to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> telecommunications network raises the issue of access to the Internet, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> began in 1969 as a Pentagon experiment to aid researchers in trading information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by computer. Today the Internet is a worldwide network linking over 21,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separately administered computer networks. Each computer network connects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tens of thousands of computers with ten million users in the United States and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fifteen million users in sixty countries around the world. <FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>  One observer recently asserted: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 44 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> About the Internet, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  The InfoLetter: A Monthly Roadmap to the Information Superhighway, May 1994, at 5.

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Leading Article: An agenda for tax reform Today marks the start of the new tax year in the UK, with attention focused on the politics of extending value-added tax to domestic fuel and power. But the VAT rise is only one of a series of tax changes to raise revenue which comes into effect this year. Fiscal tinkering is back in vogue - and the tax system is becoming more complicated and less transparent as a result. One symptom of this is the proliferation of taxes. In the November budget, Mr Kenneth Clarke introduced new taxes on insurance premiums and air travellers. These will eventually raise almost Pounds 1.2bn from activities previously outside the tax net. It is all sadly reminiscent of the ingenious wheezes to raise revenue devised by Mr Harold Lever, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the last Labour government. These expedients were supposed to have been swept away by the Conservative tax reforms since 1979. When Lord Lawson was chancellor, he delighted in abolishing taxes such as the investment income surcharge and the national insurance surcharge. The creation of new taxes is a regrettable U-turn against simplification. So, too, is the addition of extra rates of income tax. Chancellor Lawson's 1988 budget replaced the sliding scale of higher rates with a simple two-tier structure based on a 25 per cent basic rate and a 40 per cent higher rate. In 1992, chancellor Lamont introduced a third, lower rate of 20 per cent. This has already complicated tax matters, requiring pensioners and other low-income savers to reclaim some of the tax deducted from their investment income at the basic rate. Extra tax staff have been needed at the Inland Revenue to handle the complications. Last year, the tax credit that comes with share dividends was reduced from the basic rate of 25 per cent to the 20 per cent lower rate. This saves the Treasury Pounds 1bn a year without adding to most people's tax bills. But higher-rate taxpayers now pay an extra Pounds 200m a year, since the additional tax collected from them has risen from 15 per cent of the gross dividend income to 20 per cent. The move is a concealed tax increase. A further consequence has been to make it harder for basic-rate and higher-rate taxpayers to work out their liability to capital gains tax. Depending on the mix of dividends and capital gains, the marginal rate on gains can be 20 per cent, 25 per cent or 40 per cent. Without the expertise to calculate it, rational investment decisions cannot be made. Finally, the start of the new tax year brings the restriction to 20 per cent of the tax relief available on some allowances. Mortgage interest tax relief and the married couple's allowance are affected, with the rate due to fall to 15 per cent next year. The gradual reduction in the rate of relief may be a prelude to the abolition of these allowances (welcome in the case of mortgage interest relief). But it requires complicated adjustments to the codes used by employers to operate pay-as-you-earn. Increasing complexity and loss of transparency are objectionable enough after a decade in which the tax system became more open. But they undermine the government's plans to introduce self-assessment for some 8m taxpayers from 1996-97. This welcome move will encourage the self-employed and employees with complex tax affairs to calculate their own tax bills. It should eventually produce significant savings in Inland Revenue costs. But it cannot work if haphazard complications arise in the tax system. There are many advantages in a broad-based and simple tax system. Chancellor Clarke needs to consider what sort of tax system he wishes to create and devise a strategy to achieve it. Once he has done this, he must then resist the temptation to tinker.</p>

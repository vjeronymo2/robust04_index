			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Trouble with the neighbours: Latin America fears a less productive relationship with the new US administration As Bill Clinton settles into the White House, Latin American governments are worried that once again, US policy towards them is taking an unpredictable turn. They often characterise American attitudes as a pendulum swinging from crisis to neglect. Relations have been more consistent - generally bad. One of George Bush's achievements as president was the improvement of relations with most neighbouring governments. His decision to negotiate a free trade area with Mexico and to open the prospect of free trade with the rest of the region through the Enterprise for Americas Initiative was applauded by Latin governments. 'For us, the Enterprise for Americas Initiative was the most important initiative from the US in 30 years,' says Mr Alieto Guadagni, Argentina's secretary for international economic relations. In contrast, from the Latin American perspective, the Clinton administration has started badly. Governments are worried by the protectionist signals coming from Washington just as they are seeking to expand exports. They were also disappointed by the choice of Mr Mario Baeza, a black Cuban-American lawyer with little experience of the region, as nominee for the job of assistant secretary for Latin American affairs in the State Department. They became more concerned when Mr Baeza was dropped under pressure from the Florida-based anti-Castro lobby on the grounds that he might be too soft on President Fidel Castro. 'It looks as if the only Latin Americans who matter to Clinton are the Miami Cubans,' says one academic. If the pendulum is swinging towards neglect, as Latin American leaders fear, there are dangers. Mr William Leogrande, politics professor at the American University in Washington, says Latin America's problems should be addressed now 'before they become such extraordinary crises that all the policy options left are bad ones'. Talk of crisis contrasts sharply with the enthusiasm that has suffused Washington and Wall Street over the past two or three years about the region's prospects. The excitement was in part justified by the transformation of the political and economic map of Latin America during the 1980s. Elected governments, rather than military dictatorships, are now installed almost everywhere in the region. These governments have opened their economies to foreign trade and capital in the belief that the closed, state-controlled economies favoured by their predecessors were largely to blame for the debt-induced recession of the 1980s. Economic reforms - aimed at revitalising the market through such measures as privatisation and openness to foreign investment - yielded higher growth and lower inflation in most countries. But by last year expectations appeared to have run ahead of reality. Says Mr Victor Bulmer-Thomas, head of the Institute for Latin American Studies at the University of London: 'If we compare where Latin America is now with, say, two years ago, it's actually in a very satisfactory position. If people are now beginning to get depressed, it's because expectations were built up far too high.' Events of the past 12 months have also reasserted some of the region's perennial problems: authoritarianism, corruption and political violence. There have been two military coup attempts in Venezuela, the suspension of the constitution in Peru, the impeachment of the president on corruption charges in Brazil and the declaration of a state of emergency in Colombia, where the government faces an intensifying struggle against left-wing guerrillas and drugs traffickers. On the economic front, too, some of the region's success stories have started to look less secure. Mexico, for example, faces the growing problem of financing a current account deficit of Dollars 20bn, equivalent to 6 per cent of gross domestic product. With the euphoria punctured, capital inflows into the region, look set to decline. According to J P Morgan, the New York bank, the flow of private capital into the region is expected to drop this year to Dollars 23bn from an estimated Dollars 44bn last year. These developments have uncovered tensions created by the simultaneous attempt to transform political and economic systems. Mr Abraham Lowenthal, director of the Centre for International Studies at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, says the region's shifts are important but 'they are not yet deeply rooted'. Reforms are often implemented by a few senior government officials, and opposed by influential groups such as the military, the bureaucracy, trade unions, political parties and local industrialists who thrived behind the old tariff walls. Their positions are threatened by the decentralisation of power that can result from both political reform - through a more effective popular democracy - and from economic reform, which deprives the state of influence, for example through privatisation. Furthermore, the economic reforms are seen, sometimes justly, as accentuating already-wide income disparities. Two out of five Latin Americans live in poverty - 180m people compared with 130m in 1980. The wealthiest fifth of the population earn 20 times that earned by the poorest fifth, compared with less than 10 times in Asia. Economic reform has not been unpopular everywhere. In Argentina, for instance, the ending of hyperinflation and the opening of the economy has bolstered the authority of President Carlos Menem. People have been given access to cheaper consumer goods and so far have responded by supporting the government. But sooner or later, the piper has to be paid by increasing exports. 'The model is one of export-led growth; the problem is that in most countries exports have yet to take off,' says Mr Bulmer-Thomas. The difficulties in increasing exports are compounded, however, where the exchange rate is allowed to appreciate in real terms as part of the attempt to fight inflation. This appreciation, a problem both for Mexico and Argentina, makes imports progressively more competitive against home-produced goods. It widens the current account deficit and hurts domestic industry. In Mexico, vanguard of the region's economic reform movement, some economists think that only further aggressive deregulation will rid the economy of its bottlenecks - its bad roads and ports, inefficient bureaucracy and corrupt law enforcement - to allow it successfully to compete on a international level. Such reforms will take time, and time may be in short supply. Important clues to the durability of economic reform will be given in the next two years as an intense period of presidential election activity starts. This year, presidential elections are scheduled in Paraguay in May, in Bolivia in June, and in Venezuela and Chile in December. The elections will highlight the tensions between democracy, economic reform and the power of entrenched interests throughout the region. And while Mr Clinton cannot determine the outcome of events in Latin America, he can be an important influence. His campaign speeches suggested more emphasis on promoting democracy, which he argued should be the motivating force behind US foreign policy in the post cold-war period. His approach to drugs trafficking - particularly if it focuses on curbing demand in the US rather than on pouring more resources into interdiction in producing countries - may prove more constructive than that of Mr Bush. But the most important question-mark is over trade, and the new administration's attitudes to the Uruguay Round trade talks and to the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, negotiated last year and due before the legislatures of the three countries this year for ratification. Mr Clinton has declared himself in favour of Nafta, though he wants some side agreements with Mexico that would protect American jobs and ensure Mexico does not suck in investment because of lower environmental standards. However, the Democratic party is divided over the agreement and Mr Clinton may be deterred from submitting it to Congress for quick ratification. 'The rejection of Nafta at this stage would be a decisive setback. It would deal a severe blow to Mexico's economic reform efforts and strain US-Mexico relations. It would also gut the core of future hemisphere-wide trade relations,' says the InterAmerican Dialogue, a Washington-based study group in a report published last month. Without Nafta, the most potent, tangible expression of closer, more constructive US-Latin relations would be jeopardised. Securing the real gains made over the past few years and preventing a resurgence of authoritarianism and economic nationalism in Latin America would become more difficult.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   LATIN AMERICA: PROGRESS UNDER THREAT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Net capital inflows  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dollars bn               1990         1991        1992*      1993*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina                 0.5          5.0        10.7        6.2 Brazil                    4.6          3.0         7.7       -5.8 Chile                     3.0          3.0         2.4        2.0 Colombia                 -0.1         -0.6         0.2        0.0 Mexico                    9.5         20.6        19.6       19.3 Peru                      0.5          1.5         3.1        2.0 Venezuela                -1.7          3.3         0.4       -0.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                    16.3         35.8        44.1       23.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Morgan Guaranty Trust                                 *Forecasts  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

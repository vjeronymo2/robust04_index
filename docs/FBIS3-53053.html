			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>   [Text] Amman--Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali Monday  [10 January] blamed the Jordanian media for continued strains in  relations between the Kingdom and Gulf states as well as what he  described as "wrestling" between the government and Parliament.    "Unfortunately, and I say it clearly, the Jordan media play  a  part in not getting this relations back (with Gulf states)," Dr.  al-Majali told reporters in response to a question about  Arab-Arab relations.    "Everytime we almost get it back, a couple of articles go in  some of the media and it becomes strained again," Dr. al-Majali  said.    In response to another question about whether the government  will work to upgrade and facilitate the institutions of  democracy such as Parliament, Dr. al-Majali said that the media  was also a reason behind the tension between his Cabinet and  Parliament in an obvious reference to the gruelling confidence  session in December.    "The tension was drawn by the media," the prime minister  said, adding that an article appeared which caused tension that  had not existed until its publication. The prime minister was  most probably referring to comments ahead of the confidence  session that described the newly elected deputies as "docile."    Asked why his government had a "tug of war over freedom of  expression" with the Jordanian media in general, Dr. al-Majali  said that this was not true and that he did not think there was  tension between the two. But he added that "sometimes" the  media "takes a little thing and they don't study it properly and  then blow it" out of all proportions.    The prime minister explained that while the Kingdom's  relations with Gulf states, and especially Saudi Arabia and  Kuwait, were improving, they continued to face setbacks because  of critical opinion pieces or reports in the press.    He said his government had received communiques from Gulf  states protesting the criticism in the Jordanian media and are  unconvinced that the government is not behind the reports.    "A couple of articles come up, the second day we get into  trouble over them--the second day, it does not even go to the  third," the premier added. "They think that we have control  over the media, that we tell you what to write and what not to  write. And you know this is not true," the premier said.    "We hope that the media would take this concern into  account,  do they want this relation to be back, then they could help it  return rather than to stir things against it."    He said that while the Kingdom was gratified by the success  of its goodwill overtures with the United Arab Emirates and  Qatar he hoped that the same will happen with Saudi Arabia.    "We hope our relations with Saudi Arabia would improve," Dr.  al-Majali said, adding that contacts between the two countries  "are good now but have not reached the level we want."    "We are trying to ask the media to please stop adding oil to  the fire," Dr. al-Majali said, adding that "nothing is going to  change if we keep criticising them. But the situation will  change if we meet them and talk to them."    Dr. al-Majali also criticised the United States and other  Western countries for failing to facilitate reconciliation  between Jordan and the Gulf Arab states.    "Western countries, including the united States, have not  been doing enough to mend Jordan's relations with other Arabs,"  Dr. al-Majali said.    "We know that Egypt is trying its best," he said. "But the  West is not, and I do not know whether that is because of a bad  feeling about what has taken place during the Gulf war."</p>

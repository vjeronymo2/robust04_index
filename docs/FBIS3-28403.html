			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 5 (YONHAP) -- Among the member  countries of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), concern about North Korea's nuclear  program is rising and if the problem of inspections is not  solved by Feb. 21, the board is likely to take decisive action,  Korean Ambassador to Vienna Yi Si-yong said on Saturday.    Yi is here to attend a meeting of chiefs of Korean overseas  missions.    The board of governors has expressed deep concern that North  Korea rejects not only special but also general inspections. If  this goes on, the IAEA's dignity will be stained and the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) itself may be compromised, leading  the board's member countries to share the position that the IAEA  should take firm action against Pyongyang, Yi said.    "Unless the contacts between the IAEA and North Korea bring  a  concrete solution on nuclear inspections by Feb. 21, the day  the board of governors meets, IAEA Director-General Hans Blix  will report to the United Nations Security Council that the IAEA  can not guarantee that nuclear materials in North Korea won't be  used for military purposes," Yi said.    Yi envisioned two scenarios: The IAEA will adopt a moderate  resolution if North Korea agrees to nuclear inspections by Feb.  21, or the agency will have to report to the UN Security Council  on the matter if a solution is not found by then.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG EIGHT ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NEBRASKA GROUNDS OUT 432 YARDS AND DEFEATS UTAH, 42-30  </P> <P> Ken Clark rushed for 130 yards and one touchdown, Bryan Carpenter added 107  yards and another score and quarterback Gerry Gdowski scored three touchdowns  as the No. 4-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers defeated Utah, 42-30, Saturday at  Lincoln, Neb.  </P> <P> In all, the Cornhuskers had 432 rushing yards.  </P> <P> Utah fell to 1-2 despite Scott Mitchell completing 26 of 44 passes for 297  yards and four touchdowns.  </P> <P> Nebraska (2-0) found itself down 13-7 in the first quarter after Mitchell  passed to tight end Dennis Smith for touchdowns on passes of five and 43 yards.  </P> <P> Gdowski scored his second touchdown on an eight-yard run early in the second  quarter to put the Cornhuskers ahead to stay, 14-13, and Nebraska's Mike Croel  intercepted a Mitchell pass one minute later and ran it in from six yards out.  </P> <P> Mitchell then got the Utes into field goal range and Wayne Lammle hit on a  45-yarder with 5:16 left in the half.  </P> <P> Mitchell ended the first half with 169 yards on 16 of 23 passes, but the Husker  pass rush and Clark and company took over the second half.  </P> <P> Clark, who had 168 yards rushing in 20 minutes last week, had only 47 by  halftime against Utah. In the second half, he broke loose to help Nebraska roll  up the ground yards and an edge in time-of-possession of nearly 19 minutes to  11.  </P> <P> It was the fifth straight game that Clark ran for 100 or more yards.  </P> <P> Northern Iowa 10, Kansas State 8 -- The Kansas State has now gone 29 games  without a victory as Ken Macklin threw a 36-yard touchdown pass to Greg Wallace  and Brian Mitchell kicked a 39-yard field goal to lead the Panthers over the  Wildcats at Manhattan, Kan.  </P> <P> Kansas State's last win came in October, 1986. The Wildcats have lost 15  straight since a 17-17 tie with Kansas in 1987.  </P> <P> Kansas State (0-2) at least managed to make this game exciting in the final two  minutes, scoring a touchdown and adding a two-point conversion to close the gap  after Division I-AA Northern Iowa (1-1) had done all its scoring in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> Kansas 28, Kent State 21 -- Tony Sands rushed for 146 yards and two touchdowns  to lead the Jayhawks over the Golden Flashes at Lawrence, Kan.  </P> <P> Kansas Coach Glen Mason used to coach at Kent State, and two years ago his Kent  State team beat Kansas, 31-17.  </P> <P> Mason, in his second year at Kansas, beat Kent State last year.  </P> <P> Kansas (2-1) jumped to an 18-0 lead over Kent State (0-3) on the first play of  the second period, but had to bat away a fourth-down pass in the end zone to  prevent a 21-21 tie in the third quarter.  </P></p>

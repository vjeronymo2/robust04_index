			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> After Columbus Day, the Names Project will scale back its national display of  quilts that serves as a personal memorial to those who have died of acquired  immune deficiency syndrome, a spokesman for the organization said. "We will be  going into senior citizen centers, classrooms and to people at risk but who  have yet to come to terms with AIDS, and let the quilt do what it does, which  is to reach people on a personal level," said Names Project spokesman Dan  Sauro. Cleve Jones, a gay political activist in San Francisco, said the cost of  mounting the full display of quilts since October, 1987, has become  prohibitive. It will cost about $165,000 to transport and display the  approximately 12,000 quilts Oct. 6-8 in Washington on 25 acres on the south  side of the White House.  </P></p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / International Company News: SCA in SKr1.3bn rationalisation Competition in Europe's disposable nappy market yesterday forced SCA, the big Swedish forestry products group, to announce a SKr1.3bn (Dollars 173m) rationalisation programme in the nappy-making operations of its subsidiary Molnlycke which include the Peaudouce and Libero brand names. Molnlycke has been hit by a tough battle for market share in Europe in disposable nappy and female hygiene products since Kimberley Clark, the US group, stepped up its efforts a year ago to build up its position, adding to the competitive pressures imposed by Procter &amp; Gamble. Prices have fallen by 10 per cent while marketing costs have soared by up to 30 per cent. The nappy war caused a 19 per cent fall in Molnlycke's operating profit in the first nine months of this year, in spite of the company's largely successful defence of its leading position in branded nappies in its key markets in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands and France. It is the biggest producer of own-label nappy products for retailers in Europe. The cost of the battle has raised a question mark over SCA's readiness to continue to take on the US groups.</p>

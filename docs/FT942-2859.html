			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Number of water complaints 'steady' Complaints from water customers failed to show an increase last year for the first time since the industry's privatisation five years ago, Ofwat, the regulator, said yesterday. However Ofwat's annual report showed that a third of complaints continue to be about water bills. Since privatisation, bills have risen much faster than inflation to pay for modernisation and compliance with new environmental rules.</p>

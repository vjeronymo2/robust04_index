			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IS THERE LIFE AFTER TURKEY? TORNATORE PROVES THERE IS  </P> <P> Giuseppe Tornatore remembers his low point.  </P> <P> A film on which he had worked for years closed after a few days. Friends were  politely suggesting a career change.  </P> <P> "Instead of committing suicide, I wrote a new film," he said, laughing.  </P> <P> Two years after that dark period, the 34-year-old Tornatore is being hailed as  Italy's hottest new director in a decade.  </P> <P> The film that flopped in 1988, "Cinema Paradiso," went on to win him an Oscar  in 1990. And the movie written "in a moment of my life in which things were  bad" is being released in a moment in which things couldn't be better.  </P> <P> "Everything has gone so well," said the grinning, baby-faced director, his eyes  sparkling behind horn-rimmed glasses. "I'm sorry there was so much delay."  </P> <P> Two years after its dismal debut, "Cinema Paradiso" is alive and well in  Italian cinemas, and has drawn crowds in Europe, Japan and the United States.  </P> <P> Now, the question is whether Tornatore can succeed again, and prove himself an  heir to Federico Fellini, Bernardo Bertolucci and other great Italian  directors.  </P> <P> His new film, "Stanno Tutti Bene" (They're All Fine), has just been released in  Italy and is due to open in the United States in February.  </P> <P> It tells of an elderly man's journey through Italy to visit his five widely  scattered children, whom he wants to reunite for a dinner.  </P> <P> The father, played by Marcello Mastroianni, is chagrined to discover that his  children have drifted from him and have hidden their failures at work and in  marriage.  </P> <P> "I wanted to make a film about the difficulty there is today in personal  communication," Tornatore said.  </P> <P> While the film displays Tornatore's keen eye for the Italian character and for  day-to-day human comedy, it is more melancholy than "Cinema Paradiso," a  semiautobiographical tale of a child enraptured by the silver screen.  </P></p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Lafarge Coppee Several special factors may have helped protect Lafarge Coppee's half-year earnings, but its trading performance has proved surprisingly resilient nonetheless. Although the French construction market has fallen away sharply this year, Lafarge has contained the damage thanks to its cost cutting campaign and overseas expansion. The US recovery has helped offset the downturn in mainland Europe while other markets, such as eastern Germany and Brazil, have remained particularly perky. The French cement market is also proving more orderly than that in many other countries. While volumes have fallen sharply, prices have remained relatively firm. France is certainly better protected than the UK from cheap imports: its main population centres are located further from the coast making transportation costs prohibitive. Despite its sanguine trading statement, Lafarge cannot expect to evade the downturn indefinitely. This perhaps helps to explain why the company is now seeking to capitalise on its share price strength to raise FFr2.5bn in new capital. This will keep gearing within sensible limits and may subsequently enable Lafarge to pick off acquisitions. Many French companies may be keen to follow the example. With the Paris bourse touching new highs, companies must be tempted to raise equity finance before the privatisation deluge begins.</p>

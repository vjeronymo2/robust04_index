			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] JAKARTA, March 30 (AFP) -- Police here have freed  14 students who were involved in a demonstration calling for  justice in a 430 million dollar scam against a state bank, a  police official said Wednesday. Jakarta police spokesman  Lieutenant-Colonel Latief Rabar said the students were freed  late Tuesday after being questioned for several hours over their  involvement in a rally in front of the Supreme Advisory Council  (DPA) building earlier in the day. The students were among some  40 others involved in a rally against the banking scam, which  allegedly involved collusion between high officials and  businessmen.    Rabar said police confiscated 43 posters the students used  during the protest to back their calls for quick government  handling of the "Bapindo" case, so called because the  state-owned Bank Pembanungan Indonesia (Bapindo) provided what  turned out to be bad loans totalling 430 million dollars to an  ethnic Chinese businessman.

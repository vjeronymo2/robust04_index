			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Leading Article: Labour and the economy IF THE polls are to be believed, Neil Kinnock will soon be at the head either of a minority Labour government or of one with a paper-thin majority. Evidence suggests that investors are no more than modestly disturbed. Are they right to be so? Since the election campaign opened four weeks ago, the FT-SE index has fallen by some 120 points. This is a decline of only 5 per cent. Moreover, the valuation of corporate earnings remains quite high by the standards of recent years. Meanwhile, sterling has drifted down by just 3 pfennigs, from DM2.87 to DM2.843. This decline also seems small, but the lower bound for sterling within the ERM is now only a whisker away. If a new Labour government were to be tested by the exchange markets, it should act decisively. A substantial increase in short-term interest rates is likely to have a more powerful effect on credibility than a small one. For this reason - though not only for this reason  - Labour's claim that 'this election is a choice between a Conservative government paralysed by recession, and a Labour government determined to get on with building a recovery' is hollow. The flutters of sterling would only be the first of Labour's immediate problems. It would face two others. Labour is committed to a Pounds 2.9bn increase in taxation on the relatively better off in 1992-93. This shock may well worsen the current recession, by falling most heavily on those in the best position to enter into the needed increase in borrowing. A hung parliament might help Labour to avoid this mistake. Second danger At the same time, a hung parliament is likely to exacerbate the second danger. Labour's manifesto is a paean to the glories of increased public spending, but the UK's public accounts are in no state to tolerate such indulgence. Come what may, Labour must remain resolute in its determination to spend no more than the very little extra that the country can now afford. The near term may be difficult. But what of Labour's capacity to generate a more rapid recovery than the Conservatives over the next several years? Like the Conservatives, it is at the mercy of developments abroad. It could try to influence pay bargaining, but its proposals can only make a modest difference. Otherwise, the best it can do is to make its commitment to the ERM as credible as possible. The best way to do this would be to make the Bank of England operationally independent. Mr John Smith should realise that, within the ERM, government control of monetary policy will be seen by investors as offering freedom only to depreciate. The result of the government control he wishes to retain can only be higher interest rates than are necessary. Real choice If the chances of medium-term recovery are no greater under Labour than under the Conservatives, economic prospects will depend on Labour's longer-term effects on the supply side. Here, at last, is a real choice: one between the market on the one hand, and a 'partnership' between government and industry on the other. Labour stresses market failure: too little investment; too little research and development; too little training; too little manufacturing; too many take-overs; too low wages; too uneven a regional development; and too little infrastructure. The answers are predictable: a pinch of coercion here; more public spending there; and a soupcon of guidance over there. Neither in all its analysis nor in all its recommendations is Labour wrong. Yet it talks the language of the market as if it were a foreign tongue. Can Labour in office learn to talk the language of markets more fluently? Can it even realise how helpful greater reliance on markets and competition could often be to its cause? In macroeconomic policy, Labour appears to be as bound by its commitment to the ERM as are the Conservatives. In the short term, the costs of proving that commitment are likely to be appreciable. In recompense, Labour promises that its more active approach to government will undo the coils now restraining British economic growth. The promise is appealing; its results are likely to be disappointing.</p>

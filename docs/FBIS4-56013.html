			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] We have decided to quit the Green Party in  Slovakia because we could no longer in silence carry before the  public joint responsibility for the direction the party was  taking -- the party's open support for the Party of the  Democratic Left [SDL]. This was stated at a news conference  held today by Jaroslav (Cantos), a member of the preparatory  committee of the Slovak Green Party, when he talked about the  formation of this new political entity in Slovakia. Our  reporter Otto Goerner has more details.    [Goerner] The preparatory committee of the Slovak Green  Party  has issued a statement in regard to this step which says, among  other things, that for the reasons given above, as well as due  to certain differences of views on the approach to tackling  certain environmental issues, they have decided to form a new  party. They also see in this a new alternative for those voters  who want to support green philosophy but who at the same time  find it unacceptable to give their votes to the SDL. The new  party also provides an opportunity for those members who had  decided to quit the party following the formation of the  coalition with the SDL. The necessary one thousand signatures  that are required for the party to be registered at the Interior  Ministery had been collected last week and the party has lodged  an application at the Interior Ministry. [passage omitted]    In the coming parliamentary elections the new Slovak Green  Party wants to appeal primarily to the parties of the national  block. The new party will in no case however refuse to  cooperate in technical matters with the other Green Party.</p>

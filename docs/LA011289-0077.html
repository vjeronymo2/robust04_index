			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> THEATER CHAINS INVITED TO SUBMIT PROPOSALS  </P> <P> Saying there are plenty of Long Beach residents who would flock to a downtown  movie theater complex -- if one existed -- the local Redevelopment Agency is  asking major theater operators to submit proposals for an 8- to 14-screen  cinema complex. It would be constructed within a redevelopment area bounded by  1st and 3rd streets, Pacific Avenue and Long Beach Boulevard on land that the  agency would sell to the operator.  </P> <P> Many of the city's old theaters have closed or been demolished over the years,  leaving a dearth of movie theaters in most parts of Long Beach. The city's only  two major complexes are both located in the southeast corner, on Pacific Coast  Highway.  </P> <P> Redevelopment officials say a number of major theater operators are convinced  there is a strong local market to support a downtown complex as large as 14  screens. The city has long envisioned theaters as an important piece of the  downtown redevelopment picture.  </P></p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Disclosure rules for MPs need tightening, says report MEMBERS of Parliament should be forced to disclose much more information about their business dealings as part of a tightening of the rules for registering financial interests, an all-party House of Commons committee says. The committee's tough report, published yesterday, proposes that MPs should set out the nature of the business conducted by companies of which they are directors. They should give more details about any consultancies they hold, including the names of clients with which they are personally involved. They should also declare their membership of specific Lloyd's of London insurance syndicates. MPs would be required to declare relevant interests if they were leading sponsors of a parliamentary expression of opinion in the form of an early day motion. Shareholdings with a nominal value of Pounds 25,000 or more would need to be registered, as well as those amounting to 1 per cent of a company's value. There would also be stricter regulation of gifts, travel and benefits, with requirements to register acceptance of these extending to MPs' staff. The proposals follow a review of the rules prompted by a debate in February 1990, in which the Commons upheld complaints against Mr John Browne, former Tory MP for Winchester. In the last parliament, MPs' links with Lloyd's, the insurance market, were highlighted when MPs were in the forefront of those pressing the government to investigate allegations of malpractice by market insiders. About 40 MPs registered as members of Lloyd's, although it is only the new requirement that would make this compulsory. The committee agreed that, when an MP resigns from Lloyd's, the entry should remain in the register until all outstanding obligations have been met and benefits realised. 'We also believe that membership of individual Lloyd's syndicates can be of considerable significance,' the report says. The paper, finalised at the end of the last parliament, is the third from the committee awaiting debate by MPs. There is likely to be some delay before it can be discussed but it would be difficult for MPs to reject it as too Draconian. The rule on giving details of syndicates was proposed by Mr Bob Cryer, and supported by fellow Labour committee members. Two Tory members, Mr Peter Viggers and Mr Robert Adley, declared their interests as mem-bers of Lloyd's and did not vote.</p>

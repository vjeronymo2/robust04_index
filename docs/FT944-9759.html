			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Telmex volatility upsets Mexico Shares in Telmex, one of Latin America's most traded stocks, went on a roller coaster ride last week. And, as usual, took the Mexican market with it, writes Ted Bardacke from Mexico City. On news that AT&amp;T would join Grupo Alfa, the industrial conglomerate, to offer telecommunications services when the Mexican market is opened up to competition in 1997, Telmex ADRs fell more than 10 per cent over a two-day period before recovering nearly half that amount in Friday's trading session to close at Dollars 53. The Mexican IPC index declined 2.12 per cent on the week after falling 4.83 per cent on Thursday. Although both Telmex and the market knew that serious competition was coming, there had always been an assumption that AT&amp;T would go with Telmex, dominating the rapidly growing Mexican market for years to come. Last week's tumble was a correction resulting from those dashed expectations, brokers said. Future fluctuations of will be dependent on three main factors: how much protection Telmex receives from the Mexican government when it makes its announcement of new telecommunications regulations; a detailed examination of its preparations for competition in light of those regulations and AT&amp;T's recent decision and potential exchange rate losses, should the peso be devalued. By the end of trading on Friday, there appeared to be a consensus that the price of Telmex ADRs in New York would settle in the Dollars 50 to Dollars 55 range, slightly lower than the Dollars 55 to Dollars 60 range it had been trading in prior to AT&amp;T's announcement.</p>

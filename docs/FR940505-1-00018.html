(VW) to amend Standard No. 105 by reducing the required height for lettering on antilock brake failure indicator lights. VW wants the reduction to facilitate its efforts to develop a single indicator light design that complies with both U.S. and Canadian requirements. Standard 105 provides that if a separate indicator light is provided for antilock brake failure, the indicator must bear one of the following: ``Antilock,'' ``Anti-lock'' or ``ABS.'' Canada requires use of the ISO brake failure symbol. VW's single design would consist of the letters ``ABS'' placed inside the ISO symbol. A letter size reduction would enable VW to avoid having to use what it regards as an overly large ISO symbol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA is denying this petition for two reasons. First, NHTSA believes that reducing the minimum letter height would make it impossible for many drivers, particularly elderly ones, to read the words and thus discern when there is a brake system failure. Second, the agency is not convinced that the international symbol, by itself, is sufficiently recognizable to be understood as an indication of brake failure by persons unfamiliar with that symbol.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Mr. Larry Cook, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590, (202) 366&hyph;4803. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) 101 and 105, promulgated in 1978 and 1976, respectively, establish requirements for vehicle panel displays, including indicators warning of brake failure. The two FMVSS's prescribe the wording of the failure warning displays, as well as their dimensions and colors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> S5.3.5(a) of FMVSS 105 (Hydraulic Brake Systems) requires that each indicator lamp shall have letters which are not less than 1/8-inch high, and which must be visible and legible to a vehicle's driver in daylight. In the case of brake warning displays, FMVSS 105 prescribes that the word ``Brake'' be used. (S5.3.5(c)(1)). If a separate indicator lamp is provided for an anti-lock brake system (ABS), the word ``Antilock,'' ``Anti-lock'' or the abbreviation ``ABS'' must be used (S5.3.5(c)(1)(C)). Table 2 of FMVSS 101 (Controls and Displays), echoes FMVSS 105, permitting use of the words ``antilock,'' ``anti-lock'' or ``ABS.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 6, 1993, Volkswagen of America, Inc. (VW) petitioned the agency to modify FMVSS 105 to require the letters in the word or acronym on the ABS warning indicator to have a minimum height of 2.4 mm (3/32-inch) instead of the current 1/8 inch (3.2 mm). VW apparently desires the reduction to facilitate its efforts to develop a single dashboard indicator light design that complies with both U.S. and Canadian requirements. VW stated that Transport Canada had amended Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (CMVSS) 101 to require use of the ISO symbol for brake failure. CMVSS 101 requires the ISO symbol to be at least 1/8-inch high. The amendment to CMVSS 101 becomes effective on September 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VW's single design would consist of the letters ``ABS'' placed inside the ISO symbol. VW wants the letter size reduction in order to avoid having to use what it regards as an overly large ISO symbol. It states that in order to put the currently required 1/8-inch high letters inside the ISO symbol, the latter would have to be 10.18 mm (2/5 inch). VW states that such a size would be three times larger than required for all other warning indicators. In the alternative, a manufacturer would need two different designs: One for installation in vehicles sold in Canada, and one for installation in vehicles sold in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VW requested the agency to reduce the required minimum dimensions for ``ABS,'' when used inside the ISO brake failure symbol, from 3.2 mm (1/8-inch) high to 2.4 mm (3/32-inch) high. It admitted that letters inside the symbol would be ``extremely small.'' VW suggested that an ISO symbol 7 mm (1/4-inch) high could accommodate letters 2.2 mm (0.0866 inches) high. VW did not state how much larger the ISO symbol would have to be to include letters 2.4 mm high, as requested in its petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

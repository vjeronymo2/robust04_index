			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 15 Mar (XINHUA) -- Delegations attending  the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress  [NPC] continued their group meetings today to examine and  discuss Premier Li Peng's government work report. Based on  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the realities of China's reform and  development, deputies pointed out the need to unswervingly  uphold the policy of promoting material and spiritual progress  at the same time and attaching equal importance to both in the  entire process of reform, opening up, and modernization, and to  strengthen in a concrete way the building of socialist spiritual  civilization, regarding it as a common task for all fronts and  departments.    Some leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee, the NPC  Standing Committee, and the State Council took part in various  delegations' discussions of state affairs and listened to fellow  deputies' views and suggestions. Li Tieying, member of the CPC  Central Committee Political Bureau and state councillor, took  part in the Tianjin delegation's discussion, focusing on the  question of building a modern enterprise system for state-owned  enterprises. He said: In reforming the system of property  rights, state-owned enterprises must concentrate on three areas:  1) building a new system to monitor, control, and manage  state-owned assets; 2) establishing the rights of enterprises,  as legal persons, to own properties and perfecting the system  for enterprises to act as legal persons; and 3) establishing and  perfecting the leadership and organizational structures of  modern enterprises. He stressed: In the course of establishing  a modern enterprise system, we must handle well relations  between enterprises on the one hand and government, society, the  market, and the owners on the other and between the leadership  apparatus of an enterprise and its workers. We must make  theoretical inquiry into this issue, and more importantly, we  must probe it in practice and review and popularize what has  been gained in practice. During his discussion with the Ningxia  delegation, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua said: No matter how  enterprises develop in form, the character of state-owned  enterprises must not change. We must take steps to preserve and  increase the value of state assets; we must not let it decline  or disappear.    Taking part in the Jiangxi delegation's examination and  discussion, Vice Premier Li Lanqing expressed his views on  reforming and develop education. He said: Education is of  vital importance to the development of the national economy.  The fundamental solution for education is reform. In carrying  out education reform, we must first adjust the macroeducation  structure, concentrating our resources on basic education.  Without a successful basic education, higher education will end  up as "castles in the air." Second, we must not impose  uniformity in promoting the nine-year compulsory education. We  must not demand uniform education, ignoring differences between  urban and rural areas and between developed and underdeveloped  areas. Third, we must step up reform with the goal to improve  education standards and increase the beneficial results of  higher education. Fourth, we must strengthen moral education  and conduct education in patriotism and collectivism to bring up  morally, intellectually, and physically developed people.    Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau, took part in the Sichuan delegation's  discussions. Councillor Chen Junsheng attended the Guangdong and  Guangzhou delegation's discussions; and State Councillor Ismail  Amat participated in the Qinghai delegation's discussion. Each  expressed his views on agricultural issues and on the question  of developing the economy in nationality areas.    Wen Jiabao said: Agriculture affects the country's overall  interests. At present we must carry out three major tasks:  First, we must stabilize and increase grain and cotton outputs  and make the "vegetable basket" project successful. Second, we  must make continuous efforts to increase peasants' income.  After stabilizing grain and cotton production, we must make  vigorous efforts to diversify operations and develop secondary  and tertiary industries. Third, we must safeguard stability in  rural society. We must stabilize and perfect the party's  various basic rural policies, successfully guide and protect the  peasants' initiatives, and vigorously implement the various  measures to perform concrete services for the peasants.    Speaking of the work of helping poor people, Chen Junsheng  said: We must establish models who lifted themselves out of  poverty and became well-off and give wide publicity to  representative figures who shook off poverty and set out on the  road to prosperity through self-reliance, hard struggle, thrift,  and diligence. We must rely on advanced models to lead the  march and overcome the mentality of waiting for, depending on,  and demanding state preferential policies for relief. Chen  Junsheng also urged Guangdong to make determined efforts to  maintain the area of its grain crops, increase grain output, and  work hard to raise the level of self-sufficiency in grain supply.    Ismail Amat said: For Qinghai to accelerate economic  development, first the state should provide it with the support  it needs; second, developed regions should provide it with  assistance; and third, Qinghai should double its own efforts,  which is the most crucial of the three.    During her participation in the Shanghai delegation's  discussion, State Councillor Peng Peiyun briefed the deputies on  China's current family planning work. State Councillors Chi  Haotian and Song Jian took part in the discussions of the  Guangxi and Liaoning delegations, respectively.    In their discussion of the policy of doing two types of work  at the same time and attaching equal importance to both,  deputies pointed out that strengthening the building of  socialist spiritual civilization is an important component of  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics  and an objective requirement for accelerating reform and  develop. Gu Changchun, a deputy from Liaoning, said: Premier  Li Peng's government work report gives prominence to the  thinking of doing two types of work at the same time and  attaching equal importance to both in the process of building a  socialist market economic structure and the thinking of taking  the road of developing the economy and culture simultaneously.  In setting forth this year's economic construction and  development tasks, the report also stresses the building of  socialist spiritual civilization and the development of science  and technology, education, and culture. These ideas of  all-around social development conform with the trend of  development of human society and the reality of Chinese society.  Only by acting in accordance with these ideas and relying  wholeheartedly on the broad masses of people can we ensure  successful implementation of this year's reform measures.    In the discussions, deputies representing the People's  Liberation Army said: To develop a socialist market economy, it  is essential that we make vigorous efforts to strengthen the  building of socialist spiritual civilization. The practice of  reform and opening up has proved that a society's spiritual  civilization will not automatically advance once the economy  develops. Relentless and concrete efforts must be made to build  spiritual civilization. We must answer the CPC Central  Committee's call to deepen activities to learn from Xu Honggang,  foster the Lei Feng spirit of the new period, and vigorously  combat corruption and promote honest government. Leading cadres  at all levels must set themselves as an example; start from  themselves in maintaining integrity and exercising  self-discipline; establish a good image in promoting clean,  efficient government; and earnestly and comprehensively tackle  problems of public order to create a good social and cultural  environment for the speedy establishment of a socialist market  economic structure.    Pointing out Shanghai's reality, Wu Bangguo, a Shanghai  deputy, pointed out that to ensure Shanghai's economic  development, its social ethics and public order must not weaken.  We must follow Comrade Xiaoping's instruction and turn in a  satisfactory report card in both material and spiritual  civilization to the central authorities and Shanghai's people.  We must carry out a good education in patriotism, collectivism,  and socialism and advocate and foster the pioneering spirit  proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin to bring up a new generation of  better-educated people with idealism and a strong sense of  discipline.</p>

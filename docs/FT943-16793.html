			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: VideoLogic floats with Pounds 61.5m tag Shares in VideoLogic were priced at 45p yesterday, valuing the Hertfordshire-based multimedia company - which is being demerged from its parent Avesco - at Pounds 61.5m. This is significantly less than the Pounds 70m to Pounds 84m that had been expected. When the flotation plans were announced early last month SG Warburg, VideoLogic's adviser, had hoped that shares issued by way of a placing and offer in conjunction with the demerger would be priced at between 55p and 70p. However, the issue price had to be scaled back because of the turmoil in the equity market and the reluctance of institutional investors to pay a higher price during Warburg's book-building. Avesco's shares closed 10p lower at 59p yesterday. Under the terms of the demerger, Avesco shareholders will receive one VideoLogic share for each Avesco share they currently own. Avesco shareholders were also given a preferential opportunity to participate in the placing and offer, which was underwritten by Warburg, and applied for about 23.5m shares - or 49.2 per cent of the 47.8m shares available. The remaining shares were yesterday placed with institutional and other investors. The placing was designed to raise Pounds 21.5m of new money before expenses to help fund VideoLogic's future research and development programme. Mr Derek Maclaren, VideoLogic chairman, and Mr Anthony Maclaren, managing director, are entitled to a Pounds 1.6m bonus from Avesco on demerger. They have agreed to invest the bulk of the sum in VideoLogic shares, after deducting Pounds 250,000 each and making an allowance for tax. Following the subscription, VideoLogic's chairman and chief executive will respectively hold a 1.1 per cent and 1.2 per cent stake in the demerged company, which will have a total of about 136.7m shares. Dealings in the new shares are expected to begin on July 6.</p>

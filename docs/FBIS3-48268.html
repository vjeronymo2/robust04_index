			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Australia's annual inflation rate has fallen below  2 percent to the surprise of many economists and the federal  government. Belinda Trump reports that the latest consumer  price index data shows the cost of living rose just 1.9 percent  in the year to December.    [Begin Trump recording] During the December quarter, the  cost of living rose 0.2 of 1 percent. This brings the annual  rate down from 2.2 to 1.9 percent -- well below the federal  government's 3 percent forecast for the financial year and below  many market predictions. Contributing to today's figures were  falling mortgage interests and consumer credit charges. These  were offset by rises in cigarettes, petrol, fruit and vegetable  prices, local government charges, and the cost of overseas  travel and accommodation.    Of the capital cities, Hobart has the highest cost of living  increase with a yearly inflation rate of 3.3 percent. Sydney  has the lowest with an annual rate of 1.3 percent.    The federal treasurer, Ralph Willis, says today's  encouraging  inflation figures have put to rest, at least for the time being,  any increase in interest rates. Mr. Willis says economists  predicting interest rate increases later in the year will have  to rethink their forecasts.    The treasurer says the annual inflation result of 1.9  percent  for the year to December will also result in an upward revision  of economic growth forecasts. Mr. Willis says he will soon  announce how far the growth prediction will rise beyond the 3  percent rate set out in the budget. [end recording]</p>

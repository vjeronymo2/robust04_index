			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Mobil signs 15-year PowerGen gas deal MOBIL HAS signed a deal with PowerGen to provide the UK electricity generator with gas for the next 15 years. The deal comes after last month's announcement by British Gas that it would raise its prices to power stations for new gas purchases by 35 per cent, arousing fears that many planned stations would be left without gas. It will be viewed as a welcome sign that more competition is developing in the industrial gas market previously dominated by British Gas. Mobil will provide PowerGen with 100m cu ft of gas a day from the end of 1993 as part of a 15-year contract that will start to tail off after 10 years. While the company would not indicate the price of gas included in the deal, it is understood to be at a level between British Gas's existing price schedule for power generators and its new 35 per cent higher rate for new users. Meanwhile PowerGen announced yesterday that it had awarded the Pounds 290m contract to build its 680MW power station at Rye House, Hertfordshire, to Siemens, the electronic and electrical equipment supplier. Rye House will be a modern gas-fired station like Killingholme, PowerGen's large new plant on Humberside, which is also being built by Siemens. Rye House is due to become operational in 1994. Replacing coal-fired stations with such new gas stations is a significant plank of PowerGen's strategy, Mr Ed Wallis, the company's commercial director, said. In another development, Rugby Power, a partnership between East Midlands Electricity Generation and Trafalgar House Corporate Development, is withdrawing plans for a 380MW gas-fired power station near Rugby after local people objected to the scheme. Rugby Power now plans to revise and resubmit its application taking into account the objections.</p>

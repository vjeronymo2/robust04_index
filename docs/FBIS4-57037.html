			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Walter Lima from the Southern </F> Autarky Block in Brasilia -- live]    [Text] The Army continues barricading the Federal Police  headquarters in Brasilia. The atmosphere here in the Southern  Autarky Block, next to the Federal Police headquarters building,  is getting tense because Federal Police personnel are starting  to arrive and are finding that about 1,000 military troops have  been occupying the area since 0100.    Until now the only incident that has been reported occurred  at about 0300, when a car carrying two men tried to break  through one of the barricades and shooting ensued.    Vehicle traffic is under the control of the military police  and traffic department inspectors. This is also the case near  the Federal Police Regional Superintendency in the Southern  Police Sector. Security personnel at the Justice Ministry  building on the Ministries Esplanade have been reinforced by  military personnel.    Federal Police personnel are now starting to arrive at the  Southern Autarky Block. They are driving through, looking  around and going to their respective blocks.    German shepherds and soldiers armed with rifles, machine  guns, and tear gas are strategically located. Those who want to  enter the Federal Police building to work must identify  themselves before entering the building which is completely  surrounded by Army troops.</p>

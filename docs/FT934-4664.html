			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistan set for another disappointing cotton crop Pakistan's cotton output will be at least 15 per cent below target this year. 'We will not be able to achieve our targets and we may stay in the range of 10m bales,' said Mr Chaudhary Ahmed Mukhtar, the minister of state for commerce. That would represent a shortfall of 2m bales. Pakistan had expected a bumper cotton crop of over 12m bales, but large losses were caused by inadequate rainfall and a subsequent pest attack in the province of Punjab. Last year the crop was 3m bales below target because of widespread floods. Mr Mukhtar was still hopeful, however, that some of the production loss would be compensated by higher international prices . Pakistan expects that its leading cotton market competitors, such and India and China, will also face short-falls because of crop damage.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Easter rain brings spring cheer for estate agents AS BRITAIN'S housing market shows strong signs of a recovery, estate agents are hoping the Easter weekend - traditionally the beginning of the busiest period of the year for house sales - will be their most profitable for years. Sales over the next few weeks will determine whether the revival will last or peter out as in previous springs. Estate agents' offices and show houses are likely to be open throughout the holiday weekend. Though the heaviest business normally begins on Easter Saturday, the signs yesterday in the area hardest hit - the south east - were good. Pocock &amp; Shaw, a Cambridge estate agency, said: 'We had expected Good Friday to be rather quiet; instead we have been frantically busy. 'The wet weather may have helped us in that people, instead of going for a day out, have been coming in to ask about properties. We have seen between 50 and 60 people.' Mr Henry Rowe, an estate agent in Saffron Walden, Essex, said the holiday had got off to an encouraging start. Mr Kevin Moll, Mr Rowe's partner, said: 'We have sold 70 homes since the beginning of this year, about a quarter more than during the first three months of last year. We are currently averaging about 20 sales a month. In two days last weekend we had 15 offers to buy. 'There have been periods over the past four years when sales have been at this level but we have not had such a sustained recovery as we have seen this year.' Mr Jonathan Harvey, director of Friend &amp; Falcke, which sells in London's Chelsea, Knightsbridge and Belgravia, said: 'Sales are up about 60 per cent on the first three months of last year. 'A lot of these are to foreign buyers taking advantage of sterling's devaluation. Purchases by Britons, however, are still up by 15 per cent to 20 per cent on the same period last year.' Their experience has been shared by estate agents, housebuilders and building societies in other parts of the country. Sales figures for 15 of the country's largest national housebuilders show offers to buy new homes have risen by approaching a third during the first 13 weeks of this year. This includes sales to housing associations. Sales to private sector buyers are estimated by builders to have risen by between a fifth and a quarter. The weekly figures, compiled by the Housebuilders Federation, measure net reservations - sales on which a deposit has been paid less cancellations. Net reservations for the 15 housebuilders, representing about 20 per cent of the new housing market, totalled 5,000 in January and February, compared with 4,200 in the first two months of last year. This trend continued in March in spite of a slight slowdown in the week before the Budget. Mr David Holland, chief executive of Wimpey Homes, the country's second largest housebuilder, said: 'We have had an excellent start to the year which we now hope to build upon. Prices have stopped falling. The next stage will be to start withdrawing sales incentives such as discounts, cheap mortgages and removal expenses. This is starting to happen in a few areas. 'Provided the recent revival is sustained we might even see prices starting to rise again by the end of this year.'

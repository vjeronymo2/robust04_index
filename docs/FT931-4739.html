			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Canadian utility axes 4,500 jobs ONTARIO HYDRO, one of North America's biggest utilities, is cutting staff by a further 4,500, bringing planned reductions since late last year to 6,000, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. This is part of the utility's restructuring to deal with a debt crisis and a 30 per cent increase in power rates over the past three years. Total payroll will decline to 23,000 mainly through attrition and early retirement, said Mr Maurice Strong, the chairman. Negotiations will begin soon with the unions. A programme to re-tube the Bruce A nuclear reactors, at a cost of nearly CDollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn), is being deferred indefinitely and a Bruce heavy water plant will close in 1994. About CDollars 10bn is to be cut from the utility's CDollars 30bn 10-year capital spending programme.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Basin active as caution rules in Japan CAUTIOUSNESS prevailed ahead of today's futures and options expiry, and share prices fluctuated within a narrow range in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 33.82 to 17,709.05 after a high of 17,885.69 and a low of 17,648.94. Volume fell to 230m shares from 270m. Advances led declines by 461 to 444 with 192 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 1.70 to 1,345.54 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.28 to 1056.87. According to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, arbitrage cash positions against the June futures fell for four consecutive weeks to Y379bn as of Wednesday. The amount is significantly lower than the position of Y640bn held against March contracts a week before expiry, and most market participants were optimistic about the unwinding process. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said: 'Even if the index declines, it will only be temporary, since institutions have indicated interest in buying at cheaper levels.' However, some traders maintained a cautious stance. 'Although the balance of cash positions has become small, unwinding amid the low liquidity on the cash market could cause ugly results,' said Mr Steve Claussen at SBCI Securities. Some institutional investors joined short-term trading of speculative theme stocks by dealers. Meiji Milk Products, the most active issue of the day, rose Y26 to Y1,020 and Morinaga Milk advanced Y36 to the year's high of Y904. Environmental stocks were also higher, with Chiyoda, the plant engineer, up Y70 to Y1,900 and Japan Storage Battery advancing Y50 to Y1,130. Nippon Formula Feed, the livestock feedstuff manufacturer, rose Y50 to Y1,130. Nippon Express, the parcel delivery company, rose Y17 to Y734 on buying by foreign investors. Nippon Express posted a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the last fiscal year, and expects a modest rise in profits this year. Banking issues were lower, with trust banks posting sharp falls. Trust banks face deteriorating loan portfolios and a decline in margin fees due to the fall in the stock and real estate markets. Moody's Investment Service, the US credit agency, this week lowered debt ratings of four of the seven trust banks. Mitsui Trust and Banking fell Y28 to a year's low of Y740, while Mitsubishi Trust and Banking fell Y21 to Y888. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 57.89 to 20,541.80 in volume of 14.9m shares. Roundup SINGAPORE, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta were all closed for public holidays yesterday, while Bombay closed its doors again to facilitate settlement work. BANGKOK soared in heavy turnover of Bt11.6bn, the SET index gaining 49.85, or 7.3 per cent to 737.23 on the reappointment of Anand Panyarachun as prime minister, with many shares closing up at their 10 per cent ceiling limits. MANILA stayed strong on the sentiment which has lifted the composite index to new highs, the latest yesterday, since last month's presidential election. The composite index rose 7.61 to 1,580.95 ahead of today's Independence Day holiday. SEOUL extended Wednesday's minor rebound from Tuesday's 1992 low, the composite index closing 7.63 higher at 570.50 in volume up from Won207bn to Won270bn. Share prices were lifted by technical factors and improved sentiment. Senior markets were less sanguine, HONG KONG closing sharply lower on weakness on Wall Street, and profit-taking, while AUSTRALIA hit its lowest close for six weeks, with banks leading the way down. Renewed weakness in HSBC, parent of the Hongkong Bank, dragged down the Hang Seng index which closed 90.96 lower at 5,826.54. Rumours of possible rights issues by Cheung Kong or affiliate Hutchison Whampoa also hit the market. HSBC fell HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 44.25, Cheung Kong by 30 cents to HKDollars 25.50 and Hutchison by 40 cents to HKDollars 18.60. Australian brokers said that dividend stripping of banking stocks boosted volumes to a total of 127.2m shares worth ADollars 397.8m. The banking sector fell 34.6, or 1.65 per cent to 2,058.3.</p>

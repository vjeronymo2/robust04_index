			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Filipinos demonstrate against birth control Hundreds of thousands of Filipinos (left) demonstrated yesterday against a 'deluge' of contraceptives in the Third World, Reuter reports from Manila. The demonstrators, staging one of Manila's biggest protests since President Ferdinand Marcos was ousted in 1986, gathered in response to a Roman Catholic church call to oppose a government campaign to cut the country's high population growth. Cardinal Jaime Sin and former president Corazon Aquino led the protest by burning sex magazines and a copy of a document expected to be presented at next month's international meeting on population in Cairo which the church said would promote contraception and abortion. The Manila rally was a key part of the church's campaign to force the government to retreat from its stance on birth control before the Cairo conference. Cardinal Sin accused a 'global dictatorship' of swamping the Philippines and other developing countries with a 'deluge of contraceptive drugs and instruments'. Much of his anger was directed at President Fidel Ramos's government, which has taken on the church in Asia's only Christian-majority nation by refusing to back down on its campaign to promote population control. The government, which has repeatedly rejected church accusations that it favours abortion, tried to defuse the confrontation by urging people to take part in the rally. But Mr Ramos, the nation's first Protestant president, strongly supports giving Filipinos the chance to limit their families by using contraceptives. The Philippines has one of the highest population growth rates in the region at 2.4 per cent a year.</p>

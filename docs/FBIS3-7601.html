It was the 21st  straight month of falling sales at department stores and  supermarket chains, the ministry said in a preliminary report.    The stagnant performance reflected continuing price  consciousness among Japanese consumers, the ministry said.    Sales at 419 department stores across the nation dropped 4.4  percent to 723.0 billion yen, for the 24th running month of  declines from year-earlier levels, it said. Sales at 2,059  supermarket chains edged down 1.0 percent to 729.4 billion yen,  marking the 19th straight month of drops.    The 2.8 percent sales fall in February compares with a 2.5  percent drop registered in January.</p>

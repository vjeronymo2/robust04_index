"None of the parties with the possibility of winning have  attained the percentage demanded by law to secure victory.  Therefore, all tendencies lead to the possibility of a runoff  election. The TSE already has a budget earmarked for this, and  as of this very moment we are making preparations for the  event," the official added.    With regard to the problems or shortcomings charged by some  of the political parties, he said that these can be overcome in  the new election and that the TSE is willing to correct the  errors that could have been committed at voting time.  Nevertheless, he emphasized that the noted problems do not have  serious repercussions on the final results of the election and  that these are normal in any activity of this nature.    With 73 percent of the votes counted, Armando Calderon Sol  garnered 49 percent; Ruben Zamora of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front]-Convergence-MNR [National  Revolutionary Movement] coalition received 26 percent; and Fidel  Chavez of the PDC [Christian Democratic Party] received 14  percent.    "The preliminary results clearly indicate that the tendency  is in favor of Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance]. It has  been made clear that we continue being the choice of the  Salvadoran people," said Calderon Sol.    To win in the first round for the Presidency, 50 percent  plus  one vote is required. Whoever is elected will replace President  Alfredo Cristiani on 1 June for a five-year period.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Multinational partnership in London - Legal Briefs Coudert Brothers, the world's oldest international law firm, will this week formally celebrate the creation of what is arguably the UK's first fully- fledged multinational law firm. Its birth has been a difficult one. Coudert has been operating in London as a US law firm since 1960 and in March 1990 joined forces with English solicitors Beharrell Thompson &amp; Co, a firm specially created in anticipation of a relaxation in the English rules preventing solicitors joining in multinational partnerships. The three-year delay in incorporating Beharrell Thompson into the Coudert fold was caused by initial difficulty posed by Law Society rules requiring registration of foreign partners, and because of negotiations between the US Internal Revenue Service and the UK's Inland Revenue on taxation of partners' earnings. Coudert's London office has 24 lawyers - 20 solicitors, three US attorneys and one dual US/English qualified lawyer. The intention is to register 21 or 22 of Coudert's 130 partners as partners of the London office. The London partnership expects to expand to 40 lawyers by the end of 1994.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Deadline will be met say officials Trade diplomats yesterday moved to squash concerns that the complex and time-consuming tariff negotiations in the Uruguay Round of trade talks could not be completed by tomorrow's deadline. 'We will have completed the substantive market access negotiations by Wednesday,' said a senior trade official. 'What's on the table then will be final and cannot be withdrawn.' European Union negotiators caused consternation late last week when they said they might be able to conclude item-by-item tariff bargaining with just 15-20 countries, representing about 90 per cent of world trade. On Sunday the EU had definitively signed off on just one tariff accord - with Peru. However, with the Uruguay Round rules package largely sewn up late on Sunday, trade officials have been meeting round the clock to finalise deals with trading partners covering thousands of farm and industrial products. Intensive negotiations have also been taking place on opening markets for services. Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, said yesterday that tariff offers could not be reduced but could be improved after December 15. 'That process will be one of verification and augmentation,' he said. Diplomats said it was not necessary for all 115 participants in the round to bargain with each other. The biggest 20 to 30 nations will settle on tariffs and then offer the same deal to others. Smaller countries will be putting in tariff schedules based on their understanding of the deal on offer as it concerns them. Least developed countries have been given extra time beyond tomorrow's deadline to prepare schedules.</p>

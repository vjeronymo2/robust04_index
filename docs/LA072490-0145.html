			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BECKMAN RESULTS SHOW 25% DECLINE;  </P> <P> EARNINGS: THE COMPANY ATTRIBUTED A POOR SECOND QUARTER TO INCREASED SPENDING  FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND A DROP IN FEDERAL RESEARCH GRANTS.  </P> <P> Reflecting increased spending for new product development and a decline in  federal grants for medical research, Beckman Instruments' second-quarter  earnings fell 25%, to $8.6 million from $11.4 million a year earlier, the  company said Monday.  </P> <P> The Fullerton-based manufacturer of medical diagnostic and life science  research instruments has struggled with declining sales and earnings since  SmithKline Beckman Corp. spun off the unitas an independent public company in  July, 1989.  </P> <P> Sales for the second quarter ended June 30 rose 1% to $202.9 million, from  $200.5 million in the year-earlier period. Company executives said the sales  gain, though small, is a sign that the company may be emerging from its  problems.  </P> <P> "We think the worst is over," said Louis T. Rosso, Beckman's chief executive.  He noted that federal budget proposals call for increased spending for medical  research next year, which would translate into new orders for the equipment  that Beckman makes and sells.  </P> <P> "We don't expect there will be an explosive bounce-back of public funding,"  Rosso said. "It just will be better."  </P> <P> For the first six months of the year, Beckman's earnings were $16.6 million,  down from $22.1 million for the same period of 1989. Sales declined from $399.5  million to $388.4 million.  </P> <P> Not only have sales of scientific laboratory instruments suffered, but  Beckman's sales of diagnostic instruments have been hit by a trend among  financially strapped hospitals to lease costly medical equipment rather than  buy it.  </P> <P> Jay Steffenhagen, Beckman's investor relations manager, said that while lease  contracts are profitable and generate revenue over a number of years, they have  a short-term depressive effect on earnings.  </P> <P> The company said the second-quarter decline in profits was due primarily to  "strategic investment in new products," noting that the company's funding for  research and development in that quarter was $20.8 million, or 21% greater than  in the same period of 1989.  </P> <P> Rosso said the company is cutting back on investments in other business areas,  such as marketing and administration, to bolster spending on research in order  to develop products for the fast-developing biotechnology market. "We believe  the explosion in biological sciences augurs very well for this business over  the long term," he said.  </P> <P> Rosso also said that while domestic sales of equipment for the life sciences  market have been slumping, international sales of the same gear are on the  upswing.  </P> <P> Beckman stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, closed Monday at $16.75 a  share, down 50 cents from Friday's close.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BECKMAN INSTRUMENTS' PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> In the second quarter ended June 30, Beckman Instruments Inc. reported earnings  of $8.6 million, down 25% from $11.4 million. The company attributed the  declining profits to its increased spending on research and development and  reduced demand.

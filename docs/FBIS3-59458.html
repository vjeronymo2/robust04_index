			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris </F> Silajdzic to the extraordinary session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Government in Sarajevo on 24 Jan -- live]    [Text] [Silajdzic] I open the extraordinary session of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government on the critical situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, caused by the insufficient delivery of  humanitarian aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina. The situation has not  been more serious since the beginning of the aggression, and it  is threatening to turn into a veritable catastrophe. We need to  inform the international public and all the responsible factors  in the international community about the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We call for the international factors'  engagement in order to at least alleviate the consequences of  the policy conducted by the international community regarding  the organization and delivery of humanitarian aid to  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    At the 20 January meeting in Geneva, convened by the  European  Union, it was agreed that the international community would use  force if needed to secure the delivery of humanitarian aid to  all parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This conclusion was preceded  by the talks that we held in Geneva on 18 November with Mrs.  Ogata, and on 29 November 1993, a joint declaration regarding  the free passage of humanitarian convoys was signed by military  commanders. This declaration was based on an earlier agreement  reached with Mrs. Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees  [UNHCR].    Unfortunately, from that time until today, nothing has been  done to implement the European Union's decision, although it had  the support of all the other relevant international factors  worldwide, including the United States and Russia.  Unfortunately, for certain countries, this decision was just a  pretext for lifting sanctions from Serbia and these countries  invested all their efforts in this direction. The humanitarian  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina became steadily more difficult.  Convoys with humanitarian aid are experiencing increasing  difficulties in reaching certain parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  This situation began as far back as mid-October, with the UN  Secretary General's decision to suspend the delivery of  humanitarian aid to central Bosnia for a full month. To this  very day, we have not been able to recover from this break. At  the same time, this foreshadowed the grave humanitarian  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The international public was  [word indistinct], worried, they spoke about the imminent  winter, the catastrophe, however, nothing concrete was done to  prevent the present situation, which must be qualified as  dramatic.    The Bosnia-Herzegovina Government assesses that the reasons  for such a dramatic situation primarily lie in the systematic  and constant pressure applied to the sovereign, independent, and  internationally recognized state of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its  legitimate and legitimately elected authorities. The pressure  consists of making the legitimate authorities in  Bosnia-Herzegovina accept the aggressors' ultimatum, and  legalize genocide and aggression in its own country.    The international community has not consistently  implemented Chapter 7 of the UN Charter on the collective use of  force against an aggressor. It has not allowed the legal and  legitimate authorities to arm their people for the defense  against the aggression. That right, as we know, has been  envisaged by UN Charter Article 51. The Security Council, let  us remember, adopted over 30 resolutions on the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The only resolution it has implemented so  far is Resolution 713 that imposes an embargo on the import of  arms on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, which only  affects, as we know, Bosnia-Herzegovina.    We have been pointing out for some time that the system and  organization of the UNHCR in Bosnia-Herzegovina is illogical.  The UNHCR does not have its headquarters in Sarajevo but in  Zagreb, therefore in a country that is deeply involved in the  conflict with Bosnia-Herzegovina. The organization of the  logistic centers of the UNHCR does not conform with the state  organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the system of  information exchange between the government and the UNHCR is  inadequate, so we have grave difficulties in obtaining reliable  information.    We are particularly concerned about the structure of the  humanitarian aid delivered, which does not suit the needs of the  population. Most of the humanitarian aid consists of flour.  However, the population lacks a significant amount of foodstuffs  that it must have after 22 months of starvation -- considerable  amounts of sugar, fats, meat products, vitamins, clothes, and so  on.    As for the quantity of humanitarian aid -- [Refugees and  Social Welfare] Minister Smajkic will later give some more  detailed information on that -- I would only like to mention one  fact: A person on the territory under the control of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Government, that is, the legal authorities of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, received 2.89 kilos of food in December. I  repeat, on the territory under the control of the legal  authorities of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a person received 2.89, that  is, under three, kilos of food in December. A person on the  territory under the control of the Serb aggressor received 4.31  kilos of food, while a person on the territory controlled by the  HVO [Croatian Defense Council] received 9.61 kilos of food.  These are facts. Minister, you have to confirm this. What is  the source of this information? [Unidentified voice: UNHCR]. So  these are reports from the UNHCR.    On the other hand, over the last few months -- according to  the UNHCR reports -- convoys have been organized every day for  parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the Serb aggression, or for  western Herzegovina. The explanation for this is that these are  territories where there are no military operations. So, in  places where there are military operations the population is  punished in two ways -- they have the military operations, and  they do not get humanitarian aid.    The humanitarian aid is distributed to the entire population  in parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina that are occupied, regardless of  whether they are refugees or not. That is the case in Bijeljina  and Banja Luka, even though there has not been a single day of  fighting in either of the cities, and the population can, under  the circumstances, organize its own production of food.    In the context of the pressure that is being exerted on the  legal authorities of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the international  community has recently been exerting pressure by the mere  mention of withdrawing the UN forces from Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Everyone here has heard of the case of Tuzla airport. Futile  discussions have been held about that for months. The airport  in Tuzla is not being opened because the aggressor does not give  his approval. Therefore, the opening of the airport in Tuzla,  the opening of the corridors for humanitarian convoys, the  delivery of humanitarian aid in general, all this depends on the  aggressor's good will, and that has been the case for 22 months  now. That is the basic problem that we have with the  international community. The international community is not  prepared -- as they agreed in Geneva -- to use force against  everyone who obstructs humanitarian convoys.    Before ending, I would like to stress some positive things.  Where mostly needed, airdrops of certain amounts of food, the  necessary amounts of food, have been reaching the people of  Maglaj, Tesanj, Mostar, and elsewhere. That is an operation  carried out by the United States, Germany, and France. This is  a commendable move, but we cannot rely on airdrops, as these are  small quantities and the operations are too expensive and cannot  last long. So the question arises of land convoys. If there  are no land convoys, if we do not get the understanding of the  neighboring countries, particularly those where there are large  quantities of humanitarian aid, if these convoys do not head off  for Bosnia-Herzegovina and if their passage is not secured by  the UN forces, then the international community can expect a  humanitarian catastrophe in Bosnia-Herzegovina very soon.</p>

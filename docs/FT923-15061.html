			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Obligations at Lloyd's THE GOOD news for Lloyd's of London is that Sir David Walker says there was no fraud or conspiracy behind the worst losses at the insurance market. The bad news is the list of unedifying or unwise practices contained in his committee's report on the business in which those losses arose, the LMX reinsurance market. Some of those practices make one's hair stand on end. Inexperienced underwriters were writing reinsurance while in the dark about the risks further down the 'spiral' of contracts. Instead of dispersing risk, the LMX spiral served to concentrate it, but no one at Lloyd's seemed to worry. Though LMX business looked very profitable, enticing unwary Names into syndicates, it was persistently underpriced in view of the risks. The regulator's principal risk-monitoring tool, a limit on the premium income which Names can accept, exaggerates the impact of market swings rather than dampens them. To the extent that people thought it more effective than it actually was, a form of moral hazard was created. Brokerage commissions appear to have been unrelated to the scale of effort and risk involved for the broker. Working members in general did steadily but modestly better than outside Names, and some categories of market insiders in some years obtained a degree of preferential performance that was 'more than modest, which was immodest'. Underwriters on profitable syndicates routinely offered membership to brokers who could bring in business, but denied it to outside Names. Some members' agents seem to have taken 'a very lax view of their fiduciary duties'; adopted a cavalier approach to Names; ignored their instructions; failed to appreciate LMX risks or pass on warnings about them; failed to assess the suitability of those risks for their Names; and may have put their own interests ahead of their duty to Names. Members agents were not - and are not - sufficiently attentive to Names. Standards for registering members' agents were insufficiently rigorous. Some managing agents failed to supervise their underwriters properly. Lloyd's started examining the performance of managing agents too late in the day. The market view that one or more major LMX underwriters were inadequately protected from a major catastrophe did not reach the regulators. Lloyd's has been a passive regulator, not a pro-active one. Worst of all, without changes to Lloyd's, 'the committee do not have confidence that problems of the kind experienced with LMX business could not recur'. The committee thus proposes detailed recommendations for reform, some of which - such as the introduction of risk-weighted underwriting limits - are sweeping. The Lloyd's council should introduce them without delay, along with the separation between regulation and market leadership recommended by Sir Jeremy Morse's committee. Does the failure by the Lloyd's authorities to prevent these practices justify a wider sharing-out within Lloyd's of losses incurred? It is hard to make such a case in relation to Lloyd's failure to spot the business misjudgments of managing agents and underwriters. There is a stronger case, however, when considering those affected by the lax practices of members' agents. That is not how Lloyd's sees it. It is offering only hardship assistance, and is leaving its members to sue managing agents and members' agents where they think they have a claim. Suing Lloyd's itself has been made more difficult by yesterday's decision in the Oakeley Vaughan case that Lloyd's owes no legal duty of care to Names. In the light of Sir David Walker's report, it should consider seriously whether it owes a moral one.</p>

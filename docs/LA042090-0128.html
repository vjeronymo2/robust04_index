			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> RENEWED BID TO HALT AERIAL SPRAYING FAILS  </P> <P> Scrambling to breathe life into its legal challenge against malathion spraying,  the city of Huntington Beach on Thursday tried but failed to have a Sacramento  County Superior Court judge disqualified from the case because he admitted to  using the pesticide to eradicate gnats, mosquitoes and fleas from his own back  yard.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach Deputy City Atty.  </P> <P> Arthur Delaloza argued that Judge Anthony DeCristoforo Jr. improperly relied on  his own knowledge of malathion when ruling against the city's request for an  injunction against the aerial spraying in February.  </P> <P> During that hearing, DeCristoforo said: "I used malathion for years and years  and years. . . . We have a fairly large back yard, and I spray that all over. I  don't use a mask; it's never occurred to me. . . ."  </P> <P> Delaloza asserted that the judge's personal knowledge of malathion "permeated  the entire hearings" and that "this was the underpinning to the conclusion that  using malathion was safe."  </P> <P> But Superior Court Judge Michael J. Virga refused to remove DeCristoforo from  the case, saying a review of the February hearing yielded the opposite  conclusion -- that DeCristoforo "conscientiously and impartially decided the  case" based on the word of experts, and not his own experience as a gardener.

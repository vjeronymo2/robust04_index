			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANA PARSONS: PICKLER PONDERS: SHOULD ANAHEIM CUT LOSSES ON ARENA?  </P> <P> In one of his movies, Woody Allen's character is reproached by a friend for  being an atheist. "No," Allen says. "To you, I'm an atheist. To God, I'm the  loyal opposition."  </P> <P> In a society where rassling and roller derby can draw crowds, trying to stop  the sports bandwagon is tantamount to heresy.  </P> <P> City Councilman Irv Pickler is that kind of a heretic, the lone Anaheim  councilman who hasn't gotten religion over the proposed sports arena the city  wants to build.  </P> <P> But to Pickler, utterly convinced about the rightness of his position, he's  merely the loyal opposition.  </P> <P> "I have a real strong sense that I'm 100% right," Pickler, 69, said over a cup  of coffee Friday, dressed in de rigueur Southern California retirement garb of  slacks and a funny T-shirt.  </P> <P> Pickler, a councilman for 8 1/2 years, was on the arena bandwagon early on but  has since bolted. The city has broken ground on a $100-million arena in hopes  of luring a professional hockey or basketball team, or both. Santa Ana is  planning a similar-size arena but also has no commitment for a franchise.  </P> <P> Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter said he's certain that Anaheim is going to get the  pro franchises, but he hasn't named any names so far.  </P> <P> Pickler said Hunter is basically full of hot air.  </P> <P> "If this thing were signed, sealed and delivered, I'd be behind it 100%," he  said. "But we have no control over whether we get an NBA team or a hockey team.  And hockey isn't even a Southern California sport."  </P> <P>  But Anaheim clearly has the bug. In several other "on-the-move" cities around  the country, such things as sports arenas and big-time convention centers are  on the standard laundry list of necessities to make the cities appear to be  major league.  </P> <P> San Jose, for example, persuaded voters in 1988 to approve building an indoor  arena -- without the promise of landing a pro sports franchise. The city since  has been scheduled to get a National Hockey League expansion team in the next  couple of years.  </P> <P> Enter Anaheim and Santa Ana. Hunter has included the arena in his vision of an  increasingly dominant Anaheim.  </P> <P> Pickler has become increasingly concerned that civic pride, not to mention ego,  may goeth before the fall.  </P> <P> "I think Anaheim already has the prestige," Pickler said. "We have the Rams, we  have the Angels, we have Disneyland, we have the Convention Center. When we  built Anaheim Stadium, we knew we had the Angels. When we enhanced it to take  football, we knew we had the Rams.  </P> <P> "I'm a gambler. I go to Vegas quite often, I don't mind throwing my money  around, and for $10 million this was worth it to me, but when you get up to the  figures we're talking about. . . ."  </P> <P> Although no one can say for sure, Pickler is afraid that the city could be left  holding a very large bag if it doesn't get a franchise or if the management  group that plans to run the arena or its financial backers run into problems.  </P> <P> It's not that Pickler is predicting such dire events. It's just that he isn't  sure what the future holds, and that's why he doesn't like the smell of this  deal.  </P> <P>  "We're on a fast track, and I don't think we need to be," he said. "If it  costs $60 million to get a franchise and you're an owner and you have a choice  of Anaheim, or, say, Sacramento or San Jose or San Diego, are you just going to  walk in or are you going to say, 'Make me a good deal.'  </P> <P> "It's like the Raiders," he said, referring to how owner Al Davis pitted  several potential cities against each other in a competition to get that  National Football League team.  </P> <P> Of course, it's entirely possible that Pickler is just being a  stick-in-the-mud. Not visionary enough to get with the program.  </P> <P> "From John Q. Public, I don't get that remark," he said. "I've gotten the  remark, 'Why are we doing this?' "  </P> <P> As a guy who has been to Vegas plenty of times, Pickler said he'd take a walk  right now, even if it means the city would forfeit the several million dollars  it has already gambled on the arena.  </P> <P> "I think you take your losses and come back and fight another day," he said.  "It's just like a war -- you know when you're going to lose, you back away and  regroup and come back later."  </P> <P>  Luckily for us spectators, there will be a resolution to all this. History  will eventually reveal who was right. Will it be the grand visionaries of  municipal machismo who wanted to catapult Anaheim into a totally different  league, or will it be the guy whose lone cries of "Not so fast!" were drowned  out by the roar of the crowd?  </P></p>

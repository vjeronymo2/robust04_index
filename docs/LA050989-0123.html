			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DRIVER WITH SQUIRREL TIED TO CAR IS CITED  </P> <P> A man who drove a Cadillac with a live squirrel tied to a windshield wiper was  charged with unlawful possession of the bushy tailed rodent, officials said  Monday.  </P> <P> John B. Griffin, 49, described as "a loner" who may be living at an area  campground, was arrested Sunday after witnesses complained of a car traveling  on Main Street with a squirrel attached to a windshield wiper, Police Chief  Gary Sibilia said.  </P> <P> Griffin was "irate and combative" when police stopped him, Sibilia said. The  squirrel, tied to the wiper by a nylon cord, was "frightened but not hurt,"  Sibilia said.  </P> <P> "He said the squirrel was his friend," Sibilia said. "The squirrel's fine now.  It was taken by the environmental police, who brought it to a sanctuary."  </P> <P> Griffin was charged with disorderly conduct and illegal possession of a gray  squirrel, Sibilia said.  </P></p>

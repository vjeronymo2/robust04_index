			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Burton Group The market was unsettled by the slippage in Burton's second half sales following a particularly strong first six months to the year. This sales pattern is not what is expected of a so-called recovery stock at this stage of the consumer spending cycle. But there were some special factors at play. The repositioning of Burton's chains confused shoppers. The ghastly summer led to Burton being caught with its trousers marked down. Marks and Spencer, aided by the devaluation gain at its UK supplier base, has also run riot on the high street. Yet, Mr John Hoerner has done well to lead Burton out of its trading corner and deserves the benefit of the doubt for the moment. There remains considerable scope for recovery in Burton's multiple chains. But the process may just take longer to realise than first assumed. The bigger long-term question is whether its multiple structure is appropriate for the 1990s. Operating so many chains dissipates Burton's economies of scale and complicates the management task. That perhaps argues for a demerger. The flotation of Allders revealed a healthy demand for department stores and the perky Debenhams could expect a still warmer response. Debenhams may have helped keep Burton afloat during the recession. But if management believes its restructuring rhetoric, the multiple chains are no longer in need of such a lifebelt.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Conservatives in the Wings"] </F>   [Text] Professor Henry Valen is right, of course, when he  calls the Storting election of 13 September an "anomaly" that  broke the trend we have seen throughout the postwar period. It  is clear that EC opponents from all the other parties, including  the Socialist Left Party, flocked to the Center Party. However,  it was a big surprise to many that election experts feel they  can draw the conclusion that the record low voter turnout was  caused primarily by EC opponents who decided to stay home. If  that is true, it is a clear indication of the challenge that  faces EC supporters.    The Labor Party has its problems to contend with, but the  Conservatives have problems that are just as great. Among the  nonvoters in the Conservative ranks, there were three times as  many EC opponents as supporters. Even so, the election experts  are overstating the case when they maintain that the Labor and  Conservative roles as political opposites have been abolished.  The fact that only a minority of voters regarded the  Conservatives as a government alternative in this election does  not necessarily mean that the traditional dividing line in  Norwegian politics has become irrelevant for all time. It is not  a foregone conclusion that the party patterns resulting from the  EC struggle will be a permanent phenomenon.    Nonetheless, the Conservatives must be quite perplexed by  the  fact that the Labor Party received a sizable influx of EC  supporters from both the Conservative and Progress parties in  this year's election. For the many voters who regard a strong  government as the best guarantee of stability, the Conservative  Party was not an alternative.    The Labor Party for its part lost many EC opponents, mainly  to the Center Party, but in return it acquired new voters from  the ranks of those who support Norwegian membership in the  European Union, the new name of the EC. Again underlining that  the Conservatives are on the sidelines. EC supporters simply  sought refuge in the Labor Party. At the same time, former  Conservative voters who oppose EC membership voted for the  Center Party--if they went to the polls at all.    It is no surprise that there are also many opponents among  traditionally Conservative voters. However, it would be a  complete mistake for the Conservative leadership to be deluded  into believing that the election defeat was a consequence of the  fact that there appeared to be more room for opponents in the  Labor Party than in the Conservative Party. If the Conservatives  had been able to make this year's meeting with the voters a  government election, the EC opponents in the party's own ranks  would also have voted the same way they did in 1989.    When it comes to our future relationship to the EC, the  voters already knew where the Conservatives stood four years  ago. The difference was that then the Conservatives emerged as  the leaders of a nonsocialist coalition that was prepared to  assume government responsibility.    When the nonsocialist coalition collapsed in November 1990  and the Center Party paved the way for a new Social Democratic  minority government, the Conservatives saw their big chance. But  they never succeed in emerging on their own as a credible  challenger in the fight for government power.    If the Conservatives remain standing in the wings without  having any impact in the Storting, this year's "anomalous"  Storting election could be the beginning of years of tedious  effort. The Conservatives must now show that the party is able  to find its bearings in a new reality.</p>

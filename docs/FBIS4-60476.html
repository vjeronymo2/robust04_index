			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First Friday prayers sermon by President 'Ali Akbar </F> Hashemi-Rafsanjani in Tehran on 20 May -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. [passage omitted] In the first sermon we will continue  the discussion on social justice. [passage omitted] In last  year's sermons I spoke about resources; but less was said about  expenditures last year. So in the first sermon this year we  spoke about it. I think I should list a few more in the next  few sermons. In the last sermon I referred to subsidies as one  of the areas of realizing justice in the distribution of the  treasury and the government's financial resources. Briefly,  what I meant was that there were unjust subsidies left from the  distant past, that some injustices have been eradicated, and  there are important areas left. I referred to fuel and bread  and some other items [subsidies] which are still unfair. Of  course, I explained then that since they are very important and  have a great effect on life, one cannot take instantaneous  decisions about them. It needs planning, and problems arising  in conjunction with removing subsidies should be considered.  Therefore, we will keep them until our plan is ready.    In the second five-year plan there are certain indications  for this to happen in five years, but in our view even five  years are not enough. It needs at least 10 years for us to  remove the inequities which exist in fuel and bread consumption  in the society. But then, some media rushed in and said that  speech smelled of new price rises. It is not so. I stressed  then that it will be done with planning. God willing, part of  those plans are in the Majles and other parts will be prepared  later. Our people should not worry about rash and quick  measures in these sensitive times. We will act cautiously. I  said then that some actions would arouse resentment against the  government because they might put severe pressure on the people.  Therefore, such tasks will be carried out with prudence.

This announcement's purpose is to develop capacity among organizations, which have not previously focused efforts on tobacco control, to develop the infrastructure necessary to educate, support, and mobilize their membership to promote and implement Healthy People 2000 tobacco control objectives. The primary constituencies served by the organizations should be minorities (African-Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives), youth, women, blue collar and/or agricultural workers. Tobacco control is defined as preventing tobacco use, encouraging cessation, and protecting both smokers and nonsmokers through public policy and public education.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Organizations that have not traditionally been active in the tobacco control field, but have a newly emerging interest in tobacco control, are encouraged to apply for this award. Upon receiving funding, organizations will be expected to demonstrate a focus on increasing tobacco control capacity within target communities or among an organization's constituents at the national, State or local level. Funding will be used to build the organization's capacity for leadership among its constituency for, and to assist State and local health agencies and other appropriate organizations and agencies in, the development of tobacco prevention and control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of tobacco, with emphasis on target populations specified in risk reduction objective 3.4 and reducing the initiation of smoking by children and youth as described in Objective 3.5. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section ``Where to Obtain Additional Information.'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This program is authorized under Section 317(k)(3) [42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(3)] of the Public Health Service Act, as amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Smoke-Free Workplace  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the nonuse of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible Applicants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible applicants are public and private, nonprofit, and minority organizations.

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Clinton criticises black 'racism' GOVERNOR Bill Clinton has sharply attacked a black popular singer for inciting racial prejudice in the US, thus incurring the displeasure of the country's most prominent black leader, the Rev Jesse Jackson. The presumptive Democratic presidential candidate took what appears to be a calculated political gamble in a Washington speech at a meeting of the Rainbow Coalition, Mr Jackson's own political organisation. He said Sister Souljah, the black rap singer who had addressed the meeting the previous night, was on record as saying after the Los Angeles riots that blacks could be justified in killing whites and that whites had 'a low-down dirty nature'. 'If you took the words 'white' and 'black' and reversed them, you might think David Duke was giving that speech,' he said in a reference to the fringe right-wing politician who performed dismally in a bid for the Republican nomination this year. 'We have an obligation, all of us, to call attention to prejudice wherever we see it,' he said. He admired the Rainbow Coalition's determination 'to come together across racial lines' but felt Sister Souljah's comments ran counter to that spirit, as had his own admitted mistake of playing golf at a segregated country club. Mr Jackson accused Mr Clinton of 'bad judgment' and said the singer deserved an apology. The campaigns of both Mr Clinton and President George Bush have been debating how best to respond to the new political challenges posed by Mr Ross Perot, the prospective independent candidate. An option for both is to appeal more openly to their respective liberal and conservative constituencies, on the grounds that in a close three-way race, secure natural political bases will be more important than ever. This explains why Vice-President Dan Quayle has been dispatched to conservative audiences to attack the liberal values and cultural elitism of the media. He is also being deployed as the main Republican critic of Mr Perot. Mr Clinton, however, is known to believe that excessive reliance on traditional Democratic constituencies - especially minorities and organised labour - would be a recipe for failure. His campaign throughout has been predicated on the need to win back middle-class Americans, mostly white, who voted Republican in the last three elections, while not sacrificing the progressive base. At his press conference last Friday he denied there was tactical division among his staff on the issue. Yet his cause would undoubtedly be weakened if the black vote were lost. Neither Mr Bush nor Mr Perot is popular among blacks, but the critical question is whether they vote in sufficient numbers to help Mr Clinton. For that to happen it is axiomatic that he needs the support of leaders like Mr Jackson.</p>

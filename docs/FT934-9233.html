			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: UK side behind 22% rise at Electrocomponents ELECTROCOMPONENTS, the electronic, electrical and mechanical components distribution group, yesterday posted a 22 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits boosted by a steady improvement in the UK operations. Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 increased from Pounds 25.4m to Pounds 31.1m. Earnings per share grew by 29 per cent to 9.8p (7.6p) and the interim dividend is being lifted to 2.5p (2p). Turnover from continuing operations increased from Pounds 161.4m to Pounds 183.1m, helped in particular by growing sales from the group's new operations in continental Europe. Operating profits from continuing operations increased to Pounds 29.7m, against Pounds 26.1m last time when the group also recorded a Pounds 2.6m operating loss on its now discontinued Misco computer supply businesses. Sales in the group's core UK-based RS Components business increased by 11 per cent, while productivity gains and lower bad debt costs resulted in modestly improved net margins. RS International sales increased by 40 per cent, underlining the progress made by the group's continental European operations, particularly Radiospares Composants in France, which continued to show strong growth despite the recession. Mr Robert Lawson, group chief executive, said the performance of the new operations in Europe 'vindicated' the group's overseas expansion strategy. Meanwhile, Electrocomponents ended the period with Pounds 51.9m (Pounds 36.8m at year-end) in net cash. Over the next three years it plans to invest Pounds 35m to support growth. COMMENT The underlying growth in the UK business was ahead of expectations and the push into overseas markets is gaining momentum even though the new European operations are still losing money. Group strategy is to deliver high margin, low volume products to engineers anywhere in the world and the next step may well be a joint venture in India. Cash balances continue to strengthen and will be used to support organic growth in the UK and overseas. This year pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 71m generating 22p of earnings and putting the shares on a deserved forward multiple of 20.7. Buy.</p>

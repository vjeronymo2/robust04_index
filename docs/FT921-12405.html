			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Yeltsin pledge to direct missiles away from US MR BORIS Yeltsin, the Russian president, has promised to change the guidance system of the former Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles so they no longer target the US. 'We want to change our military doctrine and no longer regard the US as our potential adversary,' Mr Yeltsin said in an interview with ABC TV, filmed over the weekend and to be broadcast on Friday. The Russian president did not say whether other nuclear states - such as France, the UK and China - were also no longer seen as hostile, nor did he specify to what targets the missiles would be redirected. In the US, President George Bush is expected to propose deep new cuts in nuclear warheads in his State of the Union address to Congress tomorrow. He is also expected to discuss the plans with Mr Yeltsin at Camp David next weekend. The US cuts are likely to focus on multi-warhead missiles at land and sea, with one option being to scale back the number of warheads on each missile and phase out other systems such as the land-based MX peacekeeper. The administration is also leaning towards abandonment of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the 1972 treaty signed with the former Soviet Union which laid down strict guidelines on the development and deployment of defences against offensive nuclear missiles. A team of US nuclear arms experts led by a senior state department official visited Moscow last week and asked Russia and other nuclear-armed republics to adhere to the Start treaty signed last year which cuts offensive warheads by 30 per cent, but made no mention of the ABM treaty, the Washington Post reported. The break-up of the Soviet Union and the risks of nuclear proliferation have generated fresh support in the US for scaling back offensive systems and strengthened defences. This marks a shift in old nuclear doctrine. Mr Yeltsin said during the TV interview at the weekend that an official statement on the change of direction for intercontinental missiles would be made today, and would be repeated when Mr Yeltsin appears before the UN Security Council on Friday. Senior military figures and foreign policy analysts in Moscow have complained that the cuts in weaponry, and defence procurement made by the Russian budget - passed by deputies in the Russian parliament on Friday - has left the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Russia with no coherent military doctrine. Mr Yeltsin has stressed in meetings with the British and French foreign ministers that the nuclear forces of the CIS are under a single unified command, and that he, together with Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, commander-in-chief of the CIS forces, have the final decision on their use. The strategic and tactical missiles based in other republics are due to be sent back to Russia, or destroyed in situ, over the next few years. Mr Leonid Privalov, deputy chairman of Belarus's parliamentary Commission of National Security, said yesterday that the first batch of tactical missiles had already been sent to Russia. Mr Privalov said: 'Belarus will get rid of its strategic weapons around 1996 or 1997. . . at present we do not see an adversary, either near our borders or elsewhere, with whom we would need to fight.'</p>

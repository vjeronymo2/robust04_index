			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / A slow road to the modern world: Ford remains optimistic despite Jaguar's mounting losses Ford's takeover of Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker, appears - in the short term - to have been an unmitigated disaster. Losses are mounting, as sales and production plummet. Demand for luxury cars in Jaguar's two biggest markets, the US and the UK, seems to be in freefall. Worldwide sales in the first quarter have fallen 45.4 per cent and production 57.8 per cent. Amid the gloom, however, Jaguar chairman Bill Hayden insists that there are glimmers of hope. Mr Hayden, previously vice-president of Ford of Europe's manufacturing group, came to Jaguar after the US carmaker's takeover 16 months ago. He says the first benefits of the company's landmark 1991-92 labour agreement are beginning to show through in much higher productivity; and, he adds, Jaguar is set to reach quality levels with the launch today of a revamped XJS coupe and convertible range, which it had previously never dreamed of attaining. The takeover was hardly cheap. Ford paid Pounds 1.38bn to gain its foothold in the world luxury car market. It is competing head on with the most prestigious German luxury car makers - Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche - as well as with the upstart competition from Japan - Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's Infiniti ranges. To make matters worse, Ford - which is the world's second-largest car producer - made its play for Jaguar just before the bottom began to drop out of its own core North American automotive operations, and its profits began to plunge in Europe. In the final quarter last year, the Ford group ran up a net loss of Dollars 519m (Pounds 307.1m), its first quarterly loss for eight years. Yesterday it announced an Dollars 884m loss for the first quarter of 1991. It was clear from the outset that the Jaguar name, rather than the physical assets, was the attraction. Of the Pounds 1.38bn purchase price, the net assets were valued at Pounds 249m, while the goodwill cost Pounds 1.133bn. Ford never expected too much of the plants. Yet within months of arriving at Jaguar, Mr Hayden was declaring publicly that he was 'appalled'. In one interview, he said: 'I've been to car plants around the world. Apart from some Russian factories in Gorky, Jaguar's factory was the worst I'd ever seen.' Jaguar management admits that the first 16 months of Ford ownership has been traumatic. But the company insists substantial progress is being made in modernising its manufacturing and product development operations. 'Jaguar was quite an introverted company,' says Mr Hayden, 'it muddled through but was not aware of competitive standards outside.' Undoubtedly helped by the rapidly worsening economic environment, Jaguar has managed to revolutionise its labour practices. The two-year agreement reached last November represents the biggest change in working practices in the company's history. It has finally eradicated shopfloor arrangements which had been defunct elsewhere in the UK motor industry for 10 to 15 years. Mr Hayden says that direct labour productivity in the current year will be about 18 per cent higher than a year ago. 'We were not in a position to put industrial engineers on the shopfloor to time standard work and carry out process checks. Now we can and do.' The notorious system of 'job and finish' - whereby there was a tacit agreement that workers left the assembly line when a certain number of units had been produced, regardless of when the shift ended - has now been stopped. 'There is now 'bell-to-bell working'. Mr Hayden claims that the demarcation lines among the semi-skilled workers have been abolished. 'Before jobs were allocated by the unions. It was a metal finisher's job or a TGWU (Transport and General Workers Union) job. You could not allocate one to the other. Changing schedules or re-manning the lines was impossible.' Jaguar workers had also previously refused to take on tasks outside their narrowly-defined duties, such as detailing problems, assisting in statistical process control or carrying out quality calculations. 'All that has gone,' says Mr Hayden. At the same time, group leaders are being appointed from among the hourly workers to assist in tracking quality and production problems. The unions previously decided the allocation of overtime. Management has now regained control, although it publishes its requirements to avoid suspicions it is abusing its newly won powers. Ford's ownership of Jaguar has had an equally purgative affect on the company's engineering and product development functions. Long-held plans for a new sports car - the heir to Jaguar's legendary E-Type - were finally scrapped last year. The company realised it was unable to meet the cost, specification and performance criteria which it had established for the project. At the same time, the management put in place by Ford has insisted on tough quality standards. The launch of the revamped XJS coupe and convertible range has been delayed for about four months until the required standards could be reached. Jaguar has spent about Pounds 50m on revising the range - priced from Pounds 33,400 to Pounds 50,600. The revisions amount to the most comprehensive changes made since the XJS was launched in 1975. Mr Hayden has introduced Ford's uniform product assessment system for measuring quality. He insists that the new XJS will be introduced with the defects per vehicle cut to only one-third the level of a year ago. Jaguar is also moving quickly to address weaknesses in its worldwide distribution and dealer network, particularly in Europe. In the long-term, Ford has heady ambitions for Jaguar. The company plans to more than treble output by the end of the decade to over 150,000 cars a year. It will do this by replacing its XJ6 luxury saloon range and also introducing a smaller, sportier Jaguar model to challenge the likes of the BMW 3 and 5 Series. The ambitions will cost another Pounds 1bn, however, for development and capital investment costs, and Ford will need a steady nerve in its present troubled times.

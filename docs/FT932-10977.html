			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / CBI chief calls for changes in financing of small businesses MR Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, yesterday outlined a six-point plan to change the way small businesses are financed in Britain. He said urgent action was needed to reduce the casualty rate from cash-flow problems as the economy recovered from recession. Mr Davies said clearing banks, which in the 1980s overlent to small businesses, were now in danger of making as big a mistake by overtightening their lending rules. 'We ought to be trying to move faster towards a more flexible form of small business finance,' he told northern members of the British Venture Capital Association in Manchester. His proposals are to form the basis for developing a more formal CBI policy in the next few weeks. The points were: Speed up payment of money owing to small businesses by big companies and the public sector, often the worst offender. Mr Davies said all companies and public bodies should follow the CBI's code of conduct, which encouraged prompt payment. Wider use of factoring, where companies sell their invoices to finance houses, often subsidiaries of banks, which then collect the money. 'The attraction is that it would force banks to take a more direct interest in small businesses and to understand the strength of their customer base,' Mr Davies added. Banks should be more willing to swap debt for equity. The venture capital industry should look at its investment pattern, in which 64 per cent of funds go into management buy-outs, only 4 per cent into start-ups, 3 per cent into early stage funding and 4 per cent into refinancing bank debt. These last three categories needed a bigger share of money available, he said. A replacement for the Business Expansion Scheme which, Mr Davies said, had acted as a middle-class tax-shelter and had been abused, with funds going to ventures such as wine cellars. It should apply only to investment in a new type of local investment company, through which small business 'angels' could take stakes in targeted ventures. A successor to the Unlisted Securities Market, which the stock exchange wants to abolish but has temporarily reprieved while alternatives are considered. Mr Davies said there had to be an easier way of going public than the costlier route of obtaining a full listing. Something like the USM was needed to assist quick and easy exits for equity stakeholders in successful small businesses. He also called for wider tax relief on investments in growing businesses where realised profits were reinvested in other new unquoted businesses - a Budget proposal watered down in the Finance Bill.</p>

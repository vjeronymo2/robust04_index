			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- The Brazilian Government on 12 April  broadened the discount rate range applicable to foreign debt  bonds used by foreign banks to purchase shares of state-owned  companies being privatized. The standard 25 percent discount  off the face value of debt bonds has been replaced with  discounts ranging from 25 to 35 percent, depending on the type  of bond involved. Bonds and contracts alone pertaining to the  agreement that will take effect on 15 April total $52 billion.    According to Central Bank [BC] sources, creditors have thus  far used only $90 million of their credit in privatization  auctions. The creditor banks have claimed that the discount rate  on debt securities is very high. The creditors do not seem to  have confidence in the Fernando Henrique Cardoso-2 Plan.    A BC resolution provides that of the new bonds to be issued  on 15 April, par bonds will be converted into shares with an  initial discount of 35 percent. This rate will gradually  decline until dropping to zero in 30 years.    Foreign debt bonds converted into shares of privatized  companies may not be repatriated over a six-year period.  Profits and dividends earned on these shares may be freely  taken out of the country. Brazilian companies that purchased  debt bonds may not convert them into shares of privatized  companies.    The National Comptroller General extended from 31 March to  29  April the deadline for rescheduling fiscal debts registered as  standing debts of the federal government.</p>

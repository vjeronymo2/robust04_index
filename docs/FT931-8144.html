			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / International Company News: Honda tumbles 16.9% to Y18bn on surge in yen THE SLIDE in profits at Honda, the Japanese car manufacturer, continued unabated as the company reported a 16.9 per cent drop in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y18.23bn (Dollars 150.7m) for the third quarter to end-December. However, the results suggest the fall in Honda's profits may be reaching its bottom, especially if planned new models increase sales in the US as demand there recovers. The group is enjoying a dramatic surge in demand for motorcycles from China. Honda's pre-tax profits fell largely because foreign exchange losses from the surge in the yen against the dollar and higher interest charges offset improvements in operating income. Operating income was 4.6 per cent higher in the three months between last October and December at Y23bn. Mr Yoshihide Munekuni, executive vice president, said this was a reflection of cost cutting and lower depreciation charges from reduced investment. Consolidated capital expenditure at Honda rose by 70 per cent between 1989 and 1990 as it established its manufacturing base in the US, which accounts for about 43 per cent of sales. Capital expenditure peaked in the year to March 1990 at Y311.7bn, while the depreciation charge peaked a year later at Y191bn. This year's capital spending is expected to be down to about Y180bn, while depreciation charges are likely to be Y175bn. Interest charges have risen as the company has borrowed more to fund its Y77.5bn of warrant bond redemptions. Automobile sales fell by 10 per cent in the quarter, dipping to Y785bn, largely because of sluggish recovery in the US and downturn in Japan. Unit sales were 6.9 per cent down at 435,000 units. Honda should be well placed to exploit the expected recovery of the US car market, according to Mr Andrew Blair-Smith, an industry analyst at BZW, the UK stockbroker. Motorcycle sales are surging, largely because of strong demand from south east Asia. Motorcycle revenues rose 15.2 per cent to Y122.8bn.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / MPs vent anger at threat of further cuts in defence THE COMMONS defence committee vented its anger yesterday against the threat of further cuts in Britain's defence budget, warning that the armed forces' capabilities could fall 'below the minimum level necessary for the security of the UK'. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the committee's Conservative chairman, said a Pounds 1bn cut in the Pounds 23.7bn military budget, which the Treasury is reported to be seeking, would be 'wholly unacceptable'. Representatives of all three main parties on the 11-strong committee spoke out against further cuts at a press conference to launch two highly critical reports, both warning of potentially dire implications for Britain's defence. One of the reports, on the Navy, said that in the event of a full-scale war it would already be 'incapable of defending our sea-routes'. Labour's Mr Bruce George said the decision to hold a press conference - only the second in the 14 years since the select committee was set up  - was itself an indication of how angry the members were. On the Tory side, Mr Winston Churchill said any significant further cuts would be 'a clear breach of faith with parliament, with the armed forces and with the nation'. The committee's report on the government's July Defence White Paper warned that extra reductions would have a serious effect on morale following the Pounds 1.05bn spending cut imposed last November. 'The armed forces desperately need a period of financial calm,' it said. It repeated its previous warning that the number of Army personnel was inadequate for its tasks.

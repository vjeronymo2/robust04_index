			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: Poet's brutal tyrant - Marlowe's 'Tamburlaine' THERE IS a paradox in Christopher Marlowe's Tamburlaine the Great which is very hard to overcome on stage. How can the central character speak such beautiful verse, yet be such a total tyrant? When the RSC's current production was first performed at Stratford last year, Terry Hands as director seemed to play down the verse and emphasise the violence. The production was on the small stage of the Swan Theatre. Now that it has reached the huge stage of the Barbican, which is where it belongs, some of the problems have been resolved. Antony Sher's Tamburlaine is as brutal as ever. Far from resembling the Scythian shepherd of his origins, this Tamburlaine deliberately looks like a wolf. In one scene he enters swinging on a rope just like Tarzan, kicking down his enemies on the way. The Barbican has a space to let this be done dramatically, as it has for all the other scenes of carnage. If you want to mount an epic, do it on the grand scale. The verse is still an obstacle, but I now see that there is a strong case for the way Sher stammers or lisps slightly over some of the more exotic names, like Zenocrate, Persopolis or Samarcanda. The tyrant is still in awe of his conquests. Samarcanda, his native city, he never reaches. Where the production becomes human rather than swashbuckling is in Part 2, which is not always performed, Marlowe having written it later in response, it is said, to popular demand. Tamburlaine is older now, almost at peace, with three grown up sons, but Zenocrate is ailing. For a while he seems more like part of a bourgeois family than the scourge of Asia. When Zenocrate dies, the ransacking resumes with even greater fury, but there is still humanity in the shape of the one son who does not want to fight. Taken all in all, over the two parts, Sher's performance is magnificent. So are some breathtaking stage effects designed by Johan Engels. If there is still one quibble, it is that Zenocrate should be more conventionally beautiful, yet there is no greater pleasure in the London theatre than when the Barbican is playing deservedly to capacity. Here, it is. ***** All's Well that Ends Well is Shakespeare's most mixed up play, and one of the least performed. Yet no one could ever dispute the authorship. Almost every scene contains a reference to what he had written before or what he would write in future, including the Sonnets. There is a throwback to Romeo and Juliet, for example, and more than a hint of Falstaff in Parolles, the French nobleman turned coward . It is as if Shakespeare was at a turning point, uncertain whether to write tragedy or comedy, and not quite mature enough for the dignity of his final plays such as The Tempest and The Winter's Tale. The piece is worth seeing for its rarity value alone. Sir Peter Hall's RSC production, which has moved to the Pit from Stratford, seems to me a trifle on the heavy side. He plays up the darker elements. Still there is a very fine countess from Barbara Jefford, and a haunting Parolles from Michael Siberry. As the text dictates, Richard Johnson's King of France gets off to a shaky start. Then he develops into the thoroughly experienced Shakespearean actor we know him to be and almost holds the play together.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Denktash offers port to UN TURKISH Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said yesterday the resort of Varosha could be handed over to the United Nations in return for the lifting of an international embargo on Turkish Cypriot ports and airports, Reuter reports from Nicosia. 'We indicated that provided the embargo which has been going on for 29 years is lifted from our ports and airports, we could discuss this,' he said. But, he added, transfer of the former Greek Cypriot resort would have to await agreement on a wider Cyprus deal.</p>

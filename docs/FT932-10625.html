			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: North American producers buy Russian aluminium NORTH AMERICAN producers have bought about 100,000 tonnes of cheap Russian aluminium to blend with their own metal, according to trade sources. The bulk of the Russian material, of a quality too low to be sold on the London Metal Exchange, was taken by Alcan of Canada, including 40,000 tonnes to use at its smelter at Lynemouth in the north of England. Ironically, Russian exports have driven down aluminium prices to a level below the cash costs of most western smelters by causing a big supply surplus. Alcan cut output at Lynemouth, one of the highest-cost smelters, by 50 per cent from its 130,000 tonnes annual capacity and the metal imported from Russia will help to make up the shortfall. A similar situation persists in Brazil where the closure of Alcan's Aratu smelter has left room for the group's subsidiary to import about 2,500 tonnes of the Russian material for its rolling and processing operations. Traders suggest that there was a big increase in exports of 'off-grade' Russian aluminium from the middle of last year and that there might be as much as 500,000 tonnes in Rotterdam warehouses. As it is not of the right quality for the LME, the material does not show up on the exchange's stock figures but it does have an impact on LME prices because traders know of its availability. VAW Aluminium of Germany, which is taking Russian aluminium in exchange for technological help with the modernisation of the Novokuznetsk smelter in Siberia, also bought some off-grade material last year at a Dollars 270 a tonne discount to the LME price. Traders say that buying by the North American companies has cut the discount to Dollars 100 a tonne. Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminium group, said that it bought some of the Russian metal to test its chemistry and to see how it performed. Apart from that, Alcoa said that it had not gone out specifically to buy Russian aluminium but had probably acquired some in its spot purchasing programme. Kaiser Aluminium, fourth-largest North American aluminium company, said it had bought 'small quantities' of off-grade Russian aluminium from time to time over the past few months. Alcan said the future of the Lynemouth smelter depended on its ability to negotiate a new supply contract with British Coal which owns the Ellington Colliery, literally underneath the plant. Mr Paul Belanger, managing director of Alcan Primary and Recycling, said that coal from elsewhere in the world cost only 40 per cent of that supplied by British Coal. Closure of Lynemouth would not only affect the 480 smelter employees but also 1,600 at Ellington, which sells 1.2m tonnes of its 2.1m tonnes annual output to Alcan.</p>

Sununu is in the Soviet Union to swap  managerial pointers with Kremlin leaders.  </P> <P> Sununu, known for his stay-in-touch management style, met with Foreign Minister  Eduard A. Shevardnadze on Tuesday to discuss plans for setting up a mechanism  by which the superpowers can share advice on organizing state agencies, the  official news agency Tass reported.  </P> <P> "I'm a great believer that, whenever you talk shop with somebody, you can  learn," Sununu had said before leaving Washington.  </P> <P> Sununu, who has not met with reporters since he arrived here Monday, is in the  second half of an exchange between himself and the man who is roughly his  counterpart in the Kremlin, Mikhail S. Shkabardnya, who runs the staff at the  Soviet Council of Ministers, or cabinet.  </P> <P> Shkabardnya and his aides visited the White House during the summit meeting in  June. They expressed interest in the nuts and bolts of the Washington political  machine, such as how the federal executive and legislative branches interact  and how President Bush's schedule is prepared.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev continued to fine-tune his  leadership team. On Tuesday, he named the editor in chief of the progressive  New Times weekly, Vitaly Ignatenko, to be his press secretary.  </P> <P> Arkady A. Maslennikov, who had been Gorbachev's spokesman, was appointed  spokesman for Anatoly I. Lukyanov, chairman of the Soviet parliament, Foreign  Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said.  </P></p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Cutting the risks when you take out a pension - Debbie Harrison examines ways to make it less of a gamble Do you know what risks you are taking with your personal pension investments? Probably not, because life offices do not explain fully the risks associated with their products and some of the guarantees offered are anything but rock solid. If you intend to make substantial contributions to your individual pension plan, it is possible to control the level of risk by running your own portfolio or appointing a stockbroker to do this for you. Self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs) - and, for small businesses, small self-administered schemes (SASSs) - provide this flexibility. Where you do not have a substantial pension portfolio and expect to contribute less than Pounds 10,000 a year, however, the fixed costs of a SIPP are prohibitive and you should go for a standard personal pension. Most providers offer a range of pooled funds that span the risk spectrum, starting with the full guarantee offered by deposit funds; working up through the quasi-guarantees offered by with-profit funds; and culminating with the higher risk unit-linked, unit trust and investment trust funds. While the investment risks associated with the top and bottom ends of the spectrum can be understood readily (even if the charges are not), there is considerable confusion about the middle ground - the funds that offer a partial guarantee at a price. Conventional wisdom argues that these funds are suitable for the more nervous investor and for those approaching retirement. With-profits funds, and the unitised version, still form the backbone of the individual pensions market due to the apparently high level of stability offered through the build-up of guaranteed annual bonuses. Over the past decade, though, these products have mutated into a far riskier vehicle than many realise. A series of changes to the traditional with-profits concept has undermined the guarantee and, in most cases, between 50 per cent and 70 per cent of the final pay-out is discretionary. Unitised with-profits do not even offer a basic guaranteed sum assured, while the fund actuary retains the right to renege on the guaranteed annual bonuses if there is a run on funds during a stock market crash. Add to this the spate of bonus cuts experienced over the past few years  - which is expected to continue - and there must be a serious question mark over the ability of all but the best of these funds to perform. Now, there is an alternative: guaranteed equity funds, which use derivatives to guarantee a percentage of stock market growth or to guarantee the unit value of fully-invested funds. Derivatives have been used for some years by institutional pension funds but are relatively new to the retail market, with only a dozen or so providers offering guaranteed funds. Most funds so far are index trackers, where part of your investment is used to buy a call option to secure a percentage in the index rise while the rest is put on deposit to provide a guaranteed return. A few providers, including Mercury Life and Provident Mutual, run actively-managed funds. The choice between index tracker and active management depends on which you think will perform best over the guarantee period. Several providers, including Manor Park and Provident Life, offer a choice of guarantee levels. Provident also offers a choice of index links, including the FT-SE Mid-250 and the more common FT-SE 100. But investors interested in guaranteed funds will find the selection confusing. Each fund offers different guarantees at different costs, so it is difficult to compare like with like. Sceptics argue that derivative-based funds are so complex that few independent financial advisers really understand them. Shaun Coleman, derivatives specialist at Morgan Grenfell, disagrees. 'A good IFA should be capable of breaking these products down, identifying the component parts and working out how much they cost in the market,' he says. Essentially, there are two key elements to consider. First: what level of performance or what percentage of the index is actually guaranteed? Second: what is the cost? To provide the guarantee, an investment manager usually buys a call option or, more rarely, might use futures to hedge the portfolio. The cost of these derivatives is added to the total charges. Regarding performance, it is important to look at both capital growth and dividend yield. A common problem with some of the index tracker funds is that they guarantee the capital growth but use the substantial dividend yields to buy the option. Actively-managed funds re-invest the dividend yield and should, in theory, provide a better return assuming that the manager outperforms the index. The cost here is likely to be between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent a year on top of the usual annual charges. If you need to retain access to your money, you should examine the penalties for early surrender. Some funds lock in gains each quarter, which provides greater flexibility than the one year lock-ins. But the call option guarantee price is more expensive - and you must pay for this flexibility. So, who should use these funds? Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of partnership pensions at actuarial consultants Bacon &amp; Woodrow, says: 'Guaranteed products should be used only in the run-up to retirement to lock in to gains and to protect against price volatility. Until then, ordinary equity funds offer a better return because you are not paying for the guarantee.' Warwick-Thompson is convinced that, in this capacity, guaranteed funds are better than with-profits. 'Guaranteed funds offer protection at a price, but at least you know exactly what you are getting and how much it costs. The returns on with-profits funds are almost entirely at the discretion of the actuary.' With-profits charges also tend to be obscure, particularly on traditional contracts.</p>

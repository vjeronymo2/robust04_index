			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (2): Fishermen need not wear hairnets - David Marsh tries to dispel some of the more alarming anxieties about life in the new Europe ASSERTION: A Commission directive will oblige fishermen to wear hairnets aboard their boats. FACT: Untrue. A Council directive, which took effect on January 1 1993, aims at ensuring strict hygiene conditions in fish-processing plants. Dockside staff who cut fish will have to wear suitable head cover to avoid contaminating fish. This does not mean hairnets. It does not apply to fishermen on boats, with the exception of workers on factory vessels. ASSERTION: Firemen will have to adopt new uniforms to conform with EC safety rules. FACT: From January 1 1993, 'personal protective equipment' must satisfy common safety requirements under a December 1989 Council directive. This includes firemen's uniforms and hats. All products marketed after 1993 will have to include an EC conformity mark. ASSERTION: EC regulations require Christmas trees to be symmetrical in shape, with regularly spaced needles. FACT: Untrue. No EC regulations on standardised Christmas trees. The Christmas Tree Growing Association of western Europe has, however, drawn up European specifications to try to aid marketing. ASSERTION: EC regulations forbid the marketing of a favourite Danish apple, the Ingrid Marie. FACT: For the purpose of freedom of movement and consumer protection, EC apples are classified into two categories - 'small', with a minimum diameter of 55mm, and 'large' with a diameter exceeding 65mm. In July 1989 the Danish fruit growers' association classified the Ingrid Marie as 'large'. However, since half the harvest did not reach the required size, the apples could not be marketed normally, and had to be sold to the processing industry. There are two solutions: to introduce a new 'medium-sized' category - which could increase administration costs - or to reclassify the Ingrid Marie as 'small'. ASSERTION: The Commission wants to outlaw the dye which gives smoked haddock its distinctive golden hue. FACT: Untrue. More than 30 colours are provided for in the Commission's proposals for a Council directive for colours used for foodstuffs - including those used for haddock. ASSERTION: The European parliament wants to stop skiing when snow is not deep enough. FACT: The parliament adopted in June 1991 a resolution to preserve the ecological balance in Alpine areas, proposing restrictions on ski runs where snow is less than 20 cm deep. The Council has not followed up these recommendations. ASSERTION: Britain's Essex coast will face an invasion of cockle fishing boats this year. FACT: On January 1, existing UK public health requirements on molluscs were replaced by new EC requirements. (Directive 91/493/EEC, L 268). This means that cockles from certain parts of the Thames estuary will no longer have to be processed in a particular plant in Leigh-on-Sea. But foreign fishing boats which want to catch UK cockles are still subject to Sea Fisheries Committees byelaws. ASSERTION: An EC food hygiene directive will force street vendors and cafes to close. FACT: A general food hygiene directive is under discussion in the Community. The proposal is broadly similar to provisions already in UK law. Detailed guidance will be left to voluntary codes of industry practice, to be drawn up in consultation with producers, retailers and consumers. ASSERTION: Charity shops are banned from selling second-hand toys as a result of EC toy safety directive. FACT: According to Directive 88/378/EEC on the Safety of Toys, in force since January 1 1990, all toys placed on the Community market for the first time must bear the CE safety mark. This applies to new toys sold in charity shops - but not to second-hand toys. ASSERTION: Under new EC legislation, there will be a reversal of 'burden of proof', meaning that lifeboat teams and mountain accident services could be sued for negligence by people they try to rescue. FACT: A proposed directive on liability of suppliers of services intends to make a provider of services responsible for proving that everything possible is done to assure safety of the consumer. This covers sea and mountain rescue services. But proposals make specific reference to the notion of 'legitimate expectation'. So the person rescued cannot in practice hold rescue services responsible for injuries sustained. ASSERTION: An EC directive on health rules unfairly discriminates against French soft cheeses. FACT: The Council adopted in June 1992 a directive on health rules for production and marketing of raw milk, heat-treated milk and milk-based products. It will come into effect on January 1 1994. As far as soft cheeses are concerned, it will ensure that milk used comes from animals and stocks which satisfy health and hygiene requirements. Cheeses produced should comply with specified microbiological criteria (checks for listeria, salmonella, escherichia coli etc.) Products failing to conform may be withdrawn. ASSERTION: The Royal Navy will have to end its tradition of stirring Christmas pudding mixtures with wooden oars, on account of a new EC hygiene regulation. FACT: Untrue. The framework directive on materials in contact with foodstuffs (89/109/CEE - L40) merely states that such materials should not 'transfer their constituents to foodstuffs in quantities which could endanger human health or bring about an unacceptable change in the composition of the foodstuffs'. ASSERTION: EC regulations are forcing butchers' shops to close. FACT: Untrue. New rules on handling of fresh meat apply only to slaughterhouses, processing plants, storage facilities and warehouses, not to retail premises. ASSERTION: A draft directive states that Euro-furniture shall not be made of European oak because it is too knotty. German and Italian varieties will be favoured because they have fewer knots. FACT: There is no such draft directive. Two long-standing pieces of legislation on marketing of certain seeds, such as oak, set up quality conditions. The UK has complained in the past that not many seeds from British oaks are recognised as eligible for planting in other EC countries. ASSERTION: Youngsters will have to give up newspaper delivery rounds if the EC directive on protection of young people at work is adopted. FACT: Untrue. Young people in full time education are restricted to 15 hours a week and three hours a day for light jobs, but will still be able to do paper rounds. Work must take place outside official school hours. Must generally be between 6 am and 8 pm - although exceptions are allowed.</p>

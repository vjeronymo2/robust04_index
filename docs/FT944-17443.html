			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Earthquake insurance bill rises Estimates of insurance losses from the Los Angeles earthquake last January have been raised from Dollars 7.2bn to Dollars 9bn after a surprising number of new claims, the American Insurance Services Group said. More than 100 new claims a day are being reported by insurance companies, the group said. About 350,000 claims have now been received by insurers. Homeowners' losses represent 76 per cent of claims, with commercial losses accounting for an additional 12 per cent. The heavy losses reflect the thrust-fault motion of the earthquake which exerted enormous forces on structures. The earthquake hit the heavily populated area of north-west Los Angeles on January 14, causing extensive damage over a wide area.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Letter: A policy prerequisite for tied European currencies Sir, Samuel Brittan ('Europe will still need a monetary system', August 2) is to be congratulated for drawing attention to the irresponsible behaviour of the Bundesbank in its conduct of monetary policy. To be fair, the Bundesbank does not want to set policy for Europe, but nor do the council members want a separate European central bank. However, if European currencies are to be tied together, monetary policy must be decided by European interests, not those of a single economic area. Make policy consistent with the system and there need be no problem. Inconsistent policies produce instability; there should be no surprise over recent events. ERM members have been trying to square the circle, with the inevitable, disastrous consequences. The same article also discussed the issue of inflation convergence, and this is much more controversial. Mr Brittan, like most commentators, continues to give most of the credit for lower inflation within Europe to the existence of the ERM, even to the extent of donating the British victory to this external constraint. The ERM may have helped, but a wider perspective suggests the existence of a more universal cause. Inflation has fallen around the world. In Japan it is below 1 per cent. In Canada and Australia it is below 2 per cent and even the US has inflation of about 3 per cent. All, it should be noted, without benefit of the ERM. Inflation came down because it was unacceptable to investors and the electorate. The former raised the costs and reduced the benefits of inflationary policies, which is what really upset the latter. This, in turn, produced the political will for restraint. The ERM was incidental to this process. We shall not explain the future very well, nor deserve better policies than we have had, if we do not explain the past correctly.

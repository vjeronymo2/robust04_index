			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- The overseas  headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's  Reunification (Pomminnyon), an organization of the movement for  the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, reportedly  held its presidium meeting in Tokyo recently and adopted a  resolution to implement the program of the movement which had  been agreed and decided on at a meeting of the joint presidium  of Pomminnyon.    The resolution said the meeting discussed the issue of  promoting the independent and peaceful reunification of the  country by forming strong units based on great national unity to  counter outside forces, the United States and Japan, and the  South Korean puppet clique that are trying to make a dangerous  adventure under the pretext of the North's "nuclear issue."    It called on all the regional headquarters overseas to  actively take part in the movement of "10,000 people's  declaration" with a view to strongly urging the United States to  observe the conclusions reached at its talks with the DPRK,  rallying the forces of the whole nation to smash Japan's scheme  to become a military power and having the Korean Armistice  Agreement replaced with a peace agreement.    The resolution also called for making efforts to  successfully  hold the fifth pan-national rally slated for this year as a  great festival of the whole nation.</p>

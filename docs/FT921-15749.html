			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Carmakers hope for a late visit from Santa: How falls in profits and a collapse in sales made last year one the industry would rather forget HUMILIATING falls into loss and a collapse of new car sales turned last year into one the motor industry would much rather forget. Total new car sales plunged 20.74 per cent to 1,592,326, the lowest level for nine years, and nearly one third down on the record 2.3m recorded only two years previously. Manufacturers' profits tumbled - Ford and Rover in particular suffered substantial losses. Ford has already warned that the losses will be 'far worse' than its 1990 pre-tax deficit of Pounds 274m. For dealers and distributors, there was a rapidly increasing list of receiverships and bankruptcies as a vicious re-run of the discounting wars in the early 1980s took its toll. According to the Retail Motor Industry Federation, by the middle of this year more than 800 franchised dealers - more than 10 per cent of the total - will have been forced out of business in 24 months. There was a grim rash of job losses in all areas of the industry. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, whose statistics yesterday described the miseries of last year's market in fine detail, predicts that 40,000 jobs will have gone in the year to mid-1992, adding to 25,000 already lost since mid-1990. The misery is not over yet. In the UK, few industry chiefs see many signs of the revival in business confidence they say is essential to kickstart the industry back to life. A consensus figure for sales this year is about 1.75m, assuming - as many in the industry do - that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will not belatedly adopt the guise of Santa Claus in his Budget and abolish special car tax and give other reliefs the industry has long sent pleading letters for to the Treasury grotto. Some production lines in the UK were kept busy by Germany and some other continental markets, with output falling only 3.9 per cent to 1.58m in the first 11 months of the year. Those lines are now also coming off the boil. Worsening the uncertainty is the imminent arrival of a report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on allegedly high car prices in the UK, and whether the existing system of exclusively franchised dealers works against consumers' interests. A 'thumbs down' from the commission would add substantially to the woes in the industry. Yet some crumbs of comfort could be found among yesterday's statistics for at least some of the industry. The December market was down, but the fall of 7.26 per cent was less severe than in previous months. In all, 58,274 cars were registered in December, although not necessarily sold. Manufacturers will register cars without having sold them to real buyers if their market share looks particularly bad. In the second half of the year, sales were more than 16 per cent below the corresponding period a year before, compared with nearly 29 per cent in the second quarter. Imports were held back, although only marginally. The importers' market share fell to 55.67 per cent for the year as a whole, compared with 56.74 per cent in 1990. It was only a token but, for the first time in years, the UK share of the market tipped over 50 per cent  - knocking imports down to 49.69 per cent - in December. Last night the SMMT was nursing a faint hope that the industry's balance of trade performance might have earned it some brownie points in Whitehall. After nearly a decade of increasing deficits, reaching Pounds 6.5bn in 1989, the deficit fell to Pounds 1.5bn last year. While much of the reduction is simply the result of the fall in the UK market, Sir Hal Miller, SMMT chief executive and departing Tory MP for Bromsgrove, was nevertheless able to point out yesterday that 'we are still the country's leading exporter'. Fortunes varies for individual manufacturers. Ford, the UK market leader for well over a decade, continued to suffer. Its market share last year fell to 24.24 per cent, down more than one percentage point on 1990 and a far cry from the 30 per cent share it took for granted in the late 1980s. Mr Ian McAllister, who took over as Ford of Britain's chairman on January 1, insists that this year the rot will be reversed. Part of the reason for the fall, he says, has been the absence of performance models such as the XR3i version of the Escort, which has been delayed by the late arrival of new engines. Such cars have accounted in the past for one percentage point of Ford's market share and will do so again, he says. He also promises a new model launch every six months over the next 2 1/2 years. Vauxhall, in spite of expecting to remain profitable this year, could also be counted among the year's losers in that its market share fell slightly last year after several years of gains. In sales terms at least, among the UK-based manufacturers both Peugeot Talbot and Rover could count themselves as winners, with Peugeot in particular winning an increased share of the market. Its prospects should be further enhanced next year when a second model joins production of the Peugeot 405 at its Ryton plant near Coventry. Nissan, operating its own distribution system in the UK from January 1 after its split with Mr Octav Botnar's Nissan UK, suffered badly from the fall-out from the row. Its market share fell to just over 4 per cent - only half of its share in the late 1980s. Among the volume importers, the Fiat group's suffering continued, with the combined share of Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Lancia sinking to just under 2.5 per cent. Were it not for Alfa's 164 flagship, still selling well and helping Alfa to increase its own share last year, the group's figures would look worse. Fiat is committing Pounds 100m to its UK operations in an effort to reverse the decline. As expected, the UK's specialist and luxury carmakers were shown to have suffered most. Rolls-Royce and Jaguar sales were virtually halved. And proving that the disease is not confined to UK luxury carmakers, Porsche's sales were down by 42 per cent to 1,612. The year's winners among importers and specialist producers, measured by an increase in market share rather than unit sales, included BMW, which reaped the benefit of its new 3-series model, and Lotus, which missed increasing unit sales by a mere eight cars. The feature of yesterday's statistics which must give the European industry most pause for thought relates to Far Eastern producers. Every Japanese manufacturer, with the exception of Nissan, increased its market share. Apart from a handful of new imports from South Africa, every company which increased both market share and unit sales was from Japan, Korea or Malaysia. The winners were Daihatsu, Hyundai, Isuzu, Kia, Suzuki and Proton. No European producer figured in that category.  ------------------------------ VOLUME AND MARKET SHARE UP  ------------------------------ Daihatsu Hyundai Isuzu Kia Proton Sao Suzuki  ------------------------------  ------------------------------ VOLUME DOWN/MARKET SHARE UP  ------------------------------ Alfa Romeo BMW Citroen Honda Subaru Lada Lotus Mazda Mitsubishi Peugeot Renault Rover Seat Toyota  ------------------------------  ------------------------------ VOLUME AND MARKET SHARE DOWN  ------------------------------ Audi/VW Fiat Ford FSO Jaguar Lancia Manserati Mercedes Nissan Porsche Reliant Rolls-Royce Saab Skoda Vauxhall Volvo Zastava  ------------------------------  ---------------------------------- TOP SELLERS               JAN/DEC  ---------------------------------- 1 Ford Fiesta             117,181 2 Ford Escort             110,302 3 Vauxhall Cavalier       109,545 4 Ford Sierra              93,650 5 Vauxhall Astra           71,437 6 Rover 200                68,122 7 Rover Metro              60,361 8 Peugeot 205              46,615 9 Vauxhall Nova            44,751 10 Peugeot 405             41,296 11 Ford Orion              40,193 12 Volkswagen Golf         33,862 13 Nissan Micra            32,571 14 BMW 3 Series            25,682 15 Rover 400               25,364 16 Ford Granada            24,615 17 Volkswagen Polo         24,107 18 Volvo 400               23,110 19 Rover Montego           23,057 20 Peugeot 309             21,940  ----------------------------------</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Bangkok police on murder charges Seven Thai policemen were charged yesterday with operating a scheme that involved the murder of at least nine Chinese tourists from Hong Kong, China and Taiwan. Police captain Prayong Chuphan and his six low-ranking accomplices said they had prowled the streets of Bangkok last year looking for likely victims to lure into the countryside where they were beaten, robbed and - in many cases  -shot. Acting national police chief Pratin Santiprapob said: 'As many as 40 foreigners went missing about this time. We are afraid there will be more bodies. They picked on Chinese because they normally have gold ornaments like necklaces and Rolexes. Chinese often like to gamble, so they carry a lot of cash.' The case further darkens the Thai police's reputation for bribery, links to prostitution and extortion of cash from motorists. It coincides with a current upsurge in Asian arrivals which is helping to compensate Thailand's important tourist industry for a decline in arrivals from Europe and North America. A Chulalongkorn University study last year claimed that up to 80 per cent of Thai junior policemen are corrupt and that commissioned officers have to pay up to the equivalent of Pounds 8,000 for posts in areas of 'widespread illegal activity'.</p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> ALIEN REPORT GIVEN SOME SOLID SUPPORT  </P> <P> The leader of a Santa Ana citizens advisory group Tuesday defended its  recommendation that police cooperate more with immigration authorities to stem  the flow of illegal aliens into the city.  </P> <P> But Don Hertel, chairman of the Mayor's Task Force on Neighborhood Standards  and Preservation, agreed with critics who charged that membership of the task  force inadequately reflected the population of Santa Ana, where more than half  of the city's 235,000 residents are Latino.  </P> <P> "There was a sense that there was not enough representation in the group," said  Hertel, who is an architect. "We felt that there should have been more Asians  and Latinos in the group, but we were not party to who was going to be on the  task force."  </P> <P> Mayor Daniel H. Young, who appointed the committee a year and half ago, said he  had selected more representatives from different ethnic groups, but members had  gradually dropped out.  </P> <P> "You can't make people stay on citizen advisory groups if they don't want to,"  Young said.  </P> <P> However, former school board member James A. Richards, who headed the  eight-member subcommittee on immigration, said the fact that seven were Anglo  and one was black had nothing to do with the panel's recommendation.  </P> <P> "It's ignorant to think that a person's skin color is going to affect what he  is going to do on the task force," Richards said.  </P> <P> Richards defended the task force's recommendations as being "realistic" for  Santa Ana, adding that the report was intended to be "blunt."  </P> <P> "One of the factors that causes overcrowding is the concentration of illegal  aliens," Richards said. "Santa Ana has become a haven for illegal aliens."  </P> <P> Hertel added: "We don't want neighborhood Gestapo tactics in Santa Ana. But the  city is carrying the burden of illegal aliens here."  </P> <P> Young said he expected the task force report to be controversial.  </P> <P> "We don't want to get into the kind of Costa Mesa debate on what to do with  illegal aliens," Young said, referring to that city's efforts to discourage  aliens from taking up residence there by denying them some services. "But the  city has a major problem that it is trying to deal with. We are trying to be  fair, and we're trying to do the right things."  </P> <P> City Councilman John Acosta, who has criticized the task force for not having  more Latinos and Asians, said he believes that some Santa Ana residents are  fearful of immigrants in general.  </P> <P> "There are some old-time Anglo residents in our community who are running  scared," Acosta said. "They have told me in some instances that they want the  Mexicans to go back to Mexico and they want Asians to get back on the boat and  go home."  </P> <P> The report detailed what it considered to be the city's five most critical  "issues of concern for the 1990s": neighborhood overcrowding, the impact of the  non-English-speaking immigrant population, crime and gang activity, traffic  congestion and the environment. It called for the Santa Ana Police Department  to cooperate with the Immigration and Naturalization Service "to enforce  existing laws and reduce the disproportionate number of undocumented people  settling in the Santa Ana area."

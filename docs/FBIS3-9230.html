He stressed that the SNS would react to all steps taken by  the government. "The SNS is waiting for signals by the  government and then we will response," he noted.    Kona said he was convinced that Slovakia's ethnic Hungarian  parties, with which the new cabinet wants to cooperate, did not  contribute to a calm atmosphere on the Slovak political scene.    Before the early elections scheduled for autumn, the SNS  intends to focus on attitudes of the Hungarian parties and  reactions to them. "The SNS finds it very interesting that it is  the Hungarian parties which hold the balance of power in  Parliament," Kona said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Constitutional Conference has adjourned  sitting until the 11th of next month following some logistic  problems. Our correspondent covering the deliberations in  Abuja reports that although there was no mention of the  problems, this might not be unconnected with lack of necessary  documents for the assignment.    Delegates to the conference had earlier this morning at  their  sitting deplored the situation where many of them were not  provided with the agenda and other necessary documents for the  conference. The delegates also want the conference to be  provided with standing orders that will govern proceedings or  deliberations as well as business committees to look into the  agenda to enhance easy deliberation on issues.    Meanwhile, there has been a reshuffle at the National  Constitutional Conference Commission. A statement from the  commission announced the appointment of new chairmen to head  various subcommittees. They include the constitutional drafting  and documentation committee to be headed by Dr. Beshir Ahmed  Ikara, Alhaji Shehu Malami for finance and administration, and  the general purpose committee will now be headed by Dr. Tunji  Otegbeye. The publicity committee will be chaired by the former  civilian governor of Anambra State, Chief Jim Nwobodo. All  appointments are with immediate effect.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Korean Trade Commission decided yesterday to  launch investigations into the alleged dumping here of imported  caustic soda products from the United States, China, Belgium and  France.    Korea Soda Industry Association, a local manufacturers'  group, filed a complaint with the trade watchdog April 6,  alleging the imported sodium hydroxide, a basic chemical used to  make soap, rayon and paper, was undercutting locally-produced  goods, and damaging the domestic industry.    As to why the commission decided to launch the industrial  probe, an official said that the complaint represented all local  producers; the documents it submitted contained facts on dumping  and industrial injuries; the commission could acknowledge some  of the dumping margins and industrial injuries; and Korea  Customs Administration and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and  Energy are also recognizing the need for investigations.</p>

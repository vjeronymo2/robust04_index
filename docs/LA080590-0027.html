			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOV. DEUKMEJIAN, LEGISLATORS END BUDGET IMPASSE  </P> <P> Gov. Deukmejian, in his economic and social shortsightedness, has leaped off  the path of common sense and landed -- blue pencil and all -- in lame-duck  history. Although it is unfair to blame all of California's ills on a single  professional bureaucrat, he has added to the state's problems, not its  solutions. The tardy budget on which he so viciously fought the Legislature is  a clear indication of the governor's true legacy.  </P> <P> Who suffers? -- the poor, our children, our future. For example, Deukmejian  vindictively knifed educational programs aimed at keeping our kids away from  crime, in school, off of drugs and off of the street. He virtually eliminated a  well-respected testing program (California Assessment Program) which helps  educators gauge their performance -- and the "new assessment program" he is  calling for will take unnecessary time and millions of dollars to put into  place.  </P> <P> Instead of spending much-needed money on training programs that assist people  off of welfare, he has cut funding for such programs, as well as welfare  benefits. $61 million was cut from the community mental health system. Both of  these systems alleviate the homelessness dilemma. Yet, again, our governor has  deemed it wise to add to the ranks of homeless people by strangling the  programs aimed at keeping individuals off of our community sidewalks.  </P> <P> What leads people to drugs and crime: insufficient education and opportunity,  poverty and abuse -- all of which, sooner or later, cause taxpayers a great  deal more money spent on discipline than prevention. By cutting juvenile  justice programs and the Child Abuse Prevention Training Act's funding, our  governor may have balanced this year's state budget, but his decisions will  cost Californians unnecessary dysfunctional years and billions in future  cleanup costs. Deukmejian is leaving this state with a miserable legacy and, in  my opinion, is not leaving office soon enough.  </P> <P> BRIAN YABLON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

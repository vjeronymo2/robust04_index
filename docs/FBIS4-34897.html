			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- For the first time since he began his  campaign for the presidency, PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party] candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso admitted the  possibility of losing the elections to PT [Workers Party]  candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. During a meeting he held  with President Itamar Franco on 21 June, Cardoso made an  objective analysis and expressed his fear that Lula may win in  the first voting round.    "I do not doubt I will be the candidate with the second-most  votes in the first voting round; but then there may be no second  voting round," Fernando Henrique said during his conversation  with Franco.    "Fernando's main concern lately is that Lula may win in the  first voting round," said Senator Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS)  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul], who  attended the meeting.    On account of this concern, Cardoso decided that until the  first voting round he will not attack contenders like Esperidiao  Amin from the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], Leonel Brizola  from the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], and Orestes Quercia from  the PMDB. The strategy is not to harm these candidates now so  they can attract votes from Lula.    "I will not attack anyone now. Their candidacies must grow  so  Lula will not win in the first voting round," Cardoso said.    Cardoso on 22 June asked Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB-AP)  [Amapa] to help him in Congress so the Real Plan will not be  modified. He made this petition informally during a meeting in  the Senate cafeteria where they chatted for 10 minutes  accompanied by Senator Jonas Pinheiro (PTB-AP) [Brazilian Labor  Party], a candidate for Amapa governor, who reported on their  conversation.    Jonas Pinheiro believes Sarney is inclined to support  Cardoso, but not immediately like the PSDB and PFL [Liberal  Front Party] want.    "I feel that he will support Cardoso but Sarney is cautious.  He wants to be sure," Pinheiro said.    Cardoso again said that eventual support from the former  president will be welcomed, but he will not "aggravate" any  politician to support his candidacy.    "I am campaigning among the people. Sarney is a responsible  individual. He must make his own decision," Cardoso said.</p>

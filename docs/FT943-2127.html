			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Home loans fall raises housing recovery fears A fresh reminder of the fragility of the recovery in the UK mortgage market came yesterday with figures showing a slight drop in new net lending by building societies in August. The fall came before the impact of higher interest rates on home loans, reinforcing fears among lenders that the housing market recovery might be delayed until next year. A fall in net new commitments - loans agreed but not yet undertaken - by societies in August compared with July suggested that, even on previous interest rates, prospects were at best flat. This statistic is an important forward-looking indicator, since commitments made in one month tend to translate into loans in the following few weeks. Although the statistics - published by the Building Societies Association - show that lending was higher than in August last year, that difference can be accounted for by a change market shares won by societies as against banks, rather than by growth in the market as a whole. Last summer, societies' share of the mortgage market fell noticeably, as the fixed-rate mortgages offered by banks proved particularly attractive. Leeds Permanent Building Society, the fifth-largest, yesterday became the latest society to increase its standard variable mortgage rate. It raised the rate by 0.4 percentage points, taking it to 8.14 per cent. The sharpest rise to date is from TSB, which has about 250,000 mortgage borrowers. It raised its standard rate by 0.6 percentage points - more than the recent base rate increase - to take it to 8.05 per cent from late October. Announcements from other large lenders are expected this week. The BSA figures show new net lending at Pounds 1.13bn last month, compared with Pounds 1.16bn in July and Pounds 814m in August last year. Net new commitments totalled Pounds 3.02bn in August, compared with Pounds 3.24bn the previous month, and Pounds 2.43bn in August 1993. The figures underlined the need for lenders to strike a fine balance in passing on higher rates. They showed societies receiving net retail deposits of only Pounds 91m in August, compared with Pounds 286m in July. Mr Adrian Coles, BSA director-general, welcomed the fact that the figures were the result of an inflow of retail funds, rather than one of the outflows societies have suffered in many recent months. However, he was cautious about future retail receipts, given the continuing strong competition for personal savings.</p>

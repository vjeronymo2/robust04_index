			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Romanian President Ion Iliescu by Dominique </F> Audibert; date and place not given: "Romania: `There Still Is an  Economic Iron Curtain"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Audibert] The Romanian  revolution will be five years old at the end of the year. What  is your assessment?    [Iliescu] As for the democratic transition process, I  believe that we have achieved the most significant reforms, and  that these have deeply changed Romanian society. We now have a  multiparty political system with genuine freedom of expression  and a veritable boom as far as the press is concerned. Over 200  political parties have emerged, 90 of which participated in the  various elections, whose fairness nobody questioned. All this  was done in record time, and the process must of course continue  and expand. The foundation for a constitutional state and a  democratic society has now been laid in Romania.    [Audibert] But has the rapporteur of the Council of Europe  not just reminded you of some of your commitments concerning the  demilitarization of the police and the rights of the Hungarian  minorities in Romania?    [Iliescu] Look, one can find room for improvement in any  country. I could draw a list, say, for the United States of  America. We do not view ourselves as perfect in this regard,  but I do want to stress the fact that we have made considerable  headway. We are being judged on the matter of national  minorities, but quite frankly, I do not know of a single country  in Europe where minorities have comparable rights. Here, all  minorities are represented in Parliament. Hungarians alone have  39 representatives in the lower and upper houses, and they can  study their native tongue in primary and secondary school. Who  can match this? Not Hungary, I assure you.    [Audibert] What about the economic situation?    [Iliescu] The Cold War is over, but there still is a  veritable economic iron curtain between the West and the East in  general, and Romania in particular. At first, we had the  theoretical advantage of starting out without being burdened by  an external debt. In fact, this turned out to be a liability.  While countries such as Hungary or Poland were showered with  credits, Romania had to beg, and sometimes it felt it was being  treated like a second-class country.    [Audibert] Is the real reason not the fact that you oppose  economic reform?    [Iliescu] But this is crazy! I am not stupid, I am a  realist. On the contrary, I believe we need to get rid of any  ideological prejudices to tackle new national and international  realities. As soon as I was reelected in 1992, I put forward a  project to foster national unity between all parties and to  promote reform and see the country through the transitional  period. My position remains the same today. There is no  alternative to a free and competitive market economy, but it  must include a veritable safety net. The real difficulty is  reconciling these three imperatives.    [Audibert] What causes the deadlock, then?    [Iliescu] We have three groups of enemies. First, people  longing for a return to the previous system, who take advantage  of an obvious social reality: Since 1989, life has been very  difficult and, for most people, democracy without any  improvement in daily life has no value per se. Yet, that old  system which ensured everyone a minimum wage and which those  people want to reinstall is pure fiction in an open economy.  Second are those who would return us to pre-war Romania, who  cannot see that the real challenge is to integrate the country  into the European mainstream. Last, there is a mafia whose only  concern is getting rich by taking advantage of the difficulties  encountered during any period of transition, and which increases  corruption. I for one do not have ties with any of these groups.    [Audibert] What do you think of the return to power of  former Communist parties, as in Poland, or their increased  popularity, as in Hungary or Slovakia?    [Iliescu] This stems from a feeling of disappointment from  people who had applauded the democratization but are  disappointed by the way right-wing parties have managed the  transition. So they turn to left-wing forces in the hope that  they will know how to protect them better. But one should not  overestimate this phenomenon and its extent. I do not believe  in any possibility of reverting to the previous system.    [Audibert] You were the first to adhere to the "Partnership  for Peace" formula offered by NATO. Do you think it is enough  of a security guarantee for Central and Eastern European  countries?    [Iliescu] No, it is not, but it was the best way to avoid  being discriminated with regard to the Visegrad group (Hungary,  Czechoslovakia, Poland), for instance. In future, this  Partnership also needs to become an economic development  partnership. This is a crucial aspect for security in Europe,  one that has not been properly dealt with yet. The military  Iron Curtain is no more, but the economic Iron Curtain may yet  turn out to be even more damaging, a new source of tensions.  Instead of indulging in navel-gazing over its small internal  problems, Europe would do well to become more open to the East  and to study ways to go beyond such disparities.    [Audibert] Many of your neighbors fear new hegemonic  pretensions from Russia in the region. What about you?    [Audibert] Such pretensions exist, there is no doubt about  it. The Russian problem will remain for a long time a hot issue  both for Europe and with respect to the global balance of power.  Russia is and will remain a large country with a huge economic  and military potential. In such a large entity, transition and  stabilization are much more complicated issues than in Romania,  so one sees nationalistic movements cropping up as well as a  kind of imperial nostalgia -- which is understandable in a  country which long held a superpower status equal to that of the  United States. In such a context, the worst mistake one can  make would be to isolate Russia and exclude it from the general  process of European partnership and integration.    [Audibert] Do you believe in a sustainable solution to the  Yugoslavian conflict?    [Iliescu] Romanians feel strongly about Yugoslavia, which  was always our best neighbor. We are deeply affected by the  tragedy of this heroic people, and we have maintained ties with  all parties. However, I consider that the international  community must be more attentive and balanced with respect to  all parties. There is an anti-Serb attitude that is  inappropriate. This war is a tragedy for everyone, and the  Serbs have been suffering as much as the others. The only  sustainable solution is for the belligerents to reach a  political settlement, with the support of the international  community. We all know that there cannot be a purely military  solution. In any event, one thing is certain: the Yugoslav  problem cannot be solved at the Serb's expense.</p>

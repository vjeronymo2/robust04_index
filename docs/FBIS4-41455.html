			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vissarion Sisnev: "Russia-United States: </F> Package of Agreements. Russian Premier V. Chernomyrdin Answers  TRUD Correspondent's Questions"]    [Excerpt] Washington, 24 Jun -- [passage omitted] Your  correspondent asked V.S. Chernomyrdin to express his opinion.    [Sisnev] Forgive me, Viktor Stepanovich, but I want to  repeat a question that I put to you after last year's Washington  meeting. TRUD readers, being closer to the problems of everyday  life than anyone in our society, will wish to know above all  whether this visit will produce anything tangible for ordinary  people.    [Chernomyrdin] There is no need to explain to me who TRUD  readers are. But I can tell both them and the readers of all  other newspapers that money has not been wasted on this trip, in  the social sphere or elsewhere. What, essentially, are the  space-related contracts that we will be bringing home? They  mean support for our industry. For the defense and conversion  sectors, which as a rule are in a very difficult position today.  And Sakhalin-2? In the long term this is a multibillion  contract which provides a solution to funding problems and will  create a large number of new jobs.    I see major social benefits here. I should say that  generally we do not consider, let alone sign any project unless  there is a social program behind it. As for the agreements on  ecology and conversion, will they not be of direct benefit to  people?    [Sisnev] This is your commission's third session. A major  milestone since, as the saying goes, good things come in threes.  It is probably already possible to sum up some general results  in terms of the effectiveness and the practical usefulness of  this mechanism of bilateral partnership, is it not?    [Chernomyrdin] I believe that few bilateral organizations,  particularly as young as ours -- it is not yet one year old --  can honestly claim to have produced such undoubted benefit, and  practical benefit too. I can say without exaggeration or  bragging that much has been done during this brief time. We,  the Russian side, take a very responsible attitude to our  obligations in the permanent commission, and it is fair to say  the same of our U.S. colleagues. For his part Vice President  Gore is trying very persistently to ensure that the mechanism we  have created really works efficiently. The chief thing is that  we do not shirk any issues, that we are expanding our activity  and intend to expand it further.    [Sisnev] You talked for quite a long time with President  Clinton. Were political aspects touched on during that  conversation? Was an assessment made of the state of relations  between the United States and Russia? As you well know, Viktor  Stepanovich, there are "prophets" on both sides of the Atlantic  ready at the drop of a hat to predict that these relations will  develop into acute rivalry, if not worse -- in short, that they  will inevitably collapse.    [Chernomyrdin] Of course political problems were discussed.  As regards assessments, our bilateral relations were assessed  only on a positive plane. They proceed in the ascendant from  one presidential meeting to the next. With regard to the claim  that relations could "collapse," that is simply stupid. Such a  development is ruled out. Relations are improving and will  continue to improve -- write that down. [Chernomyrdin ends]    Right after this brief interview the chairman of the Russian  Federation Government left for Detroit, where his present visit  to America will end in talks with the leadership of General  Motors, the world's largest motor vehicle building company.</p>

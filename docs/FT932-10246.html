			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Letter: Folly of pouring Pounds 800m into 'black hole' of EC agriculture Sir, With reference to your leader 'Fraud in the EC' (May 5), the UK presidency in reaching agreement at the Edinburgh summit last December on the future financing of the EC, clearly did not help tax-payers by agreeing that agricultural spending could be bailed out by an extra Pounds 800m. The chickens are now coming home to roost. This week the Commission presented its preliminary draft budget for the EC for 1994. A monetary reserve of Ecu1bn exists in the EC's budget but it has only ever been used twice in the past. On those occasions the absolute ceiling fixed for agricultural spending (the guideline) was not exceeded and the overspend related solely to dollar/Ecu fluctuations. Now the financial regulation is to be altered to allow for European Monetary System fluctuations - this has never been the case in the past. It is already predicted that this will exceed the agricultural guideline by Ecu1.3bn in 1994. With creative accounting and good luck the Commission will be expected to get this down to an Ecu1bn overspend by use of the reserve. It does seem worth asking whether the UK is satisfied that a further Pounds 800m should be poured into this black hole of agricultural spending when fraud in the existing system is so widespread and when other issues such as job creation are paramount. Terry Wynn, general rapporteur for the 1994 EC budget, 105 Corporation Street, St Helens, Merseyside</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ben Maclennan] </F>   [Text] East London April 7 SAPA -- Representatives of  several political parties and other interest groups on Thursday  [7 April] agreed on a code of conduct for free political  activity in the Eastern Cape region. They also drew up  proposals for a national code of conduct for the security forces  during the elections.    Several important players in the region were absent from the  all-day meeting in East London, among them the Transkei  government and its security forces, the Democratic Party [DP],  the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] and its armed wing the Azanian  Peoples Liberation Army.    Independent Electoral Commission Eastern Cape Mediation  Director Stax Masango said he had sent invitations directly to  Transkei ruler Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa and the PAC, while DP  leader Dr Zach de Beer had played an important behind-the-scenes  role in encouraging people to attend the meeting. "We are not  sure why they are not here," he said. "We haven't received any  apologies from them."    He said the absentees would be invited to a follow-up  meeting  in East London on Tuesday next week.    Representatives of the African Christian Democratic Party,  African Democratic Movement, African National Congress, National  Party, Ciskei's interim administration and defence force, SA's  Police and Defence Forces and business and farmers'  organisations, agreed on a ten-point code of conduct for parties.    Among the points were a commitment to free and fair  political  activity in the region, a promise not to disturb other parties'  meetings, and an undertaking to lodge complaints about breaches  of the code with the Independent Electoral Commission. "The  reason why the parties have accepted this code of conduct is  that it is a reaffirmation of the principles of the Electoral  Act and its regulations," said Mr Masango. "They merely wanted  to express their commitment in a forum and also in public."    Contraventions of the code could be dealt with through the  Electoral Act. But the parties had also acknowledged this was a  historic meeting "and if they did not abide by this, history  would judge them".    Among the issues which delegates felt should be dealt with  in  a code for security forces were protection of basic human  rights, use of armed force, protection of polling stations and  the relationship between the security forces and the media.    Mr Masango said the purpose of the code was to help the  police and defence force to understand their functions and  limits "under such difficult circumstances".    The proposals would be forwarded to the Transitional  Executive Council for adoption, he said. If the code was  promulgated nationally, it would have to be accompanied by a  massive public information campaign.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Thomas Cook chief may quit at First Choice First Choice Holidays, formerly Owners Abroad, is in talks with Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank, which controls a 21 per cent stake in it, that could lead to boardroom changes. Among options are the resignation from First Choice's board of Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive of Thomas Cook. He would be replaced by a director from WestLB, which owns 90 per cent of Thomas Cook. Mr Francis Baron, First Choice chief executive, has made no secret of his desire to strengthen links with WestLB. Thomas Cook bought the 21 per cent stake in First Choice last year, helping it to fight a hostile takeover bid from Airtours, a rival tour operator. First Choice, known as Owners Abroad until August this year, had hoped that the link with Thomas Cook would enable it to make substantial savings through co-operation with LTU, the German travel company 34 per cent owned by WestLB. By October, however, relations with the German bank had been soured and few of the planned benefits had been realised. It is understood that the 'strategic alliance' has failed to win cost savings through shared aircraft maintenance, fuel buying and spares purchasing. Nor has it given First Choice greater muscle in holiday booking. However the retail side of Thomas Cook has delivered a significant amount of business.</p>

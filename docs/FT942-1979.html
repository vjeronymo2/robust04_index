			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Procter deal is cleared by Brussels The European Commission yesterday cleared the way for Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer goods multinational, to take over Schickendanz, a leading German maker of sanitary pads, after deciding that the company would not dominate the German and Spanish markets. Brussels approved the controversial deal after P&amp;G agreed, at the last minute, to sell Camelia, one of the Bavarian company's main brands, within 12 months of the takeover. The Commission had been worried that the joint forces of P&amp;G's Always brand of sanitary pads and Vereinigte Papierwerke Schickendanz's Camelia would hinder competition by giving P&amp;G 60 per cent of the German market and 81 per cent of the Spanish market. In Germany, P&amp;G's nearest competitor, Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare products company, has only a small market share. By selling Camelia, the merger will increase P&amp;G's share to about 40 per cent - by value - with Camelia holding about 25 per cent and Johnson &amp; Johnson about 10 per cent. Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said the merger, together with the divestment of the Camelia business by P&amp;G was 'a good thing for competition and a good thing for the consumer'. If there are too few companies in a market, this can only be bad for prices, bad for consumer choice, he said. The case has been one of the most complicated takeovers to come before the Commission. It was on the verge of being blocked earlier this month, but at the last minute, P&amp;G came forward with the offer to sell Camelia in order to win clearance for the deal. The Commission has blocked only one deal in the two-and-half years since it was given increased powers to vet large mergers. Of the mergers that have been notified to the Commission, roughly 90 per cent are cleared within a month. Only 10 per cent of the mergers notified to the Commission have had to be substantially changed to win approval. For the remaining 10 per cent of deals, the Commission has demanded that the interested parties - in virtually all cases - make substantial changes before it has approved them. Mr Van Miert said yesterday this case had caused the Commission difficulty because of the speed with which it had to deal with last-minute undertakings from P&amp;G. He said he would like to make Commission procedure on mergers more transparent. One way to do this would be to make the interested parties offer undertakings at least one month before the Commission's final deadline for deciding whether or not a merger is allowable. The need for greater transparency was more urgent in view of the sharp rise in notifications of mergers received by the Commission this year, said Mr Van Miert. He added that the increase possibly reflected the pick-up in economic activity across the EU.</p>

Terry Judge said. No weapon has  been recovered. Homicide Detective Sgt. David Krishna said he has suspects but  would not elaborate. He would not discuss motives or say if anything was taken  from the home in the 5300 block of Huddart Avenue.  </P> <P> Beth Garcia, a co-worker who knew Pedroni, said Pedroni had worked at the  Galleria for five years and was called "Grandma" by the mostly younger workers.  "She was really a fun lady to work with," said Garcia, adding that everyone  cried, "even the guys," when they heard about her death.  </P></p>

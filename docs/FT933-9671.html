			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Fine day for Virgin in Paris: Megastore open despite FFr1m Sunday trading penalty VIRGIN, the British leisure group, yesterday again defied the French authorities by opening its opulent megastore on the Champs Elysees in Paris, even though it meant paying a legal fine of FFr1m (Pounds 114,000). Mr Patrick Zelnick, the flamboyant chairman of Virgin in France who has led the two-year battle against France's Sunday trading ban, described yesterday's opening as 'a bit like a last stand'. The shop opened as usual at noon with a banner emblazoned across its facade saying 'In the name of Sunday we'll fight to the end.' Virgin said, however, that it would decide this week whether to open next Sunday. The latest bout of the Sunday trading battle began last month when the CGT trade union won a court order to force Virgin to close on Sundays. It has continued to trade despite the ban and on Friday won an appeal to reduce its fine from FFr4m to FFr1m. 'It's obvious that we can't carry on paying such huge penalties,' said Mr Zelnick, who throughout the Sunday campaign has shown the same flair for attracting media attention as Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's founder. 'But we're still opening the store today to show how stupid the situation has become.' The Champs Elysees megastore, set in a lavishly renovated banking hall, usually attracts 30,000 customers and generates a fifth of its weekly sales on Sundays. The timing of the current skirmish could scarcely be better for Virgin, which would otherwise have expected to see business slow down in August, a holiday month in France. 'This is the first time I've been here,' said Ms Severine Hinault, 22, a student from the Paris suburbs. 'I didn't even realise Virgin was open on Sundays until I saw the television coverage of the campaign. The store looked so great that I had to come.' 'I'm here to show my support for Virgin,' said Mr Guillaume Rochard, a 23-year-old office worker. 'I often come on Sundays to spend a couple of hours in the store. I work all week so I don't have time to shop. Why shouldn't Virgin open on Sundays? It isn't doing any harm.' The shop has set up a special counter where Mr Rochard can sign a petition in support of its campaign. Mr Branson has said 450,000 people have signed so far. Virgin also sells campaign T-shirts - bearing the slogan 'I vote yes to the Virgin megastore opening on Sunday' - for FFr44 each. Virgin has stepped up its lobby to persuade the government to reform the 1906 Sunday trading laws. Mr Branson last week threatened to scrap his plans for expansion in France, which could involve creating 1,000 jobs in five years by opening 25 new shops. The government has been split over the Virgin battle. Mr Jacques Toubon, arts minister, has argued that Virgin should be exempted from the Sunday ban. Mr Michel Giraud, employment minister and the chief target of the union protest, has urged Virgin to respect the law but promised that parliament will debate the 1906 legislation this autumn.</p>

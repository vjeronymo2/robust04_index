			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Alonso de Contreras] </F>   [Text] Santo Domingo, 10 May (EFE) -- The U.S. Government  has assumed an antagonistic role in the upcoming Dominican  general elections with the publication of a note by its  ambassador in Santo Domingo voicing concern over the conditions  of the upcoming elections.    The note, which was rejected last night by President Joaquin  Balaguer, says: "The importance of the Dominican (democratic)  achievement increases our concern because of violent incidents  that have occurred during the electoral campaign and because of  the belief by some Dominicans that there will be an electoral  fraud."    Last night, a few days before the general elections on 16  May  and before the electoral campaign concludes on 14 May, Balaguer  declared the note issued by U.S. Ambassador Robert Pastorino as  nonsense.    Balaguer stated that the Dominican Republic has achieved  such  a level of development that it will not permit laws to be  violated or the people's will to be mocked this coming Monday.    He added that there will not be any fraud because the  Central  Electoral Board comprises people of "irreproachable ethics" and  "also, the country has achieved such a level of development,  that it will not permit the violation of laws or the mockery of  the peoples' votes whatsoever."    In addition, the U.S. ambassador recognized in his public  note that "the Central Electoral Board (Dominican), advised by  international experts, has worked arduously to implement the  mechanisms that regulate fair elections. "We hope your work  will pursue that goal. The presence of international observers  underlines the importance of respecting the legitimacy of the  people's will. "We appeal to all the participating political  parties in the Dominican elections to work to curb the climate  of violence and to promote fair and clean elections."    The United States, through its ambassador, also implicitly  supports the "Civic Pact" proposed by opposition candidate Jose  Francisco Pena Gomez -- whom it does not cite -- so that no  party will claim victory before the official results are  announced.    "We applaud the concepts voiced by political leaders in the  proposed Civic Pact which seeks to ensure an atmosphere of peace  and order in the elections," the embassy notes says. "The U.S.  Government and people are completely neutral regarding which  candidate or political party wins the elections. Nonetheless,  we are extremely interested in seeing that the people's will be  respected through fair and honest elections."    The U.S. Embassy's entering the Dominican electoral game has  sparked a national controversy. In addition to the position  voiced by the president, the opinion of Dominican political  circles is divided among those who feel that the statement is a  healthy call for vigilance while others feel that it is an  interference in the domestic affairs of the country.    National Assembly President Jose Oswaldo Leger describes it  as "meddling" in national internal issues, emphasizing that the  Dominican people are qualified to resolve, by themselves,  internal problems resulting from the electoral process. "The  ambassadors accredited to the country (Dominican Republic) must  be respectful of our sovereignty," he said.    Angel Lockward, leader of the ruling Social Christian  Reformist Party, agreed with Leger and rejected the U.S.  Government's note. The public letter, however, was praised by  other politicians, including Hatuey Decamps, secretary general  and spokesman for the Dominican Revolutionary Party.    Regardless of whether the note represents U.S. interference  in the Dominican electoral process or not, observers and other  diplomats in Santo Domingo emphasize that the U.S. remarks are  like preaching to the choir.    In the last part of the Dominican electoral campaign, which  has been marked from the beginning -- mid-February -- by  political leaders disavowing each other, there has been a lack  of government proposals, while violence has claimed at least 10  lives and all parties have increased their warnings of fraud.    When EFE asked a diplomat accredited in Santo Domingo, who  requested his name not be disclosed, what he thought about the  U.S. note, he merely answered: "He who has ears should listen."</p>

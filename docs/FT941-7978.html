			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Management: Survival in a war of succession - Pruning the family tree can avoid damaging intra-family company politics Paul O'Hea, managing director of Colt Group, is in an unusual position. At 35 he is in charge of a thriving Hampshire-based maker of air-conditioning and ventilation systems with sales of Pounds 92m and manufacturing sites in three European countries. He is also the third generation O'Hea to control Colt, which was founded by his grandfather. This achievement grants the O'Heas membership of an exclusive club of families whose companies have survived what is often a debilitating war of succession. The transition has apparently been seamless. Paul's uncle, Jerome O'Hea, whom he succeeded at Christmas, has become chairman and moved his office to his home; he promises to visit the company only once a fortnight. And Alan O'Hea, Paul's father, who ran the business for 30 years after taking over from founder Jack O'Hea when he was 32, is president and performs a largely ambassadorial role. But the O'Hea story is something of a rarity. There are, of course, other examples of successful succession. The Hoare family has just introduced the eleventh generation at the private London bank and Wates, the builders, is now run by the grandson of the founder. But like Colt, these are exceptions. According to Alden Lank, professor of family enterprises at IMD, the Lausanne-based international management school, only 15 per cent of family companies that manage to survive five years are successfully passed on to a third generation. 'The problem of succession is the single most important reason for family businesses not to continue over the long term,' Lank says. 'Families just can't get their hands around this issue.' A more typical story is that of GH Zeal, a south London manufacturer of thermometers. Stephen Zeal, a graduate of the London Business School, says Zeal is a 'very typical family business'. 'My father and uncle were the third generation entering a cash-rich business in the 1950s with sufficient resources to compensate for mistakes made.' When he joined in the late 1970s, the company had sales of about Pounds 3.5m. 'I came in as the fourth generation with lots of ideas, the eldest of four boys,' says Zeal. But its traditional thermometer market started to come under pressure from electronic products. Declining sales meant a disproportionately large overhead became a constraint on further development. The company needed more cash but Stephen Zeal says his father and uncle lacked enough confidence in the company's future to request extra resources from the family. 'There was a slow and sluggish response to business demands,' Zeal says. 'The issue was the ability or inability of the family members to take timely commercial decisions.' He left and set up his own company making electronic temperature gauges. As a result of the company's financial position, the family decided the only way to secure value from the business - then only breaking even - was to sell to a management buy-out, a decision Stephen Zeal deeply regrets. 'There was an in-house fight between myself and the older generation,' says Zeal. 'The big problem was the family had run out of money and the company had continued to decline.' Zeal believes the problems were exacerbated because shareholdings were dispersed between about 20 family members, via various trusts. As a result, the executive directors lacked the motivation to take further personal financial risk on behalf of the other members of the family, he says. 'If the family directors felt solely responsible for themselves and their own shares then maybe a decision would have been taken to put further security down to generate more cash,' says Zeal. Lank says private companies in this situation need to anticipate such problems by 'pruning the family tree'. To avoid intra-family politics that can follow when no one member owns a significant stake, early action is needed, he says. In Colt's case Alan O'Hea's father did the first pruning. 'My father recognised this very early on and set up a structure in 1959 of discretionary trusts to hold Colt shares,' says Paul O'Hea. A second pruning is under way with the company buying out the interests of the founder's two daughters. 'We faced the fact that the family grows exponentially and the family business does not,' says Jerome O'Hea. 'We realised it would not be possible for Paul and his cousins to manage to sustain ever increasing numbers of shareholders.' Another option, if there are enough assets, is to split them between offspring and disallow cross-directorships. The Swiss-based Schmidheiny family, which has diversified industrial investments, took this route. Alternatively, shares can be split into voting and non-voting shares so that management control is entrusted to a smaller number of hands. 'If you are worried about shareholders setting up coalitions your thinking time is spent wondering how to manage the politics of the family,' says Lank. Paul O'Hea is also convinced that a succession plan should be clearly articulated. Colt announced Alan O'Hea's retirement date six years ago. And Paul O'Hea is clear about how often he would like to see his uncle in the office. 'IJ would turn up regularly,' says Paul O'Hea of Colt's founder, Jack O'Hea. 'I get the impression it will be easier for me because we have learned.' Looking forward, Paul O'Hea realises the rights of those family members not working for Colt is an issue he must tackle. For the first 30 years of Colt's existence family members did not receive dividends. He recognises the potential conflict between his interests, as a professional manager drawing a salary and running a company car, and the desires of some of the non-working family members to capitalise on their inheritance. 'I am in the business to keep it private and to grow it,' he says. 'My view is we will go on pruning the family tree as long as the company can provide the cash to do it.'</p>

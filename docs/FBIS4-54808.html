			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Commentaries appearing in mid-April on  the editorial pages of three Budapest journals with different  political orientations all indicated that the Hungarian  Socialist Party (MSZP), successor to the former ruling Communist  Party's reformist wing, is likely to win the parliamentary  election in the two rounds of voting on 8 and 29 May. The  consensus is apparently so widespread that even a supporter of  the present right-of-center coalition, PESTI HIRLAP, in a 14  April commentary by Ferenc Sinkovics, admitted that "every day  it becomes unequivocally clearer: The MSZP will win the  election." Most of Sinkovics's commentary was devoted to  predicting the problems an MSZP government would face. Noting  that the communist system collapsed irrevocably and cannot be  reinstated, especially since there is no longer any "Big  Brother" behind it, Sinkovics asserted that the MSZP will be  "forced to accept building a market economy" and will lose  support when it becomes clear that it is no more successful than  the present government in lowering prices--which, to Hungarian  voters, "is more important than any principle or ideology."  Noting that Hungary may follow the example of Poland, where  society became "disappointed and impatient" with the leftist  government "in a few months" when it failed to improve the  economy, Sinkovics noted that "we cannot be sure that the  socialist government will last" until the next scheduled  election in 1998.    Although more ambiguous than the PESTI HIRLAP piece, an  editorial commentary by Istvan Csurka--who was expelled last  fall for his far right views from the more centrist Hungarian  Democratic Forum (MDF), the leading party of the present  government--also indicated that the MSZP is likely to win the  election. In an editorial published on 21 April in his weekly  MAGYAR FORUM, Csurka chastized the MDF for its "arrogant  refusal" to accept the proposal of his party, the Hungarian  Justice and Life Party (MIEP), that they and the other  "national" parties--the Christian Democratic People's Party and  the Independent Smallholders Party--form a coalition against the  left. Unless the moderate right and far right agree to  cooperate, Csurka asserted, the MSZP will be in a position to  "choose its own coalition," most likely forming a government  with the main liberal party, the Alliance of Free Democrats  (SZDSZ). The only outcome that would be "even worse" than an  MSZP-SZDSZ government would be a coalition of the MDF, the  Christian Democrats, the Smallholders and the liberals, in which  the "national forces" would be a mere "meaningless decoration,"  Csurka wrote. The MIEP would not join such a coalition under  any circumstances, Csurka declared.    Arguing that the election must not be allowed to become a  "duel" between the right and left, Ferenc Pallagi in the 14  April issue of the trade union daily NEPSZAVA urged liberals to  unite and present a viable alternative both to the present  right-of-center government and to the socialists, "whose  popularity has grown incredibly in recent months." If the two  main liberal parties -- SZDSZ and the Federation of Young  Democrats (Fidesz) -- do not cooperate more effectively, Pallagi  said, the "liberal center" will "disappear," leaving only the  left and right. Of these, the left has the "bigger possibility"  of winning, for there is "little chance" that voters will  support the parties of the present government, of which the  public is "visibly more afraid," Pallagi argued, "than of the  reddest left." Thus, he suggested, unless the liberals regain  momentum, the left will get a commanding lead in the election.  "And, having won by too much, the Socialist Party will have a  hard time trying to form a government," Pallagi said, because no  prospective coalition partner will want to lend its "name and  political prestige" to a government that "it will hardly be able  to influence." It is possible, however, that the left's victory  will be so great that it will be able to govern alone, "without  any control"--a prospect, according to Pallagi, that may be  "just as repellent" as the "right-wing rule" of the present  government.</p>

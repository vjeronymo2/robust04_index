			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Prescriptions for world prosperity: No walls around Europe - Leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialised states meet in Munich this week. Four senior economic ministers set out their contrasting views on the micro-economic and structural challenges facing the former states of the Soviet Union, eastern Europe and the west The discussions which will attract most attention in Munich will be those about the integration of Russia, and/or the rest of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, into the political and economic structures of the west. The debate will be concerned with the macroeconomic policies to be applied in Russia, the financial assistance which can be supplied by the west and the role of international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund. But that is not the whole story. The Russian economy will never recover unless its industry is restructured to respond to market needs and to produce the goods which consumers at home and abroad want to buy when they want to buy them. Equally, western markets need to be open to those goods which Russia can produce and sell competitively. In fact, open markets are vital to all our economies. As president of the UK Board of Trade, it is my priority to do whatever I can to help British industry win business all over the world. But when it comes to trade, Britain's national interest is one and the same as that of any other country. We all have a common interest in trade liberalisation, in ensuring open markets in which everyone can compete. Without competition, we stagnate; we all lose. Open trade and competition are not simply philosophical or political subjects for sterile debate. Their benefits are experienced by all of us every day. In the high street, consumers have the choice to buy the goods and services they want. They get better quality and value for money. And providers of goods and services benefit from the opportunities of one large free market. That is what the single European market is all about. More than 90 per cent of the measures originally identified as necessary for its completion have been agreed. During the UK presidency of the European Community, we shall ensure the process is completed. And when it is completed, it must be made to work. There must be no wall around Europe that would deny us the benefits of competition throughout the world's markets. Some people say the only countries that really benefit from trade are the industrialised nations of western Europe, North America and Japan - the rich north; it does not help the developing nations of the south. This is not so. Of course, no one can deny the ever growing need for aid on humanitarian grounds; such needs cannot be in dispute. But that is a separate issue. The real key to growth and development in the poorer countries is for them to be able to sell their products in a sympathetic trading climate. That brings me to the Uruguay Round of the Gatt negotiations. A successful conclusion to the round, through its impact on world trade, will do more for the developing countries than the whole of the EC's overseas aid budget. A GATT round deal is within easy reach; we must not let it slip from our grasp. The same principle applies to the development and stabilisation of eastern and central Europe. Certainly we must provide economic and technical help. But ultimately, democracy and efficient market economies will flourish only as part of an international market free of barriers to trade, where healthy competition is the engine of efficiency, innovation, quality and choice.

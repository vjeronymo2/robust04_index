			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister to press France over electricity exports BRITAIN IS to explore the possibility of using the French interconnector to export electricity supplies to Spain and Italy, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, told MPs last night. He said this would be among the matters discussed by Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, in talks with the French government in Paris today. Underlining the difficulties in securing an expanded market for deep-mined coal, Mr Heseltine rejected some of the key proposals made by the Commons trade and industry committee designed to limit the pit closures originally proposed by the government. He ruled out government action to drastically curtail electricity supplied from France via the French interconnector, saying it would be contrary to the Treaty of Rome which established the EC. 'The proposal put forward by the select committee to reduce the amount of electricity coming across the interconnector from the present 6.5m tonnes of coal equivalent to zero or anywhere near this is not an option,' he said. Acknowledging that many MPs had been attracted by the idea of ending electricity imports from France, he stressed that adopting such a course would have put the government at 'considerable financial risk' in relation to indemnities given to the privatised electricity companies. Mr Heseltine also warned that the select committee's recommendation calling for the removal of Electricite de France's non-leviable status might well have the effect of it being allowed access to the same premium prices available to Nuclear Electric financed through the levy. Mr Heseltine cast doubt on the practicality of the committee's conclusion that it ought to be possible to find a market for an additional 16m tonnes or more of deep-mined coal in each of the next five years. He disputed the committee's estimate that a subsidy costing Pounds 500m would expand the market by 80m tonnes. While talks were continuing with the generators he could not agree that such a result could be achieved at a cost of no more than Pounds 5 per tonne. To Tory cheers, Mr Heseltine said the government would not be prepared to legislate - as the committee recommended - to require the electricity generators to take coal at a price and in a quantity that they judged to be against their commercial interests. A Labour motion condemning the government's failure to support manufacturing industry and deploring the return of mass unemployment was defeated by 39 votes (302-263).</p>

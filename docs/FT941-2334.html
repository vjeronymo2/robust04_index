			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Krajina talks hold the key to overall peace deal Prospects for an overall peace settlement in former Yugoslavia hang in the balance today, with the Croatian government due to meet Serb leaders of Krajina, the self-styled Serb state in Croatia. Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the region will mediate in today's negotiations, which are considered crucial for cementing a settlement between the Bosnian Croats and Moslems. Any such settlement would determine the status of internal borders in Bosnia and Croatia. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia said yesterday that peace in Bosnia 'will not be reached until the question of Krajina is solved', the Serbian daily Politika reported. The future status of Krajina could determine what boundary concessions the Bosnian Serbs are prepared to make to the Bosnian Croats and Moslems, who signed an accord in Washington last week. That accord paves the way for a Bosnian Croat/Moslem federation in one part of Bosnia which will have a loose confederation relationship with Croatia. But it failed to address the federation's new boundaries, largely because any agreement on boundaries depend on what relationship President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia wants with the Bosnian Serbs - and with the Serbs in Krajina. An agreement on Krajina's status could also lead to a peace treaty between Croatia and Serbia. Mr Tudjman is demanding the return of Serb-held territories to Croatian control. But Mr Milan Martic, leader of Krajina, who takes instructions from Mr Milosevic, yesterday repeated that he would accept 'nothing less than self-determination' for the Serbs. This would amount to independence for their 'state' carved out during a six-month war in 1991 - something Mr Tudjman would never accept. Mr Martic agreed to back the Russian initiative for today's talks, which will be held in the Russian embassy in Zagreb, partly because Mr Milosevic wants a peace accord with Croatia which would eventually end sanctions against his country. Mr Churkin remains optimistic, according to the Serbian media, which reported that 'both sides wanted to endorse a settlement'. Before any real compromises can be made, said Mr Slobodan Jarcevic, Krajina's foreign minister, the two sides must agree on a ceasefire and the withdrawal of the Croatian army from Krajina. According to Belgrade radio, the Serbian delegation will include Admiral Dusan Rakic, defence minister, General Mile Novakovic, national security adviser, and Mr Jarcevic. The Croatian delegation is expected to be led by Mr Hrvoje Sarinic, the republic's national security adviser. Meanwhile, in Bosnia, as part of the growing Croat/Moslem rapprochement, President Alija Izetbegovic invited Mr Tudjman to visit Sarajevo as 'another step towards implementing the agreement'. Bosnian Serb forces have positioned weapons inside the exclusion zone around Sarajevo, the United Nations claimed yesterday. Three tanks, three anti-aircraft cannon, four howitzers and 18 mortars have been found, although they are not pointing at Sarajevo and 'are not capable of engaging Sarajevo', according to a spokesman. The Bosnian Serbs claim the weapons are outside the zone.</p>

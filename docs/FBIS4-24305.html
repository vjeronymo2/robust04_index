			<p>BFN     [Text] The 30-point agenda for the national constitutional  conference has been published. It was drawn up by the national  constitutional conference commission which based the agenda on  the memoranda submitted to it. The first item on the agenda is  on the philosophical foundation of the Nigerian state. It  proposes four different terms for consideration by the  conference. These include the philosophies of one united  country or a unitary state, as well as a federation or  confederation.    An analysis by the constitutional conference commission  shows  that 60 of the total memoranda received were in support of one  united country, while 205 were in support of a federation. The  philosophy of a confederation received the support of 43  memoranda and only one memorandum was in support of a unitary  government. Another point of the agenda concerns the political  structure of the Nigerian state. The constitutional conference  is to consider three different forms. One is a two-tiers system  which has a central government and a local government without  state administration, or a central government with state  governments without local administrations. The second form is a  three-tiers system like the present one in the country while the  third proposal is a four-tiers system of central government,  regional governments, state governments, and local governments.</p>

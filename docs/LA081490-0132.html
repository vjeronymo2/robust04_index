			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> ACCIDENT FORCES FREEWAY CLOSURE  </P> <P> All northbound lanes of the San Diego Freeway were temporarily closed Monday  after a truck driver apparently made an unsafe lane change and triggered a  four-vehicle collision, the California Highway Patrol said.  </P> <P> A 25-year-old San Pedro woman and her 8-month-old infant received minor  injuries in the accident, which occurred about 11:25 a.m. north of the Harbor  Boulevard off-ramp, CHP spokeswoman Linda Burrus said.  </P> <P> The accident apparently started when William P. Maggs, 37, of Phoenix clipped  the back of a Hyundai sedan with his flatbed trailer truck while changing  lanes, Burrus said.  </P> <P> After hitting the Hyundai, Maggs drifted into another lane into the path of a  gasoline truck, Burrus said. The driver of the gasoline truck hit the back end  of Maggs' truck and then struck the side of a Toyota pickup, she said.  </P> <P> All the northbound lanes near Harbor Boulevard were closed for about 15  minutes, and three lanes were closed for nearly an hour while crews worked to  clear the wreckage, Burrus said. Maggs was not cited pending an investigation  of the accident, Burrus said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NORDIQUES STAY HOT AND RALLY PAST FLAMES, 4-3  </P> <P> Robert Picard broke a tie with a shorthanded goal in the second period, and  Peter Stastny added a power-play goal in the third as the Quebec Nordiques  surprised the Calgary Flames, 4-3, Saturday night at Quebec for their third  straight victory.  </P> <P> Mario Gosselin stopped 35 shots for the Nordiques, who beat the powerful Flames  for the first time in 3 games and achieved their longest winning streak of the  season.  </P> <P> "We're getting ahead early and we're not having to make up deficits," Gosselin  said. "And we're playing better when we have a lead. We're not pulling back and  letting the other team take the game away from us."  </P> <P> The Nordiques went 9 games without a victory before embarking on their winning  streak.  </P> <P> Mark Hunter scored at 18:40 of the final period to get the Flames close, but  Gosselin held them off in the final 80 seconds.  </P> <P> Quebec took a 2-0 lead on goals by Mario Marois and Michel Goulet in the first  period, but the Flames got even on goals by Theoren Fleury and Joel Otto before  the period ended.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 7, Edmonton 4 -- Mario Lemieux scored 2 goals and had 5 assists as  the Penguins downed the Oilers at Edmonton, Canada.  </P> <P> "It was just one of those games where everything went in," said Lemieux, who  increased his league-leading totals to 52 goals and 77 assists for 129 points.  </P> <P> Lemieux has been involved in each of the Penguins' last 12 goals over a 3-game  span, scoring 3 and assisting on 9.  </P> <P> Paul Coffey, traded by the Oilers to Pittsburgh last season, added a goal and 2  assists as the Penguins won for only the second time in 16 career visits to the  Northlands Coliseum and moved into second place in the Patrick Division, 1  point ahead of the Washington Capitals. They remain 3 points behind the New  York Rangers.  </P> <P> Montreal 4, Toronto 3 -- Guy Carbonneau scored 2 goals, and Mats Naslund was  credited with a goal that the Maple Leafs accidentally knocked into their own  net as the Canadiens won at Montreal.  </P> <P> Defenseman Todd Gill scored 2 goals for the Maple Leafs, who set up a close  finish when Mark Osborne's goal at 13:43 of the third period pulled them to  within a goal.  </P> <P> A goal by Toronto's Tom Fergus was disallowed moments later because referee  Kerry Fraser had called an interference penalty on the Leafs' Craig Laughlin.  </P> <P> New York Rangers 5, Vancouver 4 -- Kelly Kisio scored from the crease just 1:59  into overtime, and the Rangers slipped past the Canucks at Vancouver,Canada.  </P> <P> It was the first victory for the Rangers in their last 19 overtime games.

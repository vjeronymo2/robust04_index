			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> correspondent Jacobo Zabludovsky; Peres in English with  superimposed translation into Spanish; from the "24 Hours"  newscast -- live]    [Text] [Zabludovsky] Good evening, Mr. Peres. Thank you  for granting us this interview.    [Peres] Thank you.    [Zabludovsky] Mr. Peres, Israel and Mexico have had  diplomatic relations since 1952. What is the current state of  these relations?    [Peres] Between Mexico and Israel?    [Zabludovsky] Yes, please.    [Peres] Well, first of all, Mexico has changed considerably.  It is not the same Mexico since I last visited. I think Mexico  is in the middle of a change and in the future it will undergo  greater change. Soon, we will see great economic, social, and  other changes in Mexico. I have a lot of admiration for all  that Mexico has achieved and is achieving.    Israel has also changed. We went through many wars; we won  them and now we are waging the greatest war of all, which is the  war for peace. I am sure that we will win this war as well.    We would like to establish cooperation with Mexico in four  different areas. In the economic area, we would like to have a  parallel agreement between Mexico and Israel like the one that  exists between the United States of America and Israel. Second,  we would like to avoid double taxation. Third, we would like to  establish scientific and technological cooperation between  Mexico and Israel. Fourth, and most important from my  viewpoint, is the need to strengthen our cultural exchanges.  Mexico, like the rest of Latin America, is a great continent  for literature, art, painting, and sculpture. In Israel,  culture is a priority. I think we should bring our respective  countries' authors and the readers together to have a cultural  exchange and not only political and economic exchanges.    [Zabludovsky] Can you tell us about relations between Israel  and the Vatican?    [Peres] That is really something sensational. For the past  1,994 years, our relations with the Catholic world have had  their ups and downs, more downs than ups. For the first time,  we have reached an understanding that was formulized by the  Vatican and Israel. In January of this year, we signed an  agreement to exchange ambassadors. The signing of the agreement  was done in Jerusalem. It is a dramatic, historic, and  religious change between two important religions. This is the  result of a diplomatic event that happens once every 2,000 years  and I am very glad that it happened this year. I am looking  forward to a new understanding for tolerance between the  Christian world and the Jewish world. I have had the pleasure  to invite the Pope to visit Israel and I understand that he will  do it in the near future. He told me that the Lord extended his  life so that he would be able to visit Israel, Jerusalem, and  the Holy Land.    [Zabludovsky] Mr. Peres, you have been one of those who made  many efforts to attain peace with the PLO. What is currently  happening in the Middle East?    [Peres] I think the Middle East will change like the rest of  the world. There is a new wind blowing all over the place.  What is happening today is that the real political strengths  are neither the political parties, nor the traditional armies,  nor the influential super powers. The most important force is  this camera because people, young and old, are waking up every  morning and seeing what is happening in the world. They ask  themselves: Why is it that in other countries people can move  around freely, have a better life, and behave in a civilized  matter? They ask themselves: What is wrong with our country?    For example, I believe that what brought down communism was  not an army, invasion, or party. What brought communism down  was information of what was happening in the world. The silver  curtain became stronger than the iron curtain. The government  could no longer lie to the people. The same is happening in the  Middle East. Whatever you see today is what happened yesterday.  Tomorrow, and perhaps even today, young people, Arab,  Palestinians, Israeli, Christian, Muslim, and Jew, will try to  compare their lives with the lives of others and ask: Why  should we have wars? Why should we waste hundreds of millions  of dollars on weapons? Why should we support a dictatorship?  Dictatorships in our days have become so expensive that only  the rich countries can have dictatorships. The poor people are  no longer willing to pay for the craziness and egomania of  dictators. I deeply and sincerely believe that in the near  future, the next generation will prefer peace, freedom, and  science. That is the future.    [Zabludovsky] What is the future of Jerusalem?    [Peres] Jerusalem is politically closed and religiously  open.  Throughout history, Jerusalem has never been the capital of Arab  life. On the other hand, in Jewish life, we have never had  another capital but Jerusalem. Jerusalem is not only the  capital of our prayers, but the capital of our existence. So we  are not going to divide Jerusalem; we are not going to turn  Jerusalem into a Berlin; we are not going to divide Jerusalem  and build a wall. It will remain united as the capital of  Israel. But while politically it is closed, religiously it will  remain open. Every believer, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, who  wishes to come and pray to God in his language, in his  tradition, in his church, mosque, or synagogue, will have the  right and the opportunity to do so. It will be our  responsibility to secure his free coming, to secure his free  worship, to respect his own faith and his own heritage and  tradition.    [Zabludovsky] Were you pleased with the explanation Mr.  'Arafat gave to the call to a Holy War for Jerusalem?    [Peres] No. 'Arafat is using the language of yesterday. It  is old and dangerous. But when it comes to policies, he made a  change. So when I judge 'Arafat by his words I feel very bad;  but when I judge 'Arafat by his decisions, I feel that we must  continue and provide peace for Palestinians and Israelis.    [Zabludovsky] Do you trust 'Arafat?    [Peres] Do I talk to him? Oh, my God, day and night. You  know, in the Middle East you shake hands during the day and you  negotiate at night. I have forgotten what a morning is like  because usually the negotiations begin late at night and go  through the night. There have been many long nights, some of  them extremely complicated and difficult.    [Zabludovsky] Will Israel withdraw its support for Arab  autonomy?    [Peres] I am sorry, I did not get the question.    [Zabludovsky] Could Israel suddenly back out of the  Palestinian autonomy issue?    [Peres] Who?    [Zabludovsky] Israel.    [Peres] No. We made up our minds. In many ways we are  negotiating with ourselves more than with the Palestinians. The  reason why we are negotiating -- and we are on the giving side  and not on the receiving side -- is because we do not want to  become, or remain, a dominating nation. Jewish history is 4,000  years old. Never in our lives did we control, govern, or  dominate other people. The people who tried to dominate us have  disappeared from history. We do not want to dominate the  Palestinian people or Palestinian life. We would like to see  the Palestinians elect their leaders, nominate their judges,  appoint their police, have the right economy, raise their  standards of living, and become good neighbors. They will be  our neighbors and Israel will be their neighbor and neither of  the two should attempt to impose their will on the other.    [Zabludovsky] Can a similar agreement be reached with Syria  on the Golan Heights?    [Peres] It is possible, but, for the time being, President  al-Asad has not opened up. He is speaking about normalizing  relations with Israel, but how can he normalize relations with  Israel if he is not willing to normalize negotiations with  Israel? We cannot conduct negotiations in a narrow channel full  of microphones. We negotiate and there is no progress. We  believe that if al-Asad wants peace then he must do it as it is  being done at the end of the 20th century. These negotiations  must be open, conducted at political level and highly  professional. These negotiations must be conducted with the  knowledge of the people. The parties meeting in private must do  so with the knowledge of the people because it is not a  negotiation between leaders but between peoples. Today,  everyone is a diplomat and everyone is a judge. We would like  to see the Israeli people convinced that Mr. al-Asad means  business. He wants something from us that is tangible, a  mountain. We want something from him that is not tangible,  peace. Now peace must be as clear as the mountain is.    [Zabludovsky] Mr. Peres, do you think it is possible for  Israel to live in peace with its neighbors?    [Peres] Yes, Israel could and would live in peace with its  neighbors if the neighbors do likewise. All the things that are  important today in the lives of the people cannot be attained  through war. Whatever war can achieve is no longer important.  In the past 10 years, the Middle East spent a trillion dollars  in weapons. This money was taken away from the mouths of the  children; it was taken from their schools and their future. We  do not have the right to continue doing this. With half that  money, we would have been able to dramatically change the Middle  East. I believe more and more Arabs are beginning to see this.    [Zabludovsky] Thank you Mr. Peres.    [Peres] Thank you.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In preparation for the Japan-U.S. summit talks and  the major industrialized nations' summit talks (Naples summit)  in July, the new administration led by Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata will be fully engaged in working out tax system reform  bills to be proposed by the government and ruling coalition  parties after the Golden Week [29 April to 5 May] holidays.  Bills related to tax reform are originally planned to be  approved at an extraordinary Diet session in fall. However,  prospects of approval remain uncertain due to the secession of  the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the  administration. Moreover, there is a possibility of Diet  dissolution to be followed by a general election. Under such a  political situation, there is increasing concern over the  possibility that "the official pledge given to Japanese citizens  and foreign countries may not be fulfilled." On the other hand,  some members of the ruling coalition parties hold the view that  the situation might develop into a realignment involving part of  the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the right wing of the  SDPJ, saying: "Depending on how tax system reform is handled,  this may trigger the realignment of political parties."    The Hata administration gives top priority to raising the  consumption tax rate in tax reform. Taking possible opposition  by the SDPJ and the public into consideration, the expression  "rise in indirect tax" was used in the policy agreement reached  before the inauguration of the coalition administration.  However, most ruling party members now say that "The agreement  should have clearly stated 'consumption tax hike.' There is no  possibility of and time for working out a completely new tax.  There is no other choice but to correct the defects of the  present tax system and raise the consumption tax," (according to  a participant of the ruling parties' representatives' meeting).    The ruling parties' tax system reform council has to  urgently  reorganize its affairs because members from the SDPJ, such as  Council Chairman Koken Nosaka, have left the ruling coalition.  However, it is also true that some ruling party members express  the optimistic view that "it becomes easier to reach a consensus  because there is no factor of uncertainty" after the secession  of the SDPJ opposed to the consumption tax hike, (as stated by a  senior Shinseito official).    However, even if the reform bills are worked out, the  following possibilities still exist: 1) The Hata cabinet will  be forced to resign en masse or dissolve the House of  Representatives to hold a general election if a motion of no  confidence against the cabinet is submitted after passing the  1994 budget bill; and 2) tax reform bills may not be approved by  the Diet because of the opposition of the LDP and the SDPJ, even  if Hata cabinet remains in the office.    Some SDPJ members, who won public support in the last  election by advocating "opposition to consumption tax," will run  in the election for the House of Councilors next summer. While  SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama says that "there is no other  choice but to share the tax burden through indirect tax," the  party urges a radical revision of the consumption tax that will  result in its virtual abolition. Most LDP members also adopt a  cautious stance that "a tax hike should not be implemented  thoughtlessly."</p>

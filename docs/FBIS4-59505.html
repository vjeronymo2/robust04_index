			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Golan Yokhpaz from Jericho -- live] </F>   [Text] [Yokhpaz] The historic handshake between Major  General Ilan Biran, the commander of the Central Command, and  the Palestinian commander took place several moments ago. Major  General Biran, you are speaking live on IDF Radio. What were  your feelings at that moment?    [Biran] It was a very exciting moment. We have achieved a  joint success. I hope this success is only the beginning and we  will see over the next few days whether things are fully working  out. There is a great deal of promise but reality is a bit more  difficult and we must be realistic.    [Yokhpaz] What did the Palestinian officer say to you?    [Biran] We have been discussing things for many days and  these issues are not for comment over the radio.    [Yokhpaz] Did you give them any last-minute tips prior to  their entrance?    [Biran] Yes, we have agreed on our respective duties.    [Yokhpaz] Major General Biran, could you bid a short  farewell live on IDF Radio to the Jericho autonomous area?    [Biran] We have implemented the government's decision. I  salute the soldiers here who did an excellent job.    [Yokhpaz] That was Maj. Gen. Ilan Biran at the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] checkpoint at the entrance to what is now the  Palestinian autonomous area in Jericho.</p>

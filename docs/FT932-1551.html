			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / US increases duties on steel from 19 countries THE US Commerce Department yesterday significantly increased many of the preliminary duties it imposed in January on Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.1bn) of imported steel products from 19 countries. The tariffs, which have been collected and held in escrow since January, will only become final if the US International Trade Commission rules that imports injure the US industry. A finding is scheduled for July 27. Cockerill Sambre of Belgium sustained one of the largest increases when its duty on hot-rolled steel soared from less than 5 per cent to just over 62 per cent. The duty on hot-rolled steel from France's Usinor-Sacilor leapt from 12.4 per cent to nearly 80 per cent and the tariff on Japan's hot-rolled steel jumped from 26.7 per cent to 40.2 per cent. The new tariff levels ranged as high as 109.22 per cent on British Steel plate. British Steel last night said the duty was so high because it had decided not to participate in Washington's anti-dumping investigation. The US was not a large market for British Steel plate. However the steelmaker is still unhappy about the countervailing duty on flat products, in spite of a reduction in the duty from the preliminary 19 per cent to 9.7 per cent. 'British Steel does not benefit from any subsidies to the former British Steel Corporation, and we will be asking the European Commission to challenge this through the Gatt,' it said. The findings came on 72 dumping and subsidy cases, which were filed last year against producers of flat-rolled steel, after efforts to negotiate a multilateral steel agreement collapsed. They come at a particularly sensitive time, with the US, EC, Japan and Canada embarked on critical talks in Tokyo which they hope will resuscitate the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The steel findings are considered by US officials to be separated from politics. However, US trading partners say the findings are almost always in favour of US industry. To buttress their case for injury, American steel producers are arguing that they have been damaged by deals between EC, Japanese and South Korean cartels, which divert cheap steel into the 'open' US market. The UK government last night condemned the US move, saying it would join its EC partners in raising the 'unfair and unjustified' action at Gatt. Earlier, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner in charge of trade, accused the US of using imports 'as a whipping boy for problems arising largely from domestic competition within the US'. The EC had voluntarily restrained its steel exports to the US for 10 years on 'the clear understanding that this would settle any question of duties or injury covering that period', he said. Sir Leon said the Community, which had already challenged the US methodology in countervailing duty cases through Gatt, might take other challenges to dispute settlement panels. Several trade analysts agreed that there were numerous market-sharing deals between producers, but said it was irrelevant to the US case for injury. Call for change, Page 9</p>

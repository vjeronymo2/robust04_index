			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Deal near on BR break-up: Ministers support proposals to keep InterCity network intact PRIVATE regional rail compa-nies would run prestige national services on a largely intact InterCity network under a plan emerging as a front-runner in the cabinet committee considering British Rail's privatisation. Ministers are nearing a compromise agreement on BR privatisation which could pave the way for publication soon of a white paper setting out the government's plans. The Department of Transport hopes the deal will reconcile Mr John Major's preference for reviving pre-war regional rail companies with the determination of Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, who wants to keep the privatised InterCity network as a viable entity. Cabinet ministers have embarked on an intensive series of meetings on BR's future in an attempt to resolve the row which has already delayed the white paper at least once. No final decisions have been taken on how the sell-off will be implemented, but Mr Rifkind has said that a white paper would be published ahead of the general election. There were suggestions at Westminster last night that it might be released within two weeks, although a date later in February appeared more likely. The government originally hoped for publication late last year. With BR privatisation set to be a central part of the Conservative party's election manifesto, Mr Major is anxious to avoid unnecessary delays. Ministers have agreed that BR's monopoly has to be broken and that private operators must be given open access to tracks. They are also agreed that an independent regulatory organisation would be required to resolve disputes if, say, InterCity refused to permit access to its rail network. Under the compromise now being worked on, companies for each region would operate under a franchise system and would receive public subsidy. They might be allowed to lay new tracks or use InterCity lines for running services from provincial areas to London. The freight network, which like InterCity is usually profitable, would remain as one company and buy the use of track from InterCity and the regional companies. Network SouthEast might remain in the public sector or parts could be transfered to the regional operators. Mr Major wants to revive the pre-war networks of regional companies - the so-called 'golden age' scenario - but would have to accept InterCity remaining in one piece if the compromise proposals were agreed. Mr Rifkind wants to see an expanding rail network but fears that any break-up of InterCity would lead to the abolition of many unprofitable services.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Maggie Ford in Jakarta] </F>   [Text] A banking scandal has erupted in Indonesia,  implicating former ministers and a son of President Suharto in  allegations of the improper use of influence over state banks.    The scandal follows revelations in the Indonesian Parliament  that Bapindo, the state-owned development bank had lent U.S.$430  million to Eddy Tansil, a businessman who heads the Golden Key  group of companies.    Legislator A.A. Baramuli, who belongs to the ruling Golkar  [Functional Group] party, told MPs that the money had not been  repaid and was now one of 49 cases of bad or doubtful debts  amounting to billions of dollars owed to state banks.    The loan was apparently made to subsidiaries of Golden Key  for the construction of petrochemical plants in the West Java  city of Cilegon. Hutomo Mandala Putra (Tommy), a son of  President Suharto. was chairman of one of the subsidiaries and  his Humpuss Group a minor shareholder at the time the loan was  made.    Last week, General Sudomo, former coordinating minister of  politics and security and now chairman of the president's  Supreme Advisory Council, said he had recommended that Bapindo  lend money for the project but that neither he nor his family  had any personal financial interest in it. Gen. Sudomo had  earlier strongly criticised the MP who revealed the loan details  claiming that he had violated bank secrecy laws.    A series of current ministers, including Finance Minister  Mar'ie Muhammed, Governor of the Central Bank Sudrajat  Jiwandono, and Bapindo executives have appeared in parliament  denying knowledge of the loan or refusing to answer questions  about the matter.    Their reticence has led to parliamentary calls for revision  of the bank secrecy laws.    J.B. Sumarlin, finance minister at the time the loan was  granted in 1992 also denied that he had any personal interest in  the project or that he had recommended it be granted when he was  a commissioner of Bapindo.    Mr. Hutomo admitted he had pushed Bapindo to make the loan  for the project but said that Humpuss had now sold its  shareholding in the Golden Key subsidiary because it realised  that the plant would cost double its planned budget.    Mr. Tansil has claimed that he is servicing the loan, but  there appears little evidence that the money has been used to  import equipment for the plant, the reason for the loan  according to a letter of credit issued by Bapindo. Both Mr.  Tansil and another Golden Key director have been banned from  leaving Indonesia.    Foreign bankers say that the scandal points to the way  influential people can ignore laws and regulations set up by the  Central Bank and how state banks have been powerless to reject  requests for loans from such people.    The loan to Mr. Tansil violated Bapindo's legal lending  limit  at the time and Mr. Tansil had been taken to court earlier for  non-payment of loans to foreign banks.    "He is well known to Bank Indonesia," a foreign banker said,  adding that normal credit risk evaluations were clearly not made.    The Golden Key case is not the first time that Mr. Hutomo  has  been involved in borrowing from state banks for failed projects.  In 1991, he borrowed U.S. $400 million from the central bank to  establish a monopoly over the clove trade, which subsequently  collapsed.    Last year, the government ended the practice of so-called  "memo loans" -- funds granted on the basis of a memo from an  important individual -- from state banks under a programme  backed by the World Bank to recapitalise the major state banks.</p>

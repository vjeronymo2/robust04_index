			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (3): Group A - United States The US is the land that soccer forgot. Its players do not have a professional league. Its fans are supporting other countries and its media are not sure what is going on but they know they do not like it. With no league to showcase their talents even the small trickle of US players to European and Mexican professional clubs in recent years is remarkable. The bulk of the squad has been doing national service. They have been living in a soccer-boot camp, at Mission Viejo, California, paid by the US Soccer Federation to play friendlies. The team's poor record in recent months against mediocre international opposition has drawn the fire of the US press, unused to competing in an international team game in which more than two other countries play. The reaction of the fans has also been cautious. For most football is an expression of ethnicity, like playing the bagpipes or holding Oktoberfests. It is what Italian-Americans or Mexican-Americans do when they are being Italian or Mexican. This is why tickets for Ireland v Italy in New York were trading hands for a minimum of Dollars 475 on the black market while tickets for the first round games involving the host nation remained unsold. The US team needs a good start to convince its fans that, even though it places a premium on strong left-wingers, soccer is not an un-American activity. The coach, Bora Milutinovic, has an enviable World Cup record. In 1986, he took Mexico to the quarter-finals where it lost on penalties to Germany. In 1990, he coached Costa Rica to wins over Sweden and Scotland and into the second round. His US-based players resent the well-paid European-based stars who will waltz into the team at the last moment. But, with the exception of Thomas Dooley, who won a German Championship with Kaiserslautern, they lack experience. Certainly the addition of players such as John Harkes (Derby County), Roy Wegerle (Coventry City), Tab Ramos (Betis, Seville) and Eric Wynalda (Saarbrucken) immensely improved the team in last summer's US Cup. Frank Klopas (AEK Athens) has emerged as a goal-scoring threat in recent friendlies. The team will be competitive, disciplined and fit. Cobi Jones, one of the stars of the Barcelona Olympic football tournament, and Cladio Reyna, are two talented young players who will want to grab and prolong their moment in the spotlight. Most of the US soccer team grew up in a football vacuum. The game is not ingrained in them as it is in boys who grew up watching television in other countries. what young Americans do learn is how to compete. Do not write them off.</p>

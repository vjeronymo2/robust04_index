			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Antonia Marcia Vale from Belem, </F> Para State]    [Text] Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and Russian  Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov have signed an agreement  to exchange military attaches between the two countries.  Mamedov, who is attending the 24th OAS General Assembly as an  observer, stated that the agreement does not entail any form of  ideological agreement, but rather stems from mutually  advantageous relations.    Mamedov said Russia and Brazil are following the same path  toward promoting democratization in the world. He described  Brazil as a priority partner for Russia. He noted that the  agreement will pave the way for implementing several cooperation  projects between the Russian and Brazilian Armed Forces, in  addition to promoting the transfer of technology.    The agreement may also be instrumental in improving the  bilateral trade balance, which last year stood at $300 million.  Foreign Ministry experts consider this figure to be well below  the potential for trade between the two countries. Foreign  Minister Amorim will visit the Russian Federation in December to  sign new agreements.</p>

Chi Haotian made these remarks to a XINHUA correspondent  after concluding his two-week formal visits to Brazil, Uruguay,  and Chile.    Chi Haotian stated: As the first Chinese defense minister to  visit Latin America since the founding of new China, my visits  were accorded warm and friendly receptions by the governments,  militaries, and peoples of Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile. This  fully expressed Latin America's deep affection and sincere  friendship for the Chinese Government, military, and people.

They hailed China's policy of reform and opening up, and its  independent foreign policy of peace without seeking hegemonism.  They very much admire efforts by the Chinese Government and  people to develop their own country, and hoped China will become  stronger and make contributions to achieving lasting world peace  and stability.    Chi Haotian added that China can learn and make use of many  things in the economic construction and troop building of these  Latin American nations.

			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO LONGER ON THE BACK BURNER;  </P> <P> FREQUENT-FLIER BUSH COMPLETES VITAL LATIN TRIP  </P> <P> As President Bush completes the latest of his foreign trips, a week-long swing  through five South American nations, questions are being raised in this country  about whether it was wise or even useful.  </P> <P> Correspondents who cover the White House have begun reporting that constant  travel seems to be taking a physical toll on the 66-year-old Bush. The last  couple of months -- with the Persian Gulf crisis as the constant backdrop to  everything Bush does -- have been especially punishing.  </P> <P> Certainly the case can be made that with an unpredictable crisis playing itself  out -- especially one that could put the United States in its biggest shooting  war in a generation -- the President should wander no further from the Oval  Office than the Rose Garden. But, in fairness, the White House staff can make a  good argument that each of Bush's recent sojourns served a valid purpose.  </P> <P> His November trip to Europe allowed Bush to join other world leaders at the  signing of security agreements that marked the end of the Cold War, certainly  an historic event. And who can question the value of pressing the flesh and  showing support to American soldiers in the field, as he did on Thanksgiving  Day. And Mexico, while usually ignored by most U.S. citizens, is not just a  recurring foreign policy issue but -- with the Soviet Union self-absorbed --  now arguably our most important foreign policy challenge.  </P> <P> Which leaves only the trip to South America to be questioned. And, let's face  it, Latin America, in general, has never been a priority for most folks in  Washington, be they pundits, politicians or other policy-makers. So what's  really being asked, we suspect, is whether five days in Brazil, Uruguay,  Argentina, Chile and Venezuela were worth the trouble.  </P> <P> Yes they were. Except for Chile, the nations visited by Bush are not as far  along as Mexico in moving toward the open economies and free-trade policies  that Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III so ardently believe in --  but they are heading in that direction. Anything this country can do to help  them along is a matter of enlightened self-interest. At least in the short  term, the world seems to be realigning itself into trading blocs, with Europe  and East Asia poised to further challenge the United States for economic  supremacy in the 1990s. If that happens, our neighbors in the Western  Hemisphere may just prove our most reliable and eager trading partners.  </P> <P> That is why it's vital for Washington to show Latin America that it is  important, even if the message is largely symbolic for now. Symbolism counts  for a lot in diplomacy. And, for all the gringo-bashing that goes on south of  the border, the United States counts for a lot in Latin America. Most  Argentines can tell you that the last American President to visit their nation  was Dwight Eisenhower in 1958. How many of us remember that? We're willing to  bet that Latin Americans will remember Bush's trip, too, long after this  country has forgotten it. That'll be good for the United States -- and to the  President's credit.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It has become known what economic topics will be  discussed at the summit talks of the industrialized nations  (Naples summit) scheduled for July. Attaching importance to the  issue of intensifying unemployment and focusing on the central  theme of "growth and employment," the participants will discuss  measures to stimulate the macroeconomy in such nations as Japan  and Germany, as well as labor issues, including unemployment  insurance and immigration connected with various nations. Other  issues to be discussed include "trade and labor," which concerns  problems connected with the export of products through cheap  labor. With regard to aid for nations shifting to the market  economy, participants will focus on aid for Russia and Ukraine  as well. Suffering from serious economic stagnation, Ukraine has  requested financial aid amounting to $20 billion. It seems most  likely that the United States and European nations will strongly  request Japan to expand its domestic demand, and the minority  administration under Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will be forced  to overcome difficulties in coordination to work out concrete  measures such as tax cuts beginning in fiscal 1995.    Various nations have come to share the common understanding  that the top priority task lies in overcoming unemployment which  may lead to social unrest. Discussions will be held on the  strategy of creating jobs to promote global economic growth.  And as part of this strategy, consultations will be held on  requesting those nations that are rather slow in business  recovery -- Japan and Germany, for instance -- to take  additional financial measures such as tax cuts as well as  economic stimulus measures such as monetary relaxation. To  control increases in long-term interest rate which are  detrimental to economic growth, the participating nations intend  to request such nations as the United States to take measures to  steadily reduce their financial deficits.    For the purpose of creating new jobs, discussions will be  held on technological cooperation among various nations in the  fields of information and communications, including development  of multimedia. Among other topics for discussion is how to  overcome structural problems connected with immigrants and the  system of excessive insurance for unemployment. All these  problems are detrimental to the creation of new jobs.    Now that GATT will become the World Trade Organization (WTO)  in 1995, the participating nations will discuss the issue of  "establishing a new world trade system." Since no decision has  been made as to what issues connected with WTO will be  discussed, the theme for coordination at the summit remains  fluid. However, topics for discussions are likely to include  policies for competition, environmental protection, development,  and investment.    With regard to aid for nations shifting to market economies,  the first priority will still be given to Russia as decided at  the Tokyo summit last year. However, the issue of providing aid  amounting to $20 billion to Ukraine will be brought up at the  upcoming summit. Due to the fact that economic stagnation has  become more serious in Ukraine, it has become an issue of common  interest to all industrialized nations to prevent an outflow of  refugees from Ukraine and the repetition of nuclear power  station accidents.</p>

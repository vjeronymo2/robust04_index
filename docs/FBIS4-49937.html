			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Foo Choy Peng] </F>   [Text] China's state enterprises face a harsher policy of  survival of the fittest under the latest credit guidelines of  the State Economic and Trade Commission and the People's Bank of  China.    Deserving industrial enterprises are to receive the same  level of--if not more--loans as last year while some of those  with no hope of returning to profits will see the previous heavy  transfusions of bank loans cut off.    Analysts say the latest credit policy statements underscore  a  more determined approach to prevent moribund industrial  enterprises drawing off funds which could be better used by  those which are making profits, or showing signs of making real  financial progress.    The latest guidelines state that loans to profitable state  enterprises in the next two years generally should not be less  than last year's level. Indeed, more loans could be given to  the money-making enterprises if bank deposits go up this year  and next year.    Money-losing enterprises which could reduce their losses in  the next two years should continue to receive loans from banks  to cover their working capital. "Appropriate support should be  given to enterprises which could reduce their losses or even  turn around in these two years to help them tide over their  difficulties," says a report. "Credit should be tightened for  those with no hope of turning around and whose assets cannot  sustain their debts so that they could face bankruptcy."    These guidelines come at a time when foreign economists are  increasingly concerned that the biggest obstacles to the  country's economic reform programme are the moribund state  enterprises which still make up a sizeable portion of its  industrial base.    The fear that the political implications of removing them as  burdens to the state could prove too arduous--at least, while  paramount leader Deng Xiaoping is alive and no one is prepared  to make stern decisions.    A recent report by Baring Securities, for example, points  out  that there are 500 enterprises which lose more than 500 million  yuan (about HK$445.5 million) a year.    Tang Xu, deputy director of the Graduate School of the  People's Bank, said while even some money-losing enterprises  would continue to receive loans for working capital, they were  under increasing pressure to tighten their operations.    "The lending policy is certainly tighter now, as  unprofitable  enterprises will have to convince banks that they can become  leaner and fitter in order to get loans," Mr Tang said. He  added that as the country had yet to have a social security  system in place, it would be unthinkable to force all  money-losing enterprises to go under. "How do you take care of  those who are laid off? That is a bigger social question which  the central authorities will have to handle."    State enterprises essentially still take care of the  cradle-to-grave needs of their employees, and if many are forced  to close, would become a politically destabilising influence.  Indeed, some Hong Kong analysts believe that unemployment could  become a potentially more serious problem than inflation, if not  handled well.</p>

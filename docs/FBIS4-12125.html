			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Some 51 Palestinian deportees and former  fugitives crossed over from Jordan and Egypt yesterday evening.  The men, many of whom will be in positions of authority under  Palestinian autonomy, were welcomed by thousands of people.  About 28 deportees returned via the Allenby Bridge to Jericho,  and reporter Mark Weiss was there when they arrived:    [Begin Weiss recording] It was a long wait in the Jericho  sun for the relatives and friends who came to greet the  deportees at the Allenby Bridge crossing. Because of  registration problems at the border, the bus bringing the  deportees didn't cross until 8 o'clock in the evening [1700  GMT]. Army jeeps escorted the bus by a back road to a  restaurant outside Jericho where the men received a hero's  welcome. [passage omitted]    In contrast to the group of elderly veteran deportees that  were allowed back last year, this group is mostly made up of  younger intifadah activists or those deported for student or  trade union activity. They are expected to take up leadership  positions throughout the territories, as Fatah and the other  groups that support the peace process attempt to win over the  population. They hope that their return is just the beginning.  [end recording]    At the same time, at the border crossing at Rafah in Gaza,  23  deportees arrived. Dani Gur-Arye reports:    [Begin recording] [Gur-Arye] Palestinians destined to  become the new bureaucrats in the Gaza Strip returned home to a  warm reception. Dozens of friends and relatives greeted the  returnees at the Rafah terminal, while hundreds of others waited  outside, chanting and waving the PLO flag. [passage omitted]    The returnees, mostly Fatah members, have credentials both  in  Gaza and in Tunis. They were all grass roots intifadah  activists, who were either deported or who fled to Egypt as  fugitives. In their years abroad, they were incorporated into  the PLO's leadership in Tunis. Now they are back in the Strip,  with authority from above and with what the PLO hopes is respect  from below.    The head of Fatah in Gaza, Zakariya al-Agha, describes the  return as a positive gesture. But, he says, the Palestinians  are waiting for more serious steps.    [Al-Agha] I hope that we will see in the near future the  complete evacuation of Gaza from the settlements and settlers,  because this is very important and this will remove a large  obstacle from the road to attain the full peace we are looking  for.    [Gur-Arye] The returnees are expected to begin working out  of PLO offices in Gaza in the coming days. Officials in Tunis  hope their presence will bolster Yasir 'Arafat's position in the  Gaza Strip. [end recording]</p>

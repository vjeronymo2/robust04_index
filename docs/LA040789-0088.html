			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 6 MEASURES FACE IGNORANCE, APATHY  </P> <P> While facing no organized opposition, proponents of the six propositions on  Tuesday's Los Angeles primary ballot say they still have to face two serious  obstacles: ignorance and apathy.  </P> <P> In this low-key election season with few close contests, the ballot  propositions -- four bond issues and two City Charter amendments -- are  acknowledged as "real yawners," even by some of the campaign consultants paid  to navigate their passage.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, there is no opposition," said Bob Lavoie, campaign manager for  Proposition 2, a bond issue to improve police facilities, only half in jest.  </P> <P> Susan Romeo is co-manager of the campaigns for Propositions 1 and 3, bond  measures that would repair and expand libraries and make old, low-cost  apartments safe from earthquakes. She said that some opposition would at least  have brought the issues to the public's attention and would have given voters a  chance to decide on the merits.  </P> <P> "They don't make news, but they are very important issues," Lavoie said.  </P> <P> The two charter amendments would change procedures for transferring city funds  and for approving employee pay raises.  </P> <P> If the voters approve all four bond measures with the required two-thirds  majority, the total amount added to the average annual property tax bill would  be $34, according to the city administrative office.  </P> <P> Bond measure proponents are also worried about the expected low voter turnout,  which traditionally means that more conservative voters dominate the outcome.  That could spell doom for spending issues.  </P> <P> "It doesn't bode well," Romeo said.  </P> <P> Turnout in the municipal primaries has been dropping steadily in recent  elections -- from 42.4% of the registered voters in 1977 to 34.7% in 1985. Some  political observers say the turnout on Tuesday could drop to 20% or less of  registered voters.  </P> <P> With little public debate on the six measures, many voters are expected to  depend on editorial endorsements and so-called "slate cards" of recommended  votes. The slate cards are paid for by candidates who like to send out voting  recommendations on all or most of the ballot. Sometimes other candidates or  proponents of measures will pay to be included; sometimes they are added free.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slate Card Opposition  </P> <P> One bond issue that has picked up some unexpected opposition on a slate card is  the $176-million police facilities bond issue.  </P> <P> The Non-Partisan Candidate Election Council, which sends out 180,000 slate  cards to conservative voters, is recommending a "no" on Proposition 2.  </P> <P> Allan Hoffenblum, campaign consultant to the group, said the conservative  alliance generally opposes all bond issues, but agreed to support Propositions  1 and 3. "We didn't want to go 'yes' on all the bonds," he said, so Proposition  2 got the ax.  </P> <P> Proposition 2 proponents say they picked up the "no" recommendation when they  could not afford to buy their way on the the card. Hoffenblum denied the  accusation and added that no propositions paid to get on the slate card.  </P> <P> Proposition 2, nonetheless, is expected to pick up other slate card  endorsements in addition to the strong backing it has already received from  newspaper editorials, Mayor Tom Bradley, other elected officials and Police  Chief Daryl F. Gates.  </P> <P> No one submitted ballot arguments against any of the six measures to the city  clerk's office to accompany the sample ballot sent to all city voters.  </P> <P> Here is a rundown on the six measures.  </P> <P> * Proposition 1 -- A $53.4-million bond issue to finance building of three  branch libraries in the San Fernando Valley and improve 26 branch libraries  throughout the city, including some damaged in an earthquake.  </P> <P> Unlike a $90-million library bond narrowly defeated in the November election,  Proposition 1 would not provide money for building of the downtown Central  Library, a feature that attracted the intense opposition of Councilman Nate  Holden, who went on a successful campaign to beat the bond proposal last year.  </P> <P> Proposition 1 is supported by Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> * Proposition 2 -- A $176-million bond issue to build two new police stations  at yet-to-be-determined locations in the San Fernando Valley and mid-Wilshire  area, a new police training facility and modernization or replacement of all of  the existing stations to relieve crowding or to accommodate increased staffing.  </P> <P> * Proposition 3 -- A $100-million bond issue to provide loans to bring 15,000  privately owned, low-cost apartments up to earthquake safety standards. Up to  $10 million of the bond money would be used to establish homeless shelters.  </P> <P> Proponents say the financing is needed to protect the city's dwindling supply  of affordable housing. A city law requires an estimated 44,000 unsafe rental  units to be brought up to earthquake standards. However, it is difficult for  some owners to obtain financing to make repairs, city officials say.  </P> <P> The measure is supported by the mayor, most members of the City Council and  housing advocates.  </P> <P> * Proposition 4 -- A $60-million bond issue to finance installation of fire  sprinklers and removal of asbestos in City Hall and five other tall municipal  buildings. The measure was prompted by last May's fire at the 62-story First  Interstate Bank building.  </P> <P> Charter Amendment 5 -- Would reduce the number of votes required on the  15-member council for approval of city employee pay raises, from 10 to eight.  </P> <P> Charter Amendment 6 -- Would raise the limit on funds that can be transferred  within the same city department, without approval of the mayor and City  Council, from $5,000 to $25,000. Adjusted for inflation, the $5,000 limit set  in 1951 would now be about $25,000, according to a city administrative  officer's report.  </P> <P> In 1977, voters rejected a similar charter amendment by a wide margin.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Richard Simon contributed to this article.  </P></p>

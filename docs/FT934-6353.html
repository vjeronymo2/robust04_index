			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs leave Wagon lower at Pounds 5.06m Pre-tax profits at Wagon Industrial, the Telford-based materials handling, engineering and automotive products group, fell from Pounds 8.52m to Pounds 5.06m in the half year to September 30 as the group absorbed the costs of restructuring Forkardt, a German subsidiary dependent on the machine tool market. The result had been foreshadowed in June when Wagon said that the first half would be lower than in 1992-93 and that the full-year result would be similar to 1992-93, before meeting any costs at Forkardt. Reducing the size of Forkardt cost Pounds 3m, shown as an exceptional item. Operating profits were Pounds 7.42m against Pounds 8.1m, on improved turnover of Pounds 132m (Pounds 114m). Although poor levels of demand in Europe continued to drag down the group's results, Mr John Hudson, chief executive, said 'the UK is definitely picking up'. Wagon, which has net cash balances of Pounds 8m, is looking for further UK acquisitions. Last August it bought Salter Springs and Pressings for Pounds 2.9m in what looks like the first of a series of acquisitions. Wagon holds to its June statement of full-year profits similar to those of 1992-93 but has added some gloss. Mr Paul Taylor, chairman, said the board 'feels a little bit more optimistic about prospects than was the case then.' The interim dividend is maintained at 6.325p, payable from earnings per share down from 14.62p to 4.52p.</p>

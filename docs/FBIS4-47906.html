			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] There has been a new upsurge of tension in  Rwanda. Yesterday evening three UNAMIR [UN Aid Mission in  Rwanda] soldiers were injured during shelling of the airport,  and seven Rwandans were also injured as the UN attempted to  evacuate them from a hotel in the town center. [passage omitted]    In neighboring Tanzania, since yesterday the UN special  representative has been stepping up his informal talks with the  warring sides. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh was due to go to Kampala  this morning to meet the Ugandan president and then return to  Arusha. The Rwandan Patriotic Front, RPF, for its part has  already described any possible intervention by foreign troops in  Rwanda as too late and pointless, because, the RPF says, the  genocide has already been committed. This is a view which is  not shared by the planning minister of the interim government.  Speaking on a stopover in Dakar, he called for rapid  intervention by a foreign force. Augustin Ngirabatware was  speaking to Nicolas Balique:    [Begin Ngirabatware recording] I am issuing an appeal to the  international community to help the people. We also expect the  international community to use its powers of persuasion with the  RPF to make it understand that only a peaceful solution will  allow Rwandans to live together. Third, this international  force -- which should be neutral but very effective -- should be  deployed in Rwanda as rapidly as possible -- this is extremely  urgent -- in order to help the government and the RPF to  maintain the cease-fire, and to permit the negotiations to begin  again; and speaking about a neutral, effective international  force, the Rwandan Government does not rule out any country, but  we believe that in any case, as far as any direct or indirect  involvement is concerned, the official armed forces of Uganda  should not participate in it, and the Burundi Army should not  participate in it. As far as the Belgian Army is concerned, I  believe that Belgium has already decided not to take part in  this kind of force in Rwanda. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

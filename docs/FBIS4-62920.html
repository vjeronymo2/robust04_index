			<p>BFN     [Text] Acting Internal Minister of the Crimea, Valeriy  Kuznetsov, said in the morning of May 19 in an address to the  session of the Crimean parliament in Simferopol that a coup had  been attempted in Crimea last night.    He said that Deputy Ukrainian Internal Minister Valentin  Nedrihaylo had arrived in Simferopol at night. He was  accompanied by a group of 15 special policemen. Nedrigailo read  out to the personnel of the Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry  the decree issued by Ukrainian President on May 18, 1994 to  reorganize the Ministry and create on its basis a department of  the internal affairs of the Crimea which would be subordinate to  the Ukrainian Interior Ministry.    In connection with this Valeriy Kuznetsov demanded from  parliament that deputies immediately approve him as the Crimean  Minister.    An interval was announced at the parliament session.  Deputies are waiting for the arrival of the parliament's  defense commission which is to clarify these events.    Kuznetsov was appointed acting Interior Minister of the  Crimea a month ago by the decree of president Yuriy Meshkov.</p>

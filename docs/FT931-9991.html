			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Upbeat forecast from Parmalat sees 1993 sales ahead by 50% PARMALAT, the Italian dairy foods group, expects sales to surge by about 50 per cent to L2,400bn (Dollars 1.6bn) this year on the back of buoyant internal growth and continuing acquisitions. The company, which has made a strong recovery since its recapitalisation in 1990, said that turnover in 1992 rose by 21.5 per cent to L1,613bn. Mr Domenico Barili, director general, said operating earnings had risen by 17.3 per cent to L203bn. In 1991, Parmalat Finanziaria, the listed holding company, reported net earnings of L42bn. Full 1992 results will not be released until March. However, on the basis of yesterday's figures, analysts forecast net group profits in the range of L50bn-55bn. Mr Barili said that operating profits should rise by a further 22 per cent to L248bn this year. Parmalat, around 27 per cent of whose capital is held abroad, expects most of its growth to come outside Italy. The group is expanding fast in eastern Europe, South America and the US. In 1992, sales in Europe, excluding Italy, jumped 164 per cent to L66bn. In south America - principally Brazil and Argentina - sales climbed by 28.7 per cent to L260bn, while US turnover reached L13bn. All three areas are expected to surge this year, with growth rates of 263 per cent in Europe and 111 per cent in south America. Sales in the US are forecast to climb almost 15-fold to L189bn. The forecasts are based on acquisitions that have already been made - such as that of the Fejertej dairy group in Hungary - and two other transactions which have not yet been announced, but are virtually sealed, it said. Italian turnover is forecast to rise by 13 per cent. Mr Barili stressed that the acquisition-led expansion would not involve a big rise in Parmalat's net debts, which stood at L465bn at the end of December 1992. Interest charges in 1993 were forecast to edge up to L79bn from L71bn in 1992, while interest costs as a proportion of sales would fall to 3.3 per cent to 4.4 per cent in 1992.</p>

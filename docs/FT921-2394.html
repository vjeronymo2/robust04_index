			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Talks on air subsidy row to resume TALKS aimed at resolving the EC-US row over subsidies to civil aircraft makers resume in Washington next week, after two-and-a-half days' discussion ended inconclusively in Brussels yesterday. This week's talks between senior EC and US trade officials had been billed as the last chance for a deal before the self-imposed deadline of March 31, when the US may seek a ruling from the Gatt disputes panel on the issue. An EC spokesman said yesterday progress had been made on technical issues, but added: 'There are still problems of substance which are not negligible.' The US is unhappy about subsidies which it says EC governments have been paying to Airbus Industrie, the European manufacturing consortium. The EC counters that US aircraft-makers have enjoyed subsidies from their government in the guise of space or defence research grants. Officials refused to comment on the detail of the talks yesterday, but the outstanding problems are likely to include US attempts to lower the proportion of grants awarded to Airbus, and improve the transparency of the consortium's financing.</p>

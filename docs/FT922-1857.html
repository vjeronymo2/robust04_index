			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Intel wins round in battle with AMD INTEL, the leading US manufacturer of microprocessor chips for personal computers, has won a critical lawsuit in its battle to prevent Advanced Micro Devices from cloning its products. A Californian jury has returned a verdict that AMD does not, as it has claimed, have the right to use Intel's microcode, the internal instructions that control a microprocessor. AMD has won an estimated 30 per cent share of the market for 386 microprocessors, since the company launched its own version of the Intel device last year. AMD's stock price fell Dollars 5 1/2 yesterday to close at Dollars 9 while Intel finished up Dollars 3 1/4 at Dollars 51. The lawsuit is one of several between the two companies involving AMD's rights to Intel technology. The latest decision is a setback to AMD's efforts to become a major competitor in the microprocessor market. The latest case involved Intel's 287 math co-processor, a device that works alongside a microprocessor to boost its calculating speed. Intel had filed suit against AMD in 1990, charging the company with copyright infringement. AMD claimed to have a licence to use Intel's microcode under a 1976 pact between the companies and arguments in the case revolved around interpretation of the agreement. Intel said the microcode licence was limited to its use in computer systems designed for software development, and AMD failed to convince the jury that its licensing rights were broader. Intel hailed the decision as a victory in its legal battles with AMD. 'We are extremely pleased with today's verdict,' said Mr Thomas Dunlap, Intel general counsel. Mr WJ Sanders, AMD chairman, told employees: 'We have suffered a setback - not a defeat.' For 1991, AMD reported revenues of Dollars 1.2bn and profits of Dollars 145.3m. Intel reported record revenues last year of Dollars 4.78bn and Dollars 819m in profits. Siemens withdraws from IBM deal, Page 26</p>

Prince Sirivut's stance surprised observers, who had  expected  him to follow up on his strong words in Phnom Penh Sunday, when  he said the repatriation "is a human rights abuse from some  people or Thai authorities.".    While Prince Sirivut was holding a one-hour meeting with his  Thai counterpart, Prasong Sunsiri, in Geneva the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, condemned the  repatriations. Some 25,000 Cambodians poured across the border  at Ban Phakkat a week ago to escape fighting over the former  Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin, which the Cambodian Government  said it seized March 19.    Thailand started a three-day operation to repatriate the  refugees last Friday, transporting them north to Sap Tali, from  where they could cross into what the Thais said was a safe zone  in Cambodia. The Thais refused access to independent observers,  however, sparking criticism of its handling of the matter.    On Monday, Thailand's National Security Council [NSC] said  the refugees who fled fighting a week earlier in northwest  Cambodia had themselves chosen repatriation to a Khmer  Rouge-controlled zone.    NSC Deputy Secretary Khachatphai Burutphat told reporters  that all 25,000 had moved to a safe zone inside Cambodia  opposite the Thai town of Sap Tali.    In Geneva, Ogata voiced "deep concern" at the move, saying  she feared the refugees, mostly women and children, "could be  exposed to the fighting and their lives might be at risk." But  Thai Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa dismissed her  concern, telling AFP there was "no question of the Thai  Government sending them to areas where their lives could be  threatened."    Speaking to reporters after meeting Prasong, Prince Sirivut  said bilateral committees would be set up to handle a whole  range of issues, including refugees. Asked repeatedly about the  border situation, Prince Sirivut said several times that the  committees, to be set up "as soon as possible," would deal with  all matters.    Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Suwit Simasakun said the two  ministers had not even touched on the specific issue of the  25,000 refugees.    Government Spokesman Aphisit said the refugee problem had  also not been raised when Prince Sirivut met Prime Minister  Chuan Likphai. The two sides dealt with framework issues for  future relations, he said.    In Phnom Penh Sunday, Prince Sirivut has said: "It is not  normal that the Thai authorities take this decision to send  25,000 people without security, with nothing we can check."    A decidedly upbeat Prince Sirivut said Monday he was pleased  the two sides had "resolved a lot of problems today."    Cambodia and Thailand "are ready to sit down and to create a  legal framework to resolve problems state-to-state. We decided  to solve problems in a peaceful way," he said, adding: "We  don't want any local people to jeopardize our good relations."    In Geneva, Ogata commented that she was "particularly  saddened that contrary to early information, (the Thai)  government has not allowed these to stay in Thailand until such  time as a return in safety and dignity could be worked out by  all concerned."    Aphisit said Thailand had been forced to act because "we  were  finding it difficult to provide the necessary assistance keeping  them where they were."</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Docklands revisited Michael Boyce, who has been appointed chief executive of Cardiff Bay Development Corporation , could be described as the father of the whole project to redevelop the Welsh capital's decaying docklands. His paper to the Welsh Office in 1986, written when he was deputy chief executive of South Glamorgan County Council, was the basis on which the government set up a quango to oversee the scheme - at 2,700 acres the largest redevelopment project in Britain after London's docklands. Now, aged 54, he has just enough time to complete the job before retirement; the project, begun in 1987, was always seen as a 15-20 year scheme. His faith in Cardiff Bay has been undiminished despite the scheme coming off the boil as the property world went into deep recession. Promoted council chief executive five years ago, he was instrumental in siting the rebuilt County Hall in the Bay, the only significant investment in the area to have reached completion. A solicitor by training, Boyce began his local government career in Exeter, but came to South Wales 21 years ago. Boyce, who takes up his new position at the beginning of July, refuses to acknowledge being daunted by the fate of Canary Wharf. Cardiff has 'consistently had the opportunity to learn from London's mistakes' he asserts, adding that observation of other docklands regeneration schemes - such as Baltimore in Maryland - has convinced him of the 'absolute need to get the infrastructure right, with public sector involvement ahead of private sector investment.'</p>

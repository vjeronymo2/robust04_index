			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gao Tiesheng (7559 6993 3932), Liu Wen (0491 </F> 2429), and Zhang Xu Hong (1728 2485 1347) of the Market and  Price Regulation and Control Division, State Planning  Commission: "Market Prices: The Current Situation in 1993 and  Forecast for 1994"]    [Text] In 1993, the entire nation was sincerely carrying  out the spirit of the 14th National Party Congress and the  instruction of Comrade Xiaoping to "grasp opportunities and  hasten development" and not delay in furthering economic reform  and hastening economic development. As in 1992, the national  economy continued to operate at a high speed. At the same time,  conflicts caused by the transition between the old and new  systems and rapid economic development became even more  conspicuous and latent inflationary pressures began to be  released. Beginning with the latter half of 1993, when the party  Central Committee and the State Council decided to strengthen  and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, starting with  a rectification of the finance system, the national economy  began to stabilize and market prices subsided to a certain  extent. Looking at 1994, it appears that the rate of economic  growth will subside to an appropriate level, but there will  still be a relatively high growth rate. The extent of investment  growth will decrease but an appropriate level of investment will  be maintained in order to strengthen structural adjustment. The  range of commodity price increases will decline somewhat but  inflationary pressures will remain high. Price increases will  remain at a relatively high level. Price reforms will be  actively pursued in a prudent manner, based on the capacities of  various elements and control of the appropriate intensity and  timing of reforms.  <H5>  I. The Form and Characteristics of Market Prices in China in </H5> 1993    1. From January through September of 1993, the total retail  volume of social commodities was up 22.4 percent over the same  period in the previous year. The national aggregate retail price  levels were 12.1 percent higher than those of the same period of  the previous year. The cost of living was 13.7 percent higher  than that of the same period of the previous year. The cost of  living in 35 large and mid-sized cities increased 18.9 percent.  In examination of 1993 market commodity prices, the following  main characteristics can be seen: 1. The market for consumer  products is flourishing and dynamic. From January through  September, the retail sales volume of social commodities was  22.4 percent higher than that during the same period of the  previous year. After excluding the price increase factor, the  actual increase was 9.3 percent. The activity of China's  consumer product market in 1993 can be divided into two phases:  1) During the first half of the year, the consumer product  market maintained vigorous sales and the growth rate increased  each month. From January through June, the retail sales volume  of social commodities was 21.6 percent higher than that during  the same period of the previous year. The increase during the  first two months of the period was 15 percent. During March it  was 18.5 percent; in April it was 25.4 percent; in May 27.3  percent; and in June it reached 28.4 percent. 2) During the  latter half of the year the high growth rate momentum of China's  consumer products market began to slow and a trend from peaking  toward stability emerged. This was seen in the following: First,  growth in market sales began to subside. Growth in the social  commodities retail sales volume decreased 1.9 percent in July  from June. In August it was 4.6 percentage points lower than  that of June. Second, the hoarding and panic buying by residents  which occured during one period of the first half of the year  nearly disappeared. Sales of imported and name brand household  electrical appliances and gold jewelry clearly decreased. Third,  the momentum in group consumption inflation was brought under  control and decreased from a peak of an average of 30 percent  during the first half of the year to approximately 22 percent in  August and September, which was even lower than the growth in  resident consumption.    2. The capital goods market, which was consistently tight  during the first half of the year, became relatively loose.  Price increases which had been leaping forward began to slow.  This was chiefly evidenced by: 1) Market sales clearly fell to a  stable level. The sales volume growth margin fell from 49.5  percent during the first half of the year to 27.3 percent in the  third quarter. The supply and demand environment changed  gradually from a seller's market towards a buyer's market. The  change in the supply and demand environment in the capital goods  market was caused by the following two factors, in addition to  the influence of the greater economic environment: The first was  that the strengthening of macroeconomic regulation and control  basically eliminated speculative false demand in the market. The  second was that imported capital goods arrived continuously and  increased the general supply of resources. 2) Inventories  increased by a large margin, bringing inventory levels up  dramatically from the steady decline over the past year. By the  end of July, steel inventories for the entire society were up  10.8 percent from the beginning of the year. Cement supplies  were up 15.6 percent and lumber was up 1.2 percent. 3) Capital  goods prices fell back somewhat to previous, already high,  levels. The growth range in the general price index for capital  goods fell back to 43.2 percent in August from 52.9 percent in  June and, after decreasing 2.9 percentage points in July,  decreased another 6.8 percentage points in August.    3. The bloat in the general level of retail prices grew  markedly since the beginning of the year and potential  inflationary pressures began to be released. After the  strengthening of macroeconomic regulation and control, the  inflationary trend began to slow to the basis of previous high  levels. From January through September, national retail prices  increased 12.1 percent over the same period of the previous  year. The increase in January was 8.4 percent, in February 8.7  percent, in March 10.2 percent, in April 10.9 percent, in May  12.5 percent, in June 13.9 percent, in July 14.9 percent, in  August 15.1 percent, and in September 14.5 percent. Although the  general retail price level continued to rise during the latter  half of the year, the inflationary trend had already begun to  slow. The main factors that served to check the inflationary  trend in commodity prices were: The first was that apart from  rail freight and upward adjustments of electricty prices, no  other new price reforms were brought to bear in the latter half  of 1993. The second was that the effects carried over to 1993 of  the grain, coal and transportation price reforms of the latter  half of 1992, which had a relatively large impact on commodity  prices, gradually disappeared during the latter half of the  year. The third was that the decline in capital goods prices  decreased the cost factor pushing commodity prices.    An examination of the price increases of various types of  commodities and services from January through September shows  that the prices of everyday commodities increased 6.4 percent,  the price of entertainment commodities increased 0.5 percent,  the price of books, newspapers and magazines increased 6.0  percent, the price of pharmaceuticals and medical commodities  increased 9.4 percent, construction materials increased 29.6  percent, fuel increased 38.3 percent, agricultural production  materials increased 13.8 percent, and the price of services  increased 28.2 percent. When the information is categorized by  area, one can observe that the retail price increase in urban  areas was 12.6 percent and in rural areas 11.8 percent, and the  service price increase in urban areas was 31.6 percent and in  rural areas 25.6 percent.    Based on the new characterstics of the release of potential  inflationary pressures and the current operation of prices in  the market, we predict that the trends in national market prices  during the latter months of this year will be: The general level  of prices will remain high and not decline, but inflationary  trends will gradually subside. The general level of retail price  increases will be around 13 percent.    4. There has been great progress in the transition to price  mechanisms, in keeping with the requirements of a socialist  market economy. After government fixed prices were decontrolled  on a major scale as a continuation of the goal drafted and  promulgated in 1992 to redistribute pricing authority, a series  of measures were adopted in 1993 which resulted in breakthrough  progress: 1) In keeping with the principle of "unified policy,  decentralized policy making, guidance according to category, and  gradual advancement," grain and oil purchase prices were  decontrolled in all but a few provinces and regions. 2) The  price of most centrally allocated coal was decontrolled. First  the producer price of centrally allocated coal in Eastern China,  Northeast China (including the Eastern part of Inner Mongolia),  and Hunan province was decontrolled. Second, the producer price  of all clean coal from centrally allocated mines (not including  the portion used to produce coal gas for residential use) was  decontrolled. Third was the decontrol of prices of centrally  allocated power coal used in the production of electricity and  in the metallurgy industry in the whole country as well as of  economic coal submitted by local governments to the central  government for allocation. 3) The prices of most steel products  were decontrolled. Apart from steel used in mandatory plans for  national defence and military industry, in agriculture and  agricultural hydropower, and in specialized railway use, all of  which are state guided prices, the prices of all remaining steel  products were decontrolled. At the same time, the prices of  coking coal, raw iron, ingot steel, steel billets, iron alloys,  refractory materials, and carbon products as well as the  producer prices of iron ore and manganese ore were decontrolled.  4) The prices of some cement, communication exchange equipment,  civilian use trucks, fire trucks and fire-fighting equipment  were decontrolled. 5) Railway industry products were  decontrolled on a major scale. The number of items with prices  determined by the state or ministries was reduced from 13,875 to  161. The number of products with prices guided by the state or  by ministries was increased from 89 to 359. The number of items  with decontrolled prices was increased from 248 to 13,355. 6)  Agent pricing was implemented for raw materials for foodstuffs,  chemical fertilizers, cotton, wood pulp, and clothes washing  detergent imported under the national foreign currency use plan.  7) Management authority for the receipt of 22 types of  administrative fees such as visa fees for foreigners was  delegated to the relevant administrative agencies to determine  and implement fee levels.    As of the end of 1992, the proportion of state-fixed prices  was 5.9 percent of the retail volume of social commodities,  about 12.5 percent of the total purchases of agricultural  by-products, and about 18.7 percent of total income from capital  goods sales. In keeping with the development towards a market  economy, in 1993 the proportion of state-fixed prices decreased  yet another step. In summary, the leading role of the market in  the formation of prices for capital goods and consumer materials  has been basically confirmed.    5. Price structure adjustments have taken a great step  forward, with the emphasis on gradually correcting excessively  low prices in the basic industries. After the state adjusted the  prices of four sets of major products, foodstuffs, coal,  petroleum, and transportation, and raised prices in basic  industries such as steel, chemical fertilizers, post and  telegraph services, and surface transport in 1992, price  structure adjustments took another big step forward in 1993: 1)  In order to encourage crude oil production, enhance industrial  development capacity, and promote oil conservation, the low  level of China's crude oil prices was changed.In 1993, 30  million tons, or a "medium to high" amount of crude oil was  produced and the price of finished product oil was increased by  a commensurate amount. 2) In order to raise additional funds for  construction and hasten the development of railway  transportation, railway goods transportation prices were raised  in 1993 by 1.5 fen per ton per kilometer, from 3.85 fen to 5.35  fen per ton per kilometer. 3) On the basis of rectifying  electricity prices and eliminating irrational prices,  electricity prices were raised appropriately by power grid. The  national average price of electricity for industrial use was  raised about 3.2 fen per quarter. The price of electricity for  residential illumination was raised about 5 fen per quarter, and  the price of electricity for rural irrigation was raised about 2  fen per quarter. 4) The producer price for logs allocated from  state-owned forests in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia was  raised as well as the price of lumber turned in by state-owned  forests in Sichuan and Yunnan. 5) Producer prices for products  from copper and zinc were raised. The price of electolytic  copper went from a previous amount of 13,000 yuan per ton to  18,000 per ton. The price of raw copper went from a previous  level of 11,750 yuan to 16,200 yuan per ton of pure metal.  Refined copper ore went from a previous price of 9,870 to 12,000  yuan per ton. Zinc ingots went from a previous price of 6,400 to  7,700 yuan per ton. Refined zinc ore fell from a previous price  of 3,600 yuan to 3,000 yuan per ton. After the prices of copper  and zinc were adjusted as representative products, producer  prices for other similar products were adjusted appropriately  based on the stipulated price comparison coefficients.  Preliminary corrected calculations show that the adjustment  measures brought into play in China this year have directly  resulted in an increase in the average level of commodity prices  by 2.5 percentage points. The smooth implementation of these  adjustment measures has served an important function in  ameliorating China's irrational price structures and furthering  the development of basic production.    5. There was additional improvement of the system of  macroeconomic regulation and control of prices. With the  sustained rapid movement of the economy since 1993, production,  construction, circulation, and consumption, after expanding  rapidly during the previous year, have all experienced even more  rapid, inter-linked growth. At the same time, some new problems  and new conflicts have become more conspicuous. In particular,  excess currency circulation, a disorganized finance system, a  sudden expansion in investment demand and consumer demand, and  the exacerbation of "bottleneck" restrictions in basic  infrastructure and basic industry sectors have pushed up  commodity prices significantly and hastened the emergence of  inflation. Under these conditions, the party Central Committee  and the State Council have taken charge of the entire economic  scene and have decided to adopt a series of measures to advance  and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, based on  the guiding principle of "in economic work, we must take hold of  opportunities and hasten development but at the same time pay  attention to reliability and avoid losses, especially large  losses." Effective control will be exercised over the economy by  expanding reform, hastening the development and completion of  the market system, and quickly perfecting macroeconomic  regulation and control, using economic techniques, legal  techniques and, when necessary, administrative techniques. After  a period of great effort, the macroeconomic regulations and  controls have achieved some preliminary success, as demonstrated  by: First, illegal short-term loans by banks have ceased.  Second, various types of illegal accumulation of capital have  been brought under a preliminary degree of control, savings have  increased greatly, and the excessive issuance of currency has  slowed somewhat. Third, the exchange value of the renminbi has  fallen to a rational level. Fourth, capital goods prices have  fallen back to a certain extent and real property prices have  fallen by a large margin. Five, the population's expectations  for inflation have gradually decreased.  <H5>  II. Looking Ahead at the Operation of Market Commodity </H5> Prices for 1994    After two years of rapid growth in China's national economy,  there has been a great change in the macroeconomic environment.  The effectiveness of market mechanisms is gradually increasing.  The overall power of the country has clearly been strengthened.  Macroeconomic regulations and controls have begun to take  effect, the conflicts and problems which have emerged in  economic life have been resolved to a certain extent, and the  national economy is developing in a healthy direction. Favorable  conditions have been created for comprehensive reform and  opening and hastened economic development in 1994. The 90's are  a key era in China's socialist modernization. China is currently  facing a rare historical opportunity. In the face of new  situations and new tasks, in 1994 we must not delay in  furthering reform and opening, hastening the establishment of a  socialist market economy system, and promoting sustained, rapid,  and healthy economic development. For this reason, the national  economy must maintain a relatively high rate of development in  1994. According to the predictions of relevant experts, the  growth rate of the gross domestic product will remain above 10  percent. The fixed capital investment growth rate and the retail  merchandise sales volume growth rate of the entire society will  remain above 20 percent. Reform will be actively promoted in  1994 in such areas as taxation, finance, pricing, investment,  and foreign trade as well as in the enterprise system. These  reforms will have a fairly great impact on the operation of  market commodity prices in 1994. At the same time, the delayed  effects of the extraeconomic issuance of currency in 1993 and  the inertia of commodity price increases cannot be ignored. In  summary, a look at the market commodity price situation in 1994  shows that there are factors favorable to stability in market  commodity prices and factors which could lead to a rise in  market commodity prices.    In examining the factors favorable to stability in commodity  prices it can be seen that after the central government set down  policies to strengthen reform and macroeconomic regulation and  control, these policies were quickly disseminated and sincerely  implemented by all the regions and ministries and have achieved  some effectiveness, as demonstrated by the following:    1. There has been improvement in the finance system, which  is  moving towards stability. First, chaotic phenomena such as  sloppy short-term loans, sloppy fund raising, and the sloppy  establishment of finance organizations have ceased. Second,  citizens' savings deposits have been steadily rising every  month. As of September, the sum of remaining citizens' savings  deposits had reached 1386.7 billion yuan, 232.2 billion more  than at the end of the previous year. Third, the momentum of  injecting excessive amounts of bank notes into circulation was  halted and the rate of increase in the currency supply was  slowed. As of July, the margin of increase in M1 (narrowly  defined currency) had slowed from about 40 percent during the  first half of the year to a normal rate. Fourth, the payment  ability of specialized banks was strengthened. As of September,  reserve deposits rates in specialized banks had increased to 7.2  percent.    2. The fiscal and tax system improved and practices to  increase income and reduce expenses began to achieve  effectiveness. By eliminating inappropriate reductions or  remittals in taxes and aggressively attacking tax cheating and  stealing, clear improvements were made in the fiscal and tax  system. A preliminary turnaround was achieved over the first  half of the year when economic growth was rapid and low revenues  fluctuated. At the same time, the rapid growth in fiscal  expenditures was also brought somewhat under control.    3. There was improvement in the capital goods market, the  stock market, the foreign currency market, and the real estate  and development zone systems. The implementation of  macroeconomic regulation and control measures such as  standardizing the finance market and cleaning up the real estate  and development zone situations has clearly suppressed  speculative practices and "froth economy" elements. One such  example is that the profiteering practices in the capital goods  field have clearly been reduced. Capital goods supplies, which  were very tight, have become plentiful and prices have gone back  down. Second is that all areas have eliminated development zones  which did not meet requirements and are continuing to clear out  such zones. Third is that investment growth in commodity housing  has receded. Fourth is that the development of the stock market  is gradually stabilizing. Fifth is that the price ratio of the  dollar to the renminbi in the foreign currency adjustment market  has stabilized at about 1 to 8.8.4. Certain factors influencing  market commodity prices have changed: The first is that the  prices of foodstuff, domestic fuel, and building materials,  which exert the greatest pressure on commodity price levels,  have been largely decontrolled during the past two years and  thus will have less residual impact on 1994. The second is that  the prices of many capital goods in China now approach or have  exceeded international market price levels. These prices are  expected to stabilize at a fairly high level. The third is that  the consumption psychology of residents is becoming more mature.  Rational purchasing is more common than waves of panic buying,  and consumer spending is becoming more and more planned. The  fourth is that there has been a clear shift in the distribution  of residents' income, with more spent on savings, housing and  the purchase of stocks and bonds and some delay in a portion of  residents' immediate consumption.    5. The rapid growth in the national economy has increased  the  supply efficiency of the market, which has contributed a solid  material base for the maintenance of basic balance in the  aggregate supply and demand of the society.    6. The advancement of all the reforms will gradually resolve  many of the conflicts and problems remaining from the old system  at a fundamental level and will diffuse excess purchasing power,  mitigating and releasing some of the potential inflationary  pressure.    The factors which would cause commodity prices to rise can  be  seen in the following:    1. Society's aggregate demand is still peaking. Looking at  investment demand, it can be seen that although the growth in  fixed capital investment during the past few months has  decreased somewhat, it is still not an ideal situation. The  current growth rate in fixed capital investment is still over 60  percent, and it is predicted that fixed capital investment for  the year will exceed the plan by over threefold. The investment  rate will reach 37 percent, clearly beyond the limits of normal  figures and not favorable to the maintenance of steady and  healthy economic development and the normal functioning of  market commodity prices. Looking at consumption demand, it can  be seen that incomes of urban and rural residents will continue  to increase by a large margin. From January through September,  the average cost of living income for urban residents was 29  percent higher than that for the same period of the previous  year. After commodity price factors were deducted, the actual  increase was 12 percent. The average cash income for rural  residents increased 17 percent, or actually about 5 percent  after commodity price increases were factored out. A look at the  consumption demand trends in the fourth quarter shows that  following the implementation of the civil functionary system and  a series of measures designed by the state to promote  production, increase income and decrease expenditures for the  peasants, consumption demand will maintain a high rate of  growth. These factors will create a rather strong demand pull on  market commodity prices in 1994.    2. Looking at the finance and currency situations, it can be  seen that the number of new loans by banks and the net amount of  currrency put into circulation will be far greater than was  planned at the beginning of the year. An excessive amount of  currency in the market could cause inflation at any time.  History has proven that when the currency supply is excessive in  any given year, it will not only influence the inflation rate  for that year but also the inflation rate of the following year.  Therefore, when we predict the level of inflation for 1994, we  must examine not only the plans for currency issuance in 1994  but also the lagging influence of the currency issued in excess  of the economy in 1993.    3. It is not easy to be optimistic about the prospects for  the government fiscal situation. Although the current government  fiscal situation shows some improvement, the difficult financial  straits of the central government are still quite present.  Because the fourth quarter represents the peak period for  government financial expenditure, with the added financial  difficulties experienced during the previous period, many  appropriated funds are in arrears. This will increase pressure  on government fiscal payments during the next few months.    3. Due to the extensive price increases for energy and raw  materials during the past two years, as well as the large price  increases for funding, foreign exchange, and wages, pressures  for higher prices created by cost are now being released. During  the past year, prices paid by enterprises for energy and raw  materials have been over 30 percent higher than during the  previous year. The price of funds has risen over 10 percent and  the cost of foreign exchange has risen over 20 percent. These  price hike factors will necessarily push enterprise costs higher  and thus push prices higher. Because the push factor of costs  has a certain rigidity, this will not diminish significantly in  1994 and will not be clearly suppressed by macroeconomic control  and regulation.    4. Due to the lingering impact of excessive currency in  circulation, as the economy gradually cools down, market  commodity prices will still operate at a high level. Looking at  retail prices, it can be seen that in June prices rose 13.9  percent, in July 14.9 percent, and in August the increase  reached 15.1 percent. Cost of living prices for residents  increased 12.5 percent during the first half of the year and  then rose another 13.7 percent between the first and third  quarters. The cost of living in 35 medium-sized and large cities  has continued to rise at the high level of over 20 percent since  June.    5. The agricultural situation is also not optimistic. The  party Central Committee and the State Council have placed a high  priority during the past year on agriculture and have introduced  many specific policy measures to protect agricultural  production, with some effectiveness. Many factors influencing  the stability of agricultural production, however, are still  present and it is not easy to be optimistic about agriculture.  Stable agricultural production and an ample supply of  agricultural products provide the essential material base which  determines whether market commodity prices can operate normally.  The agricultural situation of 1993 will have a definite  influence on the operation of market commodity prices in 1994.    In summary, there are many objective factors present which  are favorable or not favorable to next year's market commodity  price situation. The key element determining whether market  commodity prices will maintain normal operation next year will  be whether the strength of macroeconomic control and regulation  is appropriate. If only we can be united in our understanding of  the situation and face the problems which exist, putting a top  priority on all aspects of the work to be done, we can maintain  the normal operation of market commodity prices and avoid severe  inflation.  <H5>  III. Macroeconomic Policy Choices for the Operation of </H5> Market Commodity Prices in 1994    There are mainly three choices for macroeconomic policies  for  the operation of market commodity prices in 1994.    The first is to adopt macroeconomic policies of  comprehensive  retrenchment as in 1988 and 1989. The advantage of this policy  is that it would allow inflated commodity prices to come down  rather quickly. The disadvantage is that it would be severely  detrimental to normal economic growth and would create a long  period of slump in the market.    The second is to seek only short-term high economic growth,  adopting a laissez-faire attitude towards market commodity  prices, eventually causing severe inflation which would then  necessarily bring down the rate of economic growth. This type of  tumultuous economic fluctuation would not only result in serious  damage to the national economy but would also impact on social  stability.    The third is to adopt a "soft attack" macroeconomic policy.  This would be to continue to strengthen and improve the  macroeconomic regulation and control of the national economy and  to gradually bring down the excessively high growth rate of  commodity prices while maintaining a sustained high rate of  healthy economic growth.    Our view is that the third option is usable. This is  because:  1) The 1990's are a key period in China's modernization. The  national economy must maintain a relatively high rate of growth.  We must take advantage of opportunities for development and  strive to create the conditions necessary to promote a sustained  high rate of healthy economic growth. 2) The current economic  environment, economic mechanisms and economic situation have  changed considerably from 1988. Therefore, our macroeconomic  regulation and control policies cannot simply repeat the  approach of 1988. We must operate in keeping with the patterns  of a market economy to favor the establishment of a socialist  market economy and avoid great economic rise and fall and major  losses. For this reason, we must not use "comprehensive  retrenchment" or "emergency brakes." 3) Looking at the conflicts  and problems present in current economic life, from a  fundamental point of view, it can be seen that because the  transition in economic systems is still not complete and the  disadvantages of the original economic system are still present,  macroeconomic reforms in finance, taxation, and investment are  particularly lagging behind. The fundamental approach to  resolving current and future problems in economic development is  to strengthen reform and establish a new socialist market  economic system.    In terms of macroeconomic policies, we must put great effort  into the following tasks to guarantee the normal operation of  market commodity prices in 1994:    1. The relationship among economic development, the  advancement of reform, and price stability must be managed  properly. We must control the proper strength of macroeconomic  regulation and control, and avoid severe inflation while  maintaining sustained rapid economic growth. In terms of the  current situation, the policy measures adopted by the central  government to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation  and control have already had a positive impact and have achieved  some preliminary success. The conflicts and problems in economic  life have been resolved to a certain extent. This has created a  macroeconomic environment more conducive to the normal operation  of market commodity prices and the advancement of reform and  opening. The assessment, however, of the current achievements  cannot be overdone. The conflicts and problems still present in  economic life are difficult to ignore. On the one hand, policy  measures to strengthen macroeconomic control have not been in  effect very long and the positive impact of these measures is  still preliminary. On the other hand, some deeply rooted  conflicts will only be resolved through deeper reform. In our  current economic work, we must continuously research and analyze  the newly emerging situations and problems in the economy and  correctly master the patterns of economic development in order  to resolve quickly problems and conflicts in the operation of  the economy. Looking at 1994, we must make every effort to keep  the economic growth rate and general commodity price level  growth rate at around 10 percent. We must also maintain two  security lines: The first is that the growth rate of common  incomes of urban and rural residents must not be below the rate  of commodity price increases. The second is that the savings  funds of residents must not depreciate and savings interest  rates must be higher than the rate of commodity price increases.  At the same time, we must hold steadfast to the use of combined  regulation and decontrol to actively and prudently advance price  reform policies. We must avoid overly hurried, one step  approaches but arrange for timely and smooth implementation of  each reform in an appropriate fashion and thus maintain the  stable functioning of market commodity prices.    2. The key to strengthening and improving macroeconomic  regulation and control is in expanding reform. The conflicts and  problems present in the current operation of the economy have  been caused primarily by friction between the old and new  systems. Therefore, the key to strengthening and improving  macroeconomic regulation and control is in expanding reform. In  the process of expanding reform, special attention must be paid  to the comprehensive use of economic levers such as government  finance, credit, interest rates, commodity prices, tax revenues,  wages and exchange rates. These must be coordinated in a  consistent fashion. At the same time, attention must be paid to  linking short-term regulation and control with long-term reform.  At the same time, ample use should be made of the comprehensive  planning function of the State Planning Commission. In  perfecting the system of macroeconomic regulation and control,  the Party Central Committee and the State Council have great  respect for planning and have emphasized the need to research  development strategies, research the fundamental impact of the  market on resource allocation, research mid- and long-term  planning and annual planning, and research production industry  policy. The State Planning Commission must take a comprehensive  view of the entire situation, and from a higher plane, research  and offer major macroeconomic policies. It must also offer  comprehensive coordination of the various economic policies and  economic regulation methods. Currently the emphasis should be on  coordinating the relationships among planning, finance, and  government finance, these three areas, to ensure consistency  among the various economic policies, economic levers and  economic methods.    3. Proactive measures should be adopted to strengthen the  macroeconomic regulation and control of fixed capital investment  and to vigorously refine the investment structure. Resolute  control of the scope of fixed capital investment with vigorous  refinement of the investment structure is a key element in  policy making on macroeconomic regulation and control and a  crucial major task. Unless we are determined to resolve the  problems of overextended construction, it will be difficult to  mitigate the tension in the macroeconomic environment and  effectively resolve the conspicuous problems in finance,  government finance, and other areas. Each region and ministry  must conform its thinking and actions to the central  government's policies and adopt effective measures to solve the  problems in fixed capital investment.    4. To create a better financial environment for the major  state reforms of 1994 and promote sustained rapid and healthy  development of the economy, the regulation, control and  management of the central bank's basic currency holdings must be  strengthened. First, we must continue to implement macroeconomic  regulation and control measures, correct the finance system,  strictly adhere to finance discipline and continue to enhance  reform. Second, we must strengthen the regulation, control and  management of the central bank's basic currency reserves and add  to the basic currency reserves in a timely, appropriate, and  effective fashion, to support the key needs of the development  of the national economy and further the sustained rapid and  healthy development of the national economy, and create a  financial environment conducive to reform and opening. Third, we  must continue adjusting the credit structure to guarantee the  key requirements for capital. Fourth, we must use the method of  strengthening reform to further improve the management system  and management methods of the credit fund system.    5. Price reforms must be actively promoted without delay to  advance the sustained rapid and healthy development of the  economy. The guiding philosophy of price reforms in 1994 should  be to actively pursue price reform in a safe fashion, with  rational control over the intensity of reform, on the basic  premise that the growth rate in aggregate commodity price levels  must be lower than that for the previous year. This must be  viewed with the following aspects in mind: 1) We must further  develop and improve price mechanisms with market prices as the  key. We must continue to shrink the scope of state-fixed prices  and actively further the transition to market prices, based on  the status of market supply and demand and of price reforms.  Prices for competitive commodities and common service fees must  be decontrolled as much as possible and allowed to be determined  by the market. The double track system for capital goods prices  must be eliminated gradually and the scope of the capital goods  market must be expanded. 2) Based on the requirements of the  developing socialist market economy, price structures should be  further rationalized and basic product prices should be raised,  to solve the problem of excessively low basic industry prices.  The prices of agricultural products should be raised  appropriately and the system of guaranteed prices and support  prices for food and key agricultural by-products should be  established and perfected, with attention paid to guaranteeing  benefits for the peasants. 1994 will represent an important step  forward in adjusting price structures, based on the progress of  China's price reforms and the capacities of all elements.    6. The system for indirect macroeconomic regulation and  control of the market by the government must be perfected.  First, a complete two-tiered price regulation and control system  for the central government and the provinces, autonomous  regions, and direct-ruled municipalities must be gradually  perfected. Second, economic, administrative, and legal methods  must be used in a comprehensive fashion to strengthen management  of decontrolled prices. Third, the price adjustment fund system  for the central government and local governments and the reserve  system for important commodities must by established and  perfected, in order to strengthen the state's ability to exert  macroeconomic regulation and control over the market. Fourth,  the assessment and advance warning systems for market prices  must be further developed, in order to provide accurate  indicators and reliable bases for price policy making and price  regulation and control. Fifth, the legal system of laws and  regulations for actions relating to the markets and prices must  be perfected and standardized.    7. The central government's policy measures on strengthening  agriculture must be sincerely and thoroughly implemented to  strive to stabilize agricultural production. Agriculture is the  basis of the national economy and of social stability. A good  agricultural situation provides a foundation for the normal  operation of market commodity prices. If major problems emerge  in agricultural production, there will be a serious impact on  the stability of the market and commodity prices. Looking at the  current situation, the following tasks must be completed: The  first is to further implement all measures to stabilize and  strengthen agriculture, after the meeting of the Central Working  Committee on Agriculture. The second is to continue expanding  rural reforms, to foster markets, expand the market system, and  strengthen macroeconomic guidance with priority placed on the  protection of the peasants. We must also hasten the  establishment of rural economic operation mechanisms and  management systems suited to the requirements of a socialist  market economy. The third is to enlarge the extent of funds  invested in agriculture by all levels of government. It would be  preferable to cut back temporarily on the number of industrial  projects and provide guarantees for the pressing needs of  agricultural development, raise the prices appropriately for  agricultural products, and inspire the enthusiasm of the  peasants to develop production.</p>

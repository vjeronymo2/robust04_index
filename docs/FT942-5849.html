			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Telekom buys Pounds 50m Astra stake Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, the German state-owned telecommunications and post office group, has bought a large stake in Astra, the satellite television company, in a deal believed to be worth Pounds 50m (Dollars 75.2m). The German company has bought 25 per cent of the privately-held share capital of Societe Europeenne des Satellites, the Astra holding company. Two-thirds of SES is held by private European investors including Thames Television, which along with the Financial Times is a subsidiary of Pearson, the media and entertainment group. The other third of SES is owned by Luxembourg state-owned financial institutions. Although it is most unlikely that SES will be sold - the Luxembourg government will want to keep its stake and its control - the deal would give a notional value for SES of more than Pounds 500m. SES declined to reveal the purchase price of the Telekom stake. The deal suggests that Thames Television's 10 per cent stake in SES could be worth more than Pounds 50m. Pearson paid Pounds 100m for Thames, and in addition to the SES stake, the deal included the company's continuing programme supply business with Independent Television, its Teddington studios, programme library and stakes in satellite channels. SES has three Astra satellites broadcasting 50 television channels to cable television networks and satellite dishes across western Europe. A fourth satellite capable of broadcasting a further 16 channels is due to be launched in September. SES revenues in 1993 increased 23 per cent over 1992 to Pounds 128m. Profits rose 19 per cent to Pounds 55m.</p>

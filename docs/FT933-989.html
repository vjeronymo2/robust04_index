			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Food and Drink: A fine taste of Sicily BROOM AND oleander were in bloom along the roadside when we left Palermo for Menfi in south-west Sicily. Beyond acres of vines and olives, some citrus trees showed yellow - the first hint of the thematic tastes of a Sicilian week of cooking. A course with Tasting Italy is a dream week for the lazy and greedy. Primarily a cooking holiday, the philosophy is one of mood as much as food: to introduce, along with superb cooking, the Italian sense of the importance of fresh ingredients and mealtimes. 'I see people at supermarket checkouts buying tinned potatoes,' says Sara Schwartz, one of the partners of Tasting Italy, 'and I want to ask them why.' Why indeed, when potatoes tossed in olive oil, interspersed with onion, lemon and garlic, then scattered with coarse salt and origanum and baked, can make your toes curl with delight? Our course was held in an 18th-century palazzo owned by the Ravida family. The rooms are huge and their church-like smell - one of the bedrooms was formerly a chapel - is enhanced by paintings, frescoes and gilt finery. We were an eclectic crowd, eyeing one another around our welcome table of bread with lemon zest and sun-dried tomatoes. On a marble slab table was a huge bowl of lemons, and ice-breaking jugs of Pimms-soaked strawberries. This was not the bakers' dozen of serious foodies I had been expecting. Ranging from 18 to over 60, they included a diesel generator factory owner, a student, a waste disposal company MD; a retired builder and the head chef of a King's Road restaurant. In charge of us for the week was Carla Tomasi, cook and writer. We were issued with aprons and watched Carla prepare sardines and anchovies. An exponent of the hands-on school of learning, she threw us into the deep end with that tray of unfortunate fish. Our self-congratulation knew no bounds when we lunched on tender pink and white marbled beans with a rough pesto, anchovies cured in lemon juice, sardines fried around cheesy stuffings, spaghetti with a sauce of sardines, onions, currants and pine nuts. Dessert was wild strawberry ice cream served with strawberries marinated in orange and lemon juice. All this with too much wine and sweet spring water. We slept it off on the beach. The course may not be heavyweight enough for the really serious foodie. But it was deeply enriching for me and we took away a file full of eminently repeatable recipes along with memories of a slightly crumbling palazzo, flaking frescoes, cool verandahs and new friends. Tasting Italy courses also take place in Piedmont and Tuscany. Prices range from Pounds 695-Pounds 715 which includes transfers, tuition and all food and wine but excludes airfares.

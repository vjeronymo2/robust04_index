Shortly before the trial opened, Iranian  Information Minister 'Ali Fallahian asked the Federal Government  to quash the proceedings dealing with the question of Iranian  state-sponsored terrorism, Schmidbauer, coordinator of the  German intelligence services in the Chancellor's Office,  confirmed at the Mykonos trial at the Berlin Court of Appeal on  Thursday [17 March]. Schmidbauer emphasized that he strictly  declined to meet this wish expressed by the Iranian side,  because the trial was exclusively a case for the independent  German judicial authorities.    Shortly after his meeting with Fallahian in October 1993,  Schmidbauer answered with a clear no to a question raised in the  Bundestag whether the Mykonos killings were discussed in his  meeting with Fallahian. According to the investigations of the  Federal Public Prosecutor, Fallahian may have ordered the attack  in which four Iranian opposition leaders were assassinated in  the Berlin "Mykonos" restaurant on 17 September 1992.</p>

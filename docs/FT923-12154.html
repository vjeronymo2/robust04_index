			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Caledonia buy-back swamped and tenders to be scaled down CALEDONIA Investments has been swamped with tenders of stock following its offer to buy up to 10 per cent of its share capital - 9.2m shares - at a price of 355p. Shareholders offered 35.3m shares to be bought back, worth Pounds 125.2m at the tender price, compared to the Pounds 32.7m Caledonia was prepared to buy. Caledonia said tenders would be scaled down according to the number of shares held by any investor. Those who offered more than 18.4 per cent of their holdings would be scaled down to that level, while those who tendered less than 18.4 per cent would have their shares accepted in full. Mr Peter Buckley, chief executive, said that as the buy-back counted as a distribution of income, non-tax paying funds, such as pension funds, which tendered stock could reclaim tax adding about 100p a share to the value of the offer. The Cayzer family had tendered some stock to ensure that its holding in the company would not rise by more than the permitted 2 per cent. The family stake will be about 47.7 per cent following the tender. The offer was announced on June 25, when the FT-SE 100 index stood at 2,557.3, compared to yesterday's close of 2,403.7. Caledonia's shares were unchanged yesterday at 349p. Caledonia is an investment holding company with stakes in a range of businesses including 27.3 per cent of Exco, the money broking firm, which it acquired in June, and 45 per cent of Bristow Helicpoter Group, bought last November. Even after the buy-back the group will have about Pounds 150m of cash available for investment. The buy-back scheme still has to be approved by shareholders at the annual meeting on August 5. If that meeting gives the go-ahead the company plans to send out cheques the following day.</p>

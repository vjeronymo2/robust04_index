			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE LICENSING OF CHILD-CARE HOMES  </P> <P> I was deeply disappointed in the irresponsible reporting regarding  irresponsible people that provide unlicensed child care (April 11): "Child  Care, It's Seller's Market." In my opinion, there is no excuse for caring for  children without a license.  </P> <P> I have been a licensed family day-care provider of quality child care for 7  years. Through my experience as a provider and family day-care consultant, I  know of only three reasons why a person like Sorenson stays unlicensed:  </P> <P> * A rare case of exemption, i.e. caring for family members.  </P> <P> * The unlicensed provider does not want to conform to the vary basic health and  safety codes that a license should bring, i.e. acknowledging the child-to-adult  ratios that exist for the children's safety.  </P> <P> * Complete irresponsibility.  </P> <P> If an unlicensed provider is not going to recognize and comply with these basic  safety codes, then what can a parent expect from this person in the way of  providing a rich, responsive environment for their children? Unfortunately, the  child suffers from inconsistent and below-standard care.  </P> <P> However, Orange County parents can not continue to depend on the Department of  Social Services to do their work. Parents have the power to demand licensed  child care for their children. Naturally, it may take time and effort on their  part to find a space. More than likely they will have to put their child's name  on a waiting list. But, for the sake of their children, they do not have to  accept this "so, nobody can stop me" attitude that many of these unlicensed  providers so proudly proclaim.  </P> <P> Parents should look at their child-care expenditures as an investment. Not just  as a monetary investment, but as an investment in the future of their children.  Sometimes an investment will cost a parent . . . an extra $20 a week. But the  return on that investment will be invaluable.  </P> <P> So why throw money away with a person who does not have the fortitude to get a  simple operating license. If you are a parent who has their child in unlicensed  child care, demand that your provider meet the bare minimum requirements and  get licensed. If they refuse, start looking for licensed care by calling the  local referral services weekly until you find the situation that meets your  needs. Sadly, I can think of three families who wished they had.  </P> <P> Take the time and make the effort for children. They deserve it.  </P> <P> GARY W. BROOKS  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

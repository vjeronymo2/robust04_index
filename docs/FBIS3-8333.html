			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Bucharest today the Hungarian Cultural Center  hosted a news conference by a delegation for Hungary's Alliance  of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. SZDSZ leader Gabor Kuncze and Istvan  Szentivanyi, deputy chairman of the Foreign Relations Commission  of Hungary's parliament and a member of SZDSZ, answered the  questions asked by the journalists.    Our correspondent Letitia Militaru inquired about the  SZDSZ's  chances in the 8 May elections.    [Begin recording] [Militaru, in Romanian with simultaneous  Hungarian translation] What are SZDSZ's chances in the 8 May  elections?    [Kuncze, in Hungarian with simultaneous Romanian  translation]  Naturally I cannot discuss this issue in an unbiased way, but I  think our chances are very good. According to public opinion  polls, the SZDSZ is the second-strongest party and its  popularity is growing continuously. If we add up the two  liberal-oriented parties in Hungary, the liberal bloc could have  a great weight.    [Militaru] How does your party view the Romanian-Hungarian  relations?    [Kuncze] In the eyes of SZDSZ, Hungarian-Romanian ties have  a strategic importance. It is a strategic one owing to the fact  that we are neighbors, owing to the Hungarian ethnic minority  living here, and owing to our economic interests. The  efficiency of Hungarian diplomacy could be measured by the way  in which it will manage to achieve progress in this issue.    [Militaru] What does the Hungarian ethnic minority living in  Romania mean to the SZDSZ?    [Kuncze] I think it is important to state that we cannot  restrict our bilateral relations merely to our ties with that  minority, which should be just a part of our bilateral  relations. Culturally speaking, the Hungarian ethnic minority  belongs to the Hungarian nation. Hungary's Constitution  stipulates that every Hungarian government has to consider  itself responsible for the Hungarians living outside the  country's borders and to protect their interests. As far as I  know, Romania's Constitution, in Paragraph 2 of its Article 7,  contains similar stipulations.</p>

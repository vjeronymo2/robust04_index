			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A federal judge in San Francisco denied nearly every motion made by five  defendants in a huge hashish-marijuana smuggling case and cleared the way for  their trial to begin in April. Alleged ringleader Calvin Robinson and his  co-defendants -- a son, stepson and two nephews -- will face trial nearly a  year after they were arrested in the seizure of $189 million worth of hashish  and marijuana. They allegedly used a tugboat and a barge to bring huge  quantities of the drugs into the Bay Area from a "mother ship" anchored well  offshore in the Pacific. Last May, a U.S. Customs Service investigation ended  when the Coast Guard intercepted the tug and found the drugs hidden in secret  compartments in the barge. U.S. District Judge John Vukasin, during a pretrial  hearing at which details of jury selection were also to be discussed, denied 18  pretrial motions.  </P></p>

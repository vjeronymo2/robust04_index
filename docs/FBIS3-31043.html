The meeting is to discuss differences of  views that have clearly taken shape within the past few days.  Our colleague Renata Havranova, editor of the PRACE daily,  reports:    [Havranova] The extraordinary session of the HZDS national  leadership is to decide today about the stance to be taken by  the ruling movement on solving a serious political crisis in  Slovakia--the crisis that was brought about by the HZDS itself,  with some SNS [Slovak National Party] deputies, by obstructions  in the [Slovak] parliament. Since early this morning, the Modra  hotel has been totally closed to journalists.    [HZDS] press spokeswoman Ivana Salczerova confirmed that  Prime Minister [Vladimir] Meciar had taken the floor, as he had  promised, to give his view on the Alternative of Political  Realism formed in Papiernicka, which is being supported by nine  deputies--one of the original 10 signatories has withdrawn its  signature--and two government members, [Deputy Prime Minister]  Roman Kovac and [Foreign Minister] Jozef Moravcik. Meciar is  said to have described once again their appeal to immediately  form a government of broad coalition without political heads as  an immoral, undemocratic appeal contradicting the movement's  principles. According to Meciar, the action taken by Moravcik  and Kovac is a dirty trick, not only on him personally but also  on the entire government and all of its members.    This afternoon, journalists came across Jozef Moravcik  walking in the streets of this little town. He confirmed to  them that the discussion was very sharp and that all those who  had joined the Alternative were probably going to be pacified by  the [HZDS] leadership. He also said that a proposal was voiced  asking him and Roman Kovac to resign. He is determined not to  resign. According to Minister Moravcik, whatever decision is  made at today's session of the leadership, there is no doubt  that the shaping of views has already begun, and it is no longer  possible to halt it.</p>

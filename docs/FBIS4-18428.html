			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Cypriot House of Representatives and the  Greek Chamber of Deputies have established a mechanism for  continuous exchange of information, coordination, and  cooperation in all international bodies to which they both  belong, as well as for international bodies in which only Greece  participates. House of Representatives President Alexis Galanos  announced this upon his return this evening from Athens, where  he headed a multiparty parliamentary delegation. The president  of the House of Representatives and the parliamentary delegation  also had a meeting with Theodhoros Pangalos, Greek Alternate  Foreign Minister.    Speaking after the meeting with Galanos, the Greek alternate  foreign minister described the state of alert by the occupation  forces and other Turkish actions as very impudent provocations.  They think that they are powerful, Pangalos added, but this is  not the first time someone has threatened Greece with his size  and was later ridiculed. [passage omitted]</p>

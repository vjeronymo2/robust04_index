			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nine-month reverse at Investor SLIDING profits at Saab-Scania, the vehicle and aerospace group, and falling capital gains sent pre-tax profits tumbling to SKr216m (Dollars 26m) in the first nine months from SKr1.63bn at Investor, the company which groups the prime industrial holdings of Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family. Sales at Saab-Scania, which is a subsidiary of Investor, slipped to SKr19.3bn from SKr19.9bn as assistance from the devaluation of the Swedish krona failed to offset flagging demand in Europe for its trucks and aircraft. Profits at Saab-Scania fell to SKr930m from SKr1.55bn. Investor repeated its half-year warning that it expected Saab-Scania's full-year profits to be 'significantly lower' than 1992's SKr2.13bn because of continued weak demand. Capital gains, mainly from the sale of Investor's stake in Asea, the Swedish half owner of the engineering giant Asea Brown Boveri and of holdings in Stora, the forestry group, fell to SKr1.22bn from SKr2.27bn. The value of Investor's strategic portfolio stood at SKr25.14bn at end-September. The portfolio includes most of Sweden's top industrial names, including Astra, Stora, SKF, Ericsson and Atlas Copco, but the rise in value was significantly less than the stock market rise. Investor's net worth stood at SKr34.26bn at September 30 with Saab-Scania shown at book value. Group net debt was SKr7.95bn, down from SKr8.7bn at the end of last year.</p>

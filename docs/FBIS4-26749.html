			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, China, June 24 (AFP)--PSA Peugeot Citroen  hopes to produce 350,000 cars per year in China by 2000, about  one-fourth of local production, after signing joint-venture  pacts with Chinese state enterprises. The group could  potentially increase the production level to 500,000 within a  few years if China's market for private cars is developed.  Currently, China only makes cars for taxi and government use.    PSA Peugeot Citroen joint ventures signed or under  negotiation could represent more than a third of the current  long-term production potential in China in association with all  foreign makers.    VAG (Volkswagen-Audi) is second behind PSA Peugeot Citroen  in  terms of expected production capacity with 450,000 units,  followed by U.S. company Chrysler with 200,000, Korea's Daewoo  with 150,000, and Japan's Daihatsu at 100,000.    Peugeot, the second European auto maker to come to China,  arrived in 1985 just after Volkswagen and is today expanding its  base in Guangzhou, with the help of the city council. Guangzhou  owns 46 percent of the joint venture Guangzhou Peugeot  Automobile. PSA Peugeot Citroen, which owns a 22 percent stake  in Guangzhou Peugeot, is in the process of completing phase two  of its industrial set up, intended to bring production capacity  of its 505 series to 50,000 a year. It has also negotiated the  construction of a new factory with an annual capacity of 150,000  model 405 cars.    Construction of the 120 hectare factory requires an  investment of 600 million dollars and completion of the project  before the century's end in order for Peugeot to expand along  with the expected growth in the car market here. In several  years, the domestic car market is forecast to triple from the  current level of 550,000 cars, of which 225,000 are made locally.    In Wuhan, 800 kilometers north of Guangzhou, Citroen is  building two ultra-modern European-size factories which will  employ 11,000 people. The factories are scheduled to go into  operation in 1996 and are expected to produce 150,000 ZX cars  for a total investment of five billion French francs ($910  million).    The first factory in Wuhan will be devoted to assembling  vehicles. The second, built in Xiangfan, 350 kilometers (217  miles) to the west, will make motors, gearboxes amd suspension  systems.    Citroen's double chevron logo will be associated with  Dongfeng Motor Corporation, a former truck maker, which owns 70  percent of the joint venture. Citroen holds 25 percent of the  company, Societe General possesses four percent, and Banque  Nationale de Paris has one percent.    The annual capacity of the two sites is expected to be  300,000 vehicles. The joint venture is expected to introduce the  smaller AX car, intended for private customers, a market which  barely exists at the moment. Despite a population of 1.2  billion, China in 1993 estimated that only 50,000 cars belonged  to private individuals.    Citroen and Peugeot differ from Japanese makers, who are  barely present in the Chinese automobile industry, in that they  agreed to major transfers of technology in order to get the  contracts. The pair also expect a major local integration rate  of about 60 percent, which will be closer to 100 percent near  2003 or 2004. The two companies say they would like to have  separate distribution networks, which are only now beginning to  develop.</p>

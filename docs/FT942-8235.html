			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: A non-enterprising legacy Sir, It is ironic some western companies are experiencing difficulties as investors in Romania, for reasons to which they have themselves contributed during Ceaucescu's years of forced industrial expansion ('Shoddy meets quality in Transylvania', May 18). Romania's swollen industries have absorbed for more than a generation large numbers of impoverished farm workers with few relevant skills. However low the resulting productivity, the dismally low pay helped achieve international competitiveness in selected areas, including those which have benefited Ikea as buyers of furniture 'for more than two decades'. By the 'western standards' to which Mr Gunnerling (the specialist in turning around failing companies) refers, Magura Codlea factory was as bankrupt then as it is now. As such it is a good investment, particularly when the Romanian furniture industry has adapted well to change over the past three years and expanded its export markets. What Ikea must address, however, beyond providing efficient production facilities, is the cultural bias against true enterprise, an enduring legacy of the Ceaucescu regime. Dan Stranescu, 6/38 Arundel Gardens, London W11 2LB</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Pounds 40m Welsh plant is largest start-up venture A Pounds 40m hardboard factory is to be built in south Wales in the largest UK manufacturing start-up to be backed by venture capital. Tech-Board, a new company, will make the first hardboard in Britain for five years since the closure of UK Paper's elderly factory at Kemsley, Kent. The new plant is expected to create 200 jobs and will use home-grown wood. The factory, with a capacity of 88,000 tonnes a year, could meet about half of the UK's requirements for hardboard, which is principally used in the furniture, automotive and building trades. The company intends to export to continental Europe. Mr Malcolm Graham, the former general manager of UK Paper's hardboard division, has spent the last five years since the Kemsley plant closed putting together the financing package that was agreed yesterday. He will be chief executive of Tech-Board. A syndicate of UK and international banks and venture capital houses includes 3i, which will be represented on the board. The Welsh Office is providing a Pounds 3.4m grant and additional finance is being provided by Gwent County Council and Pounds 250,000 of loan and equity is coming from British Coal Enterprise, the corporation's job-creation arm. The 12-acre factory site is on reclaimed mining land on an industrial estate near Ebbw Vale. Male unemployment in the area is 20 per cent. The new company's chairman will be Mr Peter Learmond, who raised Pounds 12m in the early 1970s to form Sheerness Steel, a mini-mill, in what was then the UK's largest industrial green-field start-up. Construction of the Tech-Board factory will start next month with production due to start within 18 months. The equipment will be imported from Sweden. Mr Graham said that the hardboard would be produced 'using wood harvested from managed UK forests, it will contain only minimal man-made chemicals and the manufacturing process will develop virtually no waste'. Tech-Board expects to gain a significant competitive advantage over foreign hardboard suppliers because of its lower transport costs and through more efficient production techniques.

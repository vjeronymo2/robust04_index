			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report by Seyyat Agababali and Kabil Huseyinli </F> from Istanbul on 9 June; recorded]    [Text] [Agababali] President of Azerbaijan Geydar Aliyev  arrived in this country for a brief working visit on 9 June at  the invitation of Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.    President Suleyman Demirel, Istanbul Mayor Kozakcioglu, and  other officials welcomed Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev at  Istanbul's Ataturk Airport. President Aliyev inspected the  guard of honor. Afterwards, Geydar Aliyev and Suleyman Demirel  made statements to the press at the airport. Later the two  presidents held a private meeting at Demirel's residence in  Istanbul, after which Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev  received British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd, who is on a  visit to Istanbul. Dear listeners, after this brief report on  the president's visit, I now give the telephone to state adviser  Kabil Huseyinli.    [Huseyinli] Today Istanbul has been transformed into the  epicenter of world politics. This is because, alongside the  NATO countries, delegates from 41 countries who have signed  NATO's Partnership for Peace program have gathered in Istanbul.  Truly, the most important political problems of the world are  being examined here. From this angle, Azerbaijani President  Geydar Aliyev's participation in such a high-level ceremony is  undoubtedly of great importance for explaining Azerbaijan's  problems to the world and thus initiating a search for a  political solution to these problems.    It must also be noted that there were significant talks on  these problems from the very first moments of the visit. Our  president discussed a number of practical matters pertaining to  a political solution in Daghlik-Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh] with  Suleyman Demirel at Istanbul airport and during the meeting with  British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd. The noteworthy fact is  that the view is gaining ground that a solution to this sore  spot of the world might henceforth be achieved mostly through  international organizations. This issue will be discussed in  more detail during talks tomorrow morning, and practical ways to  resolve the problem within the CSCE framework will be examined  once more. The Azerbaijani president's participation in these  high-level talks and the expected allocation of time to discuss  the Daghlik-Karabakh problem at this meeting will undoubtedly  bring a political solution of this problem closer.    Dear listeners, we want to conclude our report from Istanbul  with Suleyman Demirel's statement at the airport. Turkish  President Suleyman Demirel said that it is a shame for the major  world powers to turn a blind eye to these occupationist  developments in Azerbaijan, and that he will discuss these  matters with the U.S. secretary of state.</p>

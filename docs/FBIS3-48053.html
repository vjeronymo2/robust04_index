			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Bosnian  President Alija Izetbegovic Saturday called on the international  community to implement the more than 30 resolutions adopted by  the United Nations to end Serb atrocities against Bosnians in  the former Yugoslav republic. He said so far only one  resolution -- the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina -- had  been enforced.    This resolution is against the interest of Bosnians as they  are unable to defend themselves from the Serb atrocities, he  told the international conference of parliamentarians on  Bosnia-Herzegovina here.    The two-day conference attended by about 180  parliamentarians  from more than 30 countries was opened by Malaysian Prime  Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed.    Referring to Article 51 of the UN Charter which says that an  independent state under atteck had every right to defend itself,  Izetbegovic called on the UN to lift the embargo.    He said his people were not seeking an ideological state of  any kind but only wanted to preserve a democratic secular state.    He dismissed the misconception that the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina was either a civil war or religious war.    It is actually genocide... It's the war against every  religion, he said.    Izetbegovic said the war could not be stopped through  appeals  or resolutions. The aggressors don't understand this type of  logic. We have to confront force with force, he added.    After the failure of the recent peace negotiations in  Geneva,  we (the Bosnian Muslims) have been accused of rejecting calls  for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We don't reject peace, he said.    He added that the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina into three  mini-ethnic states was meant to confine Bosnian Muslims and  deprive them of access to the sea.    Izetbegovic said children and adults, young and old, were  being murdered and driven from their homes, while the women  faced constant rape in bosnia where concentration camps just  like those during World War II have reemerged.    He expressed appreciation to Dr. Mahathir and the Malaysian  people for their continued support to seek and ensure justice  and fairness for the Bosnians.    He said Malaysia's multicultural and multireligious  population was similar to that of his country.    Malaysia has proven that there can be tolerance in such a  society, he added.    Izetbegovic hoped the conference would pave the way for an  international campaign against Serb atrocities in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

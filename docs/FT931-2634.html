			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trade Indemnity reduces deficit sharply to Pounds 4.9m TRADE INDEMNITY, the UK's leading independent credit insurer, expects renewed growth in the second half of the year, but is not expecting business insolvencies to fall by more than 10 per cent. Mr Vic Jacob, managing director, said that an equally grim picture emerged from policy holders who told the company that they were not expecting much increase in sales in 1993. 'That is not an encouraging sign for the next 12 months,' Mr Jacob said. Trade Indemnity, which is 80 per cent controlled by nine European insurance groups, has about 100,000 UK customers, representing what Mr Jacob termed a 'fair selection of the active corporate community' in the UK. The group yesterday reported sharply reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 46.6m) on gross premium income up 6 per cent at Pounds 147m (Pounds 139m). Underwriting losses on continuing operations fell from Pounds 25.1m to Pounds 6.7m, while the loss on discontinued business was Pounds 6.8m, against Pounds 25.5m. Business insolvencies in 1992 fell only 4 per cent from the record level of the previous year. The company said the increase in premium income had been achieved despite the fact that policy holders had been hit by a fall in sales on which premiums are based. The improved performance had followed better risk and underwriting control and more targeted marketing. Losses per share were 1p, down from 26.35p.</p>

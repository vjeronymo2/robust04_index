			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Norwegian shipowner up sharply LEIF HOEGH, one of Norway's biggest shipowners, reported a sharp increase in nine month pre-tax profit to NKr581m (Dollars 81m) from NKr135m last year, helped by a stronger fleet, higher freight rates and a stronger dollar. Group net freight revenue rose to NKr1.79bn from NKr1.58bn as operating profit increased to NKr274m from NKr218m. The shipowner posted a nine-month financial profit of NKr48m against a financial loss of NKr83m during last year's comparative interim. Hoegh said the improvement was due to a rise in net interest income to NKr64m from NKr58m, a decline in foreign currency losses to NKr24m from NKr38m and a drop in interest expenses to NKr57m from NKr77m. The group also achieved financial gains of NKr66m on investments, against a loss of NKr26m last year. Hoegh said the oil products market from North Africa to the US and Europe for combination carriers was quite good throughout the third quarter but that it had weakened for tankers with a strong autumn market yet to materialise. IM Skaugen, the Norwegian gas carrier group, reported a reduction in nine-month pre-tax losses to NKr151m from NKr338m, helped by a fall in financial and operating costs and a stronger dollar. Last year the group also operated tankers which it has since divested, so figures are not directly comparable. Group operating losses were cut significantly to NKr75m from NKr236m from last year's comparative period. Voyage costs in the nine-month period were reduced to NKr60m from NKr267m as other operating costs were cut by more than half to NKr101m from NKr247m.</p>

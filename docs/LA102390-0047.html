			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> QUESTION OF BALANCE FINALLY ANSWERED  </P> <P> Offensive balance is something the Rams hadn't achieved until Sunday, in their  44-24 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. They rushed 32 times and passed 38.  </P> <P> "It was the first time that we had been able to play a game offensively, for  some time, other than Tampa, where we were not significantly behind," Coach  John Robinson said. "It allowed us to put together a rhythm of run and pass  that I liked."  </P> <P> For the first time this season, Jerry Glanville's Falcons rarely blitzed  against the Rams and generally toned down their style.  </P> <P> "I think they had gone a little too far out over the edge," Robinson said. "You  know, it's a new staff, and their approach to football is to come in and to  sell an attitude."  </P> <P> Because the Rams don't play until Monday night against the Pittsburgh Steelers,  Robinson gave the team today and Wednesday off. . . . Robinson said he didn't  know if cornerback Darryl Henley, who has been sidelined all season because of  an injured hip muscle, will be activated this week. Henley began working with  the team last week. TIM KAWAKAMI  </P></p>

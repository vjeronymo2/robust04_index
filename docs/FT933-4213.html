			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (10): European slump applies the brakes - Western Europe's car market fell by nearly 18 per cent / UK Motor Industry The steepest continental European car market slump in recent memory has at last begun to apply the brakes to a resurgent UK motor industry. After hovering at an unchanged 13.5m units in 1992, western Europe's car market fell by nearly 18 per cent in the first seven months of this year. The UK market, which went into recession much earlier, has gone against the Euro-trend: up by 9.1 per cent in the same period. But even with most forecasters expecting sales to grow this year to between 1.75m and 1.8m - from 1992's 1.59m - it is too small to sustain output from some UK car plants in the face of such a sharp drop in demand on the Continent. In gross output terms, statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers (SMMT) and Central Statistical Office continued to paint a buoyant picture of expansion during the first half of this year. They showed car production up by 8.19 per cent, to 742,991, over the period, compared with the 686,747 during the same period last year. But in July, for the first time in many months, the figures showed a fall in total output: by 2.42 per cent, to 115,648. Most tellingly, production for export was down 16 per cent - the first significant drop of the year. Commenting on the figures, Mr Roger King, SMMT public affairs director, says that 'overall production levels are clearly at risk in the face of shrinking exports.' Even so, production would have to slump by nearly one third in the remaining months of this year if the 1992 total of 1,291,880 were not to be exceeded. Most analysts still expect a final outturn approaching 1.4m - which would be the highest since 1975 and a far cry from the 880,000 produced in 1982, in the depths of the previous recession. Nevertheless, production at the traditional UK 'big four', Rover, Ford, Vauxhall and Peugeot Talbot, is now contracting - in some cases sharply. Growth this year is entirely the result of the start of UK production by Toyota and Honda, together with an expansion into two-model production by Nissan's plant at Sunderland. The most recent statistics for manufacturers' production, covering the first five months of this year, show that Nissan's output of Primeras and the small Micra was up 43 per cent to 115,244, compared with a year ago. Toyota produced 9,727 Carina E saloons and hatchbacks after starting production at Burnaston, in Derbyshire, at the turn of the year. Honda, which started production at its Swindon plant at about the same time, produced 10,886 of its Accord model in the same period. That contrasts with a 3 per cent production drop at Rover, 5.2 per cent at Vauxhall, 12.3 per cent at Ford and a production drop of nearly 16 per cent at Peugeot Talbot. By July, the actual cutbacks were starting. Most significantly, Peugeot decided to end its UK production of the 405 family saloon, its market mainstay. Having become a two-model plant only last January - when the new 306 hatchback entered production - Ryton is now building only the 306. Output has been reduced to 1,600 cars a week from 1,900 and 300 jobs are being cut. Vauxhall has begun to cut shifts both at its Astra plant at Ellesmere Port and at Luton, where it produces the Cavalier/Opel Vectra. Ford has taken similar action at Halewood. Despite its own output also falling back slightly, Rover Group was continuing to maintain in early August that it had no plans for cutbacks at either its Longbridge plant near Birmingham or the Cowley facilities near Oxford, where it has recently invested Pounds 200m on modernisation. On the contrary: Rover, which is now the only European manufacturer to be increasing both volume sales and market share in Europe, maintains that it is exploring ways of increasing output of its Metro and Mini small cars at Longbridge. In the first seven months of this year its total sales in Europe, including the UK, rose by 10.5 per cent to 191,000 and its market share from 2 per cent to 2.7 per cent. That output has not matched the increase reflects mainly the British Aerospace subsidiary's 'lean distribution' efforts - to cut stocks in the supply line between factories and dealers' showrooms. Although Nissan has changed the balance of its production, reducing the Primera output and increasing the Micra's, it says the downturn in continental Europe should not stop it reaching its target output, from Sunderland, of 270,000 cars this year. Similarly, Toyota and Honda maintain that they are on course to achieve their respective output targets of 36,000 and 32,000 for this year. Toyota, however, is already speeding up its previously declared, longer-term production targets. It intends to produce 100,000 cars next year - a year ahead of the original schedule - on the way to to 200,000-a-year production in the late 1990s. DRI/McGraw-Hill, the forecasting group, regards this as conservative. It predicts that by 1998 Japanese 'transplant' production in the UK will have reached 800,000 units a year, and that well before then Toyota will have added the smaller Corolla to Carina E production at Burnaston. Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, Toyota's president, has already indicated that Toyota is 'considering' a second model for the plant. DRI projects that, overall, UK car output will reach a record 2.1m by 1998 and that the UK motor industry will once again be recording a substantial balance of trade surplus after recording deficits of as much as Pounds 6bn in some recent years. Competition within the UK market, however, is expected to remain intense and keep profit margins under pressure. The long-sustained market leadership by Ford of Britain, which made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 353m last year, is being challenged as never before by General Motors' Vauxhall subsidiary. Vauxhall actually beat Ford in the UK sales charts for the first time in July, although total sales in the month are very small and regarded as unrepresentative because they precede the August sales 'bulge' caused by the introduction of the new registration plate prefix. Rover, buoyed up by the new 600 saloon range and its surging Range Rover, Discovery and Land Rover output, is also reversing its long trend of market share decline. In the first seven months of this year it accounted for 13.7 per cent of UK new car sales, up from 12.9 per cent in the year-ago period and fewer than four percentage points behind Vauxhall's 17.3. Ford, which once regularly commanded 30 per cent of all new UK car sales, now has a share of only around 22 per cent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               UK CAR REGISTRATIONS -

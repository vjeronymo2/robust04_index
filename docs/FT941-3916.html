			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Finland joins with Russia in gas venture Gazprom, the Russian monopoly gas company, is to take a 25 per cent stake in a new joint venture with Neste, the Finnish state energy group, in a deal that will lead to a substantial increase in Russian gas exports to Finland. Neste will place its natural gas division into the joint venture, which is due to begin in May. In 1992 the division, which is the sole supplier of gas in Finland, accounted for 3 per cent of Neste's total net sales and 2 per cent of its investment. The new company would have net sales of around FM1.5bn (Pounds 170m). Total capital in the venture will be FM2.5bn, of which 40 per cent will be equity. Gazprom's stake of the equity capital would be around FM250m, according to Mr Jaakko Ihamuotila, Neste's chief executive officer. 'The intention is to seek a stock exchange listing for the company,' he said. That could happen as early as May next year. The deal with Gazprom includes a new 20-year gas supply contract, under which Finnish imports of Russian gas could rise to more than 4bn cubic metres a year from the present level of 2.9bn cubic metres. Neste said it had encouraged Gazprom to enter the joint venture because the holding will strengthen Gazprom's interest in developing the Finnish gas market. It will also encourage Gazprom to increase its transmission capacity to Finland, say Neste officials. Natural gas accounts for about 8 per cent of total Finnish energy demand, with the main users being power stations and large industrial customers. Demand is expected to grow strongly in coming years, although there has been uncertainty over the source of future supplies. Russia has supplied gas to Finland since 1974, and although there has been no disruption in shipments in recent years, Finns have looked at ways to lessen their dependence. Neste has been investigating the feasibility of a pipeline linking Norway's offshore gas fields to Sweden and Finland, a project whose future may now be in some doubt. Gazprom, the world's largest gas producer, has a number of partnerships and joint ventures in Austria, Germany, France and Italy.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PEACEMAKERS' ARE AIDING HUSSEIN;  </P> <P> CITIZEN DIPLOMACY: SELF- CREDENTIALED EMISSARIES TREK TO BAGHDAD, WHERE THEY  ARE EAGERLY SEIZED ON BY IRAQI PROPAGANDISTS.  </P> <P> The presence of former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali in Iraq may seem an  insignificant event except for the fact that he was just the latest in a train  of self-credentialed mediators bucking for Nobel Peace prizes who have flown  off to Damascus to peddle their good offices.  </P> <P> These pilgrimages pose serious problems for President Bush and great  opportunities for Saddam Hussein, for the longer the gulf crisis continues  without resolution, the more the would-be middlemen will come to represent to  the Iraqi dictator the soft underbelly of American public opinion.  </P> <P> The inaugural visit was made by Jesse Jackson, who hoped, perhaps, to pull off  another spectacular prisoner release like the one he engineered with the  Syrians, after they shot down a U.S. Navy pilot during the American military  involvement in Lebanon. Jackson was followed in Baghdad by an assortment of  free-lance plenipotentiaries that included rock singer Cat Stevens, a convert  to Islam who had enthusiastically echoed the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's call  for the slaughter of novelist Salman Rushdie. Former Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark  made the trip in his trademark corduroy jacket and seemed to suggest that  Saddam Hussein is really quite a reasonable guy who simply has a beef with the  United States. The implication is that the President of the United States is  truculent and bloody-minded and just spoiling for a fight.  </P> <P> The pattern for this loose-cannon diplomacy was established during the Iran  hostage crisis when a succession of Westerners went to Tehran to atone publicly  for all the indignities, real and fancied, that the United States had heaped on  Iran and to join the miserable captives for a round of Christmas carols.  </P> <P> Kurt Waldheim visited Iran in his capacity as secretary general of the United  Nations and was almost lynched by a mob. Clark fancied that he had some  credibility with the abductors because of a career spent in public penance for  having served as Lyndon Johnson's attorney general. He was followed by a throng  of dissident U.S. clerics who disgraced themselves by playing into the hands of  the captors.  </P> <P> It seems that all you need today to suit up as a mediator is the price of a  ticket to Baghdad and some flimsy, self-conferred title such as "peace  activist." These will virtually guarantee an audience with the dictator, who  will use your presence to proclaim to the world that Iraq has no quarrel with  the American people, just its imperialistic government and mad-dog President.  It's a cinch that the longer the standoff continues, the more likely we are to  see these aspiring Henry Kissingers jaunting off to Baghdad. And as Iraqi  propagandists seize eagerly on these events and crank out videotape that shows  Americans shaking hands with this thuggish dictator, the greater is the  likelihood that some simple souls in this country will demand that we see the  crisis from Hussein's point of view.  </P> <P> It may be time to dust off the Logan Act and encourage the Department of  Justice to prosecute these meddlers who are fostering in Saddam Hussein some  dangerous illusions about American opinion. The act, passed by Congress in 1798  in response to the private diplomacy of a Philadelphia doctor named George  Logan, was designed to forbid just the kind of amateur statecraft that seems to  be so fashionable in dissident circles today. Both the radicals of the French  Directoire in 1798 and the regime of Saddam Hussein hoped to manipulate  unofficial American emissaries to drive a wedge between the American people and  their government.  </P> <P> If Hussein wants to jerk our chain, let him at least not be assisted in the  maneuver by American hands. Diplomacy may be too important to be left solely to  diplomats, but it is surely too critical to be impeded by a bunch of dabblers  whose private agendas may be quite incompatible with the best interests of the  United States and whose activities may suggest falsely to Hussein that our  domestic debate over the proper course to take in the gulf crisis is a weakness  that he can exploit.  </P></p>

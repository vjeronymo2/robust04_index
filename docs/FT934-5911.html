			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Tees development team woos businesses The battle was launched this week for the hearts and minds of business people in Cleveland, one of the counties which faces abolition under the local government review. At the Belasis Business Centre in Billingham, the five borough councils which will gain unitary status if the Local Government Commission's final recommendations for Cleveland and Durham are accepted, launched plans for a Tees Valley Development Company, a partnership with the private sector to market the area, boost inward investment and attract European funding. More than 130 members of the business community attended the launch. The five boroughs, Darlington, Hartlepool, Langbaurgh on Tees, Middlesbrough and Stockton-on-Tees, said afterwards that the principle behind their plans had local businesses' support. But only two days earlier a delegation including the Confederation of British Industry, the Teesside Chamber of Commerce and the Teesside Small Business Club - bodies representing more than 2,000 local companies - saw Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, in London to press for a single Teesside-wide authority. The delegation argued that the commission's recommendation to split Cleveland, except Hartlepool, between three unitary boroughs - Stockton, Middlesbrough and Langbaurgh - would be costly and unnecessary. It would also, they said, lead to division and weaken the area's voice in dealing with government, Europe and potential inward investors. The strongest public champion of a new Teesside authority is Sir Ian Wrigglesworth, northern CBI chairman. 'I have never known an issue which has united the business community as strongly,' he says. The private sector would have half the 20 seats on the TVDC's board of directors. The other 10 would be councillors. The TVDC, which will aim to create up to 1,900 jobs in its first two years, would be run by a chief executive with nine staff and funded by a Pounds 2m annual budget from the five boroughs. The economic development and planning framework in which it operates would be set by a joint committee of councillors. It is far from certain the government will endorse the commission's recommendation after the consultation period expires next month. While the Cleveland proposals meet the government's wish for unitary authorities, the commission's Durham proposals retain the existing two-tier structure, except in Darlington. Mr Gummer may ask the commission to look again at Durham; and that might affect Cleveland.</p>

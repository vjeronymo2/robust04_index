			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Attention turns to Italian scene Most European bond markets ended a lethargic session little changed. Even in Italy, where political problems continued to simmer, prices were little changed in quiet dealings ahead of crucial confidence votes in parliament, expected this week. 'This could be the lull before the storm,' said one dealer. In a move to steal his opponents' thunder, Italian prime minister Mr Silvio Berlusconi signalled his intention to seek a parliamentary vote of confidence in his government expected as early as today. Although Mr Berlusconi's government already faces motions for three no-confidence votes, a cabinet spokesman said that under Italy's constitution a motion for a confidence vote takes precedence over a no-confidence vote. If Mr Berlusconi loses the vote and resigns, he would demand immediate elections, the spokesman said. Many observers said that if the government loses the vote - which is seen as increasingly likely - the president might set up an interim 'institutional government' to restore political calm. Ultimately, however, 'another general election is likely in the spring, irrespective of whether Berlusconi survives the vote or an institutional government is established,' said Mr Ken Wattret, international economist at HSBC Markets. The market shrugged off the final approval by the lower house of Italy's parliament to the 1995 budget, which now becomes law. The budget, consisting of three separate items of legislation, aims to reduce next year's deficit by L48,000bn to L138,600bn. The March BTP futures contract on Liffe ended at 98.99, down 0.01 point on the day. German government bonds ended a lacklustre session little changed in spite of lower-than-expected money supply data. Annualised M3 growth fell to 6 per cent - the top of the Bundesbank's target range - in November, from 6.8 per cent in October. The market also shrugged off the Bundesbank's announcement of a 10-year bund issue planned for December 28 and 29 - the government's traditional New Year bond. Some were disappointed that Bonn was not issuing a 30-year bond. 'The Finance Ministry said last year that they would issue at least one 30-year bond each year, but they haven't,' said a Frankfurt dealer, adding: 'The market needs fresh 30-year supply to keep the long end liquid.' The 10-year March bund future on Liffe closed at 89.65, down 0.05 point. UK gilts ended a slow day slightly weaker on thin volume. Prices softened slightly on strong M4 lending data for November, but dealers reported little trading activity. 'People are mainly tying up loose ends and closing their books,' said one trader. However, another dealer reported some demand for index-linked gilts, which rose by about  1/4 point. The March long gilt future on Liffe ended at 102 3/16 , down 1/8 point. US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday after the Federal Reserve's open market committee ended its last meeting of the year without taking any action. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 5/32 at 95 31/32 yielding 7.845 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up 1/16 at 99 7/16, yielding 7.545 per cent. As the FOMC meeting began, most analysts discounted the chances of another interest rate increase. Still, some economists had said they thought the Fed might boost rates as much as 50 basis points, and the market was skittish all morning as the committee met in private. Prices hardly moved after a spokesman for the Fed said the FOMC meeting had adjourned and there would be no statement. Since the last FOMC meeting, the yield spread between two-year and 30-year bonds narrowed as the market became convinced that the Fed's tightening would restrain the robust economy. Over the past week it widened slightly after mild inflation figures led investors to bet against a rate increase in December. Release of the October trade figures drew only muted reaction. The Commerce Department reported the trade deficit widened to Dollars 10.1bn from a revised September figure of Dollars 9.35bn. In spite of the increase in the trade deficit, the market held steady as the figure was well within the range of consensus estimates. Also, a steady dollar helped stabilise the bond market.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (29): No end in sight for high public borrowings - Conner Middelmann assesses demand for capital Next year will see a sweeping overhaul of German public-sector borrowers, with familiar names disappearing and new ones appearing in their place. However, although it will be redistributed, the financing burden will remain heavy and officials at the Finance Ministry and the Bundesbank, its issuing agent, will have to continue probing the frontiers of innovation to ensure Germany's debt finds a safe home. As a result of the privatisation of public-sector companies and the consolidation of several funds created to finance German unification, old capital market favourites such as the Treuhandanstalt, the post office and the railway authorities will no longer issue bonds as from 1995. Some of these bodies' debts will be assumed by the government, while others will service their debts independently under a new name. Nevertheless, public sector indebtedness is high and the country's financing and debt servicing burden remains heavy. While Germany's total public-sector deficit, including state and local governments, is expected to drop markedly from this year's level of around DM145bn as the Treuhand deficit falls away, the Federal government's deficit next year is likely to remain little changed at around DM68.7bn, compared with DM69.1bn this year. Finance Minister Theo Waigel is due to present an updated budget forecast for 1995 on December 14. Meanwhile, the cost of servicing Germany's debt is set to increase, and Mr Waigel has warned that as of 1995 every fifth D-Mark spent by the Federal government will go towards debt servicing. So far this year, the government has managed to scrape through its borrowing programme, aided by a strong cash position at the beginning of the year and a generous DM18.25bn contribution from the Bundesbank in April. Each year, the central bank transfers the bulk of its profits to the government, which uses the money to pay down existing debt. However, Bonn's funding was dogged by the sell-off which devastated global bond markets this year and caused yields worldwide to soar. Amid nervous market conditions, the Bundesbank's decision in May to cancel a debt auction at very short notice sent shudders through a market fearing that the government was unable to raise the funds it needed. In September, with 10-year yields close to their 7 3/4 per cent high, the government decided to issue a 10-year floating-rate bund pegged to the three-month Frankfurt interbank rate. The issue met with disapproval from the Bundesbank, which for years has opposed money-market instruments on the grounds that they interfere with its monetary policy-making and foster a short-termist mentality among market participants. This has turned the spotlight on an issue which has been the subject of heated debate for the last two years: will the German government eventually issue Treasury bills with maturities of less than one year? For the last two years, a provision to issue up to DM50bn of such bills (dubbed Bu-Bills) has been included in the Federal budget, but as yet none has yet seen the light of day. Following this year's approval of D-Mark money-market funds and amid prospects for rising short-term interest rates, investor demand for such instruments is likely to increase in 1995. However, while most sophisticated bond markets boast liquid yield curves ranging from one month to 30 years, Germany's maturity spectrum starts at one year and is most heavily weighted in the four- to 10-year sector, with a relatively illiquid 30-year sector. The very short end of the German yield curve has largely remained underdeveloped due to resistance from the Bundesbank. Indeed, in August it announced it would stop issuing short-term bills, known as Bulis, for fear that they would fuel the growth of money market funds. 'We did not want to provide investment opportunities for money-market funds by issuing Bulis, thereby reinforcing (the trend towards) short-termism,' Bundesbank vice president Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said recently. Moreover, 'we have asked the Federal and state governments not to issue short-dated debt instruments,' he said, explaining that increased short-termism in government financing would fuel economic short-termism generally. (Short-term financing) may create new business opportunities, but it does not contribute to the stability of the financial system,' he said, warning of the increased interest-rate volatility and economic destabilisation which could follow. The Bundesbank also appears to fear that if the government funds itself regularly at the short end of the yield curve, it will start exerting pressure on the central bank to keep short-term interest rates low. However, despite the Bundesbank's opposition, many analysts say it may eventually have to bow to pressure from the Finance Ministry and the markets to issue Bu-Bills. Although the central bank advises the government on its funding, it is the Finance Ministry which makes the final decision on how to raise the money. 'The steeper the yield curve gets, the more favourable it will be for the government to issue short-dated debt,' says Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, economist at UBS in Frankfurt. Indeed, locking in high debt servicing costs by issuing long-dated bonds would further increase the budget deficit. The 10-year benchmark bund currently yields around 7 1/2 per cent, compared with 5 1/8 per cent for three-month money. Some warn that, by issuing money market bills the government could incur a refinancing risk by having to roll over its bills every few months at possibly rising interest rates. However, over the long term, it is usually cheaper to raise short-term rather than long-term funds because yields curves tend to be upward sloping more often than being inverted, says Mr Rainer Back, head of fixed income research at Dresdner International Research Institute. 'The market would like the government to offer a balanced mix of debt, ranging from three months to 30 years,' he says. Moreover, 'it is in the interest of Frankfurt as a financial centre that we should be able to offer short-term bills to international investors,' says Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at BHF Bank. Moreover, he says that 'if the amount of Bu-Bills in circulation were restricted to, say, DM20bn this could hardly be interpreted as veering towards short-termism.' Money market funds are another compelling reason for allowing money-market debt issuance. 'Now that they exist, you can't un-invent them,' says Ms Alison Cottrell, economist at Kidder Peabody in London. 'Given people want to invest in money market instruments, surely it's preferable to keep their savings in Germany and help them fund the deficit rather than pushing them into other countries which offer T-bills,' she says.</p>

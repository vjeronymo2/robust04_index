The strike was called by the United Workers Front  [FUT] as a protest against the rise in fuel prices. Government  Minister Marcelo Santos and FUT President Edgar Ponce expressed  different viewpoints about the strike this morning and disagreed  about the extent of its observation by workers. While the  former said the country's workers woke up to go to work, the  latter said the strike was a success and that the people  rejected the rise in fuel prices.    Gasoline station workers joined the strike by suspending the  sale of fuel, while (?power company) workers who had also joined  the strike decided to provide service.    Marcelo Ramon, president of the Federation of Oil Industry  Workers [Federacion de Trabajadores Petroleros], said that since  they are nice people who love the country, they did not stop  working in the refineries and oil fields.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / More Israelis take hard line over Hebron: A growing mood for vengeance is abroad Across Israel, Jewish families sat down at home at the start of this week's seven-day Passover festival for the Seder, the annual retelling of the Israelite exodus from slavery in Egypt and the arduous journey to the Promised Land. Towards the end of the Seder service, after the Passover meal has been eaten, the front door of the home is traditionally opened and a paragraph of prayer read aloud that has always seemed problematic to some liberal Jews. 'Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen who have not known thee,' it exhorts Jehovah. 'Pursue them and destroy them in anger, from under the heavens of the Lord.' This year, barely a month since Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein poured out his wrath in a stream of gunfire at rows of kneeling Palestinian worshippers inside Hebron's Tomb of the Patriarchs, that Passover prayer seemed particularly inappropriate. Indeed, a group of liberal Israeli rabbis issued a statement urging Israelis to excise it from the Seder ceremony. Ms Shulamit Aloni, the left-wing communications minister who has little love for Jewish religious traditions, concurred. The desire for vengeance against Palestinians who know not the Jewish God, she reasoned, was apparently all too widely endorsed already among sections of the Israeli public. An opinion poll earlier this month showed that one in 10 Israelis refuse to condemn the Hebron massacre, arguing that it should be 'understood against the background of Arab terror against Jews,' and 3.6 per cent actually praise Goldstein's actions. In the first hours after the February 25 killings, Israeli leaders across the political spectrum fell over themselves to issue condemnations, to assert that what Goldstein had done was inhumane, 'unJewish'. But in the days and weeks since, other voices have been heard, first defending Goldstein, then praising him. The first to speak up were his colleagues in the Kach movement, disciples of the ideology developed by the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, which elevates the killing of Arabs to the status of a divine mission. Next, Rabbi Dov Lior, spiritual leader of Goldstein's home settlement Kiryat Arba, eulogised him at his funeral as a Jewish hero. Rabbi Yisrael Ariel, head of a Jerusalem religious institute, declared he followed in the glorious tradition of that legendarily powerful biblical figure Samson. But then the voices spread out of the ideological hothouses and towards the mainstream. Condemning the massacre at a gathering of Jerusalem schoolteachers, Mr Micha Goldman, deputy education minister, found himself heckled by educators who endorsed Goldstein's assertion of Jewish pride. Participants in a TV debate intended to explore the evils of Goldstein's actions were struck dumb when a teenager in the audience took the microphone to declare he and others in his school had stood to attention and marked a minute's silence in honour of Goldstein's suicidal heroism. On a different level, Israel's two chief rabbis last week appealed to the government to release temporarily the handful of leading Kach activists placed in administrative detention in the wake of the massacre. It was Passover, the rabbis pleaded. These men should be at home with their families. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin rejected that request, remarking that if the massacre had been shocking, the growing evidence of support for the murder of Arabs was more so.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Palestinian aid programme 'lagging': Concern grows over impact of economic stagnation on peace process The World Bank said publicly for the first time yesterday that the international aid programme to Palestinians was more than six months behind schedule, amid growing concerns about the potentially explosive impact of economic stagnation on the peace process. Mr Caio Koch-Weser, Middle East and North Africa vice-president, said that by the end of the year donors will have disbursed only about Dollars 220m (Pounds 137m) to the Palestinians out of a total Dollars 700m committed for the year. The Palestine Liberation Organisation has complained about the bottlenecks and bureaucracy in the donor aid mechanism and warned that failure urgently to raise living conditions in Gaza is eroding Palestinian support for peace with Israel and fuelling an Islamic opposition. Mr Koch-Weser conceded that, with hindsight, donors could have found faster ways of disbursing money. But he said: 'Success is not about disbursing money fast but doing so in a way to have a visible and rapid improvement in the economic and social conditions ..so that mother and child in the refugee camps can see the change on the ground'. Donors had over-estimated the Palestinian ability to build economic management institutions and clearly define and streamline decision-making processes. It had been difficult to get adequate donor co-ordination and avoid overburdening the embryonic Palestinian institutions with second-priority projects. Delays in aid disbursement reflected delays in political talks between Israel and the PLO, also more than six months behind schedule. Donors had assumed the still Israeli-occupied West Bank would have been transferred to the Palestinians by last July, a move now unlikely before early next year. The transfer of the West Bank is vital to Palestinian economic viability and public finances owing to its considerable revenue potential. The revenue base of the impoverished 900,000 residents of Gaza-Jericho is insufficient to sustain creation of a central Palestinian authority and bureaucracy and pay running costs, and the salaries for 10,800 policemen and 12,000 civil servants. The PLO estimates it can collect a maximum Dollars 5m a month locally and a further Dollars 6m Customs duties and income taxes levied by Israel but transferred to the Palestinians through a clearance mechanism. Control over the West Bank would add at least a further Dollars 20m a month in clearance from Israel, and considerably reduce the need for donor financing of recurrent costs of the Palestinian authority. But Mr Koch-Weser said donors were determined not to let political delays continue to obstruct the aid effort. 'In future one must make sure the ups and downs of the peace negotiations don't have a major impact on the momentum of the economic reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts.' There has been vociferous condemnation of Israel's unilateral closure of its borders with Gaza and the West Bank two weeks ago which put 65,000 Palestinian migrant labourers out of work. Donors say the closure, and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's description of Gaza as a terrorist territory have sent worrying signals to the aid community and potential investors. Donors said in Casablanca there was an urgent need to revise the aid programme and focus efforts on high-impact job creating schemes such as public works to tackle huge unemployment and poverty. They have also blamed the PLO for the difficulties in disbursing aid. While most are now satisfied with transparency and accountability, they said PLO Chairman Yassir Arafat is still refusing sufficiently to delegate economic power and has allegedly encouraged infighting between four senior PLO officials with overlapping responsibility for economic policy.</p>

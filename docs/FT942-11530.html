			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Tate &amp; Lyle Poor old Tate &amp; Lyle cannot strike the right chord with the market. Ahead of last year's finals it upset investors with a profits warning. Yesterday's 22 per cent increase in interim profits might have been compensation but it was greeted with a 2 per cent fall in the shares. These were undoubtedly good results, particularly on the cereal sweeteners and starches side where North American margins jumped to 12.2 per cent from 10.1. The trouble is that this kind of movement is a reminder that Tate is in a cyclical commodity business. It may regard itself as a processor, but its profits are volatile, which is why the market tends to focus on the dividend. The main disappointment yesterday was that this grew by only 8 per cent, well below the progression in earnings. A degree of caution is understandable. Tate does not want a repeat of last year's second half when expectations raced ahead of themselves. Some catch-up may occur at the final stage but yesterday's dividend news could signal that management itself regards the interim profit increase as somewhat above trend. It also gives the lie to those who argue that the company will use every opportunity to raise its dividend to hasten conversion of its Pounds 188m preference issue. Even counting the issue as equity, gearing is 84 per cent. Yet interest cover is over seven times and the company is not short of cash for expansion as its Orsan monosodium glutamate purchase shows. It need not hurry to force conversion when the preference capital will subsequently become progressively more expensive to service.</p>

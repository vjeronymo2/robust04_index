			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Bargaining deal for Revenue staff: Non-union US computer group to sign recognition agreement The Inland Revenue Staff Federation will tomorrow sign a formal union recognition agreement with Electronic Data Services, the US computer services company which has never dealt with unions in its home country. The deal preserves the union's right to collective bargaining for the 1,900 staff of the Revenue's information technology office who are being switched to EDS in Europe's largest information technology contract from public to private sector extending over 10 years and worth more than Pounds 1bn. After six months of negotiations IRSF members are to be offered a choice between two employment contracts - an 'image contract' to replicate civil service terms and conditions as closely as practicable, and the standard EDS company contract. Transferring staff will be able to switch to the standard contract if they wish, and the two contracts will run in parallel for the foreseeable future. New staff will be hired on the standard contract. The standard package offers perks such as free medical and dental care and company cars for certain grades. The image contract is the only one covered by collective bargaining arrangements. Mr Clough said that the most difficult hurdles in negotiating the image contract were in making pension arrangements equal to those available in the civil service, and in providing a formal appeals procedure. The company, which has a number of pension schemes in place, has had to construct a new one to reflect the civil service terms. Mr Roger McNulty, the division's human resources director, said, however: 'If people decided to transfer out of the union scheme into the standard scheme we wouldn't want them transferring back again.' Tupe - the transfer of undertakings protection of employment - legislation, which protects the terms and conditions of public-sector employees whose contracts are transferred to the private sector, meant that EDS had to make a commitment to work with the union, which currently represents the majority of the 1,900 staff affected. Mr Peter Clough, managing director of EDS's Inland Revenue division, said: 'We came at it from the point of view that we needed to recognise the unions.' Mr Clive Brooke, general secretary of the IRSF, said: 'We believe that a particular strength we can bring is the job security we are offering staff. I think this is where unions will have an increasing role to play.' Mr Clough said: 'Here is an opportunity where we can demonstrate how unions can add value to an organisation.' The next stage of what Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, has described as a 'strategic partnership' between EDS and the Inland Revenue will be developing a working relationship between a public body and a corporate operation. EDS is hoping that its methods will rub off on the Revenue. The company says it has an open-ended view of how long the side-by-side contract arrangements will last.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michel Noblecourt: "The Appearance of Consensus"] </F>   [Text] At first glance, we are once again surrounded by  consensus regarding the fight against unemployment. Both the  right- and the left-wing politicians agree in emphasizing that  unemployment is not a matter of fate, and certainly not merely a  result of economic policy, since action against unemployment can  even be a priority. On both the Right and the Left, there is  talk of a "social pact" or a "new social contract." Francois  Mitterrand set the tone during his New Year's message at the  beginning of the year by pleading, albeit in vain, for a social  contract for employment to mobilize all parties, i.e, the state,  employers, and trade unions, around the "most serious question  facing us at the end of this century." With less than a year to  go until the presidential election, there is nothing amazing  about such convergent approaches, because it is most likely that  the election will revolve around this issue. However, if we  take a closer look, the consensus is only apparent.    During the Conference on Social Transformation held in  Rennes, Michel Rocard rejected any kind of timid or overly  cautious action against unemployment. "The problem," he said,  "is to stop the endless discussions and take strong and more  powerful action than we have done so far." Above all, the first  secretary of the PS [Socialist Party] wants to mobilize social  forces in the field, reactivate political will, and revive the  idea of reducing the workweek to four days. He did not,  however, take the plunge by advocating an economic policy that  is genuinely different from the one followed from 1988 to 1993,  which was based on the defense of the strong franc and on  maintaining the overall balance of forces within society.    Only Lionel Jospin called for a "major change in our  country's economic policy, which would give priority to the  fight against unemployment and in favor of employment." One  year after the death of Pierre Beregovoy, everything still leads  us to believe that the Socialists, if they were to return to  power, would be less orthodox in their economic policy and, in  particular, less hesitant about the suitability of letting  public deficits rise as long as they make it possible to revive  economic activity and take action to promote employment.    During the Convention on Labor organized by the RPR [Rally  for the Republic], Jacques Chirac went further, supporting  Edouard Balladur's economic and social policy, while at the same  time letting it be understood between the lines -- but less  harshly than Philippe Seguin -- that this policy was proving to  be insufficient and that we must turn toward another policy. He  emphasized that unemployment is not "one priority among others,"  but that it is "more important than anything else."  Paradoxically, Labor Minister Michel Giraud agreed with Mr.  Chirac "without reservation," thus pretending to be unaware that  his statements included an implicit disavowal of his five-year  law on employment, which he is having so much trouble  implementing. At the same time, Edouard Balladur reiterated his  desire to "build another society which would differ from the  easy-growth or crisis society." For all this, the prime  minister does not intend to change his economic policy, even if  he knows that slowing down the growth of unemployment, or even  some sort of haphazard stabilization, will not be enough to  convince the French that his action against unemployment has  succeeded.  <H5>  Shifting Into High Gear </H5>   In order to combat the exclusion which, according to Jacques  Chirac, "desocializes and alienates people," the politicians are  all more or less aware that we must shift into high gear, but  they still have some differences of opinion about how this  should be done. There is agreement on the need to reduce labor  costs, but each person favors his own method for doing so, since  the debate on a minimum wage for young people and youth job  training contracts has revealed a genuine gap between the Right  and the Left. They are all talking about local community  services, about making better use of the 500 billion francs  currently used for unemployment benefits, and about flexibility  and the new organization of work, but the same words do not  always mean the same thing. Already, the debate on the 32-hour  workweek, revived by the Right during the debate on the  five-year employment bill, revealed the persistence of  conflicting approaches with regard to reducing working hours,  depending on whether or not it is accompanied by wage cuts.    So, should the priority given to actions to counter  unemployment be formally reaffirmed in a referendum, which would  require an amendment to the Constitution's Article 11 to extend  its scope to include social problems? That is [Assembly  Speaker] Philippe Seguin's iconoclastic proposal. On Monday, 2  May he received the support of Jacques Chirac. However, if it  proves "necessary" and even essential for politicians to renew  their debate on the best ways to fight unemployment by placing  it at the center of their policies, then it is hard to see what  a referendum on "zero social exclusion" would contribute to the  debate.    Such a proposal seems just as contestable and demagogic as  the one made by Bernard Tapie, who wanted to make unemployment  illegal on the grounds that the right to work is enshrined in  the Constitution. It is not necessary to hold a referendum to  raise awareness. To become aware of the urgent need for a new  approach, one need only observe the implosion of a society  undermined by unemployment and exclusion, which is already  operating at different speeds. And there is more than a risk of  this happening, unlike what Mr. Chirac would have us believe.</p>

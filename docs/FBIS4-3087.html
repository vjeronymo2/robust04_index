Bidders must meet the qualifications stipulated in  Article 5.    B. Bidders will win when their bid prices are higher than  the average bidding price of all the bidding enterprises.    Total bidding quota price X bidding  quantity    Average bidding price =  --------------------------------------------    Total bidding quantities of all  bidders    C.

The  maximum bidding quantity of a foreign-funded enterprise will not  exceed the export scale ratified by MOFTEC.    If the bidding production enterprises and foreign-funded  enterprises are found to export products other than their own  manufactured products their bidding and transfer qualifications  will be cancelled for 3 years.    E. The Bids Inviting Office will destroy those bids whose  prices are out of line with the normal level of the "Bid  Applications."  5. Winning bids:    A. All bidders who have met every requirement for the awards  will be bid winners.    B. The allocation of winning quantities will be calculated  in accordance with the following formula:    C    A = B x - where:    D    A is the quantity awarded to each winning enterprise;    B is the total quatities of commodity quotas offered for  current    bidding;    C is the bidding price X bidding quantity of the  enterprises;  and    D is the total bidding prices X bidding quantities of  winning    enterprises.    When the winning quantity calculated according to the above  formula is bigger than the actual bidding quantity of a bidder,  the actual bidding quantity of that enterprise will be the  quantity won by that enterprise. The remainder of the total  bidding quantity under this formula will be allocated to those  whose total bidding quantities have not been met in the order of  the highest prices offered in their bidding.    C. The actual cost paid by the winners will be calculated in  accordance with the following formula:    Total Cost = quantity awarded X bidding price.  6. The opening of bids:    A. The Bids Committee will, within 10 working days after the  deadline, complete the work of awarding and submit the results  of the awards to MOFTEC for the record.    B.

Within 15 days of the date on which the Bids Committee  publishes the namelist of winners, the winners will pay a 10  percent advance of the winning quota costs to the bank account  designated by the Bids Inviting Office as guaranty money for  using the quotas. Upon receipt of the payment, the Bids Inviting  Office will send certificates of successful bidding to the  winners and issue receipts for the payment. When winners fail  to make payment within the specified time, the Bids Inviting  Office will regard the bids as null and void and cancel that  enterprise's quota bidding and transfer qualifications for one  year.    B. Before applying for an export license, winners will clear  the payment of quota expenses for the licensed quantity with the  Bids Inviting Office (i.e. quantity licensed X bid price X 90  percent). With the "Quota Certificates for Textile Quota Bids  Commodity Export Licenses (in lieu of receipts for quota  application payments), the winners will obtain export licenses  from the issuing organization, which will keep one copy for the  record.    C. The guaranty money paid in advance will be cleared when a  final license has been issued.    Article 10. Export licenses.    Basis for issuing export licenses:    1.

When a winning enterprise is unable to use all the  quantity it has been allocated for certain reasons, it will  submit a written application five months before the end of the  validity period of the quota to the Bids Inviting Office,  stating its reasons and the transferable quota quantity.  Transfer of quota is allowed upon approval by the Bids Inviting  Office but quota transfer fees will be paid as transfer handling  fees (i.e., transferable quota quantity X bid price X 5 percent).    2.

Upon the approval of transfer by the Bids Committee, the  Bids Inviting Office will be responsible for completing  procedures of transfer and will issue quota transfer  certificates to both transferors and transferees.  Article 12. Handing over quotas.    When winners are unable either to execute export contracts  or  transfer quotas for certain reasons, they may hand their quotas  over to the Bids Inviting Office which will repay a portion of  the guaranty money depending on the time of handing over the  quotas. For quotas turned over five months or more in advance of  the final quota validity date, 50 percent of the guaranty money  for the quotas handed over will be repaid; 40 percent will be  refunded for quotas handed over four months in advance; 30  percent refunded for quotas handed over three months in advance;  20 percent refunded for two months in advance; and no refund  will be made for quotas handed over less than two months in  advance of the validity date.

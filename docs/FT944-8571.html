			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / French property chief quits Mr Michel Mauer, the French property developer under investigation for alleged corruption, resigned yesterday as chairman of Cogedim. The company said Mr Mauer, who is being investigated for alleged influence peddling in a case involving illicit political financing, was stepping down for health reasons. In an interview yesterday, Mr Mauer said the strains of the investigation and his incarceration for 24 days had taken a toll. 'Physically and morally the ordeal tired me enormously,' he told Le Figaro. Mr Mauer is one of several senior business executives under investigation for alleged corruption and is the first to resign from his post. Cogedim, a subsidiary of Paribas, the banking group, said that Mr Mauer was also resigning his seat on the board. The case involving Mr Mauer concerns alleged illicit funding of the Republican party, one of the largest components of the centre-right government coalition.</p>

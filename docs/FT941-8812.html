			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Bosnian Serbs begin pull-back from Sarajevo: Russians secure agreement from Karadzic that ceasefire will be observed Bosnian Serbs began a large-scale withdrawal of their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo yesterday, after dramatic intervention by Russia to avert Nato air strikes against the Serbs. Moscow secured a pull-back agreement with an assurance that it would send in 800 Russian troops to join the United Nations peacekeeping force in and around the Bosnian capital. Most western countries, meanwhile, refused to send additional troops to bolster the UN operation. 'We do think that war in Sarajevo is finally over,' Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said after meeting Russian envoy Mr Vitaly Churkin at Pale, northeast of Sarajevo. A UN official said a 'very significant' withdrawal of Bosnian Serb forces was taking place. 'We are talking about convoys of equipment moving off the hills.' In Brussels, Nato said it stood by its ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw heavy weapons more than 20km from the centre of Sarajevo or put them under UN control under pain of air strikes. Pressure would not be lifted until Nato was sure the Serbs had complied. In Washington, the White House welcomed the Serb promise to Moscow but expressed surprise that the Russians were sending UN peacekeepers to Sarajevo. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, welcomed the Russian initiative, adding: 'There is now a much better chance than before of avoiding air strikes.' Russia's decision to send more troops to Sarajevo arose directly from discussions between Mr John Major, the prime minister, and President Yeltsin in Moscow, Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence procurement, told the Commons last night. Mr Churkin said 400 Russian troops under UN command in Croatia would be sent immediately to the Sarajevo area and 400 more would be sent from Russia. Mr Churkin went to Pale after two days of talks with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to try to defuse the Bosnian crisis. The Russian leadership is anxious not to be sidelined as Nato and Washington assume a stronger role in Bosnia. It also has to take account of nationalist feeling at home sympathetic to the Serbs. In an interview on Russian television, Mr Churkin said: 'We can say that any air strikes on any Bosnian Serb positions are ruled out for the simple reason there will be no targets for these strikes to hit.' Mr Karadzic said: 'We are very grateful to Russia for its involvement in the resolution of the crisis.' The Bosnian Serbs had accepted the Russian 'request' that they withdraw heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo and observe a ceasefire. Defence ministers from several Nato countries will meet in Italy on Sunday, just hours before the expiry of the Nato deadline. If withdrawal and collection of heavy weapons is not completed by that time, UN commanders on the ground can ask Nato to carry out air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions. In London, after a tense cabinet meeting at which several senior government members warned against deeper British involvement in former Yugoslavia, Mr Major announced that two companies of soldiers - about 300 in all - would be redeployed from central Bosnia to Sarajevo. Britain is also to send 60 troops with radar equipment to locate heavy weaponry sited around the Bosnian capital, as well as up to 100 further personnel. In an implicit sideswipe against the US, which has no ground troops based in former Yugoslavia, British ministers suggested that western nations which have yet to contribute to the UN forces in Bosnia should meet the call from General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander, for an extra 3,000 troops.

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Clinton's confidence boosted by final polls GOVERNOR Bill Clinton took the high road and President George Bush the lower one on the last frenetic day of campaigning before today's US presidential election. The mood of the Arkansas governor reflected the growing perception that he stands on the brink of becoming the first Democrat to win the White House in 16 years. In early stops on a final, nine-state, 4,000-mile cross-country marathon starting in Pennsylvania and ending in Colorado, Mr Clinton's message, delivered with what remains of his voice, was that people should vote and do so aggressively. 'Tomorrow, the great mystery of democracy will be played out . . . when your vote counts just as much as mine or Mr Bush's or anybody else's and when you have a chance to take your country back and reclaim your future,' he said. The contrast with Mr Bush, whose own odyssey covered five states from Pennsylvania to his native Texas, could not have been greater. Sounding increasingly desperate, Mr Bush continued to insult Mr Clinton at every opportunity. He was 'the slippery one', 'a bozo' totally devoid of foreign policy experience, a man who would bring 'economic disaster' to the country. 'Watch your wallets,' he told a crowd in New Jersey. 'When Bill Clinton is playing that tax-ophone, middle class Americans will be singing the blues.' His campaign has been frantically trying to peddle to the media all sorts of damaging information against his principal opponent. Among them are unsubstantiated 'stories' that further attempts were made to tamper with Mr Clinton's draft records in the 1970s and that films exist of Mr Clinton burning an American flag during a London demonstration against the Vietnam war in 1969. Mr Bush insisted all was not lost. 'Put that victory parade on hold, Governor Clinton, because I'm gonna win this election tomorrow,' was his refrain. Mr Robert Teeter, his official campaign chairman, said on television yesterday that 25-35 states were still 'very competitive'. But the mood of his travelling staff was said to be one of resignation to the inevitable. Mr Bush himself no longer looks at the latest polling data. The final polls yesterday gave Mr Clinton national leads of 7-12 points. The final CNN/USA Today poll of likely voters, which had pointed to a narrowing race last week, distributed the undecided element and came up with the figure of 49 per cent for Mr Clinton, 37 per cent for Mr Bush and 14 per cent for Mr Ross Perot, the Texas independent. An ABC News poll of 9,115 likely voters gave Mr Clinton 44 per cent, against 37 per cent for Mr Bush and 16 per cent for Mr Perot. The only polling consolation for the president was a survey in Ohio which found he had overtaken Mr Clinton for the first time. All other assessments of the national electoral map assign to Mr Clinton almost enough or more than enough of the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory. The one wild card remains Mr Perot, who is still in double figures in all the polls and who has taken to attacking Mr Clinton almost as strenuously as he does Mr Bush. Some pundits think Mr Perot has an outside chance of carrying states such as Alaska and Maine, both with independent traditions.

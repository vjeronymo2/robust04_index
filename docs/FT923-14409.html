			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: British Aerospace At yesterday's intra-day low of 208p, British Aerospace was down 45 per cent in just six weeks. That seems overdone. Even after second thoughts pushed the shares back up to 231p yesterday afternoon, the price scarcely reflects the fundamentals. BAe has long been vulnerable to negative speculation: witness last year's exaggerated alarm about its cash position. Now it is under attack on three fronts: worries about the European Fighter Aircraft; concern about its loss-making regional jet business; and dividend uncertainty. EFA has the highest profile but is arguably the least of these concerns. Even if the project were scrapped BAe's profits would be unaffected until 1996 or 1997. By contrast, the regional jet business is a running sore receiving urgent attention from Mr John Cahill, BAe's new chairman. Closure would be an expensive option with costs runovision for uncovered lease commitments valued in the accounts at Pounds 348m. That would push the company into a hefty loss this year. The chances of a full disposal are remote, but Mr Cahill may yet clinch a joint venture. That would be less painful than closure, but the immediate cash impact of a shut-down would be less serious than it looks, since the leases could be unwound over a long period. A separate sale of the corporate jet business could yield over Pounds 200m. The prospect of a further loss in 1992 raises questions about the dividend, but it is premature to regard the payout as doomed. Unlike BP's, BAe's dividend costs a mere Pounds 105m. Halving it would shave only 2 percentage points off gearing. And unlike British Steel, it can claim scope for vigorous earnings recovery once the regional jet problem is out of the way.</p>

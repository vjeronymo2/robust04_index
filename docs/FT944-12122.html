			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Belgium to relax pension fund rules The Belgian government is preparing to relax investment rules for pension schemes, dropping the requirement that at least 15 per cent of assets be invested in government bonds. The proposals are part of a wider set of reforms of Belgian pension law which will also address issues such as the way liabilities are calculated. The move comes just as other European governments debate just how much freedom ought to be allowed to pension fund managers responsible for investing assets. A proposed EU directive intended to bar member states from unduly restricting investments in equities or in non-domestic securities was withdrawn because agreement could not be reached. Belgium, which has roughly BFr250bn (Pounds 4.9bn) in occupational scheme assets, already has few restrictions on how assets can be invested. The Belgian Association of Pension Funds expects the 15 per cent rule to be scrapped in the next few months, with legislation drawn up soon. It has campaigned for the move. 'On pensions we are closer to the UK position, than the French or the Italian,' said a representative. Mr Paul de Smet, partner at consulting actuaries Conac, said that as a practical matter, the new rule will have little immediate effect on bond holdings. According to the association, 34.8 per cent of a typical Belgian fund was invested in Belgian government bonds at the end of last year. The next biggest component was foreign equities (21.7 per cent), followed by Belgian equities (16.5 per cent). Foreign bonds accounted for only 12.6 per cent of investments, while cash accounted for 7.6 per cent of the average portfolio. But the shares change according to the company. Funds of the big multinationals based in Belgium - for example IBM and Unilever - diversify more, with a tendency to invest more in foreign equities. However, while providing some liberalisation on investments, the proposed legislation will make it much harder for employers to borrow the surplus assets of their pension scheme themselves. The rules which set investment restrictions cover only the assets which are specifically needed to calculate liabilities, Mr de Smet said. There are no restrictions on how the surplus assets are invested and some companies have lent the funds back to themselves.</p>

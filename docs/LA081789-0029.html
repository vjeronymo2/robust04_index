			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PERMIT PROCESS STREAMLINED  </P> <P> The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council has introduced an amendment to its  landslide moratorium ordinance that would streamline the building permit  process for 37 homeowners on the west end of the Sea View housing tract.  </P> <P> The amendment, if adopted in two weeks as expected, will become effective Sept.  29. It affects homeowners in an area just to the east of the Portuguese Bend  slide area.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the measure, owners of the 37 lots no longer need to apply  to the City Council for a "moratorium exemption" before beginning the permit  process to make structural improvements to their homes. The permit process  still will require adequate drainage and geological reports before building can  begin in the geologically sensitive area.  </P> <P> A building moratorium was imposed several years ago in the area of several  slow-moving landslides on the city's south side. The slides destroyed numerous  homes and damaged roadways. In the past two years the city has graded and  removed tons of dirt from the slide area to virtually stop the slides.  </P> <P> City geologists stated in a staff report that the earth is sufficiently stable  in the Sea View area to permit home improvements like room additions and  swimming pools, provided care is taken to provide adequate drainage. Swimming  pools must be equipped with a special leak detection system to warn of excess  water filtering into the subsurface. Geologists have said that the slides may  have been activated by excess water from runoff and poor drainage.  </P></p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / The sentimental way to pick a Rose: Lucy Kellaway visits Tralee and watches a 23-year-old capture one of the most bizarre prizes on offer to women in the 1990s She is a 23-year-old with ginger hair, a job in tourism and a liking for padded party frocks in blue satin. She was head girl at her school in Limerick, is a dutiful daughter and is looking for a husband strong enough to carry the harp that she plays for charity. This admirable young woman has just become the owner of a gilded crown studded with fake emeralds and diamonds and a large ornate glass trophy. Muirne Hurley is what every pure young Irish lass would love to be: the 1994 Rose of Tralee. This must be one of the most bizarre prizes on offer to women in the 1990s. The beauty contest, now in its 36th year, is open only to those of Irish extraction. The winner is supposedly chosen not for her vital statistics, but for her ability to 'just be herself' - whatever that means. Nevertheless, there was not a single fatty, nor a set of buck teeth among the 1994 crop of 32 competing Roses. They had come to Ireland from all over the world - from the US to Dubai to New Zealand. Their parents may have escaped from Irish poverty, but their offspring are delighted to return, gushing over the charms of the mother country in the hope of winning the title. Most of them were more than bimbos: some had a university degree, others were tax consultants, investment advisers, vets, and journalists. Yet each was prepared to stand on the stage and simper, alongside Gay Byrne, a 60-year-old smoothie who is the best loved personality on Irish telly. Comfortable in their vulgar array of evening attire, they cheerfully replied to Byrne's questions about whether they had boyfriends, and what their daddies did for a living. Those who could, then did a little jig, sang a song or recited a poem. Even those who could not had a go: one gave an alarmingly flat rendering of The Streets of London. Another got into a sorry muddle over the passage she had selected from Under Milk Wood. But the audience loved it. More than half of the women in Ireland were glued to their TV sets watching the contest. The rest were presumably in the betting shop initially putting money on the Adelaide Rose, a petite dyed blonde with a big white smile. But when Muirne Hurley came on, and in particular when her wet-eyed father stood up in the audience for an impromptu serenade the hot money switched. He sang in rich baritone the moving words: 'Though lovely and fair as the rose of summer/ Yet 'twas not her beauty alone that won me/ Oh no, 'twas the truth in her eyes ever dawning/ That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee'. The people of Ireland know a winner when they see one, having watched this annual display of sentimentality for more than three decades. Within minutes the odds on the Limerick Rose had shortened from 12-1 to 3-1. There is an implicit code of conduct that Roses only break at their peril. The Boston Rose did herself no favours by boasting about the paper she had written on the politics of Northern Ireland. The Belgian Rose should never have admitted that if she saw a man she fancied she invited him out. When it comes to 'just being herself', it seems a Rose can go too far. More important still, Roses must not be seen to be competitive. They have to keep up the pretence that simply being in Tralee (a workaday town in Kerry) for a week of trips to distant hotels to shake the hand of ex-prime minister Charles Haughey is prize enough. They must not drink or smoke in public. They are expected to pick at their food: indeed when the Galway Rose put away a large heping of lemon pie and cream at one of the main banquets the story was reported in the Irish Times. Neither must they read the newspapers. It is feared that if the Roses read everything written about them - most papers carried several pages of fulsome copy and glamorous pictures every day of the festival - they might be left with no time to fulfil their busy schedules. Try as it might to recreate an age of sentimental innocence, Tralee could not quite keep the modern world at bay during the week. While the Roses batted their eyelids inside the festival dome on the streets of Tralee a booze-up was taking place on a scale remarkable even by Irish standards. Young lads poured into the town's camping sites and pitched their tents in preparation for a week of dedicated drinking. One got so over-excited as he watched the Limerick Rose being crowned that he took off all his clothes and mounted the statue in the town square. That poor chap is now facing a prison sentence for his moment of abandonment. Even more shaming, two of the nice Irish boys given the job of chaperoning the Roses during the week disgraced themselves. One got woefully drunk, and another was caught in bed with a young woman (mercifully not his Rose, whom he had safely escorted back to her hotel by midnight). Another regrettable incident was the photo opportunity for the first ever black Rose. With an almost touching lack of political correctness photographers had her pose with a pint of Guinness, with a view to a 'Black on Black' picture caption. All hell broke loose among the festival committee - a gang of five officious pale green jacketed locals, headed by a Bill Looney. They were offended not just at the association with alcohol, but also because the Roses must not be seen to advertise anything. But most sobering of all was when the Washington Rose was made to relate the tale of how her two cousins had been gang raped and murdered, and how her brother - who was trying to save them - was charged by an incompetent policeman with having killed them. This grotesque story made the cheerful chatter that followed even harder to swallow than before. Still, on the whole the week was deemed to be the greatest success - nearly Pounds 3m poured into the town that week, and if much of that was spent on booze it should not bother the chief sponsor of the event: Guinness.</p>

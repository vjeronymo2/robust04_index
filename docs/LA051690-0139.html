			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHRIST COLLEGE IRVINE OFFERS JOB TO MARSHALL  </P> <P> Christ College Irvine has offered its men's basketball coaching position to  Westmont College assistant Greg Marshall. Marshall will meet with college  officials today to discuss the offer.  </P> <P> After a search process of more than two months, college officials narrowed the  field to Marshall and Estancia High School Coach Tim O'Brien, and Monday  offered the position to Marshall.  </P> <P> Marshall said the process, which included two day-long series of interviews and  a mock basketball practice with the Christ College team, was the most  exhaustive he has ever gone through.  </P> <P> "I wish it would have happened sooner but that process showed that they knew  the importance of this position," Marshall said.  </P> <P> Marshall, 34, who was an assistant basketball coach at Idaho State and Cal Poly  San Luis Obispo, is also the associate athletic director in charge of  fund-raising at Westmont. If he accepts the offer from Christ College, he also  will be taking a fund-raising position. MARTIN BECK  </P></p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Hopes dwindle for US Mars probe HOPES FOR rescuing the Dollars 980m (Pounds 652m) Mars Observer mission from failure were dwindling yesterday as US space scientists tried vainly to re-establish radio contact with the spacecraft. Officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration could do little but cross their fingers and hope that a fallback programme would prompt the Mars Observer to call in of its own accord, after their own efforts to restore communications had produced no result. However, they said yesterday they believed the spacecraft would automatically move into orbit, despite their lack of communications. Nasa engineers had originally switched off the Mars Observer's radio last week as a precaution when they pressurised its fuel tanks in preparation for orbit. The radio has not switched back on. Scientists involved in the mission tried to put a brave face on things, noting that some of the return on the Dollars 980m investment had already been achieved through the development of technology for the mission that could be transferred to other uses. Nonetheless, the mission seems set to become the latest in a series of disasters that have severely damaged Nasa's reputation for getting things done. Nasa's efforts to explore deep space, from the Hubble space telescope to the Galileo mission to Jupiter, have been hampered by technical failures. Its launch programme has also been plagued with problems, with malfunctions causing repeated delays to the schedule for space shuttle missions. Other space launchers outside Nasa's aegis have fared no better, with setbacks including the explosion earlier this month of an Air Force Titan 4 rocket carrying an expensive intelligence satellite. These problems come at a particularly critical time for Nasa, because of the intensity of debate in Congress about future funding levels for expensive programmes such as space exploration. The space station, redesigned to meet tighter cost constraints, survived by one vote in the House of Representatives in June, but Congress members opposed to the station believe there are still other opportunities to kill the project.</p>

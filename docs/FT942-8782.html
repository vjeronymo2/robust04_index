			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / World Trade News: NCM may expand into Asia NCM, the Dutch-based international credit insurer, said yesterday it was considering expanding into Asia, where credit insurance was relatively under-developed compared with Europe, the group's main market, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. Mr Harry Groen, NCM's chairman, said the company hoped to have a 'presence of one form or another' in Asia within the next couple of years, extending growth abroad that has seen the company buy or launch operations in six countries, including Britain, since the early 1990s.</p>

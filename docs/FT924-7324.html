			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Boardroom shake-up at Spanish retail bank BANESTO, the big retail bank which owns large share stakes in a number of Spanish companies, replaced its chief executive yesterday following poor results in the group's parent bank. Mr Enrique Lasarte, chairman of Banco de Vitoria, a Banesto subsidiary and an associate of Mr Mario Conde, Banesto chairman, was appointed Banesto's chief executive in place of Mr Juan Belloso. The boardroom shake-up is being interpreted among the Madrid business community as confirmation that Banesto is encountering trading problems as the Spanish economy moves into recession. Mr Lasarte's appointment comes in the wake of losses of Pta25m (Dollars 248,828) for Banesto during the third quarter of 1992 with the bank increasing provisions from Pta8.6bn to Pta16.4bn. Most of Banesto's rivals maintained their earnings over the first nine months of 1992. Banesto appears to be suffering from its aggressive consumer credit policy of recent years. An additional drain on liquidity stems from Banesto's links with Corporacion Banesto, the industrial holding, which groups the bank's corporate interests. In the past, Banesto has been able to sell industrial interests, such as Petromed, the oil company which was acquired by British Petroleum last year, and thus increase revenue with extraordinary income. At least two of the Banesto-controlled companies on the Corporacion are currently up for sale - Acerinox, the steel producer and Agroman, the construction company - but a depressed market and the high price that Banesto has placed on them is impeding their disposal. Mr Juan Belloso is a member of the ruling socialist party who was formerly one of the senior industrial troubleshooters in state-owned enterprises.</p>

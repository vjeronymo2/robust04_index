			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Taking the pioneer trail to Cambodia The attention of the global investor in emerging markets is turning more and more to the exotic. As some of the established markets - such as Turkey and India - have failed, so far, to sustain in 1994 the sort of returns that made them glittering successes last year, such an attitude might appear reasonable. In the case of Morgan Stanley's Mr Barton Biggs it is more like being a pioneer. In a research note published recently on Cambodia, Mr Biggs, the US investment bank's director of global strategy, suggests that investors 'have one chance in three of making no money or losing their entire investment in the next five years, because the country's survival is still at risk; one chance in three of making 500 per cent; and one chance in three of realising a 1,000 per cent gain'. Of course, there are certain barriers at present to any sort of foreign investment - to begin with the country does not yet have a stock exchange. This is not a problem, says Mr Biggs. 'The adventurous can acquire real estate, or approach companies directly and buy stakes. The Ministry of Finance and central bank (have) plans to privatise power and telecommunications in the near future and a stock exchange is clearly on the drawing board.' For the moment, fundamentals are improving: a new government has reduced inflation from 200 per cent to virtually nil, the currency has been stabilised and 1993 GDP growth was 6 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                              Dollar terms                       No. of         May 6     % Change     % Change Market                stocks          1994    over week   on Dec '93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America          (210)        563.59         -6.9        -13.4 Argentina               (25)        871.17         -0.7        -12.4 Brazil                  (57)        205.51        -19.3        -11.7 Chile                   (25)        591.35         -2.0         +7.2 Colombia1               (11)        930.45         +2.8        +44.3 Mexico                  (69)        813.81         -4.7        -18.7 Peru2                   (11)        148.62         +4.9        +22.9 Venezuela3              (12)        528.30         -2.3        -10.7 Asia                   (557)        240.15         -1.1        -17.5 China4                  (18)         89.60         -5.2        -40.0 South Korea5           (156)        129.64         +4.8         +9.7 Philippines             (18)        291.39         +6.9        -14.4 Taiwan, China6          (90)        134.28         +4.3         -0.7 India7                  (76)        122.98         +0.9         +5.6 Indonesia8              (37)         95.80         +0.9        -23.2 Malaysia               (105)        265.04         -3.1        -21.8 Pakistan9               (15)        385.86         -2.0         -0.5 Sri Lanka10              (5)        160.30         +4.8         +1.7 Thailand                (55)        349.74         -2.3        -26.8 Euro/Mid East          (125)        103.75         +2.5        -38.7 Greece                  (25)        246.09         -1.3         +8.1 Hungary11                (5)        212.44         -0.0        +27.5 Jordan                  (13)        170.39         +8.1         +2.9 Poland12                (12)        652.87         -1.5        -20.2 Portugal                (25)        121.90         -5.3         +7.1 Turkey13                (40)         75.50        +14.0        -64.5 Zimbabwe14               (5)        272.35         -0.0        +34.8 Composite              (892)        294.40         -3.7        -17.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Local currency terms                       No. of         May 6     % Change     % Change Market                stocks          1994    over week   on Dec '93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America          (210) Argentina               (25)    534,571.11         -0.7        -12.4 Brazil                  (57) 394,925,996.6        -12.5       +288.6 Chile                   (25)      1,008.48         -2.3         +5.8 Colombia1               (11)      1,385.91         +3.3        +49.5 Mexico                  (69)      1,160.20         -3.9        -13.5 Peru2                   (11)        197.67         +4.7        +24.3 Venezuela3              (12)      1,582.71         +2.7        +11.4 Asia                   (557) China4                  (18)         98.13         -5.4        -40.2 South Korea5           (156)        137.33         +4.6         +9.4 Philippines             (18)        374.45         +4.3        -15.7 Taiwan, China6          (90)        133.19         +4.3         -0.4 India7                  (76)        136.00         +0.1         +5.6 Indonesia8              (37)        112.27         +0.8        -21.1 Malaysia               (105)        258.42         -4.4        -23.3 Pakistan9               (15)        533.58         -2.0         +1.0 Sri Lanka10              (5)        192.31         +4.8         +0.7 Thailand                (55)        349.81         -2.4        -27.6 Euro/Mid East          (125) Greece                  (25)        407.48         -0.5         +6.0 Hungary11                (5)        261.77         +0.2        +29.7 Jordan                  (13)        245.03         +4.7         +2.3 Poland12                (12)        922.53         -1.7        -16.4 Portugal                (25)        143.46         -4.5         +3.9 Turkey13                (40)      1,193.03        +12.4        -18.0 Zimbabwe14               (5)        322.26         +0.2        +50.8 Composite              (892)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Osaka, June 13 KYODO -- The Pacific Resource  Exchange Center, a government-backed agency, will dispatch its  officials to Vietnam to lecture on corporate management and  other issues, center officials said Monday [13 Jun].    The lecture, to be held June 14-24 in Ho Chi Minh city and  Hanoi, is designed to help Vietnam smoothly shift to a market  economy under its "doi moi" reform policy.    The economic reform has engendered a number of problems,  such  as a widening gap in the living standards between big cities and  other areas and deteriorating health of state-run enterprises.    The planned lecture will focus on ways to nurture and  strengthen managerially weak small firms and breathe new life  into economically backward local areas.</p>

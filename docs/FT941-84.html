			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Lower provisions help Co-op Bank to Pounds 18m A sharp rise in operating profit and a continuing fall in bad debt provisions helped the Co-operative bank increase annual pre-tax profits by 82 per cent from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 17.8m. The period to January 8 1994 is the second year in which the Co-op bank has returned to profit after two years of losses. Amid fierce competition for personal savings, the bank's retail deposits rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 1.9bn. Provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell by 11 per cent to Pounds 38.4m (Pounds 43.4m). Mr Terry Thomas, managing director, said the figures reflected improvements in the bank's loan portfolio in both the personal and corporate sectors. They represented 'substantial progress in the first full year since the worst of the recession in the early 1990s.' Mr Thomas said yesterday the investment programme would continue to enhance efficiency in dealing with customers, and highlighted its telephone banking service and the re-design of the distribution network. Net interest income rose to Pounds 130m (Pounds 125m), while non-interest income rose more sharply, taking total operating income to Pounds 228m (Pounds 208m). Staff costs grew by more than 10 per cent to Pounds 82m (Pounds 74.5m). Mr Thomas paid tribute to staff members and emphasised that the bank's success had been achieved without significant job losses. Earnings per share advanced to 0.91p (0.1p). The bank, which is wholly owned by the Co-operative Wholesale Society, underlined its ethical stance again yesterday, with the launch of a scheme using its credit cards to raise money for charities chosen by bank customers. From April 1, 5p of every Pounds 100 spent on the bank's Visa cards will go to national charities and local good causes.</p>

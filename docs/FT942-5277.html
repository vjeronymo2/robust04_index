			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Benefits plan for lottery system The National Lottery's computer system could be used to pay out pensions and social security benefits, says G-Tech, a member of the Camelot consortium which will operate the UK lottery. The company uses a system based on the technology it has developed for running state lotteries to pay social security benefits in parts of the US. The end of the traditional pension and benefit books was signalled last month when Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, told sub-postmasters that he hoped to introduce computer terminals in every post office to replace the 57m order books used to pay Pounds 80bn of benefits every year. G-Tech has confirmed a report in the magazine Electronics Times that benefits payments could be integrated into the network of terminals it will install to record entries for the weekly draw. Post offices would have two swipe-card terminals: one for the lottery and one for benefit payments. Mr Lilley said that all benefit recipients could be issued with a social security payment card to be swiped through a terminal to authorise the payment and specify the amount. The aim would be to save on the Pounds 550m-a-year bill for paying through order books, and to reduce losses through fraud estimated at Pounds 120m a year. Mr Craig Watson, vice-president for public affairs at G-Tech, said the system could be run on the same network as the lottery. The Camelot consortium plans to install 35,000 terminals in post offices, shops and garages to record lottery entries, connected to a central computer at Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire. G-Tech pays benefits to 700,000 people in New York city, and has won a contract to set up an electronic benefit transfer system for Texas.</p>

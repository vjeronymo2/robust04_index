			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by </F> Elisa Wasch; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Mock] [As far as Bosnia-Herzegovina is  concerned], I think that the point is not to adopt new  resolutions, most of which have lost credibility, but, finally,  to set a sign of hope by implementing at least one or more  resolutions that will have a protective effect for the  population in certain areas -- if necessary through military  intervention in specific cases, which has been announced five  times before but has never been put into practice.    [Wasch] Foreign Minister, do you not think that it is easy  for Austria, which is not a NATO member, to call for air strikes?    [Mock] It is not at all easy. What we do is abide by the  principles of the UN Charter and international law; we have  always said coercive military action should be the last resort.  However, if such action is necessary to halt aggression and to  create, at least, a chance to find a way out of chaos, then one  can only pursue this course.    [Wasch] Do you think NATO will be influenced by Austria's  demand?    [Mock] Certainly not. Nevertheless, we have been asked, and  I have been invited, to participate in a conference of  neighboring countries in Geneva. I will stick to our course  there. If others think that order can be restored by dividing  up recognized countries, or by rewarding aggression -- then this  is their opinion with which I will not identify. However, one  will have to regard that as a most serious warning for  medium-sized and small countries. One will have to be aware of  the fact that the law hardly counts in current international  politics, all that matters is strength.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Burbyga: "Independent Trade Union of </F> Servicemen Makes Friends With Defense Ministry"]    [Text] A cooperation agreement has been signed between the  independent trade union of servicemen and the Defense Ministry.    According to Mikhail Kolchev, chairman of the trade union,  everyone will benefit from this step, but above all former  military men who were forced to retire due to army cuts. This  year alone more than 180,000 officers will be leaving the army,  and each subsequent year the plan is to cut 50,000 officers.  The independent trade union's task is to uphold these people's  interests and provide them with social and legal protection. An  agreement of this kind has been signed not only with the Defense  Ministry, but with other power ministries as well.</p>

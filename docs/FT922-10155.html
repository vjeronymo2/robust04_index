			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Markets: Oil stocks are only for the strong-hearted - The Bottom Line TONY Craven-Walker, chief executive of Monument Oil and Gas, spends much of his time pondering ways in which small oil companies can offer value for shareholders. Monument is one of the UK's band of independent exploration and production companies. These put so much money into searching for oil that there is seldom any left to pay dividends. At the same time, the rise and fall of their share prices is tied closely to the fluctuations in world oil prices. This year oil prices are low: for UK companies forced to cope with the dollar-sterling exchange rate, they have sunk to their lowest level in real terms for 20 years. Low oil prices have pushed UK oil company stock prices into the doldrums. What is more, the stock market has started to lose faith in a long-term increase in oil prices which undermines the argument for buying into the sector in the first place. Craven-Walker would like to find a novel way of offering a pay-out to shareholders. In any case, Monument can offer more long-term value than some of its counterparts because of its stake in the Morecambe Bay field in the North Sea. This field produces gas for which there is strong UK demand at prices which are often uncoupled from the oil market. The last week has seen a small pick-up in the price of oil, giving a boost to oil sector shares. But the price rise was probably more for technical reasons than because of any strong upturn in demand and is unlikely to be sustained. Chris Fay, exploration director at Shell, has commented that the industry is working on the margin of economic viability. Most UK oil companies can make money with oil prices at around Dollars 18 a barrel but those with high costs such as Lasmo and Clyde Petroleum will struggle. At the same time, almost all exploration companies are trimming their drilling budgets this year which lowers their chances of an oil find. With the oil sector underperforming the FT-All Share index by at least 10 per cent this year, some pundits argue that oil stocks are a cheap buy. Not everyone agrees: 'The sector is bombed out, but there has been a significant change in perceptions about future oil prices. I don't think this has been fully reflected in share prices yet and they could still fall relative to the market,' said Simon Flowers, industry analyst at County NatWest in Edinburgh. County NatWest has joined many other industry observers in revising its forecast for oil prices downwards to Dollars 23 a barrel in 1997 compared with its previous estimate of Dollars 26 a barrel. It bases this on commitments by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost production capacity along with expectations of a slow increase in world oil demand. Money invested in oil stocks is a hedge on the future direction of oil prices in general. More specifically, investors could be expressing confidence in a small company's ability to find oil. But this is a big bet. Oil stocks, particularly the small independent exploration companies, should carry a health warning. Investors who piled into Kelt Energy when its share price hit Pounds 3 three years ago as the company looked as if it was having a successful run on exploration, have seen their holding plunge to virtually nothing today. A group of banks is running the company in a bid to recoup some of the money lent. Tullow Oil is currently generating a lot of excitement: it is focused purely on oil exploration and has enjoyed some success. Investors could easily see the value of their holdings double if the company makes a big discovery, but they could equally lose their entire stake. Shell and British Petroleum are much a safer bets on the oil price. Of these two, Shell is financially stronger and its shares are likely to continue their steady rise while dividends keep pace with inflation over the long haul. BP is more risky since if oil prices continue in their current vein, it is unlikely to be able to sustain dividend payments at current rates. In spite of the gloom over future oil prices, the sector could still prove lucrative for the strong-hearted investor. Oil prices have a tendency to confound expectations. Any political upset in the Middle East could send prices soaring while exploration stocks take off.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Petrocon targets James Wilkes PETROCON, the engineering and surveying group, yesterday launched a hostile Pounds 36.6m paper bid for James Wilkes, the acquisitive engineer which is also the world's largest manufacturer of beer mats. The offer of 13 new Petrocon shares for every three of Wilkes' values the target's stock at 199.3p. Petrocon's shares held steady after the announcement to close at 46p. Wilkes's shares rose 5p to 182p. Mr Stephen Hinchliffe, Wilkes chairman, attacked the offer as an 'unwelcome and damaging intrusion to James Wilkes' development'. It 'significantly undervalues (its) present profits and performance', he said. Mr Colin Robinson, Petrocon chairman, said, however, that Wilkes' gearing and overheads had been allowed to reach 'excessive levels'. Petrocon, which owns a 2.84 per cent stake in Wilkes, claimed to have received the support of investors holding 29.1 per cent. Mr Robinson said there were synergies in the companies' engineering divisions. One of Wilkes' main subsidiaries is Floform, the spark plug electrode maker, bought from Hollis Industries in 1989 when Mr Robinson was chief executive there. Petrocon makes and distributes valves and pipe fittings. Mr Hinchliffe dismissed the synergy claim, saying: 'To put these businesses together is basically having just James Wilkes.' The company had embarked on a programme in December to 'substantially cut gearing', he added. Petrocon also yesterday announced an agreed Pounds 2.68m offer for Beverley, an engineering, software and management services company controlled by Mr Robinson and three other Petrocon directors. Mr Robinson, who set up Beverley in 1989, holds 70 per cent of the smaller company and will earn about Pounds 2m in cash and Petrocon shares through the deal. The directors have agreed to retain the Petrocon shares until 1993. If both offers are accepted, the new stock issued would represent 69.1 per cent of Petrocon's share capital.</p>

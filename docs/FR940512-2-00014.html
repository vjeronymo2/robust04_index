We have now completed that review and have upheld the results of the preliminary results. We have determined for the final results that the signatories have complied with the terms of the agreement during the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. In addition, we have determined that the signatories of the agreement on fresh cut flowers have met the requirements for termination of the suspended investigation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> May 12, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Elizabeth Patience or Jean Kemp, Office of Agreements Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Constitution Avenue and 14th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;3793. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 10, 1994, the Department published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 6236) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the agreement. We have now completed that review in accordance with section 751(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), 19 USC 1675(a) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Imports covered by this review are shipments of miniature (spray) carnations, standard carnations, and pompon chrysanthemums from Costa Rica. This merchandise is currently classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) items 0603.10.30 and 0603.10.70. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The review covers the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991 and six programs: (1) Tax Credit Certificates; (2) Certificates for Increasing Exports; (3) Income Tax Exemptions for Export Earnings; (4) Exporter Credit for Sales Tax and Consumption Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases; (5) Exporter Exemptions for Taxes and Duties on Imports; and (6) Accelerated Depreciation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Comments Received <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received comments from petitioner and rebuttal comments from respondents (ACOFLOR, the trade association representing the signatories in these proceedings and the Government of Costa Rica (GOCR)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 1: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Petitioner argues that all Coast Rican flower producers and exporters covered by the agreement have not established non-use of countervailable programs for a period of at least five years. Since the first administrative review, nine companies have signed on to the agreement. Petitioner notes that &sect;355.25(a)(2)(i) of the Department's regulations states that a suspended investigation may be terminated if ``[a]ll producers and exporters covered at the time of revocation by the order or suspension agreement have not applied for or received any net subsidy on the merchandise for a period of at least five consecutive years.'' As not all current signatories were covered by the first review, petitioner argues that they have not been found to comply with the terms of the agreement for five consecutive years. Petitioner contends that it is not Department practice to deviate from its regulations without a demonstration that the unusual facts or circumstances of a particular case require special consideration. Petitioner points out that in Ceramic Tile from Mexico; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review and Revocation in Part of the Countervailing Duty Order (59 FR 2823, 2824, January 19, 1994) (``Tile from Mexico'') the Department found that a company had fulfilled the five-year requirement, even though it had not been reviewed during one review period because it did not ship during that period. The Department based this determination on the ``unusual facts and circumstances'' of the case and the lack of a clearly articulated Department policy detailing the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(a)(3). The Department did revoke the order for this company. Petitioner also notes a Department decision to require that separate administrative reviews be conducted for each of the review periods. (See Lamb Meat from New Zealand; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review (58 FR 45,097, August 26, 1993), and the Department's Memorandum in that review Re: Basis for Revocation of Orders and Terminations of Suspension Agreements Under 19 CFR 355.25(a)(1) at 4 (12/14/92) (on file in room B&hyph;099, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

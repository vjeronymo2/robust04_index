			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter noted that the legislative history of Public Law 96&hyph;499, indicated that the Congress wanted providers to have an opportunity to present their cases at an informal hearing prior to imposition of a sanction, citing H.R. 1169 at 56, reprinted in 1980 U.S. Code, Cong. &amp; Admin News, 5526, 5569.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  OBRA '87, as discussed more fully above, OBRA '87 specifically provides that the Secretary must ``minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies'' (see sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(2)(A) of the Act). In addition, OBRA '87 provides that, ``It is the duty and responsibility of the Secretary to assure that requirements which govern the provision of care [*&blank;*&blank;* in both Medicare and Medicaid facilities *&blank;*&blank;*] and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> the enforcement of such requirements, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are adequate to protect the health, safety, welfare, and rights of residents and to promote the effective and efficient use of public moneys.'' (Sections 1819(f) and 1919(f) of the Act, emphasis added).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As we stated in the proposed rule, we believe that there are compelling reasons to provide for an appeals mechanism under Medicaid that is triggered only after an adverse action has gone into effect. As discussed above, we believe this scheme most accurately reflects legislative intent. Additionally, we believe the Act gives us general rulemaking authority to achieve this objective and that, in particular, we have authority to regulate the timing of State Medicaid hearings that may be provided in accordance with section 1919(h)(7) of the Act. We also see no reason why the rules governing the Medicaid program in this area should be any different than those governing the Medicare program when the substantive requirements affecting providers are exactly the same and the enforcement options are virtually identical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Medicaid, the only hearing a provider will receive is that which is provided for in this final rule, as determined by &sect;488.330(e)(4). When States hear certification and licensure appeals under the same process, that process can be used for Medicaid purposes as long as it does not go beyond the scope of the hearing procedures in part 431. Part 431 only provides for appeals of deficiencies that lead to an enforcement remedy; therefore, appeals of deficiencies that did not lead to an enforcement remedy will not be recognized for Medicaid purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, we believe that residents are the primary beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid program, and their interests are paramount. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals stated as follows in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Case  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Weinberger, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  523 F.2d 602, 607 (2nd Cir. 1975): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

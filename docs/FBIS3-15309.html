Nepomnyashcha; place and date not given: "There Is a Problem  With Crimea, Yet, It Is Not in Meshkov"]    [Text] [Nepomnyashcha] Before the Crimean elections,  [Ukrainian President] Leonid Kravchuk said that the problem is  not whether there will be a president, but what powers he will  have. Today, when a month has already passed since the election  of Yuriy Meshkov as [Crimean] president, do you think that there  still is a problem with the Crimea?    [Mykhalchenko] There is a problem, but it is an objective  one, and it does not depend on who is in power there -- [Crimean  Supreme Council Chairman Mykola] Bahrov or Meshkov. In general,  the problem with Crimea is not who is the leader -- the speaker  or the president -- but what social forces are active on the  peninsula. We see that pro-Russian forces are very active  there. Moreover, their activities are aimed at separation from  Ukraine. This is the problem.    These activities, however, are doomed to failure. Nobody in  the world claims that the documents according to which the  Crimea was handed over to Ukraine were illegal. The Crimea is  an integral part of our territory. Not only Ukraine but also  all of Europe will base its position on this fact.    Perhaps this position is also convenient for Russia, because  if it acts differently, it will position itself in a very  inconvenient situation. In such a case, Germany will have a  reason to address the issue of East Prussia, currently  Kaliningrad Oblast. The issue of Kuril Islands and other  territories, which were acquired by Russia in the 20th century,  may also be addressed more sharply. This problem is like an  iceberg.    Yuriy Meshkov will undoubtedly define his strategy and  tactics soon. Russia has been supporting him in his activities  so far. However, when he went to Russia already as the  president, neither the Russian president nor the prime minister,  nor even a deputy prime minister, received him. This was very  symptomatic. Russia understands that the Crimea is an  autonomous body in the composition of Ukraine, and it should be  treated as an autonomous republic. Regarding Crimea's  cooperation with the CIS and other Western or Eastern countries,  the Ukrainian leadership has never been against that. Such  cooperation can be conducted directly, however, only within the  competence available for the Crimea. The issues of foreign  relations, borders, customs houses, and so on, fall under the  competence of the central government.    [Nepomnyashcha] Yuriy Meshkov goes to Russia and, according  to him, agrees to put the Russian ruble into circulation in the  Crimea. Does the leader of the autonomous republic have the  right to do that?    [Mykhalchenko] In this case, his wishes are presented as  reality. First of all, at a meeting between both presidents --  Kravchuk and Meshkov -- when the latter addressed this issue,  Kravchuk did not respond positively. The issue was submitted  for consideration by a working group. Second, Russia will never  put its ruble into circulation without approval from the central  Ukrainian Government, because this would be a financial  aggression. In general, even if there are two currencies in the  Crimea, this will not be really bad for Ukraine. The  consequences will be worse for Russia, because it will expose  itself to the blow of inflation, opening a free path for its  currency to sneak away.    [Nepomnyashcha] Who will repay the loans that the Crimean  president wants to negotiate currently?    [Mykhalchenko] If the loans are granted without the central  government's approval, Ukraine will not take any responsibility  for them. I have recently had a conversation with an official  of the European Bank of Cooperation, who said that his company  will not grant the $100 million in the form of a loan for  building hotels, etc., unless there is the approval of the Kiev  government. If the central government acts as a guarantor of  the loan, it will not allow it to be wasted. Those who will  obtain any loans without Kiev's guarantees will be responsible  for repaying them.    [Nepomnyashcha] In other words, these will be private  loans...    [Mykhalchenko] Yes.    [Nepomnyashcha] Is the Ukrainian leadership going to put the  following emphasis in its policy: The peninsula wanted to get a  president, and it has received one. The president has promised  a lot in his election campaign, and this means that he should  implement this now. Thus, the responsibility of the Crimean  authorities for living conditions must increase now?    [Mykhalchenko] We could follow this reasoning, particularly,  taking into account the fact that 50 percent of the Crimean  budget is composed of central government subsidies. We could  say: If you do not want to cooperate with us, we will not give  you any subsidies. I know, however, that the central government  will never put strong pressure on the Crimea to bring it to its  knees. We understand that the people who live there need energy  and housing, and that local enterprises need assistance. The  subsidies have therefore been preserved. The Crimean  government, however, should not forget that it is able to secure  the life of the peninsula only half way. A situation when  subsidies are coming from the center but revenues are left home  is inadmissible. The Crimea should also pay taxes, contribute  to the pension fund, etc.    [Nepomnyashcha] How do you assess the fact that Yuriy  Meshkov has invited Yevhen Saburov, one of Silayev's deputies in  a former Russian Government, to assume the office of Crimean  prime minister?    [Mykhalchenko] Since I personally know Saburov very well, I  do not see any revolt here. Such a practice is known throughout  the world. There is one judicial problem however. Ukrainian  legislation regarding state service says that state offices can  be held only by Ukrainian citizens. Yevhen Saburov was born in  Yalta, and if he wanted to receive Ukrainian citizenship, there  would be no obstacles. This would be beneficial for the Crimea,  because he is a top level economist.    [Nepomnyashcha] Meshkov's viewpoint regarding the Black Sea  Fleet is essentially different than the opinions of official  Kiev. What will become of the fleet in such a case?    [Mykhalchenko] It will become what it is to become,  regardless of Meshkov. This is not his competence, but that of  the central Russian and Ukrainian Governments. During his  meeting with Meshkov, Kravchuk said that although the Crimean  government will attend the negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet,  the decision will be made by the Ukrainian and Russian  Governments and presidents, as provided for by agreements. The  position of the Crimean government is purely consultative.    [Nepomnyashcha] Does the Crimean Constitution fall in line  with the Ukrainian one currently?    [Mykhalchenko] No. In many cases it does not. I would not  like to provide these examples, because this issue is currently  being examined by the parliament, which will make it completely  clear. I will only say that the Crimean Constitution must be  brought in line with the Ukrainian one. There is no other way.    [Nepomnyashcha] What if there is resistance?    [Mykhalchenko] The power of law should be applied. The  Ukrainian Constitution is superior with regard to the Crimean  one, and the minority should be subordinated to the majority.    [Nepomnyashcha] It is easy to say that the power of law must  be applied. What if it will be impossible to do this legally?    [Mykhalchenko] Other powers should be exercised then, to  ensure that Ukrainian laws are effective. I believe, however,  that certain reasonable circles will be found in the Crimea,  which will understand that resistance has no future. Otherwise,  they will have to take responsibility for the fate of the people.    There is another issue in the Crimea however, which is to be  defined in both the Ukrainian and Crimean Constitutions. There  are indigenous people in the Crimea -- the Crimean Tatars -- and  their status should be defined in the Crimean Constitution. I  believe that this territorial autonomy can be gradually  transformed into nationally-territorial one, the constitution of  which will denote that the Crimean Tatars are its indigenous  people. Otherwise, all international organizations will see  there violation of the rights of a native people.    [Nepomnyashcha] On 1 December [1991] during the referendum,  the majority of people in Sevastopol voted in favor of Ukrainian  independence, which Leonid Kravchuk used to emphasize.  Recently, however, the city has voted for other ideals, having  supported Yuriy Meshkov.    [Mykhalchenko] At that time, many politicians claimed that  if Ukraine separated from Russia, we would live much better.  And people believed in this. You probably remember how strong  the propaganda was at that time: Everything is being carried  away from Ukraine, and therefore, we are hungry and barefoot.  But when we begin to live on our own, we will immediately get  rich, our bellies will be full, and we will be well clad.  Later, instead of conducting structural reform of the economy,  we began our tug of war. Meanwhile, the crisis deepened, and  living conditions declined, by the way, also in Russia. Now,  people believe that it was better when we lived together, and  when we became independent, it got worse. The point, however,  is not the independence, but that we should move forward instead  of remaining in the same place, or even worse, going back.</p>

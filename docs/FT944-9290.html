			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Buy-backs The Pounds 500m spent by Boots buying back its shares may look large. But given that the group is due to receive Pounds 850m from selling its prescription drugs business and is highly cash-generative, the sum is actually quite modest. Boots should end the current financial year with nearly Pounds 600m net cash. Even so, it is something that Boots has acted at all. Too few British companies - Reuters and most regional electricity companies being the notable exceptions - have been prepared to shrink their equity bases and so boost earnings per share. In the US, companies regularly buy back shares even when already geared. Buy-backs are less common in the UK partly because institutional investors are not as aggressive in pushing for them. But part of the explanation is also that rights issues can be nerve-racking for companies: since raising equity is traumatic, it is not surprising that managements are reluctant to hand it back.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Gibraltar talks seek to break EC borders deadlock BRITISH and Spanish diplomats meet in London today to resume negotiations on Gibraltar, amid fears that failure to achieve common ground over the future of the British crown colony could block European Community hopes to allow free movement of EC nationals in the 1993 Single Market. Spanish objections to EC nationals freely entering the Spanish mainland from Gibraltar next year prevented agreement on the Community's External Frontiers Convention, EFC, at both the Maastricht and the Lisbon summits. The Madrid government is likely to implement its boycott again at the December summit in Edinburgh unless it perceives substantial progress on the long-standing dispute. Today's meeting of Gibraltar co-ordinators, representing the two foreign ministries and the governor of the colony, is the first for 18 months and will seek to prepare an overdue ministerial meeting to discuss the future of the Rock. A 1985 agreement between London and Madrid, which lifted Spain's blockade on Gibraltar, established periodic meetings of co-ordinators and annual talks of foreign ministers, but the last bilateral meeting was held in February last year. During the interval, Spain has used the expectation of free movement for EC nationals to press its Gibraltar claims. The Madrid government argues that if the colony is to be considered a European entry point, under the terms of the EFC, then Spanish immigration authorities should also be present on the Rock to monitor incoming travellers. Madrid successfully used the EC framework to put pressure on Britain in 1987 when a threatened Spanish veto to the Community's air traffic liberalisation programme forced the exclusion of Gibraltar airport from the agreement. Similar Spanish obduracy now could either exclude Gibraltar from the EFC, a move which the UK opposes, or delay the 1993 convention indefinitely. At the centre of the Gibraltar dispute is Spain's demand for territorial sovereignty over the Rock, the UK's commitment not to change the status of the colony against the wishes of the people of Gibraltar, and the adamant hostility among the 20,000-odd Gibraltarians to any deal with Madrid. Diplomats hold out little hope of progress at today's meeting, bar an agreement to a November date for the ministerial meeting. The UK could, however, be pressed to review proposals tabled by Spain at the time of the 1985 accord which suggested a leaseback formula or power-sharing to break the deadlock. The proposals, which were tied to Spain regaining territorial sovereignty after an unspecified period, have never been formally answered by Britain.</p>

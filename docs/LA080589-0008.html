			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ANTI-SATELLITE PROGRAM: 'SPACE IS PART OF OUR SECURITY'  </P> <P> I totally go along with Rowny's idea that "We are entering an era in which  space will be looked on as a medium rather than a barrier to man's progress. .  . . " We don't need the B-2, we should cut aid to foreign countries.  </P> <P> If we could build two space-based platforms, we can accomplish the mission of  both foreign aid and the B-2.  </P> <P> RICHARD FOND  </P> <P> Alhambra  </P></p>

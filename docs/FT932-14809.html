			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Daf blames bankers for company's collapse DAF, the Dutch truckmaker which collapsed under the weight of its debt in February, yesterday said it had been pushed into receivership by a 'minority' of unnamed bankers who demanded up to 10 weeks to study the company's last-ditch restructuring plan drawn up in January. Mr Cor Baan, chairman of the 'old' Daf as well as of the successor company which was formed last month, also said it was 'particularly unfortunate' that the company's bankers had demanded that Daf's attempt to form a strategic partnership with Mercedes-Benz of Germany in 1992 should include a form of equity participation. Mr Baan, who was speaking at the company's extraordinary shareholders' meeting, said: 'This limited the freedom to develop alternative scenarios.' The meeting, which lasted nearly six hours, was dominated by Mr Baan's explanation of the company's fortunes since its merger with Leyland, the UK commercial vehicle maker, in 1987. It was also marked by angry recriminations from shareholders who have been told that they will received nothing for their shares, as well as by criticism from Daf employees who lost their jobs when the company was revived in slimmed-down form in March. The new company, Daf Trucks, includes the core of the old company's operations in the Netherlands and Belgium but excludes the UK operations, Leyland Daf. Daf released figures for 1992 showing that its net loss narrowed to Fl 257m (Dollars 143m) from Fl 395m in 1991, taking cumulative losses since 1990 to Fl 880m. Mr Baan said the figures demonstrated that Daf was making progress in cutting costs when it ran into difficulties. Operating results swung into a profit of Fl 22m from a loss of Fl 98m the year before.</p>

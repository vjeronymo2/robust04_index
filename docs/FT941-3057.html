			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses unsettled, unable to sustain recent rally Germany trimmed repo rates again, the US CPI data was regarded as encouraging, and there was a Bundesbank meeting today to anticipate. However, bourses were unsettled by Tuesday's setback for the US equity market, and were unable to sustain their recent rally, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT ran out of steam after the Dax index, at its intraday high of 2,188.10, registered a near 10 per cent gain over its March 2 midsession low of 1,992.70. The key index closed at 2,172.73, down 6.18 from Tuesday's post-bourse close, and eased further to 2,168.11 in the afternoon. Turnover rose from DM9.5bn to DM9.7bn. Some financials initially resisted the change in tack amid reasoning that the Bundesbank's easing of its lowest accepted repo rate from 5.94 to 5.88 per cent, while disappointing the optimists, was at least another move in the right direction. However, while the session saw gains in the big banks - Bayernhypo by DM8.20 to DM464.20, Deutsche by DM7.10 to DM824.50 and Dresdner by DM8.80 to DM415.80 - all three were trimmed back later. The most noticeable pressures were on former front line cyclicals, with a number of automotive stocks and chemicals stocks showing weakness throughout the day. Volkswagen stood out with a fall of DM13.70 to DM481.50 by the end of the post bourse. PARIS fell back in the absence of major news, and the CAC-40 index, which had seen a day's high of 2,256, closed off 15.81 at 2,242.71. Turnover dropped from FFr5bn to FFr3.5bn, reflecting the easier tone of trading. Legrand was one of the day's better performers, putting on FFr70 to FFr6,070. Goldman Sachs, initiating coverage of the electrical equipment maker, recommended the stock as a long-term outperformer, based on earnings growth arising from steady volume growth and market share gains, while price increases coupled with productivity gains would lead to an improvement in margins. 'In the past, on a cyclical upturn, margins have been squeezed by sharply rising raw material costs. However, this time we believe the impact of rising raw material costs will be more restrained and this is one reason why above average earnings is sustainable in the longer term.' AMSTERDAM drifted slightly lower, the AEX index losing 2.03, or 0.5 per cent at 425.24. Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer, dropped by some 15 per cent at one stage, before finding a measure of support to close Fl 1.90 or nearly 12 per cent down at Fl 14.50. The selling was prompted by a report, denied by the company, that it was to lower the nominal value of the shares. Last week the group, in which Daimler of Germany holds a majority stake, announced a bigger than expected loss for 1993. James Capel, which maintains a sell recommendation on the stock, commented earlier this week that with a further substantial loss expected in 1994 another capital injection is likely. On a more positive note Van Ommeren, the transport and tanker group, advanced Fl 1.10 to Fl 50.60 as it forecast improved trading condition this year. Grolsch, the brewer, put on 70 cents to Fl 49.70 after reporting flat 1993 results and indicating an improvement in 1994. MILAN turned lower in technically inspired trading on the last day of the the March account as investors prepared themselves for what could be a restrained patch in the run up to the March 27-28 general elections. The Comit index fell 1.31 to 676.75. Telecommunications stocks retreated after recent strong gains. Sip fell L93 to L4,506, Stet L80 to L4,935 and Italcable L420 to L10,752. Short covering helped some industrials higher. Montedison rose L36 to L1,247 and Pirelli L48 to L2,302. Olivetti added L68 to L2,578 on further speculation about the prospects of its winning the licence to operate Italy's second mobile telephone licence. Among the banks, BCI dipped L90 to L6,247 on the last trading day before its privatisation share makes its debut on the bourse. ZURICH took its lead from weaker bonds and the SMI index fell 19.8 to 2,887.1. Roche certificates remained at the top of the active list, giving up SFr40 to SFr7,150. Profit-taking left cyclical issues lower after their recent strong performance. Brown Boveri lost SFr14 to SFr1,220 and Sulzer fell SFr23 to SFr1,045. MADRID followed the herd, the general index losing 3.06 at 340.17 with profit-taking most obvious in the US-quoted stocks which lifted the market on Monday. Turnover was slightly down at Pta30.3bn. Telefonica and Repsol were the most active stocks, losing Pta40 to Pta1,925 and Pta110 to Pta4,790 respectively; in utilities, Endesa dropped Pta160 to Pta7,430. OSLO was helped higher by lower interest rates and a strong rebound in Norsk Skog, the forestry group. The all-share index rose 6.12 to 671.52 in turnover of NKr863m. Norsk Skog rose NKr15 to NKr185, more than recouping Tuesday's NKr14 fall which followed an announcement that the company was planning share issues to raise up to NKr800m. ISTANBUL rose 4.25 per cent following a rally at midsession as the overnight borrowing rate was cut from 700 per cent to 200 per cent. The composite index added 616.12 to 15,127.3. TEL AVIV rose for the second consecutive session although turnover remained moderate and some profit-taking was evident late in the day. The Mishtanim index put on 3.99 or nearly 2 per cent to 212.81 with shares worth some Shk302m changing hands, against Shk332m on Tuesday.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 16                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1473.06    1470.79    1469.01    1467.64 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1511.95    1509.25    1507.24    1505.77  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1467.29    1468.50    1465.95    1466.28 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1505.28    1506.08    1503.26    1504.22  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Mar 15    Mar 14    Mar 11    Mar 10     Mar 9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100  1469.35   1456.59   1431.65   1445.26   1445.47 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1513.24   1495.08   1471.59   1494.35   1496.63  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90);  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1473.33; 200 - 1512.25 Low/day: 100 - 1464.83 200 - 1502.21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Written and edited by William Cochrane, John Pitt and Michael Morgan</p>

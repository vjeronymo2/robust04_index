			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BABY INSANE  </P> <P> It's about time there has been something written to tell people how hard gang  life is on its members and how most, if given an opportunity, a genuine  opportunity, would not be involved.  </P> <P> They are just children, most of them hardened by a life many of us couldn't  imagine.  </P> <P> As an African-American, I would like to see and read more about real-life gang  success stories. I would like to say to Baby Insane, if he should read this:  Hang in there, little brother. Stay on the straight and narrow, and remember  there will be many of us who are hoping and praying you continue your new life  successfully.  </P> <P> JANICE SMITH  </P> <P> El Toro  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today expressed  hope about peace in Bosnia, but warned a settlement would not  come "in a sudden blaze of glory." He reaffirmed British troops  would be sent to the Muslim town of Gorazde only when a  ceasefire was in place. And he expressed confidence in  Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander on the  ground in Bosnia, who has asked for troops to police Gorazde.    In spite of the Serb assault on the town and the United  Nations' attacks in response, Mr Rifkind said: "I believe we are  still in the position of considerable hope compared to the past.  One has always assumed it will be a situation of three steps  forward, one step back."    He added: "It is not going to happen overnight. We are not  going to have a sudden peace settlement in a sudden blaze of  glory. It's going to be worked on slowly and painfully. But  over the last few weeks we have seen more progress than we have  seen in two years and that is a cause for cautious optimism."    He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, from New York, that  British troops would be needed in Gorazde to monitor the  situation, man the checkpoints and disarm and get between the  combatants.    Responding to Sir Michael's request for troops there, Mr  Rifkind paid tribute to him and said: "I don't think we should  normally try and second guess the commander in the field as to  how he wishes to use the forces at his disposal. He knows the  local scene. He knows the best impact that can be made by using  his forces in a particular way."</p>

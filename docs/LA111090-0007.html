			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> RODENTS THRIVE IN COLLEGE RAT RACE  </P> <P> Some colleges have bed races. Some have kissing marathons. At Moorpark College,  it's the Rat Review.  </P> <P> For several years, the college's Exotic Animal Training and Management Program  has staged a Rat Review in the spring, featuring student-trained rodents that  climb, jump, slide and go through tunnels and mazes.  </P> <P> Ten members of the animal behavior class entered their pet rodents Friday in  the first Fall Rat Review.  </P> <P> About 10 rats took part. They're the ones that made the cut of those entered in  the first round of the review by 40 students, class member Bill Wolden said.  </P> <P> Wolden was pleased with the performance of his two rats, Calvin and Hobbes.  They climbed through a three-story house built by Wolden, came out onto a  balcony, walked across a wire and slid down a flagpole into a toy truck, Wolden  said.  </P> <P> Another class member, Julie Sheridan, entered Monkey-See and Monkey-Do. Each  attempted to make its way through a maze at separate times.  </P> <P> "They have distinctly different personalities," Sheridan said. "One of them,  Monkey-See, can run through the maze quickly. But she's so well trained that  she'll pause on command."  </P> <P> Monkey-Do, also a female, is more independent. "She's more of a free-thinker,"  Sheridan said. "She likes to set her own pace."  </P> <P> The rats have been in training for six weeks, college spokesman Gerry Olsen  said.  </P> <P> About 30 people attended the public event in the college's Music Building.  </P> <P> For the first time, class members who are not also enrolled in the animal  training and management program were allowed to enter their rodents.  </P> <P> "It's turned out to be a lot of fun -- a real crowd-pleaser," Olsen said.

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Parties clash over property tax bills CONSERVATIVES sought to reinvigorate their local election campaign yesterday by provoking a battle of figures with Labour over the amounts households will pay under the parties' poll tax alternatives. The government focused on the gainers under the council tax plans amid moves by ministers to restore party morale. However, Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, appeared to hint that implementation of the tax could be later than the planned 1993 start date. He said the timescale envisaged would mean taking the 'fast track'. Labour quickly condemned the possibility of poll tax bills continuing for an extra year. Ministers reiterated their view that two thirds of households would gain under the proposals. They attacked as 'bogus' Labour figures showing that its own 'fair rates' plan would cost households Pounds 67 less on average. Labour said its proposals would mean an average of Pounds 333 compared with Pounds 400 under the government's plans. But Conservatives said Labour was using different figures for the sums that councils needed to raise. Party officials also said Pounds 400 would represent the council tax bill on a median property. The distribution of properties in the seven bands would mean the average household bill would be Pounds 360. Labour also attempted to undermine the government's figures with attacks on its record in predicting poll tax levels and accused it of protecting the rich. As MPs and council representatives continue to digest Tuesday's announcements, Mr Chris Patten, Tory party chairman, was anxious to deflect attention from the trauma surrounding the poll tax's demise. He called on colleagues 'to go very firmly on the offensive'. But there were murmurs of discontent among some Tories. The Tories are expected to launch a further offensive against Labour at the weekend but plan only one more press conference before polling day. In an interview in today's Daily Express, Mr John Major was cautious about prospects for next week's elections. 'I hope we will see some good effects on May 2, but you cannot be certain about that because many people, by May 2, will not have got their community charge bills this year.' Mr Patten again indicated that a June general election had been virtually ruled out, insisting that the flow of good economic news would ensure that as 'the days lengthen this summer, so do Labour's faces'.

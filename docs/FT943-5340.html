			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Electricity industry pay bias criticised Unison, the public services union, has found widespread pay discrimination among workers in the privatised electricity supply industry, it said yesterday. Mr Alan Jinkinson, the general secretary, said equal pay cases launched by the union had won pay rises of up to Pounds 2,000 for 10,500 members, most of them women. Unison said that the electricity supply industry was the first sector to be persuaded to introduce pay equity by a union strategy of legal action and pay bargaining. The rises covered clerical and sales staff working for 11 of the 19 electricity supply companies. About 20,000 staff are expected to be affected. The union's campaign compared jobs often done by women - such as telephonist, word-processor operator, accounts clerk and sales - with jobs often done by men - such as storekeeping and meter-reading. In 1990-91 differences between grades ranged from Pounds 709 to Pounds 2,663 a year. The union said the mental effort and communication skills in clerical jobs were comparable with the physical effort and working conditions of manual jobs. Electricity supply companies have conceded the union claim in a series of cases taken to industrial tribunals, producing Pounds 70,000 in back pay for applicants. In the move from national to company bargaining, the union has also negotiated new grading structures to give clerical workers equal pay with manual workers. 'It is disgraceful that women workers continue to be exploited nearly two decades after the equal pay laws were introduced,' Mr Jinkinson said.</p>

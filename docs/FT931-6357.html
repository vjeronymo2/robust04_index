			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Arts: Festival of Britten - London concerts The Barbican's latest big concert series (February 25 - March 21) is a celebration of Benjamin Britten by the London Symphony Orchestra and a whole galaxy of singers, choirs, instrumentalists and composers, led by Mstislav Rostropovich. He is its artistic director and guiding light; he is conducting most of the concerts, playing the cello in two others, and infusing everyone and everything with his overflowingly generous musical personality. This is, above all, his tribute to Britten, the last of the 'three composers who have had the most influence in shaping my musical life': thus he writes in a foreword to the LSO programme book, itself decked with photographs documenting the association of Britten, Pears, Rostropovich and Vishnevskaya  -relatively short in clock-time (not quite two decades), infinitely significant in creative terms. But while the festival may focus on the artistic stimulus - of composer on cellist (and soprano wife) and vice versa - that resulted from this association, its programme is by no means narrowly single-minded. The LSO's opening concert, last Thursday, had no Britten in it but much Britten-by-reflection. The opening item was his little-known 1941 arrangement of the 'flowers' movement from the Mahler Third Symphony; the finale was Shostakovich's Fourteenth Symphony, dedicated to him. Mahler as Britten influence and Shostakovich as Britten's 20th-century artistic companion-in-arms are potent, fascinating subjects that cropped up again for examination in Sunday's two Barbican Hall concerts  - the afternoon Borodin Quartet recital (which showed both Britten and Shostakovich learning the metier of string-quartet composition) and the evening LSO concert (which ended with Britten's 1939 Sinfonia da Requiem, its anguish and consolatory calm deeply imbued with the spirit of Mahler's Ninth Symphony). This intelligent artistic cross-referencing adds to the excitement of the whole enterprise. Another strand concerns Britten as enlightened patron of younger composers such as Robert Saxton, Oliver Knussen and Colin Matthews. All three are featured during the series; for Thursday's concert the LSO had commissioned Matthews's Memorial. This sombrely impressive single-movement threnody attempts to capture in music a war-vision something like Lutyens's 'great untriumphal arch' at Thiepval, commemorating the fallen of the Somme (where Matthews's grandfather is buried). A single pedal-note tolls in the bass throughout the 20-minute length. Above it, reflections of two of Britten's most impassioned musical war-protests, the Sinfonia da Requiem and the War Requiem, seem to play on Matthews's harmonic language and the carefully graded evolution of his orchestral writing from grim chordal stasis to hallucinatory fast flourishes. The concentration on rhythmic variety-in-unity that has preoccuppied so much of his recent orchestral composition - fast-moving, exuberantly punchy - here works up a powerfully intense effect of slowly unfolding lamentation, dignified yet forcefully disquieted. On Sunday evening, alongside the Sinfonia da Requiem, there was another Britten composition presaging war: the Piano Concerto, a bittersweet cocktail of Shostakovich raucousness, Prokofiev-like virtuoso glitter and wit, and Britten's own angular, quintessentially English lyricism. It was expertly mixed and shaken by the pianist Barry Douglas and the vast batteries of the LSO. As a Britten conductor Rostropovich responds with an uninhibited fervour that nevertheless proves apt only some of the time. He gave the Simple Symphony so fiercely loving and drawn-out a bear-hug that its 'Sentimental Saraband' all but collapsed under the strain; the slow sections of the Sinfonia da Requiem were likewise distended. Even then, however, while longing for a lighter touch and a sharper sense of half-lights and expressively glancing orchestral effects, one tends to find oneself disarmed by his all-embracing Britten enthusiasm.( The festival is supported by Britten-Pears Foundation and Britten Estate.) ***** Earlier on the opening evening of the festival there was real Britten to be heard, though only for a select number of the audience. In the intimate setting of St. Giles Cripplegate students of the Guildhall School of Music presented Curlew River, the first of Britten's three Church Parables. Even when they are encountered straight after work and at a church in the very centre of a city, far from the hallowed rustic silence that the composer had in mind, these remarkable pieces cast a unique spell. Curlew River, a Japanese Noh play transferred to the misty fenland of East Anglia and given a Christian slant, is probably the best of them. Its music is spare, infinitely sensitive to the touch; its atmosphere is haunting. Various student groups have tried their hands at the Church Parables over the years, but the Guildhall's production, in the care of Jonathan Alver, came closest to the exaggerated Noh-style gestures of the original. The vocal parts, including Mark Milhofer's plangent Madwoman and Mark Evans's sturdy Traveller, were without exception well taken. Every good festival has its fringe activities and the success of this one reflected well on the main programme.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Decay eats away at inner cities FIFTEEN YEARS of govern-ment initiatives have done 'surprisingly little' to improve life in deprived inner cities, a Policy Studies Institute report concludes today. The report acknowledges that the most recent schemes - City Challenge and the establishment of an Urban Regeneration Agency - have not yet had time to prove themselves. It says, however, that 'given the record so far, it is difficult to have much confidence in more of the same or to feel at all hopeful about the future prospects for deprived urban areas'. Without more money and sound management, concludes the report, trends in deprived areas will 'continue to disappoint the hopes of residents and the aspirations of government'. If no increase in government resources is possible, it urges redirection of other funds to the most deprived parts of the country. The PSI, a leading independent economic and social policy research institution, bases its report on official statistics since 1977, when the then Labour government published the white paper Policy for the Inner Cities. This sought to reduce disadvantage in inner-urban areas. It concludes that, while there have been some improvements, the gap between deprived areas and the rest of the country in general remains as wide as it was 15 years ago. 'In some respects the gap has widened,' says the report. Its findings include: The worsening of pupil-teacher ratios - against the national trend - in most of the deprived local education authority areas studied. In general there had been a worsening in examination achievements in deprived areas compared with the rest of England. With the exception of the north-west, fewer people from deprived areas than expected were on Employment Training schemes. People from deprived areas were more likely to remain unemployed after leaving Employment Training and Youth Training schemes, with no evidence of improvement in this position over time. The proportion of families in poverty - measured in terms of those qualifying for social security benefits - had grown. Premature death among adults remained greater in deprived areas than elsewhere. While there had been improvements in infant mortality rates throughout the country, most deprived areas still had records that were worse than the national average. Estate Action and other housing programmes had not resulted in home-improvement and renovation schemes ing a higher priority in deprived areas than elsewhere. The decrease in social housing meant that little new low-cost property had been built to help ease the housing difficulties of deprived areas. While unemployment fell in a third of deprived areas between 1983 and 1991, it had remained the same or increased in the other two thirds. During the 1980s, says the report, grants from central government to local authorities declined in real terms. Although most deprived areas had lost proportionately less grant than other locations, the bulk of recent available funding had gone to urban development corporations, with London Docklands receiving the lion's share. Spending on the mainstream urban programme in England outside development corporation areas had declined in real terms during the 1980s. 'The decay at the heart of Britain's cities is one of the biggest challenges faced by its government,' says the report. Successive administrations had been trying to reverse negative trends by stimulating environmental renewal, encouraging investment, creating jobs and attempting to give residents a better quality of life. The institute's conclusions are based on 36 urban areas which scored the highest on the Department of Environment's deprivation indicators. These indicators consider the extent of factors such as unemployment, overcrowded homes and lack of amenities. The report acknowledges that there is a 'fundamental difficulty' involved in establishing the causes of the trends which it identifies. It was not possible to tell whether, without the initiatives taken in the inner cities during the past 15 years, the gaps between deprived areas and the rest of the country might have grown still wider. It also recognises that some innovative measures have been introduced only recently. It had been suggested, says the report, that City Challenge - under which local authorities compete for funding for specific schemes - would focus resources more effectively and encourage local partnerships. Likewise, in two years' time the proposed Urban Regeneration Agency might have shown its effectiveness. 'There is something in all these points. Even so, the conclusion to which our analyses lead is disturbing.' Urban Trends 1. Policy Studies Institute. Bookshops or BEBC Distribution, Post Office Box 1496, Poole, Dorset BH12 3YD.

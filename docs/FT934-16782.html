			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Two fined over Pounds 1m grain fraud TWO brothers were yesterday fined nearly Pounds 100,000 for their part in a Pounds 1m grain export fraud. Belfast Crown Court judge Frank Russell told Anthony and Dermot McGeough to pay at once or go to jail after they admitted charges of conspiracy to defraud and unlawfully exporting nearly 400 tonnes of wheat to the Irish Republic. The court heard the grain was smuggled through a shed straddling the Ulster border at Jonesborough with one door to the north and one to the south.</p>

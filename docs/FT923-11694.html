			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Tokyo shares pulled down by debt fears THE Tokyo stock market fell yesterday to its lowest level since April 1986, as doubts spread about the health of the economy following release of a gloomy Bank of Japan quarterly forecast. The Nikkei stock average slipped 2.9 per cent to close at 15,541.95. Prices continued to fall early today, with the Nikkei down more than 150 points in initial trading. The Bank of Japan said yesterday that it was closely watching the restructuring of troubled non-bank financial institutions, whose difficulties have been heightened by the renewed weakness of Tokyo stock prices. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, said the financial system was secure in spite of difficulties facing non-bank lending institutions, which fuelled the stock and property price spiral of the late 1980s, but now have fast accumulating bad debts. He said non-banks and other institutions should not necessarily support all of their troubled borrowers, and suggested that financial institutions restructuring their operations should maker further changes to ensure their profitability. Mr Mieno's comments made clear the central bank has revised its outlook on the economy, and that a recovery expected in the autumn will come later. He pointed to decelerating consumer demand as an important reason for delays in adjustment of inventories. Concerned that the stock market decline could prompt further falls in the next few days, Mr Sakae Kudo, chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers' Association, said the market correction must be close to completion. But Mr Sakae said stock prices were being weighed down by concerns about the domestic economy and suggested the Bank of Japan reduce the official discount rate from the present 3.75 per cent. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is growing in confidence that it will win a larger than generally predicted share of seats contested in an election on Sunday for half the upper house of parliament. Opposition parties admitted their campaigns had been flawed. Polls suggest the LDP could take about 70 of the 127 seats, instead of the 60 or fewer seats forecast when the campaign began. If so, the party and two coalition partners, Komeito and the Democratic Socialist Party, will consolidate their control over the upper house.</p>

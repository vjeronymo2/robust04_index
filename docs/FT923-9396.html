			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Business and the Environment: Sun, sea and sewage - Michael Skapinker reports on a Majorcan plan to reap the benefits of mass tourism without sacrificing the island's natural beauty In choppy seas off the south-east coast of Majorca, our captain, Juan Diaz, spots our catch. Floating half-submerged is a plastic shopping bag, filled with rubbish and tied by the handles. Our small craft, one of 10 operated by the Majorcan island council, slowly circles the offending object while Juame Ferrer, the second crew member, scoops it out with his black fishing net. Judging by the day's haul - two refuse bags filled with mineral water containers, wine bottles and bits of plastic - clearing the sea of rubbish is a labour-intensive business. But this marine litter patrol, which operates throughout the summer, is only one of a slew of Majorcan initiatives aimed at demonstrating that mass tourism and environmental protection are not contradictory objectives. Majorca's environmental projects have attracted the interest of the International Federation of Tour Operators (IFTO) which believes the Spanish island is developing expertise which could be put to work in resorts throughout the world. The European Community is poised to give Majorca the financial backing to pull its various initiatives into a coherent framework which could be applied wherever airlines disgorge their sun or snow-seeking charges. Majorca, which attracts 5m visitors a year, is ideally placed to teach the rest of the world about the benefits and drawbacks of mass tourism, if only because it has experienced such a surfeit of both. Its tourist industry, which is more than 30 years old, has brought the islanders a standard of living that their poverty-stricken forebears could only have achieved by emigrating - something they once did in large numbers. For the drawbacks, one has only to listen to local politicians describing the long struggle to restore the good name of the Majorcan seaside town of Magaluf after years of the luridly-reported antics of young, impecunious lager louts. That Majorca needs tourists is something no one on the island doubts, not even the local environmental activists who criticise the island's projects as too timid to overcome decades of uncontrolled development. Eduardo Gamero is director general of tourism for the Balearics, made up of Majorca and the neighbouring, smaller islands of Minorca, Ibiza and Formentera. Born in the Majorcan capital of Palma 50 years ago, Gamero has fond memories of the days before the tourists came. 'I remember tramways, a city where everyone knew everyone else and where you could leave your key in the front door. We lost that with the tourist development. Can you leave your key in your front door in Palma today? Absolutely not.' In the early 1950s, the populations of Palma and of Majorca were shrinking. The capital had a population of 150,000 and the island was home to 300,000 people. Today, the island has a population of 500,000, of whom 320,000 live in Palma, a sprawling, bustling, but not unattractive city dominated by a cathedral. The island, away from the main tourist towns, boasts mountains, coastline and hilltop villages to compare with anything Europe has to offer. The islanders are among the richest people in Spain. Tourism has brought them their wealth and nothing else could sustain it, Gamero says. The island's agriculture is too small and fragmented to feed the local population. Almost all Majorca's food is imported. As for other non-tourist options, Gamero says that 'it would be crazy to think that an island like Majorca could establish heavy industry. We live on tourism. Our only possible future is tourism.' The question for the island is what sort of tourism? Not, all sides agree, the low-cost package tourism that has been and, to a large extent still is, the island's speciality. First, because Majorca finds it increasingly difficult to compete on price against resorts in countries like Turkey. And second because young alcohol-sodden tourists drive away the respectable families who spend more money and do not rip out newly-planted trees. As Majorca has found, however, an island that plays host to the London Pub, the Mucky Duck and Lineker's Bar finds it difficult to move up-market. All three establishments are in Magaluf, which comes under the jurisdiction of the socialist-controlled Calvia town council, where Antonio Pallicer serves as councillor for tourism and security. Magaluf's nadir, he says, was the mid-to-late 1980s, when summer trouble in the streets was at its height. 'Our customers were of the lowest sort. Magaluf had become vulgar. We started to think, to analyse. What could we do to change the image of this resort?' Part of the answer was to change the environment in the hope that tourists' behaviour would show a corresponding improvement, allowing family visitors to return. The first problem was that tourists could wander through Magaluf without being aware of the sea. Wide, paved pedestrian paths were built, making the sea visible from central parts of the town. The council has also built a sea-front promenade, lined with 450 fully-grown palm trees imported from Egypt. The roads have been narrowed to discourage traffic from coming into the town and the pavements have been widened. Large concrete balls have been fixed to the pavements to stop cars from parking there. There are fountains, an air-conditioned first-aid post on the beach and new litter bins everywhere. The project has cost Pta 1.4bn (Pounds 7.7m), paid for by the central government in Madrid, the Balearic islands administration and local taxes. Has it all worked? 'Has people's behaviour improved?' Pallicer asks. 'I have to be honest. Not as much as I hoped.' In the local bars, they are more sanguine. The Royal Plaza, formerly the Britannia, has matched the public expenditure with investments of its own, producing a plush pink interior. Paco Heredia, a barman there for 10 years, believes Magaluf is improving. 'But it will take time,' he says. The conservative-controlled Balearic islands government has acted to limit development on Majorca to ensure that it does not lose its remaining natural attractions. A law passed last year declared 31 per cent of the island protected zones, restricting the building of new tourist facilities. Gamero calls it 'the most protectionist law in Europe'. All of this is very interesting, says Miguel Angel March, but much of the damage has already been done. Angel is secretary of the Grupo de Ornitologia Balear (GOB), founded in 1973 to protect local bird life and now an organisation which campaigns on environmental issues of all sorts. As important as tourism is, he says, it is dangerous to depend on only one industry. Agriculture should not be dismissed out of hand, he argues, when the island has a summer market of more than 5m people. The GOB has a surprising supporter in Alfred Koch, recently retired director of Munich University's tourism institute and now a consultant. He too believes the island should find other ways of making a living, in addition to its main industry of tourism. Koch heads a team which will take Majorca's projects a step further. IFTO has asked the Munich team to interview tourists and local people to assess their views of the island's tourism and its effect on the environment. IFTO has been told that the EC is prepared to support Majorca's environment projects with a grant of Ecu450,000 (Pounds 320,000) although it has yet to receive written confirmation. IFTO plans to use the experience gained in Majorca to upgrade the tourist industry on the Greek island of Rhodes and in Ireland. Koch is impressed with what Majorca has done so far, but his long experience of the industry has instilled a certain caution when it comes to attracting higher-spending tourists to a resort and persuading more of them to come out of the high season. 'When I started in tourism 40 years ago,' he says, 'I was warned that I would work on these problems until I had moss on my back.'</p>

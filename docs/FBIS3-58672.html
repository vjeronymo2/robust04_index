			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The pressure groups now taking shape in  the opposition New Democracy (ND) are the subject of commentary  in the Greek press.    According to Bambis Papapanayiotis in the 25-26 December  center-left Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA, newly elected ND leader  Miltiadhis Evert is presently faced with "pressure groups"  within his party, each "pushing in a different direction."  Background maneuvering focuses on Evert's dilemma of either  practicing a low-key, constructive opposition vis-a-vis the  Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government, or following  a hardline policy that may lead to serious confrontation. At  this time, Papapanayiotis contends, Evert is trying to maintain  an "acrobatic" equilibrium between the two versions, and is  called upon to deal with:    -- Pressure from the group still faithful to former Prime  Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis--now in difficult straits  because of the wiretapping affair during his watch. The group  knows that the more conflicting the relationship with the  government, the more protection will be accorded to Mitsotakis  in case of legal entanglements, Papapanayiotis contends. Members  of this group include ND luminaries such as Sotiris Kouvelas,  Stefanos Manos, Vasilis Manginas, Dora Bakoyianni, Nikolaos  Gelestathis, and Y. Dhimitrokallis.    -- Pressure from the "modernizers," who are Evert's "natural  allies" but insist on an immediate break with the ND's  "Mitsotakian past" to regain the party's lost traditional  adherents. The group includes ND officials such as Yeoryios  Souflias, Stavros Dhimas, S. Khatzigakis, and Athanasios  Kanellopoulos, who, according to Papapanayiotis, "agonize" over  losing "precious" time in the modernization effort.    -- Pressure from the advocates of a liberal, free market  economy led by Andreas Andrianopoulos, who is requesting a  clarification of the party's ideology and political goals.    -- Finally, pressure from those "generally dissatisfied,"  such as Mikhail Papakonstandinou, recently stripped of party  attributes.    Within this "cacophony," Evert is attempting a balancing act  that aims at "hard criticism for governmental handling of  institutional matters or reprisals against ND members, but  low-key, constructive opposition with proposals in the  legislative field," Papapanayiotis concludes.    According to the 30 December left-of-center Athens daily TA  NEA, Evert has resolved to ignore ND hardliners demanding an  immediate confrontation with PASOK. He feels that his  consensual policy and creative proposals will "sooner or later"  be appreciated by the great majority of the electorate. His  conviction stems from the results of recent polls showing that  people are tired of "confrontation for the sake of  confrontation," TA NEA notes.</p>

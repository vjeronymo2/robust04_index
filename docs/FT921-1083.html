			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: The Liberal party in Scotland THE Liberal party in Scotland, which has re-emerged three years after most of it helped form the Liberal Democratic party, is fielding four candidates, Bethan Hutton writes. Two are standing in Conservative-Lib Dem marginals where a few hundred votes could be decisive. Mr David Senior is standing for the Scottish Liberals in Fife North East, where Mr Menzies Campbell faces Tory determination to win the seat back. In Edinburgh West, Mr Alan Fleming joins the fight as Lord James Douglas-Hamilton defends a Tory majority of 1,234. The Liberal Party in Scotland supports devolving power to the most appropriate level.</p>

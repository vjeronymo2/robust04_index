			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Ministers knew of arms 'front': Jordan used as conduit for UK military supplies to Iraq up to and possibly including three secretaries of state - almost certainly saw secret documents stating that Iraq had asked Jordan to 'front' for it on a large military shipment in the last days of the Iran-Iraq war. The documents, circulated to ministers in the Ministry of Defence, Department of Trade and Industry and Foreign Office, relate to spare parts for Chieftain armoured recovery vehicles made by Vickers of the UK. This first clear indication that ministers knew about and acquiesced in deals in which Jordan acted as a conduit for arms to Iraq came as Labour, in a separate development, put more pressure on the government over arms-related sales to Iraq. The opposition stepped up its efforts to challenge Mr John Major by releasing further documents and calling upon him to say how much he knew about the issue of export licences when he was foreign secretary. Ministers have consistently maintained that, before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, Britain acted in compliance with the guidelines drawn up in 1985 during the Iran-Iraq war. The documents bearing on Jordan relate to meetings of the Inter-Departmental Committee, a body of high-level MoD, DTI and Foreign Office officials set up to scrutinise export licence applications to Iraq and Iran. The summary of one meeting on August 11 1988 refers to 'the question of spares for the Chieftain armoured recovery vehicle for Iraq'. It continues: 'Iraq has asked Jordan to front for them.' The summary of a second meeting on October 19 1988 notes that the supply to Iraq of 'spare parts for armoured recovery vehicles' had been approved. It notes: 'These parts were linked to the Jordan deal but would be supplied direct to Iraq as they were automotive parts only, and not armour or lethal equipment.' What ties ministers to these documents is evidence submitted by senior Foreign Office officials to the trade and industry select committee's inquiry into the Iraqi 'supergun' affair in January 1992. A note supplied to the committee by Mr John Goulden, then a Foreign Office under-secretary, states that 'the minutes of each meeting of the Interdepartmental Committee were submitted with brief summaries of details of each case considered to FCO, MoD and DTI ministers for approval'. Questioned by an MP whether 'it could be any minister from the secretary of state downwards in those departments', Mr Patrick Nixon, then head of the Foreign Office's Middle East department, said: 'It could indeed.' Between August and October 1988, the secretaries of state for defence, trade and industry and foreign affairs were Sir George Younger, Lord Young and Lord Howe respectively. A list of products licensed for export to Iraq in 1988, also submitted to the committee, confirms that more than Pounds 900,000 worth of armoured vehicle spares were cleared for shipment. The end user was listed as the Iraqi armed forces. The use of Jordan as a conduit for UK military supplies to Iraq was 'an open secret' among defence experts. Mr John Wyatt, a bomb disposal specialist and a former official at International Military Services, the government-owned arms sales company, saw British-supplied munitions in Kuwait at the end of the Gulf war. He said: 'We had clear-cut evidence when I went in that ammunition, rockets, mines, and all the rest of it had been supplied by Britain to Jordan which had subsequently got into Iraqi hands.' He added: 'I'm sure in 1988 there was definite knowledge of movement backwards and forwards between Jordan and Iraq . . . because I think at that stage there was a certain amount of support for Iraq against Iran.'

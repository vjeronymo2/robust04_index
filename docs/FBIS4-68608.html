			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by B. Chibisov: "One Good Turn Deserves Another: </F> From a Selector Conference in the MPS"]    [Text] The railroad workers have always distinguished  themselves by stability in both work and payment of wages. On  some railroads, however, problems have recently arisen. They are  permitting delays in their payment. In February, in particular.  At the sector's plants --even in the first two months of the  year.    After all, as O. Moshchenko, RF first deputy minister of  Railways, emphasized yesterday at the selector conference  devoted to this problem, this is social protection of the  railroad workers, the creation of a normal psychological climate  in the collectives, material ensurance for transport workers,  fulfillment of the Tariff Agreement, etc.    At the preceding selector conference (at the beginning of  April), G. Fadeyev, minister of Railways discussed this problem  in detail. The reasons for the delays were analyzed: there was  an increase, at the end of last year, in the growth rate of  wages above the level specified by the Tariff Agreement -- over  400 billion rubles [R] was paid out for this alone; the roads  failed to carry out shipment of the advance financing limits of  the transit mainlines; the proceeds for the shipping roads were  not fully recovered as monetary sums. Underlying all this is the  large debt for transport. At that time, specific deadlines were  slated for settling with the collectives. For example, the wages  for February were to be issued by 25 April, and issued for the  normal payment periods in June.    What is the situation today? While by the beginning of  April,  the debt for February was 50 percent of the wage volume, today  the indicator equals 14 percent. This is on the whole for the  Russian network. The picture is different, however, for each  road. Most of the mainlines have fully cleared off the debts for  wages, but there is BAM [Baykal-Amur Main Line] which still has  to pay out 30 percent of them, the Transbaykal -- 16, the Far  Eastern -- 47, the West Siberian -- 25, and the Sakhalin -- up  to 97 percent.    The situation among the workers in the social sphere looks  somewhat better than among those in the production sphere,  although even here not everything is running smoothly. For  example, the workers of the sectorial medical institutions are  being paid wages only for March, and those employed in the  education system -- for February.    The state of affairs for the transport plants is  particularly  alarming. There are enterprises which have not yet even issued  their January wages. It will take R23 billion to clear off the  two-months debt. Even though the MPS [Ministry of Railways]  administration had a preliminary agreement with the roads that  they would settle with the plants, practically no steps have  been taken to liquidate the debt. It is a question, not of full  payment for the goods produced by the enterprises for railroad  orders, but of wage payments. The sums here are by no means  astronomical. For example, the Volga Railroad owes R400 million,  the North Caucasus -- only R30 million, and the October -- R140  million. Small amounts. The roads are holding back the  transfers, though, and the plants cannot pay the wages.    The main reason for this, of course, is the customers' debt.  The measures which the roads take to clear it off -- not letting  the customers have rolling stock, appeal to higher courts, jobs  according to contracts -- are so far not working in full  measure. The indebtedness continues to grow. In the two ten-day  periods of April, it increased by 16.2 percent, or by R116.3  billion. It is the mainlines where delay in wage payment is  observed that account for a considerable part of it.    What are the sources of getting funds for wages? As was  emphasized at the conference, various ways must be used to exact  money for transport. There are already positive examples in the  work of the mainlines. Let us say, the Kuybyshev Railroad  concluded a contract with BAM and the Transbaykal to receive  payments through supplies of motor vehicles. The Transbaykal and  BAM workers sell them, and the money earned is transferred to  wages. There are examples of settling with petroleum products  and timber materials, with their subsequent sale. At some  enterprises of the Southeastern, wages are paid in products and  other commodities.    In a word, every possibility must be utilized to get funds,  so that by June we can make the break-through to paying wages in  the normal periods of time.</p>

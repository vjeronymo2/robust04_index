			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Work-Study Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 675.2&blank;Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Low-Income Individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four commenters responded to the Secretary's proposal to define ``low-income individual'' for the purpose of community service under the FWS program. The commenters wanted either clarification or elimination of the definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter acknowledged that the Secretary had been asked to clarify the meaning of low-income clientele in reference to individuals served through a community service program; however, the commenter believed that the proposed language adds another layer of eligibility to FWS program administration. This commenter also believed that the proposed definition of ``low-income individual'' unduly encumbers the FWS community service concept and strongly suggested that a much more simplified approach be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter suggested that efforts to increase participation in community service activities through the FWS program might be hampered if institutions were required to verify the income levels of clientele served by various community organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary has taken these comments under consideration and has determined that at this time there is no need to burden institutions with a formal definition of ``low-income individual'' for purposes of providing community service under the FWS program. There is no requirement under the statute that a particular number or proportion of the individuals must be low-income persons. However, the Secretary reminds institutions of the statutory emphasis placed on the human, educational, environmental, and public safety needs of low-income individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary has deleted this definition from the final regulations for the FWS program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Community Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requested that more clarity be provided on whether the service has to be ``direct'' under the community service component of the FWS program. Several commenters were concerned that the Secretary's interpretation of the meaning of providing community service as being ``hands-on'' or ``direct contact'' will do a great disservice to student workers by eliminating many behind-the-scene jobs. In general, commenters believed that a successful community services agency requires all types of jobs to operate efficiently and that clerical jobs serve an important function in any organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary did not propose in the NPRM a change to the definition of ``community services.'' The Secretary reminds the commenters that the current definition of ``community services'' in &sect;675.2 does not require that the service provided by the FWS student must be ``direct'' to be considered community service. The job duties must include providing services that are designed to improve the quality of life for community residents or solve particular problems related to their needs. In determining whether the service is community service, the institution must always consider whether the service provided by the FWS student primarily benefits the community as opposed to the agency or institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary at this time is leaving flexibility to the institutions in determining what jobs provide service to the community. This approach is adopted to minimize the burden on institutions in administering the community service component of the FWS program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary encourages institutions to develop jobs that instill a sense of social responsibility in the students and touch the lives of community residents in a meaningful and lasting way. The Secretary believes that the best way to provide ``community services'' is for the students' jobs to put them in ``direct'' contact where possible with the recipients of the services or involve some type of ``hands on'' service in the community. However, the Secretary does not intend to indicate that certain activities are more important than others or that only jobs that have ``direct'' contact with community members are acceptable. For example, an FWS student working for a ``meals on wheels'' program for the elderly may prepare those meals without any ``direct'' contact with the community recipients, yet the service is very important in meeting the needs of the elderly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Pakistani bank suspends officials Pakistan's central bank, the State Bank, suspended nine officials at the weekend over a two-monthscandal involving a small private bank, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad. None of the officials was named. Mehran Bank, one of Pakistan's nine private banks, remains at the centre of the dispute after Mr Yunus Habib, its chief executive, was arrested on charges of defrauding the bank of over Dollars 36m. Federal agents are investigating allegations that Mr Habib failed to deposit money which the bank had earned through the sale of bearer certificates - a form of term deposit certificate denominated in US dollars. Some bankers fear the revelations will undermine confidence in the newly liberalised private sector, and may delay further privatisations.</p>

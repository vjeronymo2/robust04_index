			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 'BEAUTIES' SHOWS FACE OF BOMBINGS;  </P> <P> NEW PLAY IS ABOUT 25 HIROSHIMA WOMEN WHO WERE DISFIGURED BY NUCLEAR WARFARE AND  CAME TO THE UNITED STATES FOR TREATMENT.  </P> <P> America's ultimate act of warfare -- the dropping of the atomic bombs on  Hiroshima and Nagasaki 45 years ago -- sets the stage for Dan Seymour's "A-Bomb  Beauties," making its premiere this weekend at the Burbage Theatre.  </P> <P> "Beauties" is based on the true story of the Hiroshima Maidens, 25 Japanese  women, disfigured by the bomb, who were brought to America in 1955 by a group  of philanthropists to undergo reconstructive surgery.  </P> <P> "What struck me about the story was its incredible irony," said Seymour, the  New York playwright who's in town for the opening. "Doing something like that  -- it's really a good and a bad thing. Yes, the girls were definitely helped in  terms of getting the use of the hands and arms back. But it was also a way of  surface-erasing the effects of the bomb, making it all better. They brought 25  'maidens' here and made their faces pretty. I'm not criticizing the doctors.  After the fact, what can you do?"  </P> <P> What angers him isn't only the Band-Aid approach to such monumental physical  and psychic pain but that it tends to obscure the true devastation of nuclear  war.  </P> <P> "Right after the bomb, a commission had gone in and conducted a scientific  study," he said dryly. "In no way did they try to fix any of the damage. . . .  I've tried to steer away from questioning whether or not we should've dropped  the bomb. To me, that's a moot point. What's important is what happened after  the bomb was dropped. Look at us now. Nuclear proliferation is on top of us. We  don't look back at the people of Hiroshima, the horror of that day."  </P> <P> In real life, then-Saturday Review Editor Norman Cousins was among those  leading the effort to bring the women here. Seymour, however, has fictionalized  his nine characters. Philanthropist Elliott Ryder is a composite of all the  Americans who were involved; the Asian chaperones are represented by Father  Tanaka, a Japanese-Catholic priest. "They're the two leading characters," said  the writer, 33. "The focus of the play is the conflict between the American and  the Japanese."  </P> <P> And the traditionally obedient "maidens" take a back seat to that power play.  </P> <P> "The women are still victims, and these two men are the ones who make all the  decisions for them," Seymour said. "I didn't write archetypes, but essentially,  it's how victims of any war are ruled. The women have no control. It's also a  question of looking at the big picture -- Japanese and American relations --  but not the small picture: 'What's good for these women?' I think that typifies  what America has done since, this big benevolent despot that makes assumptions  for other people, who's always better than everybody else."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The playwright knows that attitude isn't going to win him any popularity  contests.  </P> <P> "It upsets some people because I'm not writing about America as a hero," he  said with a shrug. "I get comments from a lot of people my parents' age, and  some of them still have an abiding hatred of the Japanese. They come up to me  after readings and say, 'What about Pearl Harbor?' Well, what about Pearl  Harbor? It was a military installation. Hiroshima: They killed 100,000. Come  on! To me, there's no comparison. Still, I am pleased when people come out of  the theater upset. At least they're talking about it; they're not complacent."  </P> <P> Shigeko Sasamori is still talking about it too. One of the famous maidens,  Sasamori has spent much of the past 35 years being interviewed about her  experiences; last May, she returned to Japan to supervise a television  docudrama on her life.  </P> <P> "The actress who was doing my part said, 'You must be very strong.' I told her,  'I don't think I'm strong or weak. I just lived my life.' " When she came here  at age 20, Sasamori had already undergone several plastic surgeries in Japan;  she cannot now recall her feelings about being selected: "I know I wasn't  jumping for joy." As for her feelings about this play, "It's not my story," the  Los Angeles resident said firmly. "I don't know what they have written."  </P> <P> Seymour quickly agrees that his vantage point has not been that of an insider.  </P> <P> "I would never begin to talk for these women," said the writer, who has  dramatized the women's facial scars by costuming them in veils. "What I'm  trying to capture is what America was like in 1955, how we looked at the world  around us, how we looked at Japan. We took these 25 girls; we were very  patronizing, very superior. . . . And yet the characters all believe in what  they're doing. They're making mistakes, but they're trying to be good men."  </P> <P> Offstage, the writer knows a thing or two about philanthropy. Growing up on the  move (the son of an oft-transferred employee at Ralston-Purina), he went to New  York to be an actor. "I didn't handle the acting business well," Seymour said  lightly. "But now I have a real job." As director of the Mental Illness  Foundation, "We raise money for schizophrenia research, community housing,  halfway houses for the homeless. I ask people for money, then give it away. I  like that part."  </P> <P> "A-Bomb Beauties"  </P> <P> Burbage Theater, 2330 Sawtelle Blvd., West Los Angeles, (213) 478-0898.  </P> <P> 8 p.m. Thursday through Saturday, 7 p.m. Sundays, through Sept. 16.  </P> <P> Price: $15, $12 for students and seniors.  </P></p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Political worries leave Milan at 12-month low Most bourses were unsettled by weakness in bond markets, and the pattern was extended in the afternoon as US treasuries opened lower, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN had its own preoccupations. It fell 2.6 per cent to a 12 month low after comments by Mr Roberto Maroni, the interior minister and a member of the Northern League, were viewed as a premature political obituary for Mr Silvio Berlusconi's coalition government. The Comit index, which lost 4.7 per cent last week, fell another 15.33 to 586.19 after Mr Maroni was quoted as saying that the government could be replaced by a different coalition after next month's review. Against the trend, Credito Italiano gained L13 to L1,548, after a high of L1,595, amid renewed speculation that Cariplo was about to launch a counter bid for Credito Romagnolo. Italiano announced the full terms of its L2,780bn offer for Rolo over the weekend and analysts noted yesterday that if the deal fell through, it would be left with a significant amount of cash. Rolo was L204 lower at L17,329. Telecommunications stocks were markedly weaker on fresh worries that mobile telephone concessions could be costly. Telecom Italia fell L200 or 5.3 per cent to L3,580 and Stet was L222 or 5.0 per cent lower at L4,215. FRANKFURT waited for New York. On the session, the Dax index fell just 3.51 to 2,024.82; but after hours the bourse saw an opening drop in US long bonds, weakness in bund and equity features and an Ibis-indicated Dax below 2,000, at a low for the day of 1,998.20 before it closed a percentage point down at 2,003.64. Turnover rose from DM3.8bn to DM4.1bn. Friday's weakness in carmakers continued during the session, and was extended after hours: BMW ended the afternoon down DM15.50 at DM723.50, Daimler DM22 lower at DM714 and Volkswagen DM9.40 off at DM400.60. Apart from generalised institutional investment caution about cyclicals, and the sector in particular, there were specific fears about VW, which slid to new 1994 lows on a Spanish news report that its lossmaking Spanish subsidiary, Seat, will not achieve breakeven before 1997. Nomura estimates - that the company is trading on prospective p/e ratios of below 8 for 1995, and under 5 for 1996 - fell on stony ground. However, the chemicals and metals group, Degussa, did well ahead of today's provisional results for the year to September 30. The shares rose DM3.50 to DM427.50 on analysts' estimates of a 50 per cent increase in 1993-94 earnings. PARIS bond markets were unnerved in the morning by the decision by Mr Jacques Delors to drop out of the French presidential race, and weakened further by the fall in US bonds in the European afternoon. The weakness of the bond market hit equities, as elsewhere in Europe, and was a major factor behind the 17.67 decline in the CAC 40 index to 1,919.32 in thin turnover of FFr2.74bn. In the circumstances, the news that Assurances Generales de France (AGF) was to be privatised early next year hit shares of the latter, which fell FFr6.30 to FFr224. Among other losers, Moulinex fell FFr5.70, or 5.4 per cent to FFr100.20 ahead of the appliance company's first half results tomorrow. However, Alcatel Alsthom rose FFr4.90 to FFr461.10 in advance of a board meeting next week. ZURICH was lower in thin volume with early gains being given up as the dollar tended easier. The SMI index fell 13.2 to 2,562.8. UBS bearers fell SFr26 to SFr1,084, with the bank said to be among the main sellers, as local press reports said that exceptionally heavy trading in the registered shares in October had raised fresh questions about how UBS won shareholder support for its unitary share plan. However, the bank rejected any suggestion that it acted incorrectly. The registered shares slipped SFr6 to SFr244 but were still trading at a 12.5 per cent premium to the bearers. Among second tier stocks, Interdiscount picked up SFr50 to SFr1,490 after last week's fall. Ems Chemie dipped SFr90 to SKr3,770 and Sarna was SFr75 lower at SFr1,445. OSLO saw profit-taking by short-term international investors after the gains of the previous fortnight and the all-share index closed 5.49 down at 625.39 in turnover of NKr380m, about half the level of recent sessions. Analysts commented that domestic institutions were holding back some liquidity in the hope of lower prices and were expected to begin buying before the index reached 610. After the close of trading, the bourse announced the dismissal of its director for unspecified irregularities which, it said, had nothing to do with securities trading. However, brokers feared that the dismissal might have a negative impact on international confidence. WARSAW bounced after last week's steep decline, the Wig index recovering 430.3, or 6.2 per cent to 7,391.9 with turnover 20 per cent higher at 746.9bn zlotys. Brokers said that 6,900 had proved to be a strong support level.

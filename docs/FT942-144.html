			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Time to act Sir, Thank heaven for Alastair Ross Goobey and his colleagues at PosTel ('PosTel vote threatens top company directors', June 27). It is high time that all institutions tackled the scandal of executive pay and perks. Reasoned arguments are ignored; only massive votes at AGMs will serve. If more institutions follow the PosTel lead they will deserve the full support of private shareholders who are otherwise easily ignored. I suggest that any such should solicit proxies to drive home the point that executives can no longer decide their own terms and conditions without accountability to the owners at large.

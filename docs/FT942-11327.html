			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / World Trade News: China looks beyond MFN horizon - Beijing sets sights on Gatt accession China, signalling confidence that the US will renew its Most Favoured Nation trading status, yesterday urged Washington to speed up negotiations on Beijing's bid to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Long Yongtu, Beijing's chief Gatt negotiator, said in an interview that the US should follow the European Union and adopt a 'practical and realistic' approach to China's accession to the world trade body. China and the US are due to resume bilateral talks on the Gatt issue in Washington early next month, just after the deadline for President Bill Clinton's decision on whether to renew China's preferential trade access to the US market. Beijing and Washington have been at loggerheads for months over the Clinton administration's demand that China improve its behaviour on human rights to secure MFN renewal. But this week, President Clinton softened the US line, saying that withdrawing MFN status would harm both China and the US. Mr Long's call for a new push on China's Gatt accession shows Beijing is looking beyond the MFN decision to the far-reaching question of China's formal reintegration into the world economy. China is anxious to be a founder member of the new World Trade Organisation, to be formed out of Gatt, when the Uruguay Round agreement comes into force next year. The Chinese official praised the EU for what he called its constructive approach to China's Gatt application, explicitly contrasting European and American attitudes. He said a draft protocol for Chinese membership presented when Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, visited Beijing in February contained 'many positive elements'. The protocol includes provision for a transitional phase after China re-enters Gatt, safeguards against sudden surges of Chinese imports, and arrangements for a regular review of Chinese compliance with the trade body's rules. Mr Long, a vice-minister in the foreign trade ministry, said China was prepared to negotiate a transitional period - to the end of the century - during which it would remove most non-tariff barriers, align its technical standards with international norms and make its currency, the renminbi, fully convertible. He added, however, that there should be no need for further special reviews of China's performance after the end of the transitional period. On safeguards, Beijing reserved the right to retaliate against attempts to 'single out' China for trade penalties, by withdrawing some of its concessions on market access. Further negotiations with the EU on these issues are due later this month, before the next meeting of Gatt's China working party in Geneva towards the end of June. Mr Long stressed that China's attempt to rejoin Gatt was 'part and parcel' of its economic reforms, but that there was a limit to concessions China was prepared to make. 'Western negotiators should understand that China's transition from a planned economy is a great experiment,' he said. 'If you ask for things to be done immediately, we have to say No. We're not looking for Gatt entry at any price - at the cost of social stability, or of throwing a lot of workers out of jobs. 'If the US can also find the practical, realistic approach adopted by the EU, we can make progress.' During the eight years of negotiations on China's Gatt membership, the US has generally taken the lead. But recently, with US policy-makers preoccupied by the MFN issue, the Europeans have assumed a higher profile. Last year, the US notched up a record Dollars 22.8bn bilateral trade deficit with China, while the EU's deficit with China fell from Dollars 12bn to Dollars 10bn. Mr Long acknowledged that the Gatt negotiations had been overshadowed by the MFN dispute, but expressed hope that the two issues could soon be separated. 'Trade is trade, and politics is politics,' he said. He said it was in the world's interests as well as Beijing's to ensure that China joined the World Trade Organisation at its inception. The WTO, he said, would be 'incomplete' without a country containing one fifth of the world's population and its 11th largest trading nation. 'We are trying to get into Gatt not because we see immediate economic benefits but because we want to make our economic system compatible with the world trade regime, so that foreign businesses have more confidence in our economy,' he stressed. 'If we really wanted to damage the world trading order, why would we bother trying to get into Gatt? It will put a straitjacket on us.' A European diplomat in Beijing agreed the EU had won points with Beijing by coming forward with its own Gatt proposals. There was no fundamental difference between Brussels and Washington on market access, transparency of import rules, and intellectual property rights. 'We are competitors, but we all have the same interest: breaking open the Chinese market,' he said.</p>

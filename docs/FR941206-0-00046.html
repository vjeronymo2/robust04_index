			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Colorado's proposed Rules 3.02.2(4)(b) and (d) are more specific than the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.15(c) in that the proposed rules provide (1) procedures governing decisions on bond adjustments and (2) more precise examples of what constitutes a basis for a reduction in bond amount. This specificity of the proposed rules is consistent with the counterpart Federal regulations. In all other respects, the requirements of Colorado's proposed rules are substantively identical to the Federal regulations. Therefore, the Director finds that proposed Rules 3.02.2(4)(b) and (d) are no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.15(c) and approves them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Rules 3.02.3(2)(a), (b), and (c), and 4.15.10(2) and (3), Bond Liability Period and Revegetation Success Standards for Land With an Approved Industrial, Commercial, or Residential Postmining Land Use <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> a. Rules 3.02.3(2)(a), (b), and (c), Bond Liability Period <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Colorado proposed new Rule 3.02.3(2)(c) to require, for areas where the approved postmining land use is industrial, commercial, or residential, that the minimum period of liability shall continue until compliance with the revegetation requirement of proposed Rule 4.15.10(2) or the alternative requirement of proposed Rule 4.15.10(3) is demonstrated. Colorado proposed to revise existing Rules 3.02.3(2)(a) and (b), which require that the basis of a minimum 5 or 10-year bond liability period, to reference the proposed exception at Rule 3.02.3(2)(c). Colorado's referenced proposed rules 4.15.10(2) and 4.15.10(3), respectively, (1) require that erosion be controlled by living ground cover within 2 years of regrading or within 2 years of the designation of the land use, whichever is later, and (2) provide for a limited exception for certain mine support facilities, where living ground cover is not necessary to control erosion. (See finding No. 6.b below for a discussion of proposed Rules 4.15.10(2) and (3)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, Colorado's proposed rules 3.02.3(2)(a), (b), and (c), as explained by Colorado in its ``Statement of Basis, Specific Statutory Authority, and Purpose,'' effectively exempt areas to be developed for industrial, commercial, or residential land uses from the requirement that the success of revegetation be judged on the basis of a minimum 5 or 10-year responsibility period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(c)(2) and (3) and 817.116(c)(2) and (3) provide for the same 5 or 10-year liability periods as do Colorado's Rules 3.02.3(2)(a) and (b). And, for areas to be developed for industrial, commercial, or residential use within 2 years after regrading is completed, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(4) and 817.116(b)(4) require, as the revegetation success standard, vegetative ground cover sufficient to control erosion within 2 years after regrading is completed. This same requirement is included in Colorado's proposed Rule 4.15.10(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM's 1979 and 1983 preambles to the Federal regulations address issues pertinent to Colorado's proposed Rules 3.02.3(2)(a), (b), and (c), which concern release of liability on areas with an approved industrial, commercial, or residential postmining land use upon demonstration of the revegetation success standard for the land use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM explained in the preamble to the 1979 Federal regulations at 30 CFR 807.12(d), concerning criteria for bond release, that, unlike other performance standards, the performance standards at 30 CFR 816.116 and 817.116 for revegetation contain a special exception for industrial, commercial, or residential postmining land use plans approved by the regulatory authority. OSM explained that the exception allows permittees to meet a less stringent revegetation test for reclaimed areas that will be developed for industrial, commercial, or residential use within 2 years following completion of regrading. OSM also stated that, if an approved industrial, commercial, or residential land use is not implemented within 2 years, it becomes necessary to comply with the full-scale general revegetation success standards at 30 CFR 816.116 and 817.116 (44 FR 14902, 15122, March 13, 1979). In other words, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(4) and 817.116(b)(4), on lands developed within 2 years after regrading for industrial, commercial, or residential use, function as a limited exception to the full revegetation requirements of 30 CFR 816.116 and 817.116, which include the requirement at 30 CFR 816.116(c)(2) and (3) and 817.116(c)(2) and (3) for a minimum 5 or 10-year liability period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

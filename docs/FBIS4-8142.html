			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Kolev, deputy chairman of the </F> Interdepartmental Council on Issues of the Military-Industrial  Complex and Mobilization Readiness, by Ventsislav Todorov; place  and date not given: "We Are Encountering Difficulties in  Restoring Lost Positions"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Todorov] Recently the  cabinet issued a decree on regulating control over foreign trade  activity with military and specialized production. Does it mean  that prior to this state control was not efficient?    [Kolev] No, after 10 November 1989 Bulgaria firmly declared  that it would observe the international norms related to the  export of arms. Then we issued a document that regulated the  manner and means of trading in arms. We worked on the basis of  that document until the decree was adopted. The decree is  stricter toward the exporters in anything related to the  information that they must provide. I would like to stress that  the Interdepartmental Council firmly, steadily, and  uncompromisingly controls arms exports. In many cases we refuse  the exports because we are concerned that Bulgaria should not be  drawn by any means into international scandals regarding the  arms trade.    [Todorov] It has been claimed that in recent years we have  lost 80 percent of our arms markets -- is this the real picture  and what could be changed?    [Kolev] This figure is probably related to the collapse of  the agreements with the former Warsaw Pact countries. Our  exports were predominantly directed toward those countries. In  comparison with the top year -- 1988 -- our exports have  decreased eight times. I do not want to cite precise figures.  However, at the same time I very much hope that in 1994  Bulgaria will export twice as much as in 1993. While we are  encountering difficulties in regaining our positions, we are  nevertheless slowly and painfully regaining them in our  traditional markets. Our arms and goods are of high quality and  they are being sought. However, I must point out that arms  markets throughout the world have shrunk. We can hardly compete  with such giants as Russia, the United States, China, or even  Switzerland and Sweden. However, we have our place and are  doing everything possible to regain our positions. The main  thing is how to come up with new systems and new items. It is  high time that those who are concerned about Bulgaria began  speaking about investment, innovation, creating new production,  and purchasing licenses, and not rally slogans and cliches. In  1945 Japan was restored from ashes because it purchased licenses  on a massive scale. [passage omitted]    [Todorov] Recently at the National Assembly Economic  Commission Andrey Lukanov, National Assembly member, said that  our middleman companies have taken advantage of Bulgarian  obligations to the former CEMA. The Teraton Company and the sum  of 230 million leva were mentioned. Do you consider such deals  normal and do they help our military-industrial complex?    [Kolev] I sincerely regret that I cannot answer this  question in a profound manner, because it has not been reviewed  by the Interdepartmental Council, and I do not have the  necessary documents. I am vaguely aware of the problem from  what I read in the press, and thus I cannot commit myself to a  professional answer. I could say one thing -- the trade  companies must work in a manner that will bring revenue to the  state.    [Todorov] There are four state companies, which have been  allowed to conduct arms business -- Kintex, Armymex, Teraton,  and Element Engineering. Have additional companies, including  private ones, shown any interest?    [Kolev] Now a barrier rightly exists -- the arms trade must  be implemented only by state trade companies. Probably the  moment will come when, under certain conditions and criteria,  private businessmen will be allowed to trade with such  production, if they can prove to the state that they have the  possibilities of doing this. The arms trade is a complicated  process. It is not regular trade. It require specialized  knowledge and training. The people who work in these  organizations must have experience. There is a risk involved in  allowing private companies to trade in arms without having any  guarantees that we would not be drawn into a new international  scandal. [passage omitted]    [Todorov] Are you optimistic over the possibility of the  Bulgarian military industry restoring the stability and market  scope of 1988?    [Kolev] I am a realist. It will be incredibly difficult,  but restoring those dimensions and even expanding them can  become possible only when we change the range of our  merchandise. Arms production as a generalized concept is an  agent of technical progress. Its top achievements were  incorporated in space vehicles. Inventors in the United States  and Russia were slow and rather jealous in conveying their  achievements to civilian production. Even now the top  technologies in the United States, Russia, France, and the world  technical and technological centers are utilized first of all by  the military industrial complexes. Therefore, we must be  realists in assessing our possibilities and place.    [Todorov] Thank you for this interview.</p>

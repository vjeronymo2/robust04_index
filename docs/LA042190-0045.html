			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEMINARY ENROLLMENT INCREASES 5.1%  </P> <P> Enrollment in the 203 seminaries belonging to the Assn. of Theological Schools  in the United States and Canada increased 5.1% at the beginning of the 1989-90  school year, including gains by blacks, Latinos, Pacific/Asians and women.  </P> <P> However, while total enrollment was up, the percentage of full-time students  continued to drop, reflecting a trend characteristic of seminary attendance  during the 1980s.  </P> <P> "The sharp increase this year may well reflect the success of school efforts to  serve a broader constituency with a variety of graduate-level programs," Father  William Baumgaertner, associate director of the association, said in releasing  the report.  </P> <P> According to the report, the opening fall 1989 enrollment in schools belonging  to the Vandalia, Ohio-based association totaled 56,082 compared to 55,405 a  year earlier.  </P></p>

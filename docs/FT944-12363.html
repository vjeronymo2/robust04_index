			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Joint venture group aims to be investment catalyst How to get hard-headed businessmen to find and invest in profitable private sector projects in the Middle East has been one of the greatest challenges at the Casablanca Summit. One small non-profit organisation is showing the way with big results. The US-backed Builders for Peace seeks to match American with Palestinian companies to invest in private businesses underwritten by the US government in Palestinian controlled areas. Since it was established by US Vice President Al Gore last year the group, composed of American business leaders of Arab and Jewish origin, has facilitated the development of nine joint venture businesses worth more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m) of capital investment. The projects, in hotel construction, housing, food processing, light manufacturing, crude oil processing and bottled water production, are expected to generate Dollars 168m in annual operating revenues and create 5,000 jobs. Eight more projects are in the design phase following a mission to five US cities by Palestinian businessmen sponsored by Builders for Peace. Mr Mel Levine, a lawyer and former US congressman, said Builders for Peace recognises the importance of private enterprise as the basis of economic growth in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. The group wants to provide a 'jump start' for the economy and help alleviate unemployment. 'We are not interested in politics. We are interested in business opportunities which are designed to make a profit undertaken by people who are determined to take a risk,' he said. Builders for Peace works closely with two US agencies - the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Trade Development Agency. The US government has allocated Dollars 125m over five years to Opic to grant political risk insurance, loan guarantees and small loans to US companies doing business in Palestinian self-rule areas. Five of the nine projects developed by Builders for Peace have received Opic assistance, giving what Mr Levine said was 'significant and tangible risk reduction'. The TDA helps joint ventures with the preparation and evaluation of feasibility studies. One of the nine projects under way is the construction of Gaza's first fully serviced business hotel. The Dollars 70m hotel is being build by GRdG, a US company, and will be managed by Marriott which may also take an equity share in the project. Mr Riad Karam, a director of GRdG, said Builders for Peace had been critical to getting the project off the ground. 'They gave us a big boost, helping with access to the US government and to Opic,' he said. 'This hotel is going to serve as a measuring stick for successful investment as major US companies start to get involved for the first time in the Palestinian economy.' Builders for Peace, backed by official risk insurance from Opic, provides a role model for wider private sector investment in the Middle East and answers a lot of questions raised by businessmen at Casablanca. Many businessmen have voiced scepticism about the creation of new regional financial institutions such as a Middle East development bank. Instead the private sector has demanded financing mechanisms such as risk insurance, project finance, export credits and the development of better business links between western and Middle Eastern businessmen.</p>

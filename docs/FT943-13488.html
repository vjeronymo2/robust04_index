			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries post gains but activity restrained US Treasury bonds posted moderate gains yesterday as the market followed through on a two-session rally at the end of last week. Late in the day, the 30-year government bond was  7/16 better at 85 1/4 , with the yield slipping to 7.50 per cent, and the two-year note was up  3/32 at 100 1/32 , yielding 5.963 per cent. There was no economic news to dampen or reinforce the upbeat mood established last week. Prices for gold and other commodities held steady, and the dollar showed solid gains against the yen and D-Mark. However, activity was restrained and bonds were unable to break out of their tight trading ranges during the morning. Later, the gains were extended but this was exaggerated by thin activity. Traders were delaying new commitments until after tomorrow's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan. In his semi-annual briefing to the Senate on the state of the economy, the Fed chief is expected to signal whether the tightening of monetary policy has succeeded in slowing growth without short-circuiting the recovery. Technical factors, however, were partly offsetting a sanguine view of the fundamentals. The heavy influx of securities in the coming weeks was already having an influence. Tomorrow, the Treasury will announce details of its regular two-year and five-year note auctions. In early August, the government's quarterly refunding operation will bring billions of dollars in new three-year, 10-year and 30-year bonds into the market, only days before the next meeting of the Fed's policy-making arm. After a soft start, most European bond markets ended higher, supported towards the close by stronger US Treasuries and late short-covering in the futures markets. Italy was the only exception, with mounting political tensions weighing heavily on bonds and the currency. Traders said many investors remained sidelined ahead of impending supply in Germany and the UK, this week's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony by the US Federal Reserve chairman and the Bundesbank Council meeting on Thursday. Italian bonds opened sharply lower on the deepening political turmoil over Prime Minister Mr Silvio Berlusconi's recent decree barring preventive detention in corruption investigations. In an effort to control price fluctuations, Italy's clearing house made a selective call for intra-day margin payments, while the London Clearing House made an intra-day margin call on the Liffe's Eurolira futures contract. The September bond future was supported by technical support around 102 and recouped some of its early losses on late short-covering. However, political uncertainty, in addition to this week's release of the government's medium-term fiscal package, are likely to make for continued volatility. German government bonds rose nearly  1/2 point, undaunted by the prospect of this week's 10-year bund issue. The first portion of the bonds will be placed today by the federal bond consortium, with the second tranche to be auctioned tomorrow. It is the first bund issue since the central bank cancelled two issues due to lack of demand. 'The bund auction will be crucial,' said Mr Adrian James, European bond strategist at NatWest Markets in London. He expects it to go 'reasonably well', supported by increased demand for long-dated paper by investors shifting funds from the short end to the longer end of the yield curve. Bunds were boosted by talk that June M3 money supply numbers, due to be released this week, may show a significant decline and by the Bundesbank's announcement that its council meeting would be followed by a press conference. This fuelled hopes that the German central bank might cut official interest rates on Thursday. French bonds rose sharply, catching up with last week's gains in neighbouring markets when France was closed for a national holiday. The September notional bond futures contract on Matif rose 0.88 points to 117.16. UK gilts were pulled up by the stronger continental markets, with the September long gilt future gaining  11/32 to 103 27/32. 'After their recent rise, gilts are in consolidation mode, but on a robust base,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson of Midland Global Markets. The Bank of England today is to announce the terms of next week's auction of conventional gilts in the 2007 to 2011 maturity range. Most market participants expect the auction to meet healthy demand from UK institutions with a natural demand for long-dated assets like life insurance companies and pension funds.</p>

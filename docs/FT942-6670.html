			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Where you should look The choice of investment trusts specialising in UK equity income is much smaller than that of unit trusts. They are to be found in two sectors: income growth, and high income. Income growth trusts, which aim to provide a yield 10 to 50 per cent above the FT-SE-A All Share index as well as capital growth, have been around for a long time but the high-income sector is a more recent development. Very few high-income trusts have a five-year record. The best-performing income growth trust over both three and five years is Value &amp; Income, which used to be the Stewart Enterprise investment trust before it was taken over by Olim in August 1986. V&amp;I's consistently high performance is the result of an investment strategy untypical of the sector: up to half its portfolio consists of direct holdings of commercial property, mainly small shops in Scotland. 'A typical property for us would be Woolworths in Campbeltown,' says manager Matthew Oakeshott. Perhaps surprisingly, the fund made a profit on commercial property all the way through the recession. The remainder of the fund is in high-yielding equities. Murray Income's portfolio is probably more typical of income growth funds. About 80 per cent is invested in the UK with the largest proportion in top 100 stocks, backed up by medium-sized companies. After weathering the recession by monitoring companies very closely for indications of dividend cuts, manager Susan Boyd is now dropping her defensive stance and moving into manufacturing stocks such as engineering, chemicals and building materials. A serious drawback for investors is that heavy demand for high-yielding trusts means almost all the UK income growth investment trusts are at premiums of 2 to 9 per cent. This leaves holders open to losses if premiums dwindle or disappear. Nigel Sidebottom, an investment trust specialist at stockbroker Gerrard Vivian Gray, says he would be happy buying several of the trusts in this sector at around net asset value, as they are unlikely to fall much below that level, but he would not buy them at their present premiums. As an alternative he would look at other sectors, such as international general, where yields were slightly lower. But many trusts are trading at discounts of around 10 per cent, thus boosting the effective yield of the underlying assets.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- UK INCOME GROWTH INVESTMENT TRUSTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                            3 years      5 years     10 years                            net inc      net inc      net inc                           (no inc)     (no inc)     (no inc) Trust name                  Pounds       Pounds       Pounds   Yield %  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Dunedin Inc Growth       150 (132)    190 (153)    480 (328)      5.41 Investors Capital        139 (124)    163 (130)    427 (290)      5.54 Lowland                  168 (150)    202 (166)    639 (459)      4.15 Merchants                149 (130)    186 (149)    494 (333)      6.12 Murray Income            162 (149)    198 (168)    498 (351)      4.57 Temple Bar               161 (140)    179 (143)    582 (385)      5.48 TR City of London        149 (133)    207 (168)    655 (439)      4.63 Value &amp; Income           205 (180)    230 (182)          n/a      4.92  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Micropal.

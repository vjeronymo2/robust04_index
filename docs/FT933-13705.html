			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Late buying boosts struggling FTSE A LATE flurry of buying interest, prompted by a burst of takeover speculation in the composite insurance arena, enabled the UK equity market to limp into positive territory at the end of a dismal week and trading account. The FT-SE 100 share index closed 1.3 higher at 2,833.0, reducing the decline on the week to 10.2. Over the two-week trading account the index fell 24.7. The FT-SE Mid 250 index remained under pressure however, closing 8.0 lower at 3,217.5, extending the fall on the week to 19.3. The market lacked enthusiasm ahead of the start of trading on Monday morning of BT partly-paid shares. Dealings in BT3 will commence at 7.30am on Monday, a full hour before the rest of the market, to ensure smooth trading. Dealers said they expected BT3 shares to get off to a reasonably good start, which should put more heart back into the stock market after its recent poor showing. Since the start of the month the FT-SE has fallen from the 2,900-level, despite a run of highly encouraging economic data. Mr Ian Harnett, equity market strategist at Strauss Turnbull, the French-owned securities house, said this week 'has seen the best week of economic news since 1987-88'. The news included a strong rise in manufacturing output, a further fall in unemployment and the lowest headline inflation rate for thirty years. Gilts, unlike equities, slipped back after a firmer opening, with sentiment slightly upset by news of the next gilts auction and a small decline in sterling. By the close the long-dated issues were around 1/16 lower on balance. The equity market fell back at the outset, dragged down by renewed weakness in the drug stocks which were hit by a series of profits downgrades instigated by Smith Barney on Wall Street overnight. Oil shares were looking vulnerable as more analysts were said to be moving to lower their oil price forecasts and earnings estimates for the big oil companies. At its worst the FT-SE was down 9.3 within the first hour of trading yesterday. Thereafter, the leading stocks embarked on a painfully slow rally which left the FT-SE index marginally higher on the day. Turnover remained surprisingly high with the non-FT-SE comprising 57 per cent of the day's total of 628m shares traded. The value of customer business on Thursday was a healthy Pounds 1.44bn.</p>

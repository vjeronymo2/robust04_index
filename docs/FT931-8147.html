			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / International Company News: JVC plans German closure to stem losses VICTOR Company of Japan (JVC), the consumer electronics group which specialises in video equipment, is planning to close one of its manufacturing plants in Germany to stem mounting losses. The move would be one of the most radical yet taken by one of Japan's electronics groups to cut costs in the face of a prolonged slump in demand. It is almost unheard of for a Japanese group to close a production plant and lay off workers, even abroad. The move suggests more Japanese companies may start to retrench from overseas operations established in the 1980s when funds for investment were cheap in Japan. JVC said a videocassette manufacturing plant in Germany would dismiss all its local employees, while a holding company in the Netherlands would be absorbed by another German subsidiary. The closures and the planned sale to a related company of some office buildings in Tokyo, should compensate for the loss JVC expects for the year to end-March. It would be JVC's second deficit after a pre-tax loss of Y2.3bn last year, the first loss for four decades. In October JVC reported a first-half Y13.5bn parent company per-tax loss.</p>

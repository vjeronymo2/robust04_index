			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Lloyd's management buoyant LAST NIGHT'S clear decision by Names was a vote of confidence in Lloyd's management. It represents a resounding success for the two men at the top - Mr David Rowland, the market's chairman, and Mr Peter Middleton, its chief executive  -both of whom were appointed from the outside. Mr Middleton in particular was in ebullient mood after the results of the ballot were announced, describing the result as the 'worst news for Lloyd's competitors in two years'. He added: 'It is time to let loose some serious commercial aggression.' Mr Rowland, who looked relaxed and buoyant throughout yesterday afternoon's two-hour meeting, clearly believes the tide has turned in Lloyd's favour after three years of crisis: 'Back in January it seemed inconceivable we could be in the position we are in today.' Mr Rowland conceded that the string of difficulties faced by Lloyd's was eroding the confidence not just of the Names who have supplied its capital, but of insurance buyers and brokers who provide it with billions of pounds of premium income. But he stressed to Names yesterday the importance of moving quickly to capitalise on investor interest in the market. 'In building businesses you just have to take your chances when they come,' he said. Mr Rowland has had a long association with the Lloyd's market, heading up some of London's most successful insurance broking operations before becoming chairman of Sedgwick in the late 1980s. He has played a critical role in the market's evolution during the past 2 1/2 years. In 1991 he chaired a taskforce of market professionals whose recommendations paved the way for a series of reforms and the transformation of the market's capital base. When he was elected chairman in January this year, Mr Rowland was able to lend weight to the efforts of Mr Peter Middleton to introduce greater professionalism and modernisation to the market. The blunt and hard-headed Mr Middleton, a former monk and diplomat who was appointed chief executive of Lloyd's in September last year, has begun to change the culture at Lloyd's. He has started to transform it from a sluggish bureaucracy into a more streamlined business designed to give greater direction and coherence to the fragmented insurance agency businesses which make up the market. In April the two men drafted a business plan designed to cut costs and make business processes at Lloyd's more efficient. They have now succeeded - against what has seemed an impossible deadline - in introducing the new corporate investment rules. Judging by the interest claimed from leading merchant banks and securities houses, they have also managed to assuage the doubts of potential investors. All this has been accomplished against the background of escalating legal actions by lossmaking Names, seeking compensation for losses incurred in 1988, 1989 and 1990, and periodic waves of adverse publicity - which, in Mr Middleton's words, have put Lloyd's on the 'back foot'. Mr Rowland admits there is still 'a long way to go'. Before the end of the year Lloyd's is committed to offering its worst-hit Names an out-of-court settlement to their legal actions, for which it has limited financial means. The market faces massive technical difficulties in transferring billions of pounds in old insurance liabilities into a new company. It must also ensure that the current wall of capital seeking to enter the market is not allowed to undermine discipline and lead to a resumption of the intense rate competition on premiums, which eventually helped plunge the market into losses. But for the moment Mr Rowland and Mr Middleton appear to have rediscovered a fragile commodity which many feared Lloyd's had lost for ever: confidence.</p>

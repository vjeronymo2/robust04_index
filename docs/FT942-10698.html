			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / BBC to link with Pearson in world satellite TV project The BBC and Pearson, the media and entertainment group, are expected to announce today that they have formed a worldwide strategic alliance to develop satellite television channels and other joint ventures. The grouping could be a growing challenge to international broadcasters such as Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network. The launch later this year will be a 24-hour BBC World Service Television channel for Europe, but further channels for Europe and other continents, particularly Asia, will follow. The announcement precedes the white paper on the future of the corporation, which has now been delayed until next month. This suggests that the BBC argument that it should be able to expand internationally has been accepted. The government will insist, however, that licence fee money should not be used for commercial ventures and on transparent accounting. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, is likely to provide a scale of financial investment that the BBC is unable to provide. The corporation has one of the largest news organisations in the world and an enormous programme library, which it is keen to exploit. Recently Pearson has made it clear that its future is as a broadly-based media and entertainment group. It acquired Thames Television, the former holder of the London weekday TV franchise, but pulled out of a potential purchase of Star TV, the Asian satellite venture now controlled by Mr Murdoch. Under an agreement with Mr Murdoch, the BBC has already left the northern beam of the Star system and is no longer available in Hong Kong and China. It loses the right to broadcast its World Television channel on the southern beam, which covers India, next year. A return to Asia in a joint venture with Pearson is now likely. Apart from areas such as news and documentaries, collaboration could include education channels and language tuition. It is believed that a separate company will be set up by the BBC to handle any ventures with Pearson. The two groups will bring in other local partners in different parts of the world. The BBC has been looking for a significant commercial partner for some time and considered a wide range of possible partners. But Pearson was seen as the most complementary. Neither senior BBC or Pearson executives could be reached for comment last night. Reuter starts TV service, Page 9</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 15 June.    The Central Bank of Ecuador, BCE, has issued its monthly  report for March 1994. It states the Ecuadoran trade balance  recorded a surplus of $104 million, a 41.3-percent increase over  the same month last year. Exports totaled $250 million, and  imports reached $146 million. Exports for the quarter were 4.6  percent less, however, than in 1993, $688.8 million versus  $722.4 million. Oil was, as usual, the major export item, with  sales totaling more than $264 million for 20.3 million barrels.  Exports of items other than petroleum produced $294.5 million  during the quarter, approximately $100 million less than the  first quarter of 1993. Nevertheless, Jose Riofrio, marketing  manager for the National Banana Plan (Programa Nacional del  Banano), said "the effects of the European Union import  restrictions have not yet been felt in Ecuador." Shrimp sales  dropped 10.6 percent, while coffee rose from $13 million to $21  million. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0023 GMT 12 June 94)    On 7 June, Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen announced  the response to the bid for oil exploitation rights "is the best  proof the country has regained its prestige and confidence  abroad." He announced 28 firms, grouped into 13 consortiums,  participated in the bid. There are 17 well sites in six sectors  of the Amazon region that are expected to require an overall  investment of $141.7 million. The winners are Amoco-Mobil,  Triton, Orix, City-Ramrod, and the Ecuadoran consortium  Tripetrol. Francisco Acosta, energy and mines minister, has  said the best guarantee for the investors "is the absolute  honesty of the bid process." Contracts will be signed in  November, and work is expected to begin in 1995. (Mexico City  NOTIMEX in Spanish 0014 GMT 8 June 94)    Foreign currency reserves rose 3.3 percent in May, totaling  $1.3 million. A BCE spokesperson has said this figure is $43  million higher than in April. The increase "comes from higher  prices for Ecuadoran petroleum on the international market." The  official added that "despite the improved conditions abroad,  gasoline prices continue to rise in Ecuador." (Quito Voz de los  Andes in Spanish 2300 GMT 6 June 94)    Financial expert Luis Onofa, in an article for Quito's daily  newspaper HOY, has said Ecuador's foreign debt has doubled in 12  years. This, he said, "demonstrates that despite renegotiation  efforts, liabilities continue to pierce the heart of the  economy, halting all growth." Ecuador's debt was $6.63 billion  in 1982, and it is $12.96 billion now. Previous administrations  were unable to reach any favorable agreements with the  international financial institutions, private banks, or the  Paris Club. Sixto Duran-Ballen's administration has "managed to  restructure the debt," however. Capital will be paid in 30  years with a 45-percent discount, while overdue interest will be  paid in 20 years on good terms and a 10-year grace period.  (Paris AFP in Spanish 1607 GMT 7 June 94)</p>

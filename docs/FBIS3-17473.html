Zhirinovskiy yesterday sent a letter to Estonian Ambassador  to Russia Juri Kahn stating that "coercive measures and  provocations against the well-known Russian defender of the law  and RLDP activist" Pyotr Rozhok may bring about "unforeseen  consequences" in relations between Estonia and Russia.    "Estonia's statehood, gained thanks to communists, may in  the  troubled times of the 20th century, if Russia's interests are  disregarded, become an ordeal for Estonia. Provocations and  pressure are not the right key in relations with a 150-million  nation. Let the organizers of such actions think deeply about  the possible consequences," Zhirinovskiy said in the letter.    The Estonian Security Police on March 24 seized Rozhok and  took him to psychiatric expertise. After that the police, in  the presence of the Russian vice consul, searched Rozhok's  apartment. They confiscated five brochures published by the RLDP  and a manuscript intended for publication "in a Russian-language  newspaper," Rozhok told BNS.    Security Police Director General Juri Pihl told BNS  investigation of Rozhok's case will soon be completed and the  materials turned over to the court.    The Security Police on March 16 filed formal charges against  the 55-year-old Rozhok under Article 72 of the Criminal Code,  accusing him of "fanning ethnic and political hatred."  Addressing a meeting of the Russian Citizens' Union of Narva on  Jan. 18, Rozhok said Lennart Meri "is, at best, the president  of Estonians, not of Estonia," since the Russian-speaking  population did not take part in the presidential elections. The  same applies to the parliament, he said. In an interview to the  Russian-language newspaper published in Sillamae, Rozhok claimed  Estonia is an ancient Russian territory. In Rozhok's opinion,  the retired Russian military living in Estonia should form armed  units "to defend their honor and dignity" in case the  authorities decide to deport them from Estonia.</p>

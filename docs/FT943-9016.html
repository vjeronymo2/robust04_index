			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Markets: Still skittish after all these profit rises - London The Swedish bond market seldom excites London equity traders, who reached their desks on Thursday only after braving flooded streets and tube stations. But when a  1/2 percentage point increase in Swedish interest rates was followed by a similar rise in Italy, many succumbed to a bad case of cold feet, and the FTSE-100 shed 28.8 points. There were clear domestic reasons for both moves - concern over the Swedish inflationary outlook and deficit, plus Italy's determination to defend the lira at a time of continuing political uncertainty. However, London's immediate reaction betrayed underlying concern that the European interest rate cycle is on the turn. Traders started in equally nervous mood yesterday morning, and at one point the FTSE-100 was down 27 points, but the bond market rallied on reassuring US consumer price data and the FTSE-100 ended the day 4.1 points higher. Analysts of the UK market tend to polarise into two camps: optimists who continue to focus on the robust recovery in corporate profits, and pessimists who fear equity values are looking overstretched - particularly relative to returns available in the gilts market. UBS points out that the real yield gap between equities and index-linked gilts has declined from 60 basis points last November to minus 13, and the last time it turned negative was in early 1987, preceding the stockmarket crash. Gilts reflect market scepticism over how long inflation will continue at its present low level. NatWest Securities accepts the Bank of England will raise UK interest rates this year in a pre-emptive strike against inflation, but says investors must be aware that the battle the Bank is facing is not against a return to the bad old days of UK inflation. It says: 'Instead the Bank thinks that 3 per cent is achievable on the current interest rate structure, but its aim is to get back to the lower half of the target range of 1-4 per cent by the end of this parliament. If it comes anywhere close to achieving this then it will be a very favourable outlook for the gilt and UK equity markets.' The bounce in corporate profitability is now well established. However, Barclays, the UK biggest bank, still managed to surprise with a trebling in pre-tax profits to more than Pounds 1bn in the first half of the year - mainly due to a Pounds 680m drop in bad debt provisions. Not all the news was good: operating profits fell slightly, partly because of low demand for loans from recession-chastened consumers and businesses who are in no rush to take on new debts. The biggest fillip to equities came from the regulatory review of the English and Welsh regional electricity companies, which was so favourable to the 12 RECs that one analyst described it as 'a sheep in wolf's clothing'. Although the new price formula means average family bills should fall by a total of Pounds 70-Pounds 90 over the next five years, the City quickly concluded that the RECs would be able to deliver real dividend growth of at least 5 per cent over the same period. The reporting season by the composite insurers got off to a strong start, with General Accident, Commercial Union and Royal Insurance all coming in ahead of expectations. Their domestic market recovered strongly, thanks to higher premiums, efficiency improvements and more careful underwriting. Good news was not confined to the financial and utilities sectors: profits at GKN, the automotive components and defence engineering group, rose by 62 per cent, even although sales were up only 9 per cent. Much of the improvement came from a continuing programme of cost-cutting and an upturn in several businesses - particularly automotive components, which benefited from recovery in the continental European car market. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group, also came in with better than expected results. Its worldwide speciality chemicals business benefited from recovery, but results in its consumer businesses in Europe and America did not yet fully reflect these improving conditions. You cannot get closer to the consumer than an undertaker, and this tiny sub-sector this week saw the climax of a dramatic takeover. Service Corporation International, North America's largest funeral group, was assured of winning Great Southern Group, the UK funeral company, when the Takeover Panel refused an attempt to block SCI's revised offer of Pounds 113m. Loewen, the Canadian funeral group, had tried to prevent SCI from raising its bid because the Texas-based group made a 'final' offer which omitted a standard clause allowing the offer to be increased in the event of competition. The Panel decided this omission by SCI's advisers, led by the merchant bankers Schroders, was attributable to 'a genuine mistake, however regrettable'. SCI has agreed to pay Pounds 4m compensation to investors who sold shares in Great Southern before the misleading announcement was clarified. It is not clear who will finally pick up the bill, but it seems unlikely that Schroders will pocket much of a fee. Meanwhile, excitement in the British burial business may not be over. The day after SCI won the Panel's backing, it bought a 3 per cent stake in Plantsbrook, the only other UK-quoted funeral company, and said it was interested in buying further shares. Plantsbrook is 46 per cent owned by Pompes Funebres, France's largest funeral business, and SCI may want to secure a ring-side seat if the parent considers asset sales. SCI is also concerned that Loewen Group, its largest north American competitor, might consider turning its attentions to Plantsbrook. Watch this space . . .</p>

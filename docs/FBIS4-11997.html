			<p>BFN     [Text] The security servives in the province of Tamanrasset  today announced that they have arrested more than 300 people of  foreign nationality during the combing operations which the  security forces recently carried out in a number of quarters of  the capital of Hoggar. The security services added that those  persons were residing illegally in Algeria. The services  pointed out that most of those arrested are perverts who carry  out unlawful practices, including trading in drugs and armed  robbery, as well as money dealings, as they have not presented  any identity documents. During this day-long combing operation,  in which joint forces of the army, police, gendarmerie, and  customs participated, more than 1100 tins of Lahda [powdered]  milk and baby milk, and more than 2000 packs of cigarettes - all  of which were going to be smuggled to neighboring states - were  seized.</p>

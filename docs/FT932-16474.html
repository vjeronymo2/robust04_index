			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Japanese steer around Maastricht storms:  The tortuous progress of the Maastricht treaty in Britain is portrayed by the government and its supporters as damaging to the national interest. Delays or non-ratification, they say, threaten inward investment by presenting Britain as 'half in and half out of Europe'.  But what do the inward investors think? ASK leading Japanese manufacturers if they are discouraged by the debate over Maastricht from locating in Britain and some will betray annoyance at the mere suggestion. Most will point to large strategic investments, already made, to which they pledge commitment. Toyota Motor in Tokyo is a good example. 'Considering the time, energy, and money put into organising suppliers, distribution networks and shipping ports, withdrawing from the UK is absolutely out of the question,' it said. The company has invested more than Pounds 500m in a car plant in Derbyshire and an engine plant in Wales. Sony, the consumer electronics company, said there would be no change in investment policies even if debates over Maastricht and the UK's return to the European exchange rate mechanism continued. The company exports televisions to continental Europe from its plant in Wales. Sony said: 'It's probably unavoidable that every country has their differences over further unification, but we're willing to wait three, five or even 10 years.' Toray, which manufactures synthetic fibres, has just completed its third polyester plant in Nottingham. The company supplies Marks and Spencer, and ships half of its products manufactured in the UK to continental Europe. The company is philosophical: 'We don't think most of us will live to see complete unification in Europe,' adding that many Japanese companies had set up plants and distribution networks in the UK ahead of 1993. 'What happens after that won't have much economic impact (on the company).' Ricoh, the office machinery maker which manufactures copier machines and parts in the UK, said: 'Politics and currencies are a cultural matter for the countries involved,' stressing that the most important factor for further investment was the economy and market demand. For smaller Japanese companies yet to move into Europe, ratification of Maastricht may not have as much weight as some Europhiles stress. A researcher at Japan External Trade Organisation (Jetro), an affiliate of the ministry of industry and trade, said the main criteria for choosing an area for investment were market size and labour costs. 'This worry over Maastricht and Japanese companies is overdone. People see great importance in the single market, where goods and services flow freely, but prospects of what lies beyond that is not a major concern,' he added. A Jetro survey of 433 Japanese companies with manufacturing or research and development bases in Europe indicated that immediate reaction to the single European market was muted, and that companies were still trying to assess the effects. Only 31.1 per cent said integration was having a positive effect on their business, while 65.6 per cent indicated the effects were neither clearly positive or negative. On economic and currency unification, 72.5 per cent expect the process to be delayed, while 21 per cent thought that not all EC members would participate. The survey also indicated that the UK remains the most favoured EC country - 27.7 per cent of 713 companies had chosen to locate manufacturing centres in the UK. The availability of English-speaking workers, distribution systems and infrastructure are some of the reasons for the UK's popularity. It is also worth noting that most investment decisions were made in the 1980s, when the UK's attitude towards Europe was unclear. According to the Jetro report, the main reason for Japanese companies cutting back on investments, or even pulling out of Europe, was the flagging European economy. This suggests that Mr John Major, the prime minister, may be successful in wooing more Japanese investment if the UK economy, and the European market, pulls clear of recession.</p>

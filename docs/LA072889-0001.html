			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: TRYING TO GET IN TOUCH WITH A HANDS-OFF PRESIDENCY  </P> <P> It has only been six months since Ronald Reagan left office, but already some  historians are willing to guess how history will compare him to other  presidents. Most put him somewhere in the middle. Lewis Gould, a University of  Texas historian, compares Reagan to Calvin Coolidge, explaining: "Coolidge was  strong for keeping things from being done." Gould thinks Reagan will eventually  wind up "in the middle or lower-middle ranks." But he did give Reagan credit  for having "elements of F.D.R. in his ability to communicate." A biographer of  Franklin D. Roosevelt begs to differ. Frank Freidel, professor emeritus at  Harvard, said: "If I had to rank him right now, I would rank him as high as  Dwight D. Eisenhower. Both were total charmers. Both clung to the same sort of  small-town Middle Western verities. Both were men of principle. Both to a  certain extent were hands-off presidents." Not everyone agrees with Freidel,  either. An Eisenhower biographer, Fred Greenstein of Princeton, said Eisenhower  never had an Iran-Contra-type scandal and instead compares Reagan to Ulysses S.  Grant, a President who, he said, "had substantial public support but left a  rather messy legacy." Historian Donald McCoy of the University of Kansas also  called Reagan a hands-off President and said that "he wasn't terrific at it but  on the other hand he wasn't a failure, either. What shall we say? So-so,  average, fair."  </P> <P>  -- For the first time in 35 years, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II will enter a  horse in a race in the United States, said track officials at Arlington Park in  suburban Chicago. The queen's last entrant in the United States was Landau in  1954. That horse finished last in the Washington International.  </P> <P>  -- The people of Salem, Mass., are a bit confused about two candidates for the  City Council. One of them is Jean-Guy Martineau, who holds the 5th Ward seat  and is seeking one of four at-large seats. Another is Jean-Claude Martineau,  who is running for the 5th Ward seat that Jean-Guy is leaving. Adding to the  confusion from their similar names is the reason for that likeness: They're  40-year-old identical twins. Jean-Claude had been living in Florida but decided  to enter politics upon his return to Salem because constituents kept mistaking  him for his office-holding brother. "He got all the complaints and I got off  free half of the time," Jean-Guy said. DAVE JOHNSON  </P></p>

The third  installment of these reports -- "Hongyun Company Builds the  Bridge" -- gave an account of the role it has played as a  starter in the reform of the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation. It was also this company that had offered the  first expenses for the training of the corporation's surplus  personnel, which has created a favorable "microclimate" for  in-depth reform. This article will mainly brief readers on how  the Beijing Match Plant, a breakthrough point of reform in the  Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, trained and diverted  more than two-thirds of its staff and workers to work elsewhere.    Where lies the difficulty in revitalizing large and  medium-sized state enterprises? The greatest difficulty lies in  the inability to divert numerous surplus personnel to work in  other units because enterprises find it very difficult to absorb  these personnel by themselves and society also finds it  difficult to bear the burden, as the social insurance system is  still unsound. That is why people called this a "tight knot."    The Beijing Match Plant, with a staff of 868 people, was a  subsidiary of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation.  It had only 60 people left when it reorganized and moved out of  the urban district to continue its match production. The  surplus personnel all were diverted to other units, but none of  them lodged a complaint against the plant, appealed to the  higher authorities for help, or created trouble. This great  event -- and in Beijing Municipality, at that -- was handled  very smoothly and without causing any disturbance.    How did they untie this "tight knot"?    Neither society nor enterprises were in a position to  bear the burden of surplus personnel. Hence, the Beijing First  Light Industrial Corporation created an independent intermediary  organization to manage its work force -- an organization that  takes on the responsibility for untying the "tight knot" from  beginning to end.    As a matter of fact, the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation succeeded in discovering a starter -- the Hongyun  Company -- for the development of state assets and comprehensive  reform. Meanwhile, the issue of relocation and placement of  labor resources also was resolved, and funds for establishing a  compensatory unemployment insurance mechanism have been  relatively sufficient. However, who will undertake the heavy  responsibility of "diverting the staff and workers to work  elsewhere"?    In fact, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has  studied the solution of the increasingly serious problem of  redundant personnel over the past few years. There were nearly  80,000 staff and workers in the corporation. Even if the factor  of industrial structure was not considered, the rate of surplus  personnel still exceeded 30 percent. A few years ago, in order  to invigorate the employment system, they optimized labor  organization, which resulted in a reduction of 8,000 people from  among the 80,000 staff and workers. For this reason, the  corporation was at the forefront of the entire municipality in  this respect. However, owing to the unsound insurance system,  excessively scanty amount of unemployment compensation, and the  inability of the untrained personnel to enter the market, most  of the staff and workers returned to their original posts one  after another, and a number of new contradictions were elicited  accordingly.    "The diversion of staff and workers in state-owned  enterprises should be resolved by way of a market mechanism, but  should not wait until the perfect establishment of a labor  market. Therefore, it calls for setting up an economic entity  that will act as an intermediary for the development and  placement of labor force in keeping with the market law." This  is a consensus reached by the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation through assiduous exploration of the issue of  diverting staff and workers to other jobs. Consequently, when  the Hongyun Investment Company -- an asset development company  -- was founded, expenses needed for the diversion of staff and  workers were allotted from this company to set up an economic  entity with independent assets: the Beijing Jingqing Labor  Service Development Company. Its duties are as follows: 1) The  management of staff and workers during the removal period to  redevelop the assets of the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation; 2) The training of staff and workers to enhance  their quality; and 3) The transition from a centralized job  placement system to a new employment mechanism suited to the  market economic structure through the integration of labor force  employment system with labor insurance system, so as to achieve  the objective of appropriately assigning jobs for staff and  workers in society.    This labor force management intermediary  organization took overall responsibility for unemployment  insurance, training for job transference, and job assignment of  the asset development enterprises [zi chan kai fa qi ye 6327  3934 7030 4099 0120 2814], so that state-owned enterprises were  able to perform the tasks of asset development "with light  burdens." In this regard, we may say that it was the Beijing  Jingqing Labor Service Development Company that untied the  "tight knot."    The big pot has been broken, and everyone is longing for a  new and fine bowl after being trained. People hope that those  in work can have more pay for more work, that those who are our  of work need not worry about their food and clothing, and that  those who seek new jobs will also obtain benefits. They have  something to wish for and have actually gained something.  Thanks to these "two wheels," the diversion of staff and  workers has progressed at a more rapid pace.    At the end of 1993 when the match plant, with a history of  70  years, was leveled to the ground amid the rumble of bulldozers,  the staff and workers really could not calm their feelings. "I  can do nothing but dip the heads of matches and package them, so  I am incapable of finding a new job. What am I to live on in  the future?"    Just a couple of months later, the once-agitated and  disappointed hearts were overflowing with beautiful aspirations.  Among the 868 staff and workers, some of the elderly ones  retired ahead of time, others were transferred to work in a new  factory, and it was arranged for the remaining 558 personnel to  receive training for other posts. On the basis of full  investigation and study, the Beijing Jingqing Labor Service  Development Company has made training plans in line with the  requirements of society and of management and service work for  the small residential district built on the site of the original  match plant. Here, the company started 14 training courses,  including business accounting, computer science, enterprise  business administration, commercial services, cooking,  cosmetology, hair-dressing, gardening, driving, automobile  maintenance, tailoring, and so on. After these people were  released from work to receive training for three to 12 months,  those who passed examinations were issued certificates  certifying their qualifications for reemployment, their grades,  and their standard equivalent to technical secondary school  graduates. In this way, they were qualified to participate in  the talent competition on the market, thereby achieving the  ultimate goal of two-way selection between enterprises and  individuals through training so that the superior ones were able  to find new jobs. For this reason, staff and workers were  extremely enthusiastic about attending training courses. Some  said: "Reform did not kick us out and leave us alone. The  state has spent money on our training, paid our basic salaries,  and prepared us for re-employment. That is why we are most  willing to learn, despite fatigue and hardships, because it is  to our own benefit to learn the skills, is it not?" Some types  of work -- like driving and hair-dressing -- require higher and  special skills, so the trainees must pay for part of the  expenses. They paid readily, without saying a word.    Without doubt, the opportunity to find an occupation again,  the pressure of obtaining a job based on one's own  qualifications and not by assignment, and the pursuit of a new  profession are powerful driving forces for staff and workers to  keep their minds diligently on their studies. In addition, the  Beijing Jingqing Labor Service Development Company also gave  consideration to appropriate interest stimulation for the  job-awaiting staff and workers, who live on their salaries,  through the following measures: 1) The salaries of staff and  workers who persist in production are higher than their original  levels; 2) Salaries during training are lower than those  received when they were at work; 3) The compensation given to  personnel waiting for employment is larger than social  compensation; 4) Sick and resigned personnel are given a  lump-sum subsidy in an amount generally equivalent to one-third  of their annual income; 5) Those who suspend work and pay while  retaining their posts are granted a lump-sum subsidy, but should  pay unified funds for old age and management fees for keeping  files; and 6) Those who resign and will find jobs on their own  are given subsidies equivalent to their salary income of two and  a half years. Within two weeks of the announcement of these  measures, four people asked for transfers, three resigned, and  most of the students in the driver training course said they  would try their best to find jobs by themselves after the  training.    Overstaffing is not only a tough problem for asset  development enterprises, but also one that state-owned  enterprises wish very much to resolve. In-depth exploration is  being carried out at a new level.    Although students in various training courses had not  obtained their graduation certificates, recruitment units in  society began to call on them, one after another. The  restaurant service training class would finish its course by the  end of April, but a unit told the students that it would come to  recruit more than half of them at the end of March. The  gardening class was in similar circumstances, as a unit readily  announced the recruitment of half the students....    However, personalities responsible for the Beijing Jingqing  Labor Service Development Company did not dare to relax their  efforts in the least. The aim of this company is to take care  of the work to divert nearly 20,000 staff and workers in 32  enterprises engaged in asset development or relocating to other  places. Liang Jingao, general manager of the company, proposed  an even higher goal: The Beijing Jingqing Labor Service  Development Company ultimately should undertake the entire task  of diverting all surplus personnel in the state-owned  enterprises under the Beijing First Light Industrial  Corporation, so that all these enterprises can shake off their  burdens and "march with light packs."    In light of the large numbers of surplus personnel  prominently existing on the Chinese sides [xiao mu ti 1420 3018  7555] of joint ventures at present, they have decided to start  with this, by using for reference the practice of diverting  personnel in enterprises that are relocating. According to this  practice, a joint venture pays an amount in the form of  compensation to a labor service company to discharge the  expenses of training its surplus personnel so that they are  capable of finding jobs again in the labor market. Recently, the  Beijing Jingqing Labor Service Development Company began drawing  up plans to train some 180 off-the-post staff and workers of a  joint venture: The Convenient Foodstuff Factory.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Patrick-Henry Desaubliaux: "5,793 French Blue </F> Helmets in Former Yugoslavia"]    [Text] On 1 February, France's military participation in  the UN Protection force [UNPROFOR] was 5,793 blue helmets out of  a total of 27,540. On the same date, there were 4,077 French  blue helmets in Bosnia out of a total of 10,760.    The French blue helmets make up several battalions:    -- The 1st Infantry Battalion, stationed in Glina, some 150  kilometers south of Zagreb; it comprises 890 men equipped with  front-line armored vehicles (VAB) and light armored vehicles  (VBL). Their weapons include about 12 antitank Milan missiles  and as many 80-mm mortars.    This battalion consists of units of the 27th Mountain  Division (Grenoble): Annecy's 27th BCA [mountain light infantry  battalion], Grenoble's 27th RCS [expansion unknown], Grenoble's  7th BCA, La Valbonne's 7th BGDA [expansion unknown], Chambery's  13th BCA, and Briancon's 159th RIA [mountain infantry regiment].    -- The 2d and 4th Infantry Battalions are stationed in  Sarajevo.    The 2d Battalion has 769 men equipped with VAB's, Milan  missiles, and 80-mm mortars. The VAB's are fitted with 12.5-mm  machine guns. The battalion was formed with units belonging to  the 9th Marine Infantry Division (Nantes): Angouleme's 1st RIMA  [marine regiment], Auvours' 2d RIMA (near Le Mans), Angers' 6th  RG [engineer regiment] and Vannes' RICM [expansion unknown].    The 4th Battalion is comprised of 812 men also belonging to  the 9th DIMA [marine division]. In addition to weapons similar  to those of the 2d Battalion, they have 12 wheeled armored  Sagaie ERC's [reconnaissance vehicles] equipped with a 90-mm  cannon. They come from the 3d RIMA and the RICM (Vannes) as  well as Angers' 6th RG.    -- The Zagreb-based logistical support battalion is  comprised  of 1,140 men mostly belonging to Chalon-sur-Marne's 10th command  and support regiment.    -- The Bihac-based 3d Infantry Battalion comprises 1,275  men.    It is equipped with VAB's, VBL's, Milan missiles, and 80-mm  missiles as well as very-short-range SATCP's [very short-range  surface-to-air missile], and 12 Sagaie armored vehicles.    This battalion was formed with units from the 15th Infantry  Division (Limoges): Clermont-Ferrand's 92nd RI, Brives' 126th  RI, Castel Sarrasin's 31st RG, and Sathonay's 99th RI. Also  present are elements from Valence's 1st Spahi corps.    -- The Kakanj-based Battalion of Engineers has 400 men from  Besancon's 19th RG, Mourmelon's 72nd RG, and Angers' 7th RG. In  addition to its own specialized vehicles, it is equipped with  VAB's.    Apart from the 24 Sagaies, these units have no heavy  weaponry  (neither armored vehicles nor artillery). Each battalion has a  relatively small number of Milan missiles and 80-mm mortars.  Not all VAB's are equipped with 12.5-mm machine guns. Personal  weapons are FAMAS [Saint Etienne assault rifles] and a small  number of FRF1 precision rifles.    This choice of weapons was not made by France but by the  United Nations. Initially, when the blue helmets have begun  their mission in the former Yugoslavia, the United Nations had  resisted the presence of the VAB's, which it deemed "too  offensive." These wheeled vehicles offer good protection from  bullets as well as mines. Without them, there would have been  more casualties than currently recorded: 18 dead and 281  wounded. In addition to these 5,793 blue helmets, France has  1,200 and 3,000 men stationed nearby the war zones: The crews  of the ships patrolling the Adriatic, European observers, air  surveillance units monitoring the embargo and helicopter  detachments based in Split.</p>

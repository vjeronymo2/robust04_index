			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with EC Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert </F> by Marc Paoloni and Marc Nexon in Brussels; date not given:  "Karel Van Miert: `Gerard Longuet Has My Confidence, But The  Treaty Is Essential'"]    [Text] [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Does not the act of  prohibiting the French Government from putting another franc  into Bull run the risk of putting that company in difficulty?    [Van Miert] The Commission could not let such large public  payments be made to a company in a normal commercial environment  without reacting. The amounts transferred in December were  already an illegal act, because paying them contravened the  rules of the treaty. We did nothing new by making the decision  to which you referred. We decided to apply the provisions laid  down in the Community acts.    Recently, for example, we demanded the reimbursement of two-  thirds of the aid received by the company Grundig from the  Austrian Government. Yet, Austria is not part of the Community.  One should be aware that in the Grundig case, France wanted us  to intervene in this way. The same is true for the steelmaking  industry in Italy: The French Government felt the Commission's  arbitration to be legitimate. The decisions we take on one side  must also be taken on the other. That is a matter of  consistency.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] In other words, this was not an  expression of distrust vis-a-vis the French authorities?    [Van Miert] Not at all. [Foreign Trade Minister] Gerard  Longuet made a lot of effort. He tried to come along with  documents. The steps he took were correct. We can see that the  minister is still going down the proposed path. We understand  that there was a change and that that has consequences.  However, we must also acknowledge that the explanations given  to us by the French Government were insufficient and that we  were extremely patient.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] The French Government explained its  hesitancy to give precise information about Bull because of its  confidential nature. What do you think of that?    [Van Miert] We are used to dealing with hundreds of matters  under such conditions. It is a question of confidence. One  thing is sure: We will not be in a position to make a decision  based on the aid given to Bull until we have a detailed  restructuring plan for the company. This plan must convince us  of Bull's long-term viability. Otherwise, it will not even be  possible to privatize the company. I can see that the industry  minister is showing a desire to reorganize the group, but one  must play by the rules of the Community game.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Is this recapitalization for full  settlement, along with a privatization, not enough for you?    [Van Miert] Absolutely not. This is not the first time that  we have examined the Bull case. People have so often told us  "You will find out what you find out" that we might be allowed  to harbor a few doubts. We are responsible for getting to the  bottom of this matter -- if only out of consideration for Bull's  competitors. I have received many letters from foreign firms,  including European ones, which do not understand our patience  and which feel that this situation is intolerable and cannot go  on.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Is there the possibility of the  Commission asking for the aid received to by paid back?    [Van Miert] At this stage, it is not possible to speculate  and I refuse to do so. Let us examine the strategic plan and  then we will see. However, it must be clear that I am not  suspicious about France. I have confidence in Gerard Longuet  and I can see that things are now moving at Bull.    [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What will the next stages entail?    [Van Miert] I plan to meet with Gerard Longuet in the coming  days and then use that meeting to get to the bottom of the Bull  affair.</p>

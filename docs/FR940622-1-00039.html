			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(1) can apply to preferred stock that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is redeemable solely at the option of the issuer. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holder generally must treat a call premium as a constructive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution under &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b) to the extent that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> premium is unreasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 305(c) was amended by the Revenue Reconciliation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act of 1990 (the 1990 Act), Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, which changed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the treatment of stock redeemable at a premium. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments provide that: (a) If the issuer is required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redeem stock at a specified time, or the holder has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option to require the issuer to redeem stock, at a premium,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the redemption premium will result in a constructive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution if it exceeds a de minimis amount computed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the principles of section 1273(a)(3); (b) a redemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> premium will not fail to be treated as a distribution (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> series of distributions) merely because the stock is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> callable; and (c) in any case where a redemption premium is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated as a distribution (or series of distributions), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> premium will be taken into account under principles similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to those of section 1272(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendments to section 305(c) did not alter the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that constructive distributions resulting from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redemption premium be treated as distributions to which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 301 applies only if they have the effect described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in section 305(b), including section 305(b)(4). Rather, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amendments were adopted because Congress believed that ``the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic accrual rules applicable to debt instruments issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with [original issue discount (OID)] also should generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to certain preferred stock issued with a redemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> premium if the stock will be redeemed, or if it can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably be assumed that the stock will be redeemed, on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixed date.'' H.R. Rep. No. 881, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 347  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1990). The legislative history to the 1990 amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that Congress did not intend to limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority of the Treasury and the IRS to determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proper treatment of redemption premiums on callable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferred stock. Id. at 348&hyph;49.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Explanation of Proposed Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1990 Act Amendments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Proposed &sect;1.305&hyph;5 (b)(1) and (b)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restate the basic rules concerning the treatment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandatorily redeemable and puttable stock in conformity with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1990 Act. The IRS and Treasury anticipate that other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues raised by the 1990 Act will be addressed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequent guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Treatment of issuer call rights <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The primary focus of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed regulations is on the treatment under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 305(c) of stock callable at a premium at the option of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If stock is subject to an issuer call, the holder cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control whether the stock will be redeemed at the premium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount. Moreover, if the payment of a call premium merely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflects increases in the value of the holder's stock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting from market fluctuations after the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuance, the call premium is not the equivalent of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution and its payment is more appropriately taxable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only upon realization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If, on the date of issuance, however, it is more likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than not that an issuer will exercise its call option based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the economic terms of the stock, the holder's anticipated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in the earnings and assets of the issuer through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the call premium is equivalent to a periodic return on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stock that should be taxed over time as a distribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such a call has the effect of a mandatory redemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision, and should produce comparable tax consequences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, proposed &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(3) requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constructive distribution treatment with respect to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuer call only if, based on all of the facts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances as of the issue date, redemption pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the call right is more likely than not to occur. Even if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redemption may be likely, however, constructive distribution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment does not result if the redemption premium is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solely in the nature of a penalty for premature redemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A penalty for premature redemption is a premium paid as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of changes in economic or market conditions over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which neither the issuer nor the holder has control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples include changes in prevailing dividend rates or in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the value of the common stock into which the stock is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convertible. Calls in such cases reflect increases in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of the holder's stock resulting from events that occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the date of issuance, and the premiums paid thereon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore represent a penalty for premature redemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than the equivalent of a periodic return on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under a safe harbor, constructive distribution treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not result from an issuer call if the issuer and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holder are unrelated, there are no arrangements that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively require the issuer to redeem the stock, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exercise of the option to redeem would not reduce the yield  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the stock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standard in the proposed safe harbor is similar to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the standard for taking into account call options in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the yield of debt instruments potentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the accrual of OID. See &sect;1.1272&hyph;1(c)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the determination of whether a redemption premium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be treated as a constructive distribution is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based solely on the effect of an issuer call on yield.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(1) does not provide any exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from constructive distribution treatment for stock that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately callable by the issuer. Under proposed &sect;1.305&hyph;5(b)(3), a constructive distribution by reason of the issuer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> call would only occur in cases where a call is more likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than not to occur, based on the facts and circumstances as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the issue date. The holder is treated as constructively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving the premium as a distribution over the period from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the issue date to the date on or by which redemption is most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely to occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (5): Quest for definitive answers - Legal Issues AS DERIVATIVES trans-actions metamorphosed at a dizzying rate in the 1980s, turning bonds and options into swaps and swaptions, strips and tigers, with collars and floors, they mutated beyond traditional securities regulation, and put themselves into a land of legal limbo. Financial engineers driving quirky softwear on powerful Sun workstations have not only left stodgy bond traders with their broker screens in the dust, they have befuddled regulators unaccustomed to dealing with hybrid financial instruments. The fact that derivative deals represent thousands of billions of dollars in capital and regularly cross political borders makes the legal wrangles, and their accompanying risk, all the more onerous. Recognising that banking and trading laws were written long before there were over-the-counter derivatives, banks are working to seal the gaps left where derivative transactions do not fit into old-fashioned legal categories. The problems of defining what derivatives are, who is allowed to trade them, and how to enforce standard agreements designed to reduce transaction risks are all hot issues in banking. The ubiquitous interest rate swaps, for example, risk being judged illegal under the gambling laws of countries as diverse as France, Brazil, Canada and Japan, and until recently, under the commodities regulations of the United States. In some countries swaps risk has been classified as usurious, and is illegal. Mr Dan Cunningham, partner at the US law firm Cravath, Swaine and Moore and counsel to the International Swap and Derivatives Association, says tremendous progress has been made in these areas, and that clarifying legislation is being sought in countries where the line of the law is cloudy. Changes in the legal environment have come in important areas. US commodity regulators this year declared that swaps were exempt from futures regulations, wiping away a huge legal uncertainty in the US. Australia is considering similar legal adjustments. In France, national financial authorities last September issued a circular that defined who is allowed to use swaps, and under what conditions they can trade. Local governments in France, for example, cannot speculate in derivatives, but can use them to hedge. However, those changes have occurred under conditions still in flux. Uneasiness about the risks derivatives pose to the world banking system prompted the US Congress to reserve final word on derivatives regulation, and some legislators view the swaps exemption from commodity law as simply an interim act on the way to more structured swaps regulation. In another category of legal risk, derivatives dealers have become increasingly more circumspect about who they take as a swaps counterparty, not just from a credit standpoint, but from the view of legal eligibility. Governments, particularly municipalities, can be attracted to derivatives deals, but their qualification for a swaps marriage is not always clear. The costs of consorting with an ineligible counterparty were driven home in the UK in 1991, when the House of Lords ruled that the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, an active sterling interest rate swaps trader, did not have the power to enter into derivative contracts. The decision voided five years worth of contracts, and forced the local authority and the involved financial institutions to take losses. The decision also voided similar deals between more than 130 UK councils and 75 of the world's largest banks, stirring up legal appeals that are still in the courts. Now, rather than assume a counterparty is eligible under existing statutes, banks and other dealers are demanding a definitive body of law. In the US, lobbyists have persuaded about 25 states to enact laws defining who can use derivatives. Lawyers say the process has been slower in other countries, particularly in Germany. Despite the huge amounts of money sloshing through the over-the-counter markets, industry advocates say there have been remarkably few defaults. A recent ISDA survey put cumulative losses at a mere Dollars 358m in the past 10 years, and half of those were attributed to the Hammersmith case. The past cannot necessarily predict the future, however, and credit risk is the predominant concern of every derivatives dealer and bank regulator. Most swaps dealers use standard contracts to define their transactions, and to reduce credit risks, many engage in bilateral netting agreements. If the contract is terminated early, because of bankruptcy or liquidation, the netting agreements allow payables and receivables to cancel each other out, limiting the credit risk of the solvent counterparty to net exposures. Enforcing netting is rife with potholes, however, and only slowly are bankruptcy judges and others recognising them as valid. Of all the industrialised countries, lawyers say France is the most questionable jurisdiction for enforcing netting. A 1989 ruling in the US allows netting between US-based counterparties, and the practice is generally recognised in the UK. The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision of the Bank for International Settlements in April released a proposal to recognise bilateral close-out netting as a means of reducing credit risk for the purpose of measuring bank capital adequacy. It is now seeking international comments on the plan. A controversial offshoot of the netting discussion is the idea of multibranch netting. A financial institution with operations and assets worldwide will choose a location, for tax or other purposes, in which to register a swaps transaction. If an institution finds itself in collapse, as happened in the case of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, world bank regulators may wrangle over the proper way to deal with the remains, putting the integrity of the netting agreements in jeopardy. Mr Cunningham says the issues of enforcability of multibranch netting have gained attention since the BCCI case. A derivatives report issued in July by the Washington-based think-tank, the Group of Thirty, suggests a solution. 'Resolution will come only if and when it is clear that insolvency of a bank with several branches in different countries will be handled as a single proceeding and not as separate proceedings for the bank and each branch,' he says. This recommendation, and others like it, leans towards standard global financial regulation, an evolution that legal demands of derivatives trading may accelerate.</p>

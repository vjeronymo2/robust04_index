			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and </F> foreign minister, by Nobuaki Hanaoka, chief of the SANKEI  SHIMBUN Political News Department; place and date not given --  from the "Listening Without Reservation" column]    [Text] [Hanaoka] Prime Minister Hosokawa has announced  the postponement of a cabinet reshuffle. How about aftereffects  of the postponement?    [Hata] Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura held two  posts as chairman of Sakigake [Harbinger Party] and government  spokesman. He agonized at the time. However, Mr. Takemura will  leave someone with the work of running his party to some extent  and perform his duty as spokesman.    [Hanaoka] It has been said now that political reform, an  agent holding the ruling coalition parties together, has been  settled, the Hosokawa's Cabinet cohesiveness will be inevitably  weakened. What do you think?    [Hata] It has been weakened. However, the coalition  partners have taken a new look at their positions. Chairmen of  the ruling coalition parties held a meeting on the evening of 2  March when Prime Minister Hosokawa announced his decision to put  off a cabinet reshuffle. The mood at the meeting abruptly  turned gloomy when the prime minister expressed his intention to  give up the planned reshuffle. The meeting was filled with the  mood for working together when I said, "Let us return to the  starting point and restart."    [Hanaoka] Do you think the ruling coalition parties will  consolidate their bipolarization?    [Hata] I do not think so. The ruling coalition parties  still have differing intentions. They should not cling to their  names.    [Hanaoka] It has been reported that the ruling coalition  parties differ from each other on national ideology and  political tactics.    [Hata] The difference is not a ditch that they cannot cross.  While Mr. Takemura is advocating the need to build Japan into a  "small nation," Mr. Ozawa is speaking of the need to build Japan  into an "ordinary nation." There is little difference in their  views. They agree on the point that Japan should be built into  a nation that has a great ideology to create a real peace for  the world within the framework of the Constitution and has  senior citizens live free of concern at home. If Japan were  built into a small nation, however, it could not enjoy its  present-day prosperity.    [Hanaoka] I believe that the plan for the national welfare  tax was a correct direction, but it was pointed out that the way  Mr. Ozawa handled the new tax system was high-handed.    [Hata] In the past seven months, the new multilateral trade  negotiations (the Uruguay Round) was concluded, the Political  Reform Law was enacted, and Japan decided to partially open its  rice market. They are changes that can occur once in 10 years.  Five ruling coalition parties shored up the coalition  government when it dealt with those changes. The coalition  government had a time limit for deciding on each of the changes.  It was inevitable for Mr. Ozawa to deal with the new tax in a  high-handed way. The high- handed way was a transitional way.  If a new major political party is formed, such a high-handed  way would disappear.    [Hanaoka] How will the ruling coalition parties coordinate  their choices of candidates for the next elections?    [Hata] The ruling coalition parties must discuss how their  candidates should be divided into single-seat constituencies and  the proportional representation system. If any party fields no  candidate, it would suffer a decrease in the number of votes  obtained in the proportional representational system. If the  ruling coalition parties are merged into a single party, this  would resolve the issue of fielding unified candidates in the  next elections.    [Hanaoka] Mr. Hata, do you mean that the ruling coalition  parties should be aimed to dissolve themselves to form a new  party?    [Hata] Now that the combination system of the single-seat  constituency and the proportional representation system has been  adopted, a realignment of political parties will take place.  The best option for the ruling coalition parties is to merge  themselves into a single party. A new party should be created.    [Hanaoka] How are the ruling coalition parties going to deal  with leftists in the Social Democratic Party of Japan?    [Hata] There is an ideological problem with them. They  should decide what to do in the future.    [Hanaoka] Is there a possibility that more Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] members will desert?    [Hata] It depends on whether the liberal democrats have the  courage to purge themselves of their past and how they view  politics in a new age.    [Hanaoka] What is the cause of a new party?    [Hata] It is to rally a powerful political force capable of  countering the LDP. We will have to promote economic reform,  administrative reform, and decentralization. From a  broad-ranging point of view, we intend to develop a new tax  system which will balance assets, consumption, and income in the  long-term.    [Hanaoka] Will Mr. Hosokawa head the new political party?    [Hata] Yes, he will.    [Hanaoka] Japan-U.S. relations are in serious shape. Would  you comment on it?    [Hata] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks did not break  off, but ended with no agreements reached. The Hosokawa Cabinet  intends to make a sweeping relaxation of regulations. For the  United States, Japan is the second largest importer next to  Canada. Both Japan and the United States are in a mature  relationship of mutual dependence. If the two countries stop  taking face-saving actions, their relations will certainly  improve.    [Hanaoka] Mr. Ozawa appears to be planning to visit the  United States.    [Hata] A decision has already been made about his visit to  Washington. He will travel to the United States to give a  lecture at the request of an American press club. Mr. Ozawa has  not been seen in public for health reasons. When I told him,  "If you continue to stay away from the public, it would  immediately become a newsworthy story," Mr. Ozawa said, "I am  really in poor health."    [Hanaoka] No prospects are seen for deliberation of a budget  bill for fiscal 1994 in the House of Representatives Budget  Committee.    [Hata] The Budget Committee should deliberate, among other  things, the budget bill to recover Japan's economy. There are  no clear reasons for delaying its deliberation. It is said that  the Budget Committee will begin deliberating the bill when Labor  Minister Chikara Sakaguchi returns to Japan after attending the  job summit. I think it is good if a debate focuses on labor  problems during the committee's general interpellation session.</p>

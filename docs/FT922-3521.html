			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Arts: School of American Ballet - Dance in New York The annual School of American Ballet Workshop (so-called) performances are an event of more than parochial interest. They are, to begin with, fully staged productions of ballets, usually from the repertory of New York City Ballet, with orchestra, the excellent Juilliard School Philharmonia. (During his tenure as musical director of the company, the late and much lamented Robert Irving used to conduct.) The audience includes not only doting parents and siblings, but also balletomanes, critics, and directors of other companies from around the country, all on the lookout for new talent. Some of these audience categories overlap. Former members of NYCB now direct companies or teach outside the city. This year's award-winning students, Emily Coates and Anna Liceica, are former pupils of Patricia Wilde, director of Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, and Yvonne Mounsey, who teaches in Santa Monica, California, respectively. Another very gifted young dancer, Rachel Rutherford, is the daughter of the former ballerina Gage Bush and the late Richard Englund, an associate director of the Joffrey Ballet. Coates and Liceica have already been taken into NYCB as apprentices. Although the School is the official school of City Ballet, not all its graduates can find a place there, so it also feeds into American Ballet Theatre and companies outside New York and even abroad. (Paloma Herrera, a 16-year old in last year's performances, has been attracting notice in small roles at ABT this summer.) The performances this year afforded a pleasure over and above that of watching fresh young talent. After the dismal week of 'original' ballets presented in the NYCB's 'Diamond Project' (which really was a glorified workshop), it was a relief to see an evening of mostly great choreography: two Balanchine ballets that were not in the company repertory this season, Allegro brillante and Who Cares?, and a Bournonville divertissement, the pas de trois from La Ventana. The only clinker was Martins's achingly tedious Mozart Serenade. The general level of the dancing would have done any professional company proud. Once on stage, these teenagers seem to lose all trace of adolescent insecurity and become assured, elegant, sophisticated young women and men. If I had to pick out one outstanding dancer, it would be the Romanian-born Anna Liceica, who danced the first variation in La Ventana with sweet delicacy and lyricism, then gave a knockout performance of the 'My One and Only' solo in Who Cares?, with its dazzling succession of multiple pirouettes. But the whole cast in this ballet was sensational, from corps de ballet through to soloists: Liceica, Rutherford, bewitching in the 'Fascinatin' Rhythm' solo, and Gavin Larsen, spirited in 'Stairway to Paradise', all three women strongly partnered in their duets by John Winfield. As so often before, this was the perfect ballet for a June evening in New York City.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Crimea rebels head for crisis Crimea's pro-Russian parliament virtually declared independence from Ukraine yesterday by voting to restore their short-lived May 1992 constitution. The 'constitution' calls on Ukrainian-Crimean relations to be governed by treaties, as between two sovereign states, as well as creating Crimean citizenship and opening the door for Crimea to establish its own military units. Immediately after the Crimean vote, Ukraine's parliament went into closed session and passed a resolution setting a series of deadlines for Crimea to revoke the constitution. Mr Nikolai Mikhailchenko, President Leonid Kravchuk's chief domestic adviser: said 'There is a line which cannot be crossed, that of the territorial integrity of Ukraine. The Crimean parliament has just crossed that line.' But he gave no indication of the likely Ukrainian response. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president stepped into the crisis warning that no force should be used against Crimea. 'Crimea is an independent republic within Ukraine. It has the right to its own political stand, to make its own political decisions,' he said. Mr Kravchuk had earlier attempted to put the peninsula's Internal Affairs and Security (former KGB) branches under Kiev's direct control. But this was flouted on Thursday by Crimean leaders who appointed their own men into newly re-styled Crimean security ministries. Western diplomats in Kiev warned that an armed confrontation over Crimea could deteriorate into a Russian-Ukrainian conflict. 'President Boris Yeltsin will stay out of a verbal showdown, but if anything physical happens it will be hard for Russia to stay silent,' one diplomat warned. The Crimean peninsula, once the balmy seaside playground of Russian tsars and the Soviet elite, already contains 50-60,000 Ukrainian troops. Significant Russian forces, part of the Black Sea fleet equipped with rifles and armoured vehicles, are also stationed there. On Thursday Crimea accused Ukraine of deploying 1,000 additional troops and seizing buildings while Kiev radio accused Russia of landing two paratroop divisions. There was also a bomb scare at the Crimean parliament building although these reports could not be confirmed. Tensions have flared on and off between Kiev and Crimea since Ukraine became an independent state in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Though Crimeans, nearly 70 per cent ethnic Russian, voted for an independent Ukraine in 1991 Ukraine's appalling economic decline has driven the Russian majority to seek integration with Russia. Yesterday's restored constitution was initially passed in May 1992. Conflict was averted when Mr Kravchuk brokered a deal in which Crimea was granted autonomy in exchange for annulling its independence and toning down its constitution.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Titov and Nadezhda Yakhotina: "Americans </F> Preferred Reasonable Prices of Novosibirsk Plants"]    [Text] The management of one of the largest  finance-industrial groups in the USA, the Harbor Group, is  studying the possibility of placing a number of large orders  with conversion enterprises in Russia. A press conference was  held yesterday at the American business center in Novosibirsk,  regarding the April visit by Harbor Group President Sam Fox to  Moscow, Novosibirsk, Saratov and Kazan.    The Harbor Group unites 50 enterprises in the United States  and Europe which produce goods made of metal, rubber, and  plastic, as well as compressors, medical equipment, medicines  and precision production parts. It is a supplier of components  for IBM, Apple, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors. It provides  over 50 percent of the medical equipment to all the hospitals in  the United States. Its annual turnover is $1.5 billion.    As the director of the American business center in  Novosibirsk, Robert Ekkart, reported at the press conference, at  the present time the Harbor Group has undertaken the development  of 10 production programs which will be proposed for  consideration to Russian plants in May of this year. Another  visit by Harbor Group representatives to Novosibirsk is planned  for that time. In the course of this visit, specific programs  and conditions of cooperation will be discussed, and  technologies and production blueprints will be handed over so  that the enterprises may evaluate their own capacities.    The conversion enterprises of Moscow, Saratov, Kazan and  Novosibirsk have evoked the greatest interest of the Harbor  Group. The signing of a number of agreements with the Saratov  Aviation Plant, the Novosibirsk production association "Sever,"  the Berd Electromechanical Plant and the "Sibtekhstilmash" plant  is expected in the near future. The Harbor Group intends to  place orders with these enterprises for the production of parts  and components for computers in batches of from 10,000 to 1  million units. The value of these will comprise from $0.2 to  $600, and the overall volume of the orders may comprise $20  million.    Mr. Ekkart noted that, considering the high technological  level of the Novosibirsk conversion enterprises and the presence  of high class specialists, the Harbor Group considers the prices  on the production of these enterprises to be satisfactory. In  his words, in Moscow the representatives of the Harbor Group  "silently walked out of the plant which they were considering,  because of the absurdly inflated prices on its products."    The initial basis for serious interest by the Harbor Group  in  the enterprises of Novosibirsk was the cooperation with the  Institute of Hydrodynamics of the Russian Academy of Sciences  Siberian Department in the sphere of developing pumping  equipment. Aside from expressing interest in participating in  production projects with Novosibirsk enterprises, the firm is  also exhibiting great interest in scientific-research  cooperation.    Nevertheless, we should hardly expect any large investments  by the Harbor Group in Russia in the very near future. This fact  was confirmed by Mr. Fox in his comment to the effect that at  the present time the Russian conversion enterprises are  experiencing the need not for investments, but for loading their  production capacities and creating conditions for work.</p>

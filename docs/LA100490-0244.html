			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABOUT WINE: CASTELLO D'ALBOLA: BREAKING TRADITION  </P> <P> The wine of Chianti -- red, dry and in the midst of a renaissance -- is  composed as much of heritage and history as of wine-making expertise, so it is  noteworthy when a winery defies tradition.  </P> <P> Here in the parched, rocky hills of the Chianti country, it is not easy to make  changes. Zoning laws all but prohibit expansion of buildings; Common Market  laws all but prohibit new plantings. Cost factors override everything, making  renovation a practical impossibility.  </P> <P> Money, however, can help. Two of Italy's most successful modern wine producers,  Villa Banfi and Antinori, got where they are today because they had always been  money makers, which permitted those two far-thinking companies to reinvest  their profits and improve their wines.  </P> <P> Castello d'Albola is also a product of profit reinvestment. Unlike Banfi and  Antinori, Albola has not yet won wide fame, but its new wines are indicative of  two truisms of Chianti:  </P> <P>  -- The old methods that focus on excellent grapes still make great wine.  </P> <P>  -- Modern techniques of farming, fermenting and finishing can combine with the  older methods to make wine greater than anything yet seen.  </P> <P> Still, there is one absolute that binds these two thoughts: To do anything  right here requires money, preferably a load of it.  </P> <P> The 11th-Century watchtower atop the main building at Castello d'Albola  indicates that this place -- once known as Pian d'Albola -- has been making  wine for centuries. But it is only during the last two years that it has been  making great wine.  </P> <P> The funding behind the renovation of Albola comes from the huge Italian wine  firm Zonin, which bought a decaying 1,200-acre estate here in 1979 and  immediately began upgrading the whole operation, from restoring the vineyards  to building a massive new wine-making facility.  </P> <P> "There was a great amount of deterioration of the vines during the time when  they were not properly tended," said Bruno Zaratin, director. He pointed out  that because of the large number of vines per acre in the densely planted,  steeply sloped Albola vineyard, it cost about $20,000 per acre to replant the  vines (about five times the cost of a valley floor vineyard in California).  There are about 375 acres of vines here, a costly replanting job for at least  one other reason: labor here is scarce and thus expensive.  </P> <P> It is interesting to note, though, that approaching this facility from Radda,  one must leave the paved road and drive more than a mile on an unpaved  rock-strewn path to the ancient walled castle. In other words, though Zonin was  prepared to spend millions on the vineyards to produce quality wine, paving the  road was clearly viewed as a frill.  </P> <P> The renovation of this property includes a monstrous, 80,000 square-foot  winery, modern in every respect including the design. Getting this structure  approved required the patience and cash to fight bureaucratic intransigence.  </P> <P> "How long did it take you to get the permits for this place?" I asked Zaratin  as we walked around the $3 million structure, still uncompleted.  </P> <P> "Only four years!" he exclaimed in exultation. "Not many people can get permits  that quickly here. This is one of the most protected places in all of Italy."  Then he added quickly: "And then three months after we got the final permit,  the law was changed again, so now it's even harder to get a permit."  </P> <P> In 1988, two things occurred to make Albola a true property of potential. The  first was when the winery placed Filippo Pedron in charge of vineyard and  winery operations. A talented wine maker, Pedron was charged with making only  great wine and selling off anything not satisfying that mandate.  </P> <P> Then Zonin entered into an international marketing agreement with the Seagram  Classics Wine Co., a powerhouse in the business.  </P> <P> Driving around the estate with Pedron and Zaratin, I saw touches of care  everywhere: matching the grape variety to a particular soil, careful choice of  clone (13 different clones of Sangiovese are used here), concern over sun  exposure for a type of pruning system, even the location of the new olive  trees. (Making olive oil is as much a Chianti tradition as making wine.)  </P> <P> Tasting the latest releases, I was quite impressed with the wines, the 1988s  and 1989s even more than the excellent 1987s, evidence that Pedron has had an  immediate impact on the quality.  </P> <P> The 1987 Chianti Classic ($7) is an excellent, balanced and fruity red wine  with a bone-dry finish, perfect for pasta.  </P> <P> Utterly sublime, however, was the 1988 Chianti Classico ($9), which will be  released in two months. A flowery aroma and soft cherry-raspberry notes make it  appealing, and the aftertaste is a joy because of lower tannins and an  extremely long finish.  </P> <P> Pedron said he made the wine with new rototanks that gently roll the juice and  the skins around together, extracting proper flavors without excessive tannins.  It's a method used with great success by the Australian wine industry.  </P> <P> This is a striking wine, one of such immense appeal that it was declared the  winner of the Douja d'Or for 1990 -- the highest award in a wine competition of  849 wines from throughout Italy.  </P> <P> Albola also has two newer-styled Tuscan wines. Both are marvelous, if a bit  pricey. The better of the two is 1988 Accaiolo, a soft, very rich, toasty red  wine with a marvelous cherry-nutmeg spice quality and an intense, deep  aftertaste. At $26, it sounds expensive, but it may become one of the cult  wines of the 1991 season.  </P> <P> A companion wine, 1989 Castello D'Albola Chardonnay ($21), is also superb,  mainly because of its lean, fresh aroma, creamy mid-palate and fruity finish.  It is excellent wine and competes with the best Chardonnays of the New World.  </P> <P> However, with its 1987 and 1988 Chianti Classico wines, Castello d'Albola will  make its mark in a more obvious way: great red wines at a price most people can  afford.  </P></p>

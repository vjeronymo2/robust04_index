			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GRAPHICS ZONE PLANS 12 SHOWROOMS IN U.S.  </P> <P> The Graphix Zone, a desktop publishing and computer graphics sales and service  center, said Wednesday that it has moved its headquarters showroom here and  that it has plans for 12 showroom-stores across the country.  </P> <P> The company shut its prototype showroom within the Computer City Supercenter  store in Garden Grove and moved to the new location to be closer to its  corporate clientele, said Angela Aber, vice president of marketing at the firm.  </P> <P> Graphix Zone, co-owned by former AST Research Inc. managers Aber and Chuck  Cortright, provides services in desktop publishing, presentation graphics,  computer-aided design and multimedia computer services.  </P> <P> Aber said the company expects to open three or four stores on the West Coast in  1991 and an additional eight stores nationwide by the middle of 1993. She said  the Garden Grove test location was successful, generating a first-year gross  margin of three times the industry average.  </P> <P> The flagship Irvine store will be at 38 Corporate Park, close to the  intersection of Jamboree Boulevard and the San Diego (I-405) Freeway.  </P> <P> The showroom will feature a demonstration area, like those at trade shows, in  which customers can try out software products from dozens of manufacturers or  rent computer time. The showroom will also feature a large service bureau and a  theaterlike seminar area for corporate presentations.  </P> <P> "In just one year, Graphix Zone has proven that a reseller focused on high-end  graphics -- with a value-added mind-set and an emphasis on graphics training  and services -- can achieve growth rates considerably higher than those of  typical storefront dealers," said Rick Inatome, chairman and president of  Inacomp Computer Centers Inc. in Troy, Mich.  </P> <P> Inacomp, a co-investor with Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Corp. in the Stanton-based  Computer City Supercenters chain, will provide products and equipment to the  Graphix Zone showroom stores, Aber said.  </P> <P> Mike Rusert, executive vice president of Computer City Supercenters, said his  chain still expects to open 20 to 25 superstores within three to five years.  However, he said the stores will not include the Graphix Zone as a tenant,  mainly because of the Graphix Zone's high-end corporate clientele.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mirjana Bunjevac-Filipovic from the </F> White House in Washington]    [Text] The agreements signed today are of exceptional  importance for both Croats and Muslims and also for peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the stability of the whole of Europe.  The guarantees obtained here in Washington should help all this  to be implemented effectively and as soon as possible.    Two of the six agreements signed are, so to speak, of a  general nature. One of those two agreements obligates the  signatories to support the formation of the federation between  Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the other to  support the development of economic and military cooperation  between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation and the Republic of  Croatia. There are also four separate documents: the  preliminary agreement on the confederal relations between the  Republic of Croatia and the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  the agreement granting the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation access  to the sea via the territory of the Republic of Croatia, the  agreement granting the Republic of Croatia free passage through  the territory of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, and finally,  the agreement on the constitution of Bosnia- Herzegovina, which  will be sent to the Constitutional Assembly for discussion and  adoption.    After the signing ceremony, President Clinton had separate  talks first with President Izetbegovic, and then with President  Tudjman.    The Republic of Croatia and the whole of the Croatian nation  highly appreciate the role of the United States and President  Clinton in reaching the agreement on creating the Croat-Bosniak  Federation and the confederation between the future  Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation and the Republic of Croatia.    This is said in a statement by President Tudjman following  his talks with President Clinton.    These agreements will be important for halting the war in  the  former Yugoslavia and the creation of conditions for permanent  peace and stability of the new world order in this part of  Europe. The United States' leading role -- moral, political, and  in the security sphere -- is of paramount interest for uniting  efforts for preserving peace on the part of the most important  world factors -- the United Nations, the CSCE, the European  Union, NATO, and individual states. The role of the pope and  the Vatican are of paramount importance in the ecumenical  efforts to restore peace and encourage cooperation between the  nations and religious communities in different crisis areas.  This is also said in a statement issued after President  Tudjman's talks with President Clinton.    President Tudjman also held talks with European Union  Foreign  Ministers Van der Broek, Claes, Kinkel, and Papoulias. A  luncheon offered in honor of Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic,  and the Croatian and Muslim delegation by U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher is under way.</p>

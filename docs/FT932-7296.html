			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Lords approve pay change THE House of Lords yesterday approved a government move to allow employers to pay higher salaries to non-union members. Ministers had moved to change the law, after a Court of Appeal judgment earlier this month, that it was unlawful for workers to be offered financial incentives to give up union membership. The change was agreed in a last-minute amendment to the Employment Bill which completed its passage through the Lords last night. It has still to be approved by the Commons in its final form.</p>

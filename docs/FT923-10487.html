			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): New York's overnight gain lifts the Continent WALL STREET'S overnight gain lifted most bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw foreign institutions return to the market as the view began to take hold that the Bundesbank might not have to increase the Lombard rate. Some analysts believe that the better-than-expected inflation figures released last week may lead to a gradual easing in monetary policy by late summer. At midsession the FAZ index was up 2.09 at 643.05, extending into a gain of 17.51 in the DAX index to 1,628.15 by the close. Turnover rose to DM5.9bn from DM4.5bn. Disappointing half-year results from Commerzbank, the first of the big three banks to report, saw its shares shed DM1.20 to DM238. Dresdner Bank, which is due to report on August 4, put on DM2.80 to DM327.50 and Deutsche Bank was DM4 firmer at DM647.50. Bayerische Hypobank, which reported good figures on Tuesday, gained another DM9.50 to DM382.50. PARIS ignored an early decline in the bond market and the CAC 40 index rose 32.63 or 1.8 per cent to 1,801.63 in turnover of FFr2.5bn. Blue chips led the advance as Michelin added FFr4.50 to FFr215, Total put on FFr3.20 to FFr233.20 and Elf rose FFr7.50 to FFr348. Underperformers also joined in, with Schneider adding FFr34 or 5.8 per cent to FFr617 and Lafarge up FFr13.80 to FFr319. Euro Disney dropped FFr2.55 or 2.7 per cent to FFr90.65 after Airtours, the UK package holiday operator, said it might end its Euro Disney programme because of poor bookings and policy changes by the theme park. Some analysts played down the announcement, which they viewed as an attempt by Airtours to put pressure on Euro Disney during the current 1993 price negotiations. The stock was also hit by rumours, later denied, that Euro Disney would have to raise its VAT rate to 15 per cent, the new European Community minimum, from its current 5.5 per cent. BSN also bucked the firmer trend, losing FFr2 to FFr1,017 while Moulinex fell FFr7.70 or 5.8 per cent to FFr126.30, a new 1992 low. MILAN continued its technical upswing but came back slightly by the end of the session. However, news in the afternoon that the government had won a confidence vote in the lower house on its plans to cut the state deficit by L30 trillion in 1992 lifted Italian shares traded in London. The Comit index rose 1.13 to 401.14 in turnover estimated at L110bn after L62.2bn. AMSTERDAM was stronger on technical trading and a firmer Wall Street. The CBS Tendency index closed up 2.5 at 117.5. Blue chip stocks improved with Royal Dutch up Fl 2 at Fl 144.80, Unilever rising Fl 4.90 to Fl 183 and Elsevier reversing Tuesday's losses with a gain of Fl 3.10 to Fl 106.60. Fokker's shares were suspended briefly prior to its announcement that it is to issue 13.2m new shares to be placed in a new holding company to be controlled by Deutsche Aerospace. Fokker's shares closed up 30 cents at Fl 26.20. Chemical groups Akzo and DSM enjoyed another good performance ahead of the latter's half year results today. Akzo advanced Fl 4 to Fl 142 and DSM saw its shares gain Fl 1 to Fl 100.40. STOCKHOLM advanced for the third consecutive session as the Affarsvarlden General index rose 9.4 to 864.1 in turnover of SKr285m after SKr161m. Astra A shares rose SKr12 to SKr549 on news of good US sales for its anti-ulcer medicine, Losec. ZURICH was buoyed by lower domestic interest rates. The SMI index advanced 35.3 or 2 per cent to 1,812.7. The banking sector remained strong as Union Bank reported satisfactory half-year earnings. Its bearers gained SFr14 to SFr712. MADRID rose in active trading helped by some pleasing corporate results. The general index put on 4.58 to 215.93. Endesa gained Pta125 or 4 per cent to Pta3,225 after announcing a 17 per cent rise in first half earnings. VIENNA's ATX index rebounded 17.43 or 2.25 per cent to 790.95. Austrian Airlines fell Sch20 to Sch1,710, a year low, on reports that it may have to cut its dividend this year. ISTANBUL advanced as more banks lowered their deposit interest rates. The 75-share index closed up 34.38 at 4,200.38 in turnover of TL244bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUL 29  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes   Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1066.70  1068.02  1068.11  1070.26  1070.62  1072.59  1075.69  1077.69  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          Day's High  1077.88            Day's Low  1066.70  ----------------------------------------------------------------------       Jul 28      Jul 27      Jul 24       Jul 23       Jul 22      1058.38     1056.98     1052.53      1059.53      1060.97  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

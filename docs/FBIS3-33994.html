			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nahum Barne'a] </F>   [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said last night in  a meeting with writers and poets at his home, that he can depend  more on President al-Asad's word than Yasir 'Arafat's.    "'Arafat is under pressure from all sides. He says something  and then two weeks later cannot deliver what he promises. He  does not represent all the Palestinians. Still, he is our only  partner on the Palestinian side and the negotiations with him  will continue. There is no going back." [passage omitted]    Rabin said he reached the conclusion that al-Asad is serious  about his contacts with Israel when Israeli intelligence learned  that al-Asad had turned down a request by the Iranian ambassador  to meet with him prior to the Syrian leader's summit meeting  with Clinton in Geneva. Rabin reached the conclusion that Syria  has a partnership with Iran on the Iraqi issue, but that it  decided to sever the partnership in relation to Israel.    "If al-Asad were to do one-third of what al-Sadat did, there  would be no problems in the peace process with Syria," Rabin  said. [passage omitted]    Rabin also said that because of the danger of Iran and  Islamic fundamentalism, peace must be reached between Israel and  all the pro-American states in the region. "I hope that al-Asad  now understands that the path to rapprochement with the U.S.  must go through Israel."    He spoke with concern about the regime in Egypt. "The regime  in Syria is more stable than the one in Egypt. Even if al-Asad  is assassinated the regime will remain stable. On the other  hand, the regime in Egypt is now the least stable in the region  and is under the risk of an Islamic takeover."    The meeting lasted over three hours and was held in a  pleasant atmosphere and with a lot of empathy displayed for the  prime minister.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: More bonus cuts TWO MORE life offices have announced reduced with-profits pay-outs for 1993. But they have cut bonuses in different ways. Following Norwich Union, many companies have opted to cut reversionary bonuses, which are declared annually and cannot be taken away from the value of the policy if it runs to maturity. This is to reflect lower anticipated investment returns and to strengthen reserves. Lower annual bonuses relieve pressure on reserves. Pay-outs at the end of 10-year policies have been dropping significantly. Royal Life has opted to cut its reversionary bonus by 0.5 percentage points to 3.25 per cent. Its terminal bonus, added only at the end of the policy to reflect more recent performance, has been left broadly unchanged. Ten-year pay-outs have dropped by 8.9 per cent, while 25-year maturities, assuming the policy was taken out by a 29-year-old man paying Pounds 30 per month, rose 1.1 per cent to Pounds 55,632. Scottish Provident maintained its reversionary bonus on conventional business, but growth rates for unitised with-profits life and pensions funds dropped from 9.25 per cent to 8.5 per cent, and from 11.0 per cent to 10.0 per cent respectively. Terminal bonuses have also been reduced. Ten-year endowment pay-outs, using the same assumptions, fall by 4.0 per cent from Pounds 7,129 to Pounds 6,844, while 25-year pay-outs fall 1.7 per cent to Pounds 56,409.</p>

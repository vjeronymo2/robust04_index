			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alex Fishman] </F>   [Text] This week the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will  establish its first ever special Military Police unit that will  specialize in handling civilian disturbances. The new unit  belongs to the Central Command, and in addition to basic  Military Police training, its new recruits will be trained at  the Israel Police installations in matters such as dispersing  rallies and arresting rioters.    Although the new unit's establishment orders do not  specifically indicate the civilian population that is to be the  target of the Military Police unit's operations, knowledgeable  defense establishment sources noted that recent developments,  the equipment designated for the unit, and its operational  methods all indicate that the unit will mainly operate against  the violent Jewish sector in the West Bank.    These troops' operational methods and equipment will be  similar to those used by the Israel Police rally dispersing  units.    The decision on the establishment of the unit was made by  the  late Major General Nehemya Tamari, the former Central Command  commander. The unit will be officially announced on 8 May.</p>

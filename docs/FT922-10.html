			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Finland leads flurry of issues with Dollars 1bn FRN A FLURRY of new Eurodollar bond issues were launched in the international bond market yesterday, most receiving a warm reception against the background of a rally in US treasury bonds. Finland continued its heavy international borrowing programme by launching the first Eurodollar floating-rate note by a sovereign borrower since the mid-1980s. The Dollars 1bn five-year transaction, lead managed by Nomura International, pays the six-month London inter-bank offered rate. Buyers included central banks keen to hold liquid, sovereign floating rate paper. Commercial banks were also active buyers, since they do not have to set aside capital against holdings of OECD sovereign debt. Part of the proceeds of the Finland issue were swapped with SBAB, the Swedish national housing finance corporation, which launched a Dollars 500m fixed-rate deal, also lead managed by Nomura. The back-to-back swap reflects the paucity of currency and interest rate swap opportunities in the mainstream market. The five-year SBAB deal was priced to yield 60 basis points more than US Treasuries, considered aggressive by participants in the deal. Depressed conditions in Sweden's housing market and financial system were seen as deterring some potential buyers, although SBAB retains a credit rating just one notch below the top triple-A level from the big rating agencies. Redland, the UK building materials group, launched a Dollars 250m five-year issue, lead managed by Goldman Sachs. The group raises most of its dollar funding from banks and the US commercial paper market. Yesterday's issue was its first in the Eurodollar market since the 1970s. The proceeds of the issue will be used to reduce the amount outstanding under Redland's commercial paper programme, which rose from around Dollars 150m to Dollars 400m following the acquisition of rival building materials group Steetley earlier this year. The 7 1/4 per cent bonds were priced to yield 90 basis points more than US Treasury paper, considered good value by participants in the deal. Eurodollar bonds issued by British Aerospace were trading yesterday at a yield spread of 87 basis points. City of Kobe launched a long-awaited Dollars 210m 10-year deal, lead managed by Bank of Tokyo Capital Markets. The bonds were priced to yield 30 basis points more than treasuries, considered tight following a widening of Eurodollar yield spreads last week. For example, the Asian Development Bank's Dollars 500m 10-year deal was launched two weeks ago at a yield spread of 26 basis points but was trading at around 30 basis points by the close yesterday. Elsewhere, European investors remained keen buyers of bonds denominated in French francs, despite a sharp sell-off following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty this month. Yesterday, France Telecom saw an enthusiastic response to a FFr2bn nine-year deal lead managed by Credit Lyonnais. The 9 per cent paper was re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.34 for a yield 32 basis points more than French government bonds. By the close the bonds stood at 99.55 bid, for a yield spread of 28 basis points.</p>

We are looking forward to  realizing and following up all previous decisions, as well as  giving them new momentum within the framework of bilateral  relations, which should all fall within the framework of the  edifice of the Arab Maghreb Union [end recording]    On the aspects of the cooperation which can be given  priority  during these proceedings Ahmed Attaf, secretary of state for  cooperation and Maghreban affairs, has said the following:    [Begin Attaf recording] The cooperation between Libya and  Algeria is a comprehensive one; it encompasses all spheres, i.e.  economic, financial, cultural, and transport.

			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENTIFIC GROUP WAGES CRUSADE TO EASE FOOD SAFETY CONCERNS  </P> <P> "Our Food Supply Is Safe" was the headline of a full-page advertisement that  ran in three major newspapers Wednesday. Signed by 65 scientists, it went on:  "There is no scientific merit to charges that pesticide residues in our produce  cause cancer in human beings."  </P> <P> The paid statement was the latest effort of a little-known but frequently  quoted science group that has been waging a high-profile crusade to counteract  environmental groups' concerns about food safety.  </P> <P> Representatives of the New York-based American Council on Science and Health  have been on the media circuit the last several weeks trying to persuade the  public that Alar, a chemical used on apples, is safe and should not be banned.  </P> <P> Calling itself a "consumer education and advocacy group," the organization held  a news conference in New York on Wednesday to highlight the signatures of 65  scientists who agree with its view that Alar is not a serious health threat and  should not be listed as one by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  </P> <P> "We believe the (environmentalist Natural Resources Defense Council's) attack  on food is the most significant and damaging attack on consumer confidence in  our food that has happened in our lifetime," said Elizabeth Whelan, an  epidemiologist who founded the American council 10 years ago.  </P> <P> Whelan's ability to attract media attention has alarmed many environmentalists,  who say the organization's title is misleading and its science faulty. Lawrie  Mott, an NRDC scientist, worries that the American council's statements might  confuse people who do not realize "that scientists are just as likely to get  embroiled in political debates as anyone else." A representative of the  Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides, an environmental group, calls the  American council "industry attack dogs."  </P> <P> Whelan said her organization receives up to 35% of its funding from  corporations. Contributors include Uniroyal Chemical Co., the manufacturer of  Alar, and the National Agricultural Chemicals Assn. Most environmental groups  receive financial support mainly from dues-paying members and private  foundations.  </P> <P> The group wins praise for its efforts to publicize the hazards of smoking but  has raised eyebrows with its contention that saccharin, an artificial  sweetener, is safe and does not cause cancer, that there is no evidence that  the herbicide 2,4,5-T, an ingredient of the defoliant Agent Orange, causes  birth defects, and that cyclamates, red dye No. 2. and EDB, a pesticide that  was used on grain, should never have been banned.  </P> <P> Critics contend that many of the council's scientific advisers have worked for  or received grants from drug, chemical and other manufacturers whose products  the council defends. For instance, Robert P. Upchurch, a professor of plant  science at the University of Arizona who signed the council's Alar statement,  said in an interview Wednesday that he worked for 10 years for Monsanto Co.,  which manufactures pesticides. Whelan scoffs at the charges of conflict of  interest, saying "all money is industry money" and insisting that she does not  ask her scientific advisers about their finances.  </P> <P> Her group's views, in fact, are shared by many scientists. They argue that the  potential hazards of such chemicals as Alar are overstated in proportion to  natural carcinogens found in food; that health threats, like smoking and AIDS,  dwarf any peril from pesticides, and that basing regulations on animal studies  is inappropriate because animals and humans do not always react the same.  </P> <P> The EPA is expected to ban Alar based on experiments with mice. Albert Heier,  an EPA spokesman, said that extrapolating cancer data from animal experiments  is "controversial" but "that's the best we've got."  </P> <P> The American council's advertisement appeared in the New York Times, USA Today  and the Washington Post. Whelan, who has appeared on several television news  shows in recent weeks, grumbles that she still has not received as much  attention as Meryl Streep, who has lobbied for tougher pesticide laws.  </P> <P> "We have petitioned the Donahue program and '60 Minutes' to send a  representative," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Pensions pressure on Icahn THE Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the agency which underpins pension benefits in the US, yesterday stepped up the pressure on Mr Carl Icahn, owner of Trans World Airlines, to support TWA's pension plans which, it claims, are underfunded by Dollars 1.2bn. In a letter faxed to the former corporate raider, the PBGC claimed that Mr Icahn had twice reduced a verbal offer to settle responsibility for the TWA pensions, and 'we have yet to receive the often promised, never-delivered written offer'. It also said that the original verbal offer, which would have provided 'secured backing for the TWA's minimum funding payments to the plans of the next 10 years up to a present value of Dollars 150m' was not adequate. The PBGC's executive director, Mr James Lockhart, urged Mr Icahn to come to Washington 'to present a serious and realistic offer for resolving this matter'. The letter came a day ahead of a bankruptcy court hearing at which TWA will ask for permission to sign an agreement in principle with its unions, which would transfer a 45 per cent stake in the airline to employees in exchange for wage concessions. Creditors would be given the remaining 55 per cent stake in return for forgiving about two-thirds of TWA's debt. The PBGC, in a separate motion, said it supported this deal, but noted that any reorganisation scheme at TWA was still dependant on settlement of the pensions issue. 'In addition,' the agency claimed, 'a feasible plan of reorganisation will require a financing commitment, from Icahn or others, which does not yet exist'. There was no immediate response from TWA, although the airline has previously disputed the pension underfunding figures calculated by the PBGC. On Tuesday, TWA - which has made sizeable operating losses all year - announced plans for a major cut in services and jobs next month in an effort to reduce costs.</p>

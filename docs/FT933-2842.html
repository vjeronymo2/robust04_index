			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Study says Norwegian banks to double profits NORWAY'S commercial banks, emerging from crisis, are set to more than double composite operating profits, after credit losses, to NKr3.6bn (Dollars 515m) next year. According to a central bank study, this will compare with forecast profits of NKr1.45bn for this year. The study, which looks at the effects of lower interest rates on bank earnings, expects the banks to continue to recover. The sector made a composite NKr813m profit for the first six months of 1993. Lower rates will also have a positive effect on banks' property portfolios, triggering a significant rise in value. The value of individual bank loans will increase because of improved possibilities for those loans to be serviced. The study forecasts a rise in composite net interest income to NKr12.2bn in 1994, or 3.21 per cent of assets, from a forecast of NKr11.7bn, or 3.17 per cent of assets, for 1993. In the first six months of 1993, the banks achieved composite net interest income of NKr5.52bn, or 3.04 per cent of assets. Banks are projected to cut losses on loans and guarantees in 1994 to NKr4.8bn from a forecast NKr6.9bn in 1993. At the half-way mark of this year credit losses were NKr3.3bn.</p>

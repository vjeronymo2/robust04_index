			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / SmithKline Beecham announces succession SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs and consumer products group, yesterday announced that Mr Henry Wendt, chairman, and Mr Robert Bauman, chief executive, will retire next April. Sir Peter Walters, chairman of Midland Bank and a non-executive director of SB since 1989, will then become non-executive chairman. Mr Jan Leschly, head of SB's pharmaceuticals since 1990 when he moved to the company from the US group Squibb, will take over as chief executive. SB's share price yesterday closed down 3p at 446p. The appointment of Mr Leschly, a 51-year old Danish pharmacist, cuts through the problem of whether to appoint a former employee of SmithKline Beckman or Beecham. The appointment of Sir Peter, 61, will calm concerns that the company is becoming too American. He is expected to surrender his chairman's position at Midland over the next 12 months. He will continue to be a non-executive director of HSBC Holdings. The surprise announcement, made at SB's annual general meeting, is, the company says, part of a carefully planned transition to ensure the group maintains continuity and focus. The approach is in marked contrast to recent events at Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals group, where Sir Paul Girolami, chairman, sacked his chief executive Mr Ernest Mario. Dr Jean-Pierre Garnier, president of the north American pharmaceuticals operations has been appointed executive vice-president of pharmaceuticals. Lex, Page 20</p>

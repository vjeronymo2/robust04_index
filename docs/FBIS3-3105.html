			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- China and the United  Nations (U.N.) are considering focusing their educational  co-operation on helping China's primary education in  poverty-stricken areas.    This was revealed here today by China's State Education  Commission (SEC).    "Such a shift of focus in the next couple of years will be  conducive for China to reach its goal of spreading nine-year  compulsory education for all the children in the country by the  year 2000," an SEC spokesman said.    He said the U.N. Children's Fund, Population Fund,  Development Program and other U.N. organizations have in the  past ten years provided China with free aid totalling 64 million  U.S. dollars for ten educational projects.    At the same time, the Chinese Government put in five times  this amount for these projects, he said.    The co-operation projects cover fundamental education,  normal  education, higher education, textbook compilation and population  research, the official said, adding that every city and province  in the Chinese mainland is involved in such projects.    The SEC spokesman said that advanced electronic devices have  been deployed in the projects to train teachers for the  poverty-stricken countryside.    Through training the principals of 1,000 primary schools in  poor areas, their management personnel and some of the parents,  95 percent of the eligible children in these areas have been  enabled to go to school, he said.    Other aid projects include training centers for university  management personnel, heads of primary and high schools and  primary and secondary school teachers, he said.    Educators have been sent to other countries through such  projects to receive training or attend academic conferences.  "China's educational exchanges with world bodies and other  countries have thus been further promoted," the SEC spokesman  said.</p>

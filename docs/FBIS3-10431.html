"El Chacal," by unidentified Radio Corporacion  reporters; in (Caulatu), northern Jinotega; date not given;  monitored in progress -- recorded]    [Text] [Talavera] ...That is part of the government's not  honoring its word, and that is why it is now confronting so many  problems, like the demands being made by the peasants in  Managua. That is why we do not trust the government to keep its  word, and why we feel tomorrow, the government might decide not  to honor its commitments. You could say we are on the alert. We  are keeping a watchful eye on the government to see if it will  follow through with its promises. As I said before, in previous  years the government has not kept a significant number of  agreements with us. I could even say it has not honored even a  small part of the agreements that were very important to the  Nicaraguan Resistance [RN] movement at the time when it was  armed. The RN movement continues to be an organization with a  very ample social base, which, by the way, is still quite  significant.    [Unidentified reporter] What about the call (Jimmy Leo),  president of the RN High Council, made to the 3-80 Northern  Front through several Managua radio stations; a call for an end  to the negotiations agenda with the government, while problems  such as land distribution, ownership titles, and hunger strikes  are still unsolved?    [Talavera] With respect to statements made by the RN High  Council president or vice president, we completely support them  as part of the resistance. We also feel a certain degree of  solidarity with all the commando units that support the peasants  who are participating in a hunger strike. A very just cause is  what has forced them to adopt this hunger strike decision  because the government has not honored its obligations. We have  a responsibility toward them, and we want to say that from the  moment they decided to go on a hunger strike, we, in turn,  decided to pressure the government to keep its word.    [Reporter] Will that in any way interfere with negotiations  already carried out with respect to an initial demobilization?    [Talavera] Since we consider ourselves responsible people,  there might not be a need to interrupt negotiations, but if we  have opportunities, like tomorrow at 1000 hours, when we are  scheduled to meet face to face with government representatives,  we will call attention to the plight of those Managua peasants.    [Reporter] What is your opinion of the decision by "El  Charro" and "Northiel" not to demobilize?    [Talavera] We have received information indicating that  there has been some contact between mediating organizations,  such as Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo's commission, the  CIAV-OAS [International Commission of Support and  Verification-OAS], and an exchange of letters. I believe it  would be premature to talk about whether or not they will decide  to demobilize. If I decided to comment on this issue, I would  most likely be speculating. They are also fighting, however,  for the same things we are, and we expect there will be a  satisfactory solution to the problems. In all reality,  Nicaragua's problems have not been solved, and the government  has complicated things even more by not honoring its obligations.    [Unidentified reporter] This morning's BARRICADA newspaper  ...    [Talavera, interrupting] What's that?    [Reporter] This morning's BARRICADA newspaper reported that  the 3-80 Northern Front had sold its Redeye missiles to drug  traffickers. The report also pointed out that the missiles had  been sold for $25,000 each. What can you say about this?    [Talavera] All I can say about the alleged sale of Redeye  missiles by the 3-80 Northern Front is that the person who wrote  the report is very irresponsible. The author reveals  information in a very malicious manner and attempts to  manipulate Nicaraguan public opinion and portray us as worthless  people. Maybe he is worthless and that is why he wrote that  report. All I can say is we have never associated with drug  traffickers or become involved in any other type of corruption.    [Reporter] You still have the missiles under your control?    [Talavera] Of course. We still have a significant amount of  weapons under our control. The demobilization process involves  at least 100 or more men ...    [Reporter, interrupting] Do you plan to turn over the Redeye  missiles once the demobilization process is over?    [Talavera] So far, we are in a negotiation phase. We have  initiated negotiations the same way as we have initiated  negotiations with respect to demobilization. Tomorrow we have  another meeting scheduled with the government. It follows a  process.    [Reporter] Jose Angel, what words do you people use to talk  to the government about the RN's general problem, whether it is  poverty, desertion, etc.? According to the 3-80 Northern Front,  how many men participate in RN activities?    [Talavera] Nearly 30,000 active military men are involved in  RN activities. Also, hundreds of thousands are involved in the  social problem. Our biggest problem is that peasants, who make  up the RN's rank and file, are one of the most seriously ignored  sectors.    [Reporter] In addition to the information reporter Alvaro  Cruz read to you, we have also heard that you have been getting  support from Honduras. Some newspapers have hinted that the RN  has received aid from Honduran military men. What can you say  about this?    [Talavera] Those reports are groundless. Their only grounds  is speculation. We have never been supported by any government.  Our struggle has been 100 percent nationalist and supported by  the Nicaraguan people.    [Reporter] Commander Chacal, will some of the demobilized RN  commanders participate in the training classes to be held at the  Walter Mendoza police academy?    [Talavera] Only line officers from the first demobilization  will attend the course at the Managua Police Academy. The rest  of the officers, who will work in the country's northern  municipalities, have yet to participate in the course.    [Reporter] Commander Chacal, when will the RN's main body be  incorporated into the RN Party?    [Talavera] RN is united as an organization. We are keenly  interested in consolidating a party that can represent and be  the political arm of the peasants, workers, and students. We  must say the organization has been growing steadily. We want to  be incorporated into the RN party as soon as possible. I believe  only details remain to be worked out and that all RN sectors  want to form a single party, a political arm to coalesce all of  the RN members as well as the rank and file.    [Reporter] Has the 3-80 Northern Front been assigned any  responsibility in the RN High Council? I understand that you  have talked to the High Council.    [Talavera] We have not met with the RN High Council, but we  want to belong to it so we can be more active and be heard. As  soon as we lay down our arms, our struggle becomes a civic one.    [Reporter] Commander Chacal, how do you explain the RN  party's failure in the Atlantic Coast elections, where the RN  did not win a single seat?    [Talavera] I do not know what really happened at the  Atlantic  Coast elections because we were busy with other problems. We  were confronting a military offensive. I do not think the RN's  failure to win even one seat represents much. I think, however,  that this is due to a scarcity of available resources and a lack  of publicity. We do enjoy broad support in the Atlantic Coast.  Of this I am sure.    [Reporter] Commander, what are your comments on criticism  from exiled Nicaraguans in Miami who say that the fact that the  3-80 Northern Front has agreed to demobilize is treason to the  RN.    [Talavera] The people who have expressed that opinion are  totally removed from the real situation here in Nicaragua. I  have belonged to the RN for many years. I was brought up in  this. I have never felt like I betrayed the RN. Proof of that  is the fact that I have the support of all the peasants in  northern Nicaragua and of the leaders who are in command. We do  not feel we have turned our backs on these peasants. On the  contrary, I would say this is being looked at from another point  of view. There are some people who like to talk, and those who  talk the most are the ones who do the least. That is the  situation. The people who made those comments had no bases for  doing so. The reality here is totally different. It is not the  same to live in Miami and to see war on television as to face  the enemy not knowing where to obtain resources, secure  logistics, ammunition, and other type of war materiel. What  does one do with the wounded, the dead, and the grieving? What  will be done with the war disabled? What will be done about a  number of consequences brought on by war?    I regard the type of information given by certain gentlemen  in Miami as totally irresponsible. We have very solid social  foundations, we have good friends, but there are those who  always like to find fault. There are some bad Nicaraguans who  are always on the lookout. They are always trying to criticize,  but their criticism is totally destructive. The reality here  in Nicaragua is totally different.    [Reporter] The matter of Northiel [Wilfredo Gutierrez or  Wilfredo Chavarria], Charro, and other members of the 3-80  Northern Front is still pending. What is the position of these  cells or groups led by specific commanders regarding the  demobilization plans or negotiations with the government?    [Talavera] In the case of Commanders [name indistinct],  Charro, and Northiel, I think the negotiations will have to be  held directly with them. The 3-80 Northern Front is negotiating  independently. We believe that the commanders who lead those  troops will negotiate directly with the government.    [Reporter] Commander Chacal, could you give us the names of  those who make up the 3-80 Northern Front general staff?    [Talavera] There is a board of commanders. Commander Piloto,  Commander Carlos, Commander Chacalin [Salvador Talavera  "Esteban"], Commander Gringo, Commander Musun, and Commander  Martin are some of them. There are several other commanders  whom I do not....[pauses] There is Commander Magnum.    [Reporter] Tell me something, are the troops or groups led  by  Northiel or Carlos part of the 3-80 Northern Front?    [Talavera] We consider them brothers as we are struggling  for  the same cause, but the 3-80 Northern Front is totally  independent from those commanders.    [Reporter] Commander Chacal, excuse me if I insist, but do  you really have a great deal of faith that the government will  meet the agreements signed?    [Talavera] We have hope, as I said before, and we also have  faith. The fact of the matter is that we have our  apprehensions. On previous occasions the government has not met  its commitments, but we hope that this time they will not repeat  the same actions or that they will not fall into the vicious  circle of making promises that they don't keep.    [Reporter] Commander Chacal, what can you tell us about the  work in the labor unions carried out by the RN Superior Council  in Managua.    [Talavera] It has been very well done. Any organization that  seeks to unite the RN has my blessing. I congratulate the  commanders who have shown interest in the RN going down one road  under one leadership. I congratulate the general command and  the supporters who participated. Many of them in the party and  in the RN Supreme Council are actively participating to unite  the entire RN organization.    [Reporter] It would be interesting to know the scope of the  demobilization plan, because the government always claims it  lacks the funds needed to cover demobilization expenses. How  much money will be required to implement the plan?    [Talavera] That is true. The government always claims it  lacks funds for this purpose, although it has funds for other  activities. In reality, the needs and demands of peasants in  this area are very high. Our goals, however, are beyond the  government's promises and agreements. We have created  commissions to request international aid to lessen the  government's burden and to help peasants join the nation's  social and productive life.    [Reporter] Does that mean the government will have to resort  to credits from banks and to money that is not readily available  or that is obtained at a high cost? If you request  international aid, what will be the state's contribution?    [Talavera] We are not talking about specific amounts yet.  We do know that there are many social demands, that the  peasants need assistance and financial aid. The government has  many responsibilities toward peasants that it has not accepted.  We cannot give exact amounts. We are not saying the government  should give them handouts but that they should reincorporate  them into society and find ways to help peasants in the northern  region who have been totally neglected in the past years.    [Reporter] What will happen if the government does not  comply?    [Talavera] We are always ready to continue our struggle. We  will continue our efforts and present our demands. We will  resort to all civic and peaceful means to demand full compliance  with the agreements. Based on our experience, I know there will  always be problems, but we do hope we will not have to pressure  the government to ensure its total compliance. The negotiations  have just begun. It is a process, and we hope this time the  government will act in good faith.    [Reporter] Commander Chacal, what was the purpose of  Esteban's visit to Managua this weekend?    [Talavera] Esteban visited Managua for several reasons.  First he had to go to the police academy to receive a group of  demobilized 3-80 Northern Front members who are participating in  an intensive course before going to the municipalities where  they will be stationed. He also had to coordinate future  meetings with the central government, which I believe will be  headed by Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta. Those were the  main reasons for his visit, to receive the group of former  combatants in Managua and to create a direct channel between the  Government Ministry and the 3-80 Northern Front to avoid future  obstacles that could delay the negotiation process.    [Reporter] There is an interesting factor. The second chief  of staff, who I believe is Javier Carrion, has held talks with  the 3-80 Northern Front High Command. Do you feel you can trust  this top EPS [Sandinist People's Army] officer? We have heard  peasants say that there is still espionage and persecution. Do  you think you can trust him as member of the Army since he was  the one who talked to you?    [Talavera] We must accept certain things. We must talk with  the people who have power in Nicaragua. Those who have the  weapons are the ones who run the country. The Army has the  weapons and is involved in the struggle. The government sent  its representatives, and Colonel Carrion was one of them. We  participated in direct talks at the negotiating table.    We must admit, however, that we have our misgivings.  Security was one of the key points discussed at the meeting.  We know full well that our lives are in serious danger once we  demobilize. Therefore, one of the most critical topics we  discussed at the meeting, which was suspended on several  occasions, was security. We are afraid that once we demobilize  we could face direct persecution or be killed. The hundreds of  commanders who have been killed are proof of that. We must act  maturely in these negotiations to prevent persecution or attacks  in the future. We had to make this clear. One of the  agreements reached to give security to our troops was their  admission into the National Police.    [Reporter] What does that agreement entail? To what extent  would the police serve as a guarantee for the security of the  RN's 3-80 Northern Front?    [Talavera] Most of those demobilized in the northern area  are  former RN members. All 3-80 Northern Front fighters live in  this area and were born and raised here. After speaking to  them, they confirm that they intend to continue living here.  Therefore, this would help them a great deal, and they would  feel more confident as it would remove the tensions thanks to  the constant contact with their own people and organizations in  their own backyard. It is only logical. That does not mean we  do not feel at ease with Nicaraguans from other parts of the  country. It is really a reflection of the military problem, the  military conflict, which since last decade has been bloodier in  this area than anywhere else.</p>

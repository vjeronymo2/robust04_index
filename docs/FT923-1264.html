			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / More join ranks of the enemy within: The groundswell of Conservative opinion against the Maastricht treaty NO WONDER prime minister John Major has been adopting a Euro-sceptic tone of late. When he stands up to open today's emergency Commons debate on the government's economic policy, he will be more conscious than ever of the enemy within. It is the Conservative MPs who hold extreme doubts about the text of the Maastricht treaty. As he weighs whether or not he can push the treaty through parliament, Mr Major will be all too aware that the doubters' ranks are growing. A straw poll by the FT of Tory backbench opinion indicates that the number of MPs prepared to defy the government, if it pushes for the Maastricht treaty to be ratified without significant additions or amendments, has risen to at least 40. When the bill ratifying the treaty received its second Commons reading with a majority of 244 four months ago, 22 Tories voted against the government. Those who supported the government in May, but now say they could not back the bill on the Maastricht treaty if it returned to the Commons unamended, include: Sir George Gardiner, MP for Reigate; Mr Geoffrey Dickens, Littleborough and Saddleworth; Mr Michael Lord, Suffolk Central; Mr John Wilkinson, Ruislip-Northwood; Mr Andrew Hargreaves, Birmingham Hall Green; Mr John Whittingdale, Colchester South and Maldon; Mr John Townend, Bridlington; Mr Peter Griffiths, Portsmouth North; and Mr Michael Fabricant, Mid Staffordshire. In addition, Mr Roger Moate, MP for Faversham, who abstained on the second reading, said he would now vote against unless there were 'enormous amendments', while Mr Roger Knapman, MP for Stroud, who also abstained, said he would not support the treaty 'in anything like its present form'. The analysis - compiled from direct contact with a large number of Tory MPs  -showed a wide divergence of opinion. Discontent with the text of the treaty has increased markedly. But there were still those who saw no difficulty either with the treaty or the government's ability to have it ratified. 'I have no qualms about it whatsoever,' said Mr Robert Adley, MP for Christchurch. 'I think the prime minister has a substantial majority in favour across the parties.' In addition to the 40 or more potential rebels, there was a sizeable grouping of MPs who admitted to misgivings and stopped well short of pledging unconditional support. 'If there is any thought of bulldozing through the same thing again, they will find a lot of people like me hesitating,' said Mr James Hill, MP for Southampton Test. Mr Nigel Waterson, MP for Mr Ian Gow's old seat of Eastbourne, said: 'They cannot necessarily count on my support.' A further sobering feature for the government was the number of MPs elected for the first time at the general election in April who are among the most sceptical. Many of those signed the motion in June that called on the government to 'make a fresh start with the future development of the EC' in the wake of the Danish referendum. Most of those with reservations focused on the centralisation of powers and the process of economic and financial integration. Backing for a single European market was all but unanimous. On centralisation, many MPs called for a clearer definition of the concept of subsidiarity as set out in the treaty. The trouble with the present definition was that 'you could drive a coach and horses through it', according to Mr Fabricant, who said he would vote against ratification of Maastricht 'as it stands at present'. On financial integration, disillusioned MPs urged either extensive ERM reform or recognition that the system was dead. 'I don't want us to go back into the ERM, so I don't see how I can support Maastricht as it is,' said Mr Townend, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee. Sir Rhodes Boyson, a former minister, said: 'Any party who say after this we are going back into the ERM should be consigned to Devil's Island.' Circumstances would have to be 'very strange' for him to support the Maastricht treaty if it returned to the Commons unamended. Some MPs argued that the fault with the bill lay less in the text than the government's failure to outline adequately what the treaty said. 'It is not what is in Maastricht but what people think is in it,' said Mr Roger Sims, MP for Chislehurst. Many of the most sceptical prefaced their remarks by emphasising they were not in the anti-European camp. Mr Griffiths said opposition was now coming from 'committed Europeans' unhappy with the structures being proposed. There was a common view among Euro-sceptics that they had supported the government on the bill's second reading as a vote of thanks to Mr Major and foreign secretary Douglas Hurd for negotiating UK opt-outs on the social chapter and monetary union. Some were also influenced by the assumption - since dispelled - that their reservations would not be shared by significant numbers in other member countries. 'One swallowed the bits one didn't like on the assumption the rest of Europe was mad keen to go along,' according to one experienced MP, who said Maastricht was now 'holed under the water'. Mr Dickens said: 'It is nice to think we are not the only nation whingeing.' There were several calls for a British referendum, although others were just as passionately against such a step. A further group said the appropriate time for a referendum would be prior to any decision to opt into a single currency. Euro-enthusiast Mr Spencer Batiste, MP for Elmet, said: 'If there is to be a referendum, it should be when the option on a single currency is exercised.'</p>

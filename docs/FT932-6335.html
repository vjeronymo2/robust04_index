			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: State Bank of New South Wales slips into the red STATE Bank of New South Wales, the Australian public sector regional bank, has fallen into the red in the first half to the end of March after big increases in both doubtful debt write-offs and abnormal losses. After abnormals, the bank turned a ADollars 10.6m profit into an ADollars 89.6m (USDollars 62.4m) loss. This reflected a ADollars 95.9m abnormal loss mainly resulting from changed tax treatment. Before abnormals and tax, the bank turned an ADollars 15.5m profit into a ADollars 20.3m loss following a 46 per cent rise in doubtful debt charges to ADollars 109.8m. A tax credit of ADollars 26.6m put the bank ADollars 6.3m in the black before abnormals. Net non-accrual loans eased from ADollars 779.2m to ADollars 705.2m. On Wednesday, the bank, which is preparing for privatisation, resolved its exposure to FM Australia, the troubled entertainment group, through a sale to Village Roadshow. The sale, for about ADollars 93m, requires approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board, because Village Roadshow is owned 17.5 per cent by Anglo Television of the UK. Lend Lease Corporation, the Australian financial services group, has announced plans to raise between USDollars 175m and USDollars 200m through an issue of convertible bonds as part of the finance for its acquisition of a 15 per cent interest in Westpac, the Australian bank.</p>

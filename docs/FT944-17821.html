She hasn't said why, and nor will her lawyer, Monroe Inker, say if the two have met recently. 'I have been sworn to silence by my client,' says Inker. Can it be that Kennedy, who has been a Democrat senator for 32 years, is facing an unusually tough fight from Republican Mitt Romney, a venture capitalist and son of former Michigan governor, George Romney?</p>

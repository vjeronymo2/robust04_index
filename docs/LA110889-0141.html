			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BID TO RELEASE BAKKER REJECTED  </P> <P> A federal appeals court panel today refused to release jailed television  evangelist Jim Bakker while he appeals his conviction for fleecing millions  from PTL followers.  </P> <P> A three-judge panel of the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals said a motion on  behalf of the defrocked minister was not sufficient to refute evidence that he  might flee if released.  </P> <P> The judges said hundreds of letters from loyal followers did not provide a  basis for releasing Bakker. The letters were received in U.S. District Court in  Charlotte, N.C., where Bakker was convicted Oct. 5 of 23 counts of mail and  wire fraud and one count of conspiracy.  </P> <P> Bakker, 49, was sentenced Oct. 24 to 45 years in prison and fined $500,000. He  was immediately taken into custody and is serving his time at a federal prison  in Minnesota.  </P></p>

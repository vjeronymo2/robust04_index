			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kim Chong-tu] </F>   [Text] It was learned on 12 June that the ROK Government  plans to conduct the ROK-U.S. joint "Ulchi-Focus Lens-94  exercise" on a large scale for 14 days, from 22 August to 4  September, to inspect the nation's readiness for mobilization.    To inspect the nation's capabilities to mobilize resources  and recover damages, during the 22-27 Ulchi exercise, the  government plans to select Seoul as an exhibition city in  conducting exercises for preparing against disasters,  stabilizing the people's livelihoods, and maintaining the  government's functions.    According to authorities concerned, government ministries  will conduct surprise exercises of their own, as well. For  example, the Ministries of Home Affairs and Transportation will  conduct an exercise for mobilizing personnel and vehicles; the  Ministry of Agriculture, Forest, and Fisheries will conduct a  river-crossing exercise for barges loaded with grain and an  exercise for distributing grain; the Ministry of Health and  Social Affairs will conduct an exercise for guarding against  poisonous gas; and the Ministries of Home Affairs and Trade,  Industry, and Energy will conduct an exercise for preparing  against the rupture of electricity, water, and gas supplies.</p>

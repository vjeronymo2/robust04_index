			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kragujevac, 13 Feb (TANJUG) -- "If we were to accept  the unreasonable demand that only our artillery be removed -- by  20 km from our positions on the Sarajevo front line -- that  would mean that we have abandoned our territory and left the  Serb population with no protection and at the mercy of 50,000  poisonously religious fanatics and anti-Serb Muslim fighters,"  General Milan Gvero, deputy chief of the general staff of the  army of the Srpska republic, said today in the "Hallmark of the  Times" program on Kragujevac radio.    Saying that no one in his right mind could accept this  either  in a military or a human sense, Gvero stressed that immediately  after the withdrawal Muslim forces would take the Serb  positions. This is why he has demanded a sensible agreement in  the direction of peace.    "We must have guarantees that, if our army withdraws by a  single kilometer, the Muslim army will do the same and that  their infantry will not advance by a single inch. If there are  no such guarantees we are dutybound to remain where we are now,  because of the bloodshed and the people," Gvero added. In his  words, there is a false image in the world of Sarajevo as a  Muslim city. This is a territory which is Serbian in every  respect, so the term siege is inappropriate and at odds with the  facts.    The demand to tilt the balance of force to the detriment of  Serb forces is unrealistic and unfulfillable. In Gvero's view,  this is a criminal attitude to our territory, our people, and  our army.    General Gvero stressed that NATO's ultimatum was a  consequence of the emotions created by the Sarajevo massacre,  and it is a fact that the massacre was staged.    Asked to comment on President Clinton's statement that one  should not fear the Bosnian Serbs' air defense, which is  allegedly totally outdated and in poor repair, Gen. Gvero said:  "If someone attacks us for no reason whatever we will, just as  always in the past, find a way to neutralize the attacker. No  one should speculate as to what weaponry we possess. We have  enough weapons for effective defense. I believe that reason will  prevail, but if insanity prevails it will be met with an  appropriate reaction."</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Drugs improve heart patients' prospects The first strong evidence that cholesterol-lowering drugs reduce mortality and improve health in heart disease patients is published today. The five-year Scandinavian study followed 4,444 people who had suffered heart attacks or angina (chest pains). Half were treated with simvastatin, a medicine to reduce cholesterol levels in the blood, and half took dummy tablets. There were 30 per cent fewer deaths overall and 42 per cent fewer deaths from cardiovascular (heart) disease among the treated group. The trial was financed by Merck, the US drug company that makes simvastatin, but conducted independently by cardiologists in five Scandinavian countries. The results, presented at the American Heart Association annual meeting in Dallas, are published in The Lancet, a UK medical journal. The study steering committee called it 'the first and only clinical trial to demonstrate conclusively that long-term therapy with a cholesterol-lowering medicine substantially improves survival.' Prof John Kjekshus, the study chairman, said: 'Over the next five years we expect these findings to have a tremendous impact on standard treatment for heart attack and angina patients. The message is very clear: if you have a heart attack, you have to reduce cholesterol. It is as important as quitting smoking.' Until now, many doctors have been reluctant to prescribe drugs to reduce cholesterol, a fatty substance that clogs up blood vessels, because there has been no proof that they extend life. Other specialists who were not involved in the study agreed on its significance. 'I think this is the trial that was necessary to convince the sceptics,' said Dr Malcolm Law of St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. 'It should change medical practice.' Professor Brian Pentecost, medical director of the British Heart Foundation, also called the study 'very encouraging'. Merck is the world's leading manufacturer of cholesterol-lowering drugs. Its sales of simvastatin and lovastatin, a similar drug, amounted to Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) last year and could rise substantially if more doctors prescribe them for heart patients.</p>

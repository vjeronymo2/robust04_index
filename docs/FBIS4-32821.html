			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 27 May (NOTIMEX) -- Apolonio Ruiz Ligero,  Spanish secretary of state for foreign trade, disclosed here  today that Spain proposed Cuba step up the pace of the economic  reforms aimed at reorganizing the island's economy.    In a brief news conference, Ruiz said he met with Vice  President Carlos Lage and other members of the Cuban economic  cabinet, who explained the difficulties in accelerating these  changes. In any case, Ruiz added, Spain perceives that the  measures adopted by the Cuban Government, such as the  legalization of the possession of foreign currency and the  increases in prices and fees, are not isolated and form part of  a comprehensive package.    Ruiz lamented the drop in Cuba's capacity to export to Spain  as a result of the current economic crisis and indicated that if  the supply of Cuban merchandise increases, Madrid would be able  to increase its purchases. According to sources close to the  Spanish delegation, bilateral trade amounted to approximately  $290 million in both directions.    On Friday, Cuba and Spain expressed their interest in  extending their economic cooperation to areas other than tourism  by signing an agreement for the mutual promotion and protection  of investments. "This new generation agreement is very  important because it establishes confidence, legal security, and  an adequate framework for investors," Ruiz Ligero said after  signing the agreement at the end of two days of talks.    Ruiz also signed with Ernesto Melendez, Cuban minister for  foreign investment and economic cooperation, the final document  of the fourth meeting of the joint intergovernmental commission,  which held sessions in Havana. The two officials highlighted  the "simple, brief, smooth, and easy" way that the negotiations  took place, indicating that they reaffirmed Havana and Madrid's  political resolve to strengthen economic and financial ties.    "We have given ourselves the challenge of making sure that  in  the medium term, these relations will be good and that we will  be able to lay the foundations for greater cooperation in the  future," Ruiz stressed. He arrived in Havana on Wednesday.  "The negotiations were very simple and we can present our  economic sectors with substantial progress," the high-ranking  Spanish official said. He also met here with Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina and other officials.    "The increasing way that the Spanish entrepreneur is in our  market and in tourism investments bodes well for our work  prospects. We are very pleased with the results of the talks,"  Melendez said. Sources of the Cuban delegation told NOTIMEX  that "one of the basic conclusions is that investments are a  fundamental element for the development of relations and  everything possible must be done to increase them."</p>

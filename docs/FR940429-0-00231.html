			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters strongly objected to the proposal to include, as a specific basis for any of these proceedings against an institution or a third-party servicer, a substantial misrepresentation of the institution's educational program, financial charges, or employability of the institution's graduates by an institution or servicer under contract with an institution, as applicable. The commenters felt that this proposal would require a third-party servicer to monitor a client institution's marketing of its educational program, its admissions process and the appropriateness of the financial charges as well as the statements made, verbal or written, regarding the employability of the institution's graduates. One commenter suggested that the application of this provision be limited to third-party servicers that provide services such as marketing for institutions. One commenter suggested that misrepresentation of eligibility of a location be added to the violations subject to the imposition of a fine. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These provisions, with respect to third-party servicers, are aimed at just such servicers as those mentioned by one of the commenters_those that provide marketing or other services designed to represent an institution to prospective students and the public. However, the provisions can apply equally to any other third-party servicer that, in the conduct of its activities under a contract with an institution, deliberately misrepresents the nature of the institution's educational program or other relevant information. These provisions do not require a third-party servicer to take any special steps to monitor an institution's activities. The servicer being an agent of the institution is expected simply to avoid misrepresenting the institution. Subpart F of this part describes what constitutes misrepresentation. Misrepresentation of the eligibility of an institution's educational program clearly falls within the meaning of the term under subpart F and further may constitute fraud under the provisions of &sect;668.83, providing a potential basis for an emergency action. In the February 17, 1994, NPRM, the Secretary emphasized the seriousness with which he regards misrepresentation and the potential danger that misrepresentation poses to the Title IV, HEA programs. Commenters have not persuaded the Secretary to modify that view. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter felt that the Secretary should not pursue action against a contracting institution until the matter with the third-party servicer is resolved and also requested that the Secretary not fine both the servicer and the institution for the same occurrence. The commenter recommended that the proposed effective date of the suspension, limitation, or termination, which is at least 20 days after the mailing of the notice of intent, be revised to either 30 calendar days or 20 business days to allow sufficient time for preparation of a response. A commenter suggested that a fine be imposed only for material violations of Title IV, HEA program requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary reserves the right to initiate an action against an institution at any point at which the Secretary determines that the action is necessary. The protection of the Title IV, HEA programs requires this flexibility. Whether to impose fines on both an institution and a third-party servicer, and the amount of those fines, for the same occurrence depends on the degree to which each party caused or is otherwise responsible for the violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary considers 20 days generally to be sufficient time for the notified party to prepare a response. The Secretary notes, however, that this provision establishes a minimum time frame. The Secretary may allow additional time if the Secretary determines that the circumstances of the proceeding require more. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary does not consider it advisable to restrict the imposition of fines to material violations of Title IV, HEA program requirements. However, &sect;668.92 describes generally the factors that the Secretary may consider in determining the amount of a fine. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 668.87&blank;Prehearing Conference, 668.88 Hearing, 668.89 Authority and Responsibilities of the Hearing Official, 668.90 Initial and Final Decisions_Appeals, and 668.91 Filing of Requests for Hearings and Appeals; Confirmation of Mailing and Receipt Dates <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters questioned the absence of criteria in the regulations for the qualification of the hearing officer. The commenters also suggested that procedures should be established to allow for the participants to inform the hearing officer of details of the issues given the generally complex issues involved in most cases. The commenters recommended that the Secretary be required to provide a copy of the transcript described in &sect;668.88(d) to all parties within ten days of the hearing. Several commenters felt that any decision should be governed by a ``reasonableness'' standard to limit the liabilities of parties participating or providing servicing of the Title IV, HEA programs in good faith. The commenters thought that the process should allow for extenuating circumstances and that the hearing official should have the authority to interpret regulations and to rule them inapplicable. Another commenter believed that the hearing official should be bound by not only all applicable statutes and regulations but also other guidance deemed to be in effect by the Secretary to ensure that ``Dear Colleague'' letters and other written guidance from the Department of Education be included. One commenter believed that any prehearing conference with a third-party servicer should include any institution that has a contract with that servicer and who could potentially be affected by the Secretary's action. One commenter suggested that &sect;668.89 be modified to require that the hearing official be bound not only by ``all applicable statutes and regulations'' but also by all applicable judicial precedent, the Constitution, Federal statutes of general applicability, including the United States Bankruptcy Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter questioned the statement that if the hearing officer finds that a termination is warranted, the Secretary affirms that decision asking if the Secretary intends to automatically affirm the hearing official's decision. A few commenters suggested that an institution or third-party servicer should be able to introduce new evidence on appeal noting that the Secretary should have the opportunity to have complete information that may not have been presented at the original fact-finding sessions. These commenters thought that the emphasis in resolving the issue should be on arriving at the most fair and most logical conclusion as opposed to conforming to a stringent pattern or process. One commenter felt that the Secretary should not have a special process for fraud investigations and there should not be limitations placed on a hearing official's ability to act. The commenter believed that the proposed procedures would unfairly limit the due process procedures available to participants in the system and that the current procedures do not require further modification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

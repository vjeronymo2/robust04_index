			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> STEWART TURNS BAD TIMES TO GOOD  </P> <P> Coming down the stretch in the lead of the Byron Nelson tournament brought back  memories for Payne Stewart -- all of them bad.  </P> <P> But Stewart exorcised his personal demons Sunday with a three-under-par 67 at  Irving, Tex., to take a two-stroke victory over charging Lanny Wadkins.  </P> <P> "I feel I had something coming to me in the Dallas-Ft. Worth metroplex,"  Stewart said.  </P> <P> He was referring to his misfortunes in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area when, in  consecutive years during the 1980s, he lost the Colonial in nearby Ft. Worth,  lost again in this event, then lost again at Ft. Worth -- all in playoffs.  </P> <P> "In some of them, I beat myself," Stewart said. "You don't mind when somebody  beats you. You mind a lot when you beat yourself.  </P> <P> "I think I've learned not to beat myself."  </P> <P> Stewart, the PGA champion and a playoff winner in the Heritage Classic last  month, proved his point.  </P> <P> He was under fire by some of golf's best players -- Greg Norman, Mark  Calcavecchia and Wadkins -- but held to win the tournament he had established  as one of his career goals.  </P> <P> "Except for Bay Hill (where he resides), this is my most emotional victory," he  said. "This is as sweet as the PGA."  </P> <P> Wadkins, who made the last, and best, run at Stewart, predicted it could be the  start of greatness.  </P> <P> "I think Payne is just now learning to win," Wadkins said. "I think he is going  to be a great player for a long time."  </P> <P> Stewart finished with an eight-under-par total of 202 in the tournament that  was shortened to 54 holes because of early-week floods.  </P> <P> The victory was the seventh of his career and he joined rookie Robert Gamez as  the only other multiple winner on the PGA Tour this year.  </P> <P> The victory was worth $180,000 from the purse of $1 million and lifted  Stewart's earnings for the season to $496,491. It also lifted his career  earnings to $4,103,198, making him the seventh player to pass the $4 million  mark.  </P> <P> Another playoff appeared a distinct possibility when Wadkins made a brilliant  stretch run with a 65, best round of the tournament.  </P> <P> But Stewart preserved his a one-stroke lead with a five-foot par putt on the  15th hole, then pushed the margin to two with a five-footer for birdie on the  16th.  </P> <P> "I didn't think I had much chance," Wadkins said. "I kind of conceded him a  birdie on the 16th and that was enough. My hat's off to him. He's been knocking  on the door here a long time."  </P> <P> Calcavecchia had a 69 to tie Bruce Lietzke (68) for third at 207. Norman  finished with a 69 for 209.  </P> <P> Chi Chi Rodriguez shot a four-under-par 68 to edge defending champion Charles  Coody and George Archer by one stroke and win the PGA Senior tournament at Las  Vegas.  </P> <P> Rodriguez, who lost to Coody in a playoff in the tournament last year, strung  together three rounds in the 60s to finish 12-under and win his first  tournament of the year.  </P> <P> "This is the first time a 12 beats an 11 in Las Vegas," said Rodriguez. "I'm  real excited. It's been a long time."  </P> <P> Rodriguez, who was tied with Archer for the lead going into the final round,  birdied the first hole and never relinquished the lead. He had a two-shot lead  before making a bogey on No. 17, but he and Archer both parred the 18th.  </P> <P> Archer shot 69 in the final round, while Coody had a 67, missing a 20-foot putt  on 18 that would have forced a playoff.  </P> <P> Ayako Okamoto of Japan overtook Pat Bradley and Dawn Coe on with a  four-under-par 68 for a one-stroke victory in the $425,000 Sara Lee tournament  at Nashville, Tenn.  </P> <P> The victory was the 16th in nine years on the LPGA Tour for Okamoto, who earned  $63,750.  </P> <P> Bradley was three shots ahead after a 33 on the front nine, but she made four  bogeys on the back side and finished with a 73.  </P> <P> Coe had a chance to force a playoff, but bogeyed the final hole.  </P></p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Caricom faces customs union discord - Canute James looks at internal differences about an external tariff GOVERNMENTS of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) have decided to review the common external tariff amid indications that the controversial rates will be lowered. At their recent annual summit in Trinidad, the leaders were faced with the prospect that their increasingly frustrated efforts to create a regional common market in two years could be made more difficult unless a customs union is established. Despite several deadlines for its implementation, four Caricom members have refused to impose the tariff, saying it would be inflationary and damage fledgling light industries in need of protection. The ground-level difficulties have been exacerbated by criticism of Caricom's tariff levels from the US, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. This, coupled with unfavourable comparisons of tariffs being used or proposed by other regional groupings, has left governments concerned that the Caribbean Community could become uncompetitive in exports and investments if no changes were made to the common tariff. Caricom, which has a market of 5.5m people, comprises 13 English-speaking countries of the region, including Belize in Central America, the Bahamas, and Guyana in South America. It was established in 1973 with the aim of strengthening the economies of its members through increased regional trade and a common approach in trade negotiations with third countries. All members except the Bahamas, which is not a signatory of the trading agreements, have said they would implement the common tariff. The common external tariff imposes low rates of duty on imports which do not compete with goods produced within the community, but it sets high rates on any imports which are likely to injure domestic industry. The highest rate of duty within the community is 45 per cent and the lowest 5 per cent, replacing a structure in which tariffs ranged from 5 per cent to 70 per cent. Rates differ according to whether the imports are raw materials or finished products. Imported agricultural products attract the highest rate of tax in order to protect local agriculture, while inputs for agriculture, such as fertilisers and seeds, are subject to very low tariffs. The Jamaican government has proposed that the highest level be reduced to 20 per cent but some Caricom members consider this too drastic, claiming there is still need for protection in some sectors. The review ordered by the heads of government will be completed in time for an extraordinary summit at the end of October. It is widely expected that the highest tariff will be cut to 30 per cent, with an agreed timetable for further reduction. 'Caricom cannot have a common tariff implemented by some members and not by all,' said Mr P J Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister. 'High tariffs are out of step with global trends and inconsistent with the mood of the international marketplace.' This opinion is shared by his St Lucian counterpart, Mr John Compton, who argued: 'Industry cannot develop as a hot-house flower, artificially protected by high tariffs and quantitative restrictions. Industry must become efficient and not only compete in the domestic market, but seek to penetrate the export markets which are now available.' There are still doubts about the wisdom of changing the tariff. Mr Charles Maynard, the trade minister of Dominica, opposes any rethink of the structure and remains committed to the common external tariff as an instrument of protection for regional agriculture and manufacturing. There is agreement, however, that the community's agriculture sector must be protected. 'There will still be a need to safeguard the agriculture sector in the community because it will not be able to compete with subsidised imports,' said Mr Patterson. A senior official in Trinidad and Tobago's trade ministry said Caricom could not afford to become a 'dumping ground for subsidised agricultural products from countries such as the US where the annual subsidy on a farm cow is higher than the per capita income in some Caricom states.'</p>

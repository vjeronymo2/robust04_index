			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Market signals issue success for Tomkins TRADING IN Tomkins' nil-paid shares ended sharply up yesterday ahead of the November 30 deadline for the conglomerate's first call on shareholders under its Pounds 653m rights issue to fund the recommended bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall. The nil paid closed up 8 1/2 p at 20.5p and the underlying shares up 9p at 222p, giving every indication that shareholders will fully subscribe to the issue barring any unforeseen external disruption in the market as a whole. Once the rights issue is successfully away, Tomkins' next target is to keep its share price near the 227p level ahead of the first closing date of the RHM offer on December 7. At this price Tomkins' offer of 520p and 2.29 new shares for every four RHM shares is worth more than the 260p cash alternative, encouraging shareholders to stay with Tomkins rather than take the cash. As the share price headed strongly away from the 200p rights issue price, which it briefly threatened last week, Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive, was confident Tomkins would end up with a strengthened shareholder register. Advisers to Tomkins say there has been exceptionally high turnover in the nil paid shares, suggesting a significant shift in the make-up of the shareholder base. The fall in Tomkins' share price appears to have allowed some institutions to join the shareholder register when previously they were underweight or had thought the shares were too expensive. As shareholders have examined Tomkins' bid for RHM, much of the initial hostility and opposition to the Pounds 935m offer appears to have subsided. 'I have not had much hostility from the institutions that I have seen,' he said. 'What we misunderstood was the size of the rights issue in volatile markets. A number of shareholders decided to sell enough rights to take up the shares.' City observers say this is consistent with the fact that institutions are not flush with liquidity at the moment. Some institutions have also said that while Tomkins' shares were not attractive at the 261p level prevailing before the bid for RHM, they were attractive again after the 15 per cent fall in the price. The recent devaluation in sterling would have a beneficial impact on earnings this year. And recession in the US, where Tomkins has over three quarters of its business before the RHM deal, would end earlier than in the UK. Mr Hutchings said that some people had 'taken their eye off the ball'. 'This is a company (RHM) making Pounds 92m; the cost of funding a Pounds 935m acquisition with borrowings is Pounds 65m at 7 per cent so there is plenty of upside.' He also said he had been encouraged by the 'numerous, numerous' offers he had received for parts of RHM's bakery, grocery, milling and baking businesses which reinforced Tomkins' belief in its target's value. This did not necessarily mean Tomkins would break with its history of tending to run rather than sell businesses that it buys. 'We are builders of mature businesses in mature markets,' he said. While institutions appear to have been brought around to supporting the RHM deal, a number still question whether Tomkins' rating at a premium to the market will not have been smeared slightly with a food company rating which could hold back any substantial recovery from the current share price. Mr Hutchings insists this has never been the case before. 'We have gone into a lot of unfashionable businesses,' he says. 'We have not been rated for our industrial fasteners or our handguns or lawnmowers, and look at the likely progress. The next deal will not be in food, just as it won't be in lawnmowers as it won't be in handguns.'</p>

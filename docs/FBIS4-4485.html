			<p>BFN     [Text] The Pyongyang mission of the South Korean National  Democratic Front [SKNDF] held a news conference on 31 March on  the white paper published by the SKNDF Central Committee  exposing the nuclear arms development maneuvers of the South  Korean puppet clique.    The news conference was attended by reporters of newspapers,  news agencies, and broadcasting networks in Pyongyang and  foreign reporters.    Cho Il-min, chief of the mission, made remarks at the news  conference.    Cho Il-min informed the reporters of the white paper  published by the SKNDF Central Committee to expose the nuclear  arms development maneuvers of the South Korean puppet clique and  mentioned the purpose of publishing this white paper.    He pointed out that the U.S. imperialists and their stooges  are waging the anti-North and antisocialist smear campaign on  the pretext of the nonexistent nuclear issue of the North and  are expanding it in a step-by-step manner. Thus, they are  leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to a touch and go  war crisis. He said that because the South Korean people cannot  be the victims of such a slanderous nuclear smear campaign, the  SKNDF Central Committee decided to publish a white paper to  expose the truth of the situation before fair public opinion of  the world.    He said that the heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the  multipurpose research reactor in Taedok are used for the  development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula and the  basis for this is that enough plutonium capable of producing 34  nuclear warheads a year is being generated from the heavy water  reactor in Wolsong, and that plutonium is being generated from  the multipurpose research reactor in a more rapid manner than  heavy water. He also pointed out that the South Korean figures  involved in the nuclear development themselves confessed that  these reactors were introduced for the purpose of developing  nuclear weapons, and that since nuclear materials can be  extracted even during operation, supervision is difficult  [kamdokto kollanhada].    Cho Il-min, chief of the mission, expressed the hope that  the reporters will pay attention to nuclear weapons development  maneuvers in south Korea, and will report and create public  opinion in a fair and impartial manner.    He answered questions raised by reporters.    The white paper of the SKNDF Central Committee was  distributed to reporters at the news conference.</p>

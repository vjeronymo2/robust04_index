			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COFFEE prices recovered some of their recent losses at the London Futures and Options Exchange, but traders said activity remained sluggish in the absence of fundamental news. The September robustas position's Dollars 13 rise to Dollars 772 was 'on the back of New York', one explained. Dealers said the potential for further advances was limited because several producing countries were looking to sell at Dollars 10 to Dollars 20 above present levels. The COCOA market also reversed its downtrend, with the September position finishing at Pounds 597 a tonne, up Pounds 3 on the day, about in the middle of the day's trading range. 'People are cautious at the moment,' said one dealer, commenting on the low level of turnover. 'We're waiting for origin news and anything out of the Geneva talks (on the renegotiation of the moribund International Cocoa Agreement). At the London Metal Exchange most metals reversed their recent downtrends. The exception was TIN, which resumed the downward course that was interrupted on Tuesday. Dealers attributed the Dollars 55 fall that took the cash position below the Dollars 7,000-a-tonne mark to 'a negative technical outlook'. Compiled from Reuters</p>

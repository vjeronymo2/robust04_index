That means that  as of today there will be no new appointments to government  posts until the electoral process is concluded. The goal is to  grant the elections honesty. Here is what Planning Director  Armando Montenegro said:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Montenegro,  why  was the decision to freeze the government payroll made today?    [Montenegro] This is a normal decision during the period  before the elections to guarantee impartiality. The  appointments of employees and officials run the risk of  mid-level officials using them for political reasons.    [Reporter] How long will this decision remain in force?    [Montenegro] This will remain in force until after the  elections. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon] </F>   [Text] Twenty-five days after more than 100 Cubans intent  on leaving the country forced their way into the residence of  the Belgian ambassador, negotiations to persuade these people to  desist in their action remain deadlocked. Following the forced  entry into the Belgian Embassy, other groups of Cubans  separately entered into the German Embassy and the Chilean  Consulate, but in none of these cases have Cuban authorities  allowed the perpetrators of these illegal acts to leave the  country.    A recent statement issued by the Cuban Foreign Ministry was  explicit enough to make potential violators give up their goal  of violating the norms that regulate diplomatic sites worldwide.    This is not the first time groups have tried to use  embassies  or ambassador's residences as springboards for their immediate  exit from Cuba because they believe that the fanfare of the act  itself and the political character they want to give it will  ease the way.    The Cuban authorities' position has always been to firmly  deny such demands. In these new cases, as on previous occasions,  the Cuban authorities have insisted that people who commit such  crimes may return to their homes without facing charges,  although the perpetrators will not be exempt from punishment for  previous crimes or for crimes committed during the forced entry  into a diplomatic site.    The previously mentioned Cuban Foreign Ministry statement  was  even more dynamic in confirming that anyone who enters a  diplomatic site by force will never be authorized to leave the  country, even if they later abandon the site. By stating  clearly that people involved in such acts permanently lose the  right to leave the country, the Cuban Government has taken the  necessary steps to better protect embassies which, it seems,  have become the target of individuals who would like to leave  the island through this ill-suited path without being  politically persecuted.    As Belgian, German, and Chilean diplomats have seen, the  people they are harboring are not the object of political  persecution. Moreover, it is very clear that these individuals  are additions to a long list of Cubans who want to emigrate to  the United States, but the U.S. Interests Section in Havana  continues to grant visas with an eyedropper, denying visas to  most of applicants.    With the Foreign Ministry's recent statement, Cuba has  stressed its traditional policy of not giving in to pressure  exerted by people who purport to emigrate by illegal and even  violent means.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Low taxes urged for lottery and pools REDUCING tax on football pools and imposing a low rate of tax on the new national lottery would be the best combination for all parties, including the government, a study commissioned by the Sports Council has concluded. London Economics, the consultancy, found that a 7 per cent tax on national lottery proceeds would help beneficiaries, lottery players and government. Reducing the pools levy from 37.5 per cent to 30 per cent and increasing winnings accordingly would produce additional pools turnover of about Pounds 150m a year together with higher revenues for all concerned. The Treasury has not yet announced the level of tax to be imposed on the lottery but it is expected to be less than 20 per cent. Even taking into account the effect on tax revenues of the re-direction into the lottery of consumer spending from other areas, a 7 per cent lottery tax would mean the government losing nothing. It would also allow 35 per cent of turnover to go to the five nominated causes - Pounds 450m on the conservative estimate that the lottery would have revenues of Pounds 1.5bn a year. The five beneficiaries are sport, the arts, heritage, charities and the millennium fund. The London Economics study, which looked at 141 lotteries around the world, concluded that the proportion of prize money critically affects the success of a lottery. A one percentage point increase in the payout ratio of 50 per cent would raise turnover by about 6 per cent. Round the world the payout ratios for lotto games where players choose numbers are in the band 46 per cent to 50 per cent. Passive ticket lotteries are mainly 41 per cent to 45 per cent, while the payout on instant lotteries based on scratching cards 55 per cent to 65 per cent.</p>

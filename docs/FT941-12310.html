			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Australia No one can accuse Australian equities of poor performance in 1993, but their rise of around a third did lag the striking gains elsewhere in the Pacific rim. That raises the question of how the market will fare if international investors really tire of the fancier markets such as Hong Kong. Part of the answer is that an end to the liquidity flows from the US and Japan which have bolstered south east Asian markets would certainly dull the prospects for Australia as well. But international investors are still underweight in Australia, where markets could fare relatively better. Gains to date have not left industrial issues particularly expensive in relation to expected earnings increases of some 25 per cent in the current fiscal year. Resources issues could outperform if recovery in the industrial world brings the prospect of rising commodity prices. Australia's long recession forced companies to cut costs to the point where they are markedly more competitive. That has helped contain the current account. Measured as a proportion of output, last year's deficit of some 3.5 per cent of GDP was the lowest since 1980 even though exports have not yet been boosted by higher commodity prices. With inflation still low, there is also some prospect of a stronger Australian dollar. The biggest appeal should be Australia's resource-based economy. On past experience this should come into its own if a turnround in both the Japanese and European economies brings synchronised recovery in the industrial world in 1995. Admittedly, coal prices remain depressed, but metals are already starting to attract attention, as the response to Mercury Asset Management's international mining fund showed. This argument still assumes, though, in stark contrast to the latest US GDP figures, that there can be no meaningful recovery without a spot of inflation in its train.</p>

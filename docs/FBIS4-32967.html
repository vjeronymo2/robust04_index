			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patricia Gutierrez from the "Early Morning" </F> newscast]    [Text] The Mexican Government has expressed its total  disagreement with the preliminary decision by U.S. authorities  to apply taxes on Mexican exports of cement clinker and portland  cement. The U.S. Commerce Department based its decision on the  argument that Mexican export companies did not provide adequate  information on Mexico's cement sales to the U.S. market.    Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche said that if the final  decision by the U.S. Government in August turns out to be  adverse to the interests of Mexican cement companies, Mexico  will present the case to the NAFTA commission. Serra Puche  explained that a formal request will be presented to establish  an arbitration panel to consider the correct application of the  U.S. antidumping law in accordance with what is established in  Chapter 19 of NAFTA.    Meanwhile, Trade Negotiations Under Secretary Herminio  Blanco  will meet with the representatives of the affected companies to  evaluate the possibility of a public hearing that will allow  them to explain their arguments against the U.S. Commerce  Department's decision. The Mexican businessmen have 30 days to  submit comments on Friday's preliminary decision, which  established differential margins [margenes diferenciales] of  60.33 percent for Mexican Cement and 59.91 percent for the rest  of the companies.</p>

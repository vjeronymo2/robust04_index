			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Russian Government has expressed its deep  concern at developments in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone.  An appeal to the leaderships of Georgia and Abkhazia, which was  issued on Saturday [26 March] through Foreign Ministry channels,  expresses the hope that both sides involved in the conflict will  not allow the resumption of bloodshed and will remove obstacles  in the way of negotiations.    A few days ago the Georgian leadership requested the Russian  president and defense minister step up their efforts to settle  the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. Otherwise, Eduard Shevardnadze  said speaking on Georgian television, events in Abkhazia may  become uncontrollable and a fresh escalation of the conflict  unavoidable.    Today's appeal by the Russian Government expresses a  readiness to redouble its efforts to help the opposing sides  achieve mutually acceptable accords.</p>

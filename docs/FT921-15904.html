			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Pledge on Polish sell-offs POLAND'S new government will press ahead with privatising state-sector companies and will seek finally to untangle ownership rights, Mr Tomasz Gruszecki, the incoming senior privatisation official, has pledged. 'We want to privatise fast, but first we must clean up our present jungle and finally establish who owns what,' he said yesterday. State-sector companies needed to be told if they were to be privatised or not and a 'privatisation map' was to be drawn up. Mr Gruszecki reiterated his support for 'mass privatisation' plans, or a transfer of about 200 state-sector companies to foreign-managed investment funds, with distribution of shares in the funds to the populace. He said three top officials from his ministry had resigned with the change of government, but stressed that talks with western investors which had been started by the outgoing government would continue. The new government also plans to merge the Privatisation Ministry with those of Industry and Central Planning to form a single Economics Ministry. This would be headed by Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, now in charge of economic policy.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Colonel Igor Golin, chief of the Northwestern </F> Group of Forces Press Center; Captain First Rank Valeriy Gromak;  and Lieutenant Colonel Sergey Knyazkov: "Riga Provocation: Its  Organizers Must Answer for Their Actions"; first three  paragraphs are statement by Russian Federation Ministry of  Defense Directorate of Press and Information]    [Excerpts] "On the morning of 10 January armed groups of  Zemessargs (Latvian home defense guard) seized a number of  military installations on the outskirts of Riga belonging to the  Northwestern Group of Forces [NWGF]. Major General N.A.  Taylakov, deputy commander of the NWGF, and Major General A.D.  Vodopyanov, adjutant [pomoshchnik] to the NWGF commander for  work with personnel, went to the scene of the incident. In  response to their demand for the release of the facilities  seized the chairman of the suburb of Vidzeme ordered the  generals' arrest. The Russian generals were handcuffed and put  into a car, which was driven off in the direction of the Russian  border. NWGF Commander Colonel General L.S. Mayorov informed  the Russian defense minister of what had happened. Defense  Minister Army General Pavel Grachev issued instructions to place  the Russian troops stationed in Latvia on combat alert and to  step up security at facilities and buildings belonging to the  NWGF. Likewise, air-assault troop and military transport  aviation forces and resources were also placed on alert. The  NWGF commander reported the event to Latvian President G.  Ulmanis, who expressed bewilderment about what had happened,  issued instructions for the arrested parties to be released, and  offered his apologies. By 1700 hours the Russian generals and  all the occupied facilities had been freed.    "The Russian Federation Defense Ministry demands an  immediate  investigation and the punishment of those responsible. Any  violent, unlawful action against Russian servicemen, military  units, or facilities belonging to Russian troops will be cut  short in the most resolute manner. Responsibility for all  possible consequences in this instance lies with the local  authorities, who have an obligation to guarantee a normal  atmosphere for Russian military units."    [Signed] The Russian Federation Defense Ministry Information  and Press Directorate [passage omitted]    For justice's sake it should be acknowledged that the  Latvian  official authorities' reaction was immediate. Latvian President  Guntis Ulmanis declared that the home guards' actions were  illegal and that measures would be taken to bring about the  Russian generals' immediate release. By 1700 hours the generals  had been freed and conveyed to Riga, and by the end of the day,  according to a statement by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, official apologies had been received via the Russian  Federation Embassy.    As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA learned from Inart Skukinsh [name as  transliterated], ITAR-TASS correspondent in Riga, an emergency  session of the Latvian National Defense Council chaired by  Guntis Ulmanis took place in the evening. It adopted a decree  comprising the following five decisions: to examine the  essentials of the emergency which had taken place; to relieve  Andrejs Rucs, chairman of the Vidzeme district council and  deputy chairman of the Riga assembly, of his duties; to conduct  official inquiries within the home guard and municipal police of  the relevant Vidzeme precinct; to prepare a response for Russia  on what happened; and to clarify normative acts regulating the  transfer and receipt of Russian Army property.    At an emergency session of the Latvian Government held at  midnight, Republic Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs evaluated the  event as a provocation.    Late in the evening Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs  Andrejevs  spoke on Latvian television. He noted that "armed conflict was  a real threat." And in a statement for the press circulated the  same evening the Latvian Republic Foreign Ministry made it known  that "the Latvian Government will do everything possible to  ensure that actions of a provocative nature which may damage  Latvia's prestige in the world and complicate the domestic  political situation in the republic will not be allowed to  happen in the future."    The conflict would appear to have been defused, and 11  January talks began between the heads of Russian and Latvian  government delegations. However, nobody should be left in any  doubt that Russia will take all requisite measures to protect  its citizens, all its citizens, but particularly those in  military or diplomatic uniform, from this type of encroachment.</p>

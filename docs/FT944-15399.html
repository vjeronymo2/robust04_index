			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Bank of Italy wins appointment row The Berlusconi government yesterday backed down in its long-running dispute with the Bank of Italy over the nomination of a new director-general from within the bank. The central bank has fought a bruising battle over its second highest post with the right-wing coalition to ensure an insider replaced Mr Lamberto Dini, who left the job to become treasury minister in May. Yesterday the bank's governing council named as a replacement Mr Vincenzo Desario, the junior of the two deputy directors who form part of the four-man executive directorate of the Bank of Italy. The 61-year-old Mr Desario is a compromise candidate chosen over Mr Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, the senior deputy director, technically the first in line for the job but vetoed by the Berlusconi government as being too close to the former Ciampi administration. In a statement yesterday the Bank of Italy stressed its appreciation of Mr Padoa Schioppa. The Desario appointment has to be approved by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and the cabinet. Bank of Italy officials yesterday pointed out that an appointment proposed by the governing council, composed of chairmen of the bank's regional offices, has never been turned down. If the government climbs down as expected and accepts Mr Desario, it still leaves unresolved the issue of Mr Desario's successor. The governing council yesterday avoided discussion of filling the fourth place on the directorate. The government is considered unlikely to take this defeat lying down and yesterday Mr Antonio Parlato, junior minister at the treasury for the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, said legislation to change the statutes of the Bank of Italy would shortly be placed before parliament. The opposition welcomed the outcome. A spokesman for the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) said: 'The government has been unable to impose its line, while the Bank of Italy in the midst of hundreds of difficulties has managed to defend its autonomy and mark a point in its favour.' The government had sought to bring in an outsider, arguing the bank needed new blood. This was seen both within the bank and outside as an attempt by the executive to exert greater control over the bank, especially regarding interest rates policy.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: A different view of the purpose of work Sir, Richard Brown, of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce (Letters, September 8), claims that the Social Chapter amounts to 'shackles'. That says it all. It is typical of a representative of British commerce to portray the social wage as a 'handicap'. This illustrates why we will never be at the heart of Europe as long as that view prevails among commerce and government in the UK. The letter also illustrates the difference between the left and right in Europe and the right in the UK. Everybody else believes the purpose of work and commerce and, indeed, civilisation is to improve the working, living, social and cultural conditions of the people generally. Mr Brown presumably believes the sole purpose of commerce is to make the rich richer and the poor poorer. I would fully endorse European Commissioner Padraig Flynn's concept of a World Social Chapter. Indeed, I believe it is essential unless free trade is to result in beggar-my-neighbour policies on a world scale which will deprive the workers of the Pacific Rim of any improvements while removing the hard-won gains from our people.

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: A testing time for Dobson Park - Andrew Bolger reports on a mining equipment joint venture REGARDLESS of the outcome of Mr Michael Heseltine's review of the pit closure programme, Britain's mining equipment industry faces a testing time on the home front. Dobson Park, which plans to put its hydraulic pit support and conveyor business into a joint venture with Meco International, its main UK rival, said both companies had been facing an inexorable decline in their domestic market base, particularly since the announcement in October of British Coal's plan to close 30 of its existing 50 pits. Dobson said: 'The board hopes that the subsequent review initiated by the president of the board of trade will result in some amelioration of the closure programme but notwithstanding this, there seems little doubt that a further material decline in the demand for the division's mining equipment products will follow.' The Association of British Mining Equipment Companies estimates that its members export Pounds 400m from a total annual turnover of Pounds 900m. But the association has told the pit closure review that international sales will decline without a strong home market. Abmec represents 50 manufacturers, with a combined workforce of 22,000. It says that during the last four years, British Coal shrinkage has caused 54,000 redundancies among its members. 'The impact on members' finances has been severe, consequently many research and development programmes, which would have assisted in the exploitation of our overseas markets, have had to be cut. Many of our members will not survive further redundancies if the pit closures proceed.' If UK pits are reduced from 50 to 20, the association claims a further 15,000 employees would have to go. In addition it estimates that the value of exported mining equipment would be cut by a third. Dobson's mining equipment division and Meco have both shed about 1,000 jobs over the last three years. Dobson employs about 1,200 people, 250 of them overseas, while Meco has about 1,700 employees, several hundred of whom are in the US. The new joint venture, Longwall International, will be strong in its international markets. Dobson and Meco supply all British Coal's hydraulic pit supports for longwall seams. These inch forward, supporting the roof as a cutter tears out the coal. Between them they have 80 per cent of the UK market for conveyors, which take the coal away. A full-face support installation, comprising between 120 and 150 units powered by hydraulic jacks, costs between Pounds 6m and Pounds 8m. Longwall will have about 50 per cent of the US market for roof supports and face conveyor equipment, and strong positions in South Africa and Australia. Its main competitors are two German companies, Hemscheidt and Westphalia-Becorit, but analysts said the UK group should benefit from the recent devaluation of sterling. Although there is considerable scope for rationalisation of Longwall in areas where the two companies compete directly, Mr Alan Kaye, Dobson Park's chairman, said there were also a lot of complementary activities. Dobson had tended to concentrate on selling capital equipment, whereas Meco had focused more on the aftermarket, rebuilding and refurbishing equipment. Dobson's strong American operation would be able to use Meco's three US workshops. Mr Kaye will be the first chairman of Longwall and its chief executive will be Mr Adrian Buckmaster, Meco's chairman and chief executive. In their most recent results, Meco made trading profits of Pounds 8.6m on sales of Pounds 143.3m and Dobson Park's mining equipment division made trading profit of Pounds 7.4m on sales of Pounds 101m. Dobson Park is contributing net assets of Pounds 25m to the joint venture, and Meco is putting in assets worth a net Pounds 16m. To offset the disparity Dobson Park will receive a guaranteed income stream from preference shares in Longwall and property rental. Dobson Park and the current shareholders in Meco will each own 50 per cent of Longwall's issued share capital. To balance the disparate interests of the shareholders, both Dobson Park and the Meco management will each have 35 per cent of the voting rights of Longwall, the remaining 30 per cent being held by Dowty Group, Westpac Banking Corporation and National Westminster Bank. Although the link-up clearly raises concerns about competition, Mr Kaye said he was reasonably confident of clearance by the UK regulatory authorities. It seems unlikely that Mr Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, who has already tried to close most of the UK's pits, would block this attempt to form a more significant force in the international mining equipment market.</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Hanson expected to show quarter-on-quarter fall HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, is expected to announce its first quarter-on-quarter fall in pre-tax profits for 28 years when it publishes its first quarter results on Thursday. Analysts' forecasts for Hanson's three months to December 31 range from Pounds 220m to Pounds 240m, compared with Pounds 241m in the comparable period. The expected fall in profits is partly explained by the continuing effects of the recession on both sides of the Atlantic. Lord Hanson, chairman, has said that the UK recession was likely to continue to affect Hanson's business for the first half of the year. While Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries, the group's US arm, told shareholders last month that 'the US economy remains sluggish' and that he did not anticipate any beneficial effect until at least late 1992. However, last year's first quarter figures were also boosted by the last two-month contribution from Cavenham Forest Industries through a Dollars 1.3bn swap for its 49 per cent stake in Newmont Mining. Mr Nyren Scott-Malden, conglomerate analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'The difficulty of getting organic growth from the mature businesses will force the group to continue to grow by acquisition, which is becoming more difficult as the group gets larger.' Lords Hanson and White are to address institutional shareholders, representing about 80 per cent of the equity, at a meeting in London on Friday.</p>

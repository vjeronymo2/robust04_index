			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Riverso - mutual benefit to Barings As if Alitalia chairman Renato Riverso did not have enough to do piloting Italy's state airline through a turbulent restructuring, he has now taken on the chairmanship of Baring Brothers (Italia), writes Andrew Hill. There are five professionals in Barings' Milan office who maintain close contact with another five-strong team in London. Small beer, compared with the sprawling Alitalia empire, or Riverso's previous remit as chairman and managing director of IBM Europe. Nevertheless, Riverso, 61, sees the job taking up '10 or 20 per cent' of his time, as against 50 per cent at Alitalia. Paradoxically, he thinks supporting foreign competition could give a boost to the underdeveloped Italian investment banking sector. 'The Italian financial world needs to grow in knowledge and experience in the various segments of the business, and this is an area where the contribution of foreign banks is vital,' says Riverso. Barings, London's oldest merchant bank, is keen to advise on more privatisations, and expand corporate finance advice to the country's thriving small- and medium-sized companies. Indeed, the only area in which the new recruit is unlikely to benefit Barings is in winning more business from Alitalia itself: the airline is advised by JP Morgan, admits Riverso.</p>

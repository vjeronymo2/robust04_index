			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Referendum decisions shake Europe BOURSES which had appeared in the morning to shrug off Denmark's surprise 'No' vote against the Maastrict treaty changed their minds after France called its own referendum on European political and economic union, writes Our Markets Staff. Ironically, Copenhagen apart, Paris had the worst experience of the day. Frankfurt moved from indifference, through cautious concern just before the official close to further losses in blue chips after hours, but there were signs there of a recovery in the late afternoon. PARIS began to weaken immediately the market opened with the fall accelerating after President Mitterrand's announcement. Having spent much of the morning resisting a descent through the 2,000 barrier, the index sped to an intraday low of 1,976 before staging a slight recovery just before the close. The CAC-40 ended down 32.26 or 1.6 per cent at 1,992.61 in volume of FFr2.55bn. The financial sector was hit as the franc came under pressure in the currency markets, Paribas falling FFr12.90 to FFr401.6 and Societe Generale by FFr21.00 to FFr520.00. Other news had its effect. Eurotunnel, weak recently, with some analysts commenting that investors may have felt that, on technical grounds, the price had now fallen as far as it was likely. Promodes tumbled FFr169.00 to FFr3,430 on Tuesday's expectation of 12 per cent growth this year, which has led to a number of forecast revisions ahead of tomorrow's analysts' meeting. Peugeot lost FFr12.00 to FFr777.00 after disappointing sales figures earlier in the week, while dealing in Dassault Electronique was suspended at FFr180.00 ahead of a restructuring announcement after the close. Among oils Total lost FFr5.60 to FFr258.40 and Elf shed FFr6.60 to FFr392.40. FRANKFURT moved from a 0.84 rise to 719.06 in the FAZ at midsession to a 12.81 fall to 1,788.58 in the DAX at the close. Turnover rose from DM5.9bn to DM6.9bn. Mr Horst Greven of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that blue chips lost a lot of ground in the last half hour of official trading, suggesting protective mark-downs by dealers. The relationship between equities and futures in the afternoon indicated another 5 points off the DAX in the post-bourse, said Mr Greven, but at the end of it equities seemed to be gaining ground again. Drug, or drug-associated companies were down again, Schering dropping DM31.50 to DM755 after a DM6.80 fall on Tuesday on government proposals for a two-year freeze on pharmaceuticals prices. Gehe, the leading drug wholesaler, dropped DM45 to DM919; Altana and Bayer, both with important pharmaceuticals arms, fell DM22.50 to DM623.50, and DM4.80 to DM290. MILAN recouped some of the opening losses triggered by the Danish vote, the Comit index closing 2.99 lower at 497.32. Fiat and Montedison, which both lost ground at the official closings, rebounded in later kerb trading to end L68 better at L5,474 and just L3 lower at L1,500 respectively. Banks were hit harder, Banco di Roma and Credito Italiano lost more than 2 per cent with Mediobanca and San Paolo down by slightly less than 1 per cent. A number of bourses fell by a reactive 1 per cent or less. ZURICH's SMI index of leading shares fell 14.4 to 1,915.8. Dealers blamed the French referendum move, but they also said that Swiss chemical stocks also followed Tuesday's Wall Street weakness in chemicals. AMSTERDAM saw Fokker actively traded on rumours that merger talks with Dasa may be in trouble. The aircraft manufacturer lost Fl 1.20 to Fl 34.30, while the CBS Tendency General index declined 0.9 to 130.2. STOCKHOLM opened 1.3 per cent lower, but recovered steadily to end at its high for the day as the Affarsvarlden General index closed 8.30 down at 983.90. VIENNA recovered from early loses. The ATX index closed 4.84 up at 1,006.93, its highest level since the beginning of April. Among the most active stocks OMV rose Sch16 to Sch938 on news that it had made a new discovery of oil in Libya. The textile manufacturer, Lenzing, gained Sch2 to Sch1,030 in spite of announcing a 38 per cent fall in 1991 operating profit. DANISH equities opened the day 8 eight per cent down after yesterday's referendum rejecting the Maastricht treaty, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. Prices recovered steadily in heavy trading throughout most of the day, but an hour before the official close the computerised trade registration system broke down and brought business to a halt.  The market was taken by surprise by the referendum result. Few brokers had taken the possibility of a 'No' vote seriously, especially after late opinion polls had pointed to a majority in favour. The KFX index slipped in early trading to 94,330, a fall of about 6 per cent, but when trading halted it was back to 96,100, a fall of 4.1 per cent on the day. The all-share index crashed by 12.60 to 335.13, down 3.6 per cent. Turnover was DKr412m, almost twice the daily turnover in recent weeks.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUNE 3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes   Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1194.80  1195.35  1195.52  1193.29  1189.67  1184.65  1184.84  1186.81  ----------------------------------------------------------------------          Day's High  1196.24            Day's Low  1184.61  ----------------------------------------------------------------------      Jun 2         Jun 1       May 29         May 28        May 27     1200.27       1196.12     1199.58        1195.22??     1194.56  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).                               ??

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Mexico names banks set to be privatised MEXICO'S Ministry of Finance has announced that the next four of the country's state-controlled banks to be privatised will be Banamex, Confia, Banco Oriente and Bancreser. Banamex is Mexico's largest bank, and the government was originally expected to wait until the end of the year before selling it. The bank has over 750 branches, 30,000 employees and Dollars 18.5bn of assets. On the basis of the 30 per cent of the bank's equity traded on the bolsa, it is worth over Dollars 2.5bn. The battle for control of the bank is expected to be between Mr Roberto Hernandez, head of Accival, Mexico's biggest and most successful brokerage, and a syndicate which includes Mr Fernando Senderos, head of Desc, a large conglomerate, and the brokerage InverMexico. Some 20 per cent of the bank will be sold to members of the banks regional boards. The other three banks are small and are unlikely to fetch more than Dollars 250m. Confia, which is profitable, may be bid for by Inverlat, another brokerage. Bancreser is one of only three of the 18 state-controlled banks which are fully owned by the government.</p>

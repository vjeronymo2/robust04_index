			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 12, RIA -- Russian President's Press  Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov and Head of the Presidential  Administration Sergey Filatov were present today at the founding  congress of Russia's Democratic Choice Party [RDCP]. However,  neither did they address the congress, nor did they make any  statements on the president's behalf.    "I'm not a bit surprised that Russia's Democratic Choice  Party has received no congratulations on its creation. Our  relations with him (the president) are good and constructive  enough so as to do without such curtsies," the party's leader,  Yegor Gaydar, told a briefing today.    "Such congratulation messages are usually prepared by those  being congratulated," Sergey Filatov told a RIA correspondent,  adding that it's not worth paying that much attention to the  absence of such a message.</p>

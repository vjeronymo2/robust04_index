			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Technology: Coming up with the write stuff - A new product which reads handwriting A software package that dramatically improves the ability of computers to recognise handwritten characters has been devised by California-based Palm Computing. Called Graffiti, the package takes a different approach to earlier attempts at handwriting recognition by teaching users to write characters in a unique way. The software recognises them and translates them into computer text. Palm says Graffiti achieves 100 per cent character recognition - a feat other systems cannot come close to matching - after a short time spent by the user learning the required characters. The software could boost sales of small, hand-held computers, called personal digital assistants. PDA sales have so far failed to meet the levels predicted by market analysts a year ago. They have floundered partly because of their disappointing performance in recognising handwritten text, which users enter using a special stylus instead of a keyboard. Producing PDAs that can recognise handwritten characters has proved a punishing challenge. Apple Computer promised that its Newton MessagePad could recognise complete words. But it took users considerable time and effort to teach the Newton to recognise their handwriting, and even then the device often misread the text. Graffiti presents users with a box measuring 1 sq in on the computer display screen, into which they write single letters one after another; each new letter overwrites the last, and appears in computer text on the PDA screen. Most characters are written in a way very similar to that in which most people write already, but seven characters, including the letters 'k' and 'a' are written slightly differently to minimise confusion between letters and numbers. According to Kimball Brown, analyst at market research firm Dataquest: 'It basically teaches people how to write so that the PDA will recognise their characters, instead of trying to teach the PDA how to recognise a wide variety of different handwriting.' The software also allows users to enter large blocks of text, such as commonly used phrases, by writing a two-character abbreviation. Ed Colligan, vice-president of marketing at Palm Computing, says the time it takes to learn the system will be 'more than compensated for by the increased capabilities Graffiti provides'. Palm is encouraged by the results of focus groups involving 80 users, in which more than 90 per cent of Newton and Tandy Zoomer PDA owners who tried Graffiti said they would buy it. The company claims several leading computer manufacturers plan to include Graffiti with new PDAs and hand-held computers. But it says it will not sell an exclusive licence to any single manufacturer. 'We see Graffiti as an enabling technology. If it helps boost sales of PDAs and hand-held devices everybody will benefit, and we can sell more of our other applications,' explains Colligan. Graffiti is also likely to be used in new types of pager. Since its screen requirement is so small, leading pager manufacturers such as Motorola plan to introduce products that will allow users to send short messages quickly by writing on a small screen with a special stylus. 'Graffiti is a significant technology breakthrough which enables development of pocket-sized devices with robust data input capabilities,' says Doug Brackbill, vice-president at US-based wireless communications firm Mobile Telecommunication Technologies. Graffiti recognises all Roman-alphabet characters and Greek mathematical symbols. Palm is working on a Japanese version, and hopes Graffiti will become an industry standard. In the US Graffiti costs Dollars 79 (Pounds 50) and is available in versions for the Apple Newton, Tandy Zoomer and AST GridPad. A version for PDAs based on General Magic's Magic Cap and Microsoft WinPad systems is forthcoming. The product will be available from European suppliers in the next few weeks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Among the issues raised in the discussions U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher held in Israel was the  option that the agreement with Syria be implemented in stages,  spread over five to eight years. This was reported by our  political correspondent Shlomo Raz. Jerusalem believes that if  al-Asad is made aware of the nature of the permanent agreement  between the two countries at an early stage, he will be willing  to accept the stages of the interim agreement Israel is offering.    Yesterday, the offer raised at the time by James Baker --  that U.S. forces be stationed on the Golan Heights -- was also  discussed. The parties further discussed the economic aid Israel  would receive from the United States if an agreement is signed  with Syria.    Senior political sources further told our correspondent that  in Damascus, Christopher will discuss bilateral Syrian-U.S.  issues such as removing Syria from the list of terror sponsoring  countries, Syria's status in Lebanon, and its involvement in the  international drug trade. Syria will also be asked to lift its  boycott on the multilateral talks.</p>

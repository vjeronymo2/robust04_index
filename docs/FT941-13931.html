			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: If the price is right the choice is big - There are more types of mortgage on offer than ever. Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Bethan Hutton consider their infinite variety Many prospective house buyers have been biding their time until the market bottomed out, but estate agents and would-be sellers are now hoping that recent rises in house price indices will flush buyers into the open. If you are one, and particularly if you are a new buyer, the choice of mortgage may be greater than ever before. There are traditional variable rate loans and many fixed-rate mortgages are available. In addition, some lenders have introduced mortgage packages to help borrowers pay off mortgages more quickly than the usual 25-year term. How to pay back the mortgage The choice may at first seem overwhelming, but all mortgages fall into two basic types: repayment or interest-only. This division is created because any loan comprises two parts: the original capital borrowed and the interest. Repayment mortgages Your monthly repayments cover both the interest and capital so that at the end of the traditional 25-year term, the whole loan has been paid off. The main virtue of this type of mortgage is its simplicity. As long as you maintain monthly commitments, the loan is guaranteed to be paid off at the end of the term. The main drawback is that each time you move, you have to redeem the mortgage and start from scratch with another loan. Since you will usually be paying more in interest than capital in the early years of the mortgage, you could find that your payments are mostly of interest if you move frequently. It can be argued that although repayment mortgages are safe, interest-only loans are better because the borrower can invest the portion which would otherwise go towards paying off the capital, giving him the opportunity to make money over and above the original loan. Interest-only mortgages As the name suggests, your monthly contribution only covers the interest on the original sum borrowed. At the end of the 25-years, the onus is on you to pay off the capital in one go. This method obviously has its attractions at times of relatively high inflation. In 1969, the average house cost Pounds 4,640, an amount which seems enviably small today. Neverthless, you cannot leave everything to inflation, particularly in times of low inflation. The mortgage savings packages suggested by lenders are all equity-linked - an endowment, a pension, or a personal equity plan. Endowment mortgages still account for most new mortgages, although they have fallen from their 1988 peak. Their popularity is due in no small part to firm recommendation by banks and building societies, who earn commission on their sale. Your monthly payments consist of the interest to the building society and a premium to an insurance company, which invests the money on your behalf and also throws in some life assurance. Mortgage-linked endowments are usually for a fixed 25-year term. You need to continue them to maturity to get the full benefit, so once you have one, you carry it with you each time you move, although the underlying mortgage may be switched to a different lender (see below). Pension and personal equity plan-linked mortgages occupy the 'niche' end of the market and are both highly tax-efficient. However, many do not like the idea of using some of their pension savings to pay off their mortgage. Pension mortgages are also inflexible because the benefits cannot be taken until retirement age. This can mean making interest payments for more than 25 years if you are a young borrower, which is a needlessly expensive procedure. Peps allow you to invest up to Pounds 9,000 annually in the stock market with income and capital gains free of tax. However, you are at the mercy of stock market fluctuations. Some lenders, notably Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society, will allow you to take out an interest-only loan without linking it to a specific product and leave it up to you to decide how to invest to repay the capital sum. Fixed rates With mortgage and interest rates at 20-year lows, people have been rushing to fix their interest payments. The most recent Council of Mortgage Lender figures for the third quarter of 1993, show that 61 per cent of new mortgages taken out were fixed rate, compared to 27 per cent just one year earlier. The costs of a fixed rate mortgage include paying a booking or administration fee of Pounds 200-Pounds 300. Try to avoid fixed rates tied to insurance-related products. And there will be early redemption penalties  -the fee for early repayment of part or all of the loan. Choosing a short-term fix of, say, three years or less, leaves you exposed to the risk that the fix ends just as interest rates rise again. But fixed-rate offers of more than five years are likely to be higher than the standard variable rate of 7.64-7.74 per cent. Reducing the burden Stepping up repayments If you are lucky enough to find monthly repayments easily affordable now that interest rates are low, you will save on interest if you reduce the size of your original borrowing. This option becomes more attractive as monthly payments become more expensive. Mortgage interest tax relief will be restricted to 20 per cent (from 25 per cent) in the 1994-95 tax year and to 15 per cent the following tax year (see table). Miras remains capped on the first Pounds 30,000 of the loan. You should talk to your lender about the best way of making lump sum repayments. In most cases, you will need to state that the money is for repaying the capital and instruct the lender to recalculate your monthly interest payments accordingly. Otherwise, most lenders will treat the money as overpayment of interest and will not take it into account until the end of their financial year. It has never been in lenders' interest to encourage repayment of capital, since they lose interest. However, Yorkshire Bank, a tiny player in the mortgage market, today launches its Flexible Payment Mortgage which encourages borrowers to step up their repayments, although they can drop back to the minimum level if they need to. This minimum payment level is set at 8 per cent. Since the bank's current variable rate is currently 7.65 per cent, the overpayment of interest is taken into account. Lump sum repayments of as little as Pounds 25 can be made and interest is calculated on a daily basis so that the next payments reflect the lower interest. The borrower can also choose the date on which to make the payments and whether to do so on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis. The fee for the mortgage is Pounds 150 - the same as for the bank's standard repayment mortgage. A small increase in monthly payments can make a huge difference. If you paid the minimum on a Pounds 60,000 loan from the bank, monthly payments would be Pounds 468.39 and the interest would amount to Pounds 76,341 at the end of the 25 years. But if you decided to overpay by less than Pounds 7, so that monthly payments were Pounds 475, you would wipe Pounds 14,046.56 off the interest. UCB Home Loans has a similar product but charges Pounds 25 each time you vary the payment. Old endowments First-time buyers are not the only ones with mortgage choices. Existing home-owners can also take their pick of repayment or interest only mortgages, with all the different repayment methods. But if you already have an endowment policy taken out to cover a previous mortgage, your decision becomes more complicated. If you want a repayment mortgage, what do you do with the endowment? If you choose an interest-only loan, what happens if the endowment is not enough to cover a new loan on a bigger property? Ian Darby, of specialist mortgage bankers John Charcol, says the first piece of advice must be to hang on to the endowment. Since these are long-term savings vehicles, you will get the highest return if you carry on paying premiums into the policy until its scheduled maturity date (but see below for other options). If you want a straight repayment mortgage this time, the endowment policy will become redundant as a mortgage repayment method, but you can keep it going as a free-standing savings policy - it is simply no longer assigned to the building society. This is only a good idea if you can afford to pay capital and interest on the new loan in addition to endowment premiums. Alternatively, if you have an endowment due to deliver, say, Pounds 100,000, but you need to borrow Pounds 150,000 for your new property, you could structure the new mortgage so Pounds 50,000 is repayment, and the remaining Pounds 100,000 is interest-only, covered by the existing endowment. Or you could make the whole mortgage interest-only, and then choose whether you want a second endowment or perhaps a Pep to cover the extra Pounds 50,000. Darby says building societies are becoming more flexible about repayment methods, so other savings vehicles, such as unit or investment trusts, or employee share option schemes, could be built into the equation. If your existing endowment is due to mature in 15 or 20 years' time, you could consider repaying the rest of the new mortgage over the same period, rather than going for the usual 25 years. While interest rates are low, and if you have spare income, this could be worthwhile and affordable. Cancelling the endowment If for any reason you cannot afford to carry on paying premiums on your existing endowment, there are three main options. But Darby warns: 'Virtually all the alternatives, from surrender, to auctioning your policy, to making it paid up, do not represent good value, given the investment that people have already made in their premiums.' Making the policy 'paid up' means that you pay no further premiums, but the money you have already paid is still invested, and continues to grow until the original maturity date. When it matures, the policy will not be worth as much as if you had paid all the premiums, but there may still be a decent lump sum. If you do not want to pay any more, and you would rather cash the policy in, you can either surrender the policy to the life company, or sell it to another investor, through an auction or a broker. You usually get more by selling than surrendering, but much less than by keeping it on. If the endowment is less than five years old, or if it is from a company with a poor investment record, it may be difficult to sell. It is best to talk to an independent adviser and discuss all the options before deciding to discontinue an endowment.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EFFECT OF MIRAS CHANGES ON MONTHLY PAYMENTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Loan (Pounds)     Repayment mortgage             Endowment mortgage*                Now      April      April       Now     April     April                          1994       1995               1994      1995  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  30,000     190.58     197.65     204.84    143.25    152.80    162.35  40,000     254.77     264.52     274.07    206.92    216.47    226.02  60,000     406.33     415.88     425.43    334.25    343.80    353.35  80,000     557.68     567.23     576.78    461.59    471.14    480.69 100,000     709.04     718.59     728.14    588.92    598.47    608.02 150,000   1,087.44   1,096.99   1,106.54    907.25    916.80    926.35  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Based on current mortgage rate of 7.64 per cent * Excludes endowment premiums.

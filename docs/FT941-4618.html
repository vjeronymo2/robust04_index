			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Ind Newspapers rises to IPounds 29m Independent Newspapers, the Irish newspaper group controlled by Mr Tony O'Reilly, has achieved an 81 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits from IPounds 16m to IPounds 29m (Pounds 27.9m) on turnover of IPounds 173.5m. Some IPounds 7.3m of the profit increase was due to lower interest charges resulting from the conversion last April of the group's IPounds 30m convertible capital bond issue. This included the reincorporation of an interest credit of IPounds 2.5m in accrued interest on the bonds. Net debt at year-end fell to IPounds 11m (IPounds 48m), giving gearing of 6 per cent. Recent acquisitions in South Africa and the UK have since increased borrowings to IPounds 30m. Operating profits for 1993 rose to IPounds 27.1m (IPounds 22.2m). An exceptional charge of IPounds 3m as a provision against the investment in the loss-making Tribune newspaper, was offset by an IPounds 3.8m gain on the disposal of its Mirror Group stake . The profit contribution from the Australian interests in the APN newspaper group and Buspak advertising doubled to IPounds 9m, and its UK subsidiaries returned to profit with a contribution of IPounds 0.5m. The input from the core Irish newspaper business grew by 6 per cent to IPounds 18.4m. Princes Holdings, the 50 per cent-owned cable TV subsidiary in Ireland, did not contribute any profits, but increased its subscriber base by 57 per cent to 103,000 customers through a deliberate loss-leading marketing campaign. Mr Liam Healey, group chief executive, said the subsidiary would begin to show profits this year. A subscriber base of some 250,000 customers was targetted for 1997. Last month the group spent IPounds 22m on a 29.99 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing, publisher of the UK Independent and Independent on Sunday. It has also taken a 31 per cent stake in the South African Argus newspaper group through a share-swap deal which will give Argus shareholders a 5 per cent holding in Independent Newspapers. Earnings per share came through at 30.54p (19.44p) basic and 24.93p (19.6p) fully diluted. A final dividend of 7p is recommended, for a total of 11p (9.3p adjusted). COMMENT Independent Newspapers is a big fish in the cramped pond of the Irish newspaper market, and growing contributions from overseas acquisitions like APN will be vital to sustain the impressive level of growth achieved hitherto. Barring civil war in South Africa, the Argus move appears a good one. But the taking of a minority stake in the loss-making Newspaper Publishing group in the UK without being able to bring Independent's proven management skills to bear at board level, could misfire. Earnings per share of 28p look achievable in 1994, giving a prospective p/e multiple of 17.7, which makes it pricey in the confines of the Irish market but cheap against its international peers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Barbados Labor Party says it does not intend to  take the proposed 8 percent pay cut issue lightly. Opposition  leader (Owen Arthur) said the laws that allow government to  interfere with the salaries of public workers as it sees fit are  bad and offensive. According to the opposition, these laws  should be removed from the statute books. Mr. (Arthur) says he  is getting legal advice on the matter, which he intends to put  before parliament.    [Begin (Arthur) recording] Clause 26, which was (read) as a  basis upon which the government has acted in this instance, was  recommended as one of those aspects of the Constitution that  should have been changed. I deeply regret the (?Balisur) Party  government did not change it then. I deeply regret this was not  tested for fear... [pauses] only because we fear that because  the government then did not have a two-thirds majority, or  because we did not have... [pauses] [words indistinct] it was  not changed, but it is such an offensive law that it ought to be  off the statute books of this country.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 24 TASS -- The State Duma, the lower  house of the Russian federal legislature, has finally approved  the Russian federal budget for 1994 as a whole after months of  debates. On Friday morning 273 deputies voted for it, with 80  voting against and eight abstaining. Four deputies, who left  their electronic voting cards behind, supported the vote in  favour at the microphones in the hall.    The law provides for the spending of 194.5 trillion roubles  and the revenue of 124.5 trillion roubles. It imposes a cap of  70 trillion roubles on the budget deficit.    Following the approval by the Duma, the law will be  forwarded  to the Federation Council.    The budget-94 was eventually approved in the fourth round of  voting after the earlier three rounds on Wednesday failed to  give the seal of approval to the budget, which the deputies  found lacking due allocations for defence, health care and  education.    The Duma had to set an hour apart for voting on Friday and  threatened sanctions to absentees. All scheduled trips were  cancelled and those on business elsewhere were recalled to  ensure the quorum.</p>

According to him, controlling the deficit is an  essential factor for boosting and consolidating the new economic  cycle, which "has undoubtedly now begun."    The minister issued two messages during an important lecture  on "economic policy and the new situation" delivered at the 21st  Century Club yesterday evening. In the first place, the  government's priority and pressing task is to contain public  expenditure and deregulate the telecommunications sector, "which  is taking shape as the driving force of the next cycle of  growth."    Second, Pedro Solbes stated that the government's economic  policy will be based on encouraging investment and exports. The  minister was emphatic in asserting that the mistake will not be  made of artificially stimulating consumption by lowering taxes,  as the People's Party demands, or increasing wages, as the  United Left and the trade unions demand.    The minister emphasized that there is no longer any doubt  that economic recovery has begun. "It now seems generally  accepted by the experts that there are clear and sufficient  signs to say that we have begun the change of economic cycle."  The economy performed favorably in the fourth quarter of the  year, breaking the downward trend. The rate of industrial  output is beginning to show positive figures. Car sales are  beginning to recover, and the number of new enterprises is  growing.    To ensure that this trend can be consolidated over the next  few months, the government deems it essential to reduce the  public deficit and improve enterprises' competitiveness.  According to him, the forecast state deficit for this year  exceeds 3 trillion pesetas, which represents just over 5 percent  of GDP. Hence the public deficit does not yet exceed the  interest which the state is paying on the public debt in  circulation, which this year will stand at 4.5 trillion pesetas.    Solbes was emphatic in asserting that it is essential to  stop  at this point. "The danger of a self-sustaining deficit process  could come about very quickly unless we act extremely firmly.  If we do not do so, traumatic solutions would be required, as  has happened in other countries."    In order to achieve this, there is a need for "an agreement  among everybody in order to limit our demands on the state.  Together with this, it is clearly necessary to wage a more  effective struggle against every kind of fraud -- not just tax  fraud -- and improve administration."    Pedro Solbes reflected on the nature of the public deficit,  pointing out that "it undoubtedly occurs because the state is  spending more than it raises, but the state spends on those  policies which the public demand of it -- whether it be on  health, education, unemployment, or roads -- and raises what the  country's wealth permits and what people are socially prepared  to tolerate as a tax burden. The state's expenditure on its own  functioning as an administration barely exceeds 3.5 percent of  total expenditure."    The minister pointed out that the state will owe 60 percent  of GDP at the end of the year -- that is, over 36 trillion  pesetas. This debt attracts interest which now represents 16  percent of total expenditure. Hence it has become the item on  which we spend most after paying pensions. He stated that "the  public deficit occurs because the public demand more of the  state than they themselves are prepared to contribute. Hence a  supportive austerity effort is necessary for the next three  years." According to him, the economic recovery will not be  enough to rebalance public accounts.    The second element of the new economic policy -- "those who  continue to demand a change in economic policy are unable to  recognize that this change has already occurred" -- is improving  enterprises' competitiveness. In his opinion, the devaluation  of the peseta and the reform of the labor market were two key  elements for achieving this, "but we must continue to work in  two other directions -- continuing with the structural reforms  and promoting stable and lasting restraint in earned and  unearned incomes."    With respect to the deregulation of the telecommunications  sector, he stated that over the next few months the necessary  decisions must be taken in order to prevent Spain's being left  out of that process which is now mobilizing very considerable  resources in the United States and Europe. "An early decision  on this matter will have very positive effects on investment and  employment, and will make it possible to reduce inflation."</p>

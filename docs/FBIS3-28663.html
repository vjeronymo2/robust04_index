The report by the Customs Tariff Council, an  advisory panel to the finance minister, came just two days  before a deadline on Japan-U.S. trade talks, which both sides  say have become particularly bogged down over the contentious  auto and auto parts issue.    The council urged repealing a 4.6 percent tariff on rubber  tubing for radiator hoses, a 2.4 percent levy on rubber belts  and a 9.6 percent tariff on polyester material used for seat  covers.    The report, which excludes levies covered by December's  global accord under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT), says scrapping the import duties would almost eliminate  Japanese tariffs on auto parts.    A ministry official said the foreign share in the three  areas  should increase, adding that foreign radiator tubes account for  only 200 million yen of the 85 billion yen annual Japanese  market, and that foreign rubber belts and the seat cover  material each amount to 600 million yen of 11 billion yen  markets.    The report said tariffs on raw sugar should be slashed by  21.5 yen per kilogram to 20.0 yen, which the official said would  amount to about 60 percent. It called for lowering those on  refined sugar by the same amount to 35.5 yen per kilogram, which  he said would be about 80 percent.</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD OFFERS ALTERNATE CSU CAMPUS SITES  </P> <P> In what may well be a futile effort, Oxnard this week suggested alternative  sites for a California State University campus in case the Taylor Ranch site in  Ventura falls through.  </P> <P> However, CSU officials said they are serious about an ultimatum Chancellor W.  Ann Reynolds delivered to county leaders almost two weeks ago, decreeing that  Ventura County must accept a campus at Taylor Ranch or forgo a four-year  university.  </P> <P> "I think we made it pretty clear that we believed we had looked at all the good  alternatives and spent three years on the process," said Vice Chancellor Jack  Smart. "We are not eager to look at another piece of property and take three  years and not get it."  </P> <P> Smart, however, refused to rule out the possibility of looking at other sites,  but said the probability of the university doing so is minimal.  </P> <P> Reynolds said she wanted to see an outpouring of community support for the  coastal bluff by mid-February.  </P> <P> But the Oxnard City Council, saying a four-year university was vitally needed  in Ventura County, suggested two sites in case Taylor Ranch is rejected.  </P> <P> "A four-year college is needed so desperately in this county, the site should  be second in everybody's mind," council member Ann Johs said. "It is the  education we are looking at -- not the Taj Mahal."  </P> <P> Oxnard put six sites up for review three years ago. All were rejected.  </P> <P> However, the point might be moot.  </P> <P> Since Reynolds' ultimatum, CSU officials have heard from supporters throughout  the county, and some school boards have endorsed Taylor Ranch.  </P> <P> In addition, several groups have organized to raise money for a professional  public relations campaign.  </P> <P> "I think it looks encouraging," Smart said. "A number of groups and individuals  are expressing real interest in continuing to secure Taylor Ranch, and I think  that's positive."  </P> <P> The university chose Taylor Ranch after what Reynolds described as an  "exhaustive" search of sites in Ventura County.  </P> <P> But several groups have opposed building the university because of concerns  about water and air pollution and increased traffic.  </P> <P> Most notable in the opposition is the Ventura County Environmental Coalition,  which recently asked four cities to suggest alternative sites for a campus.  </P> <P> The coalition targeted Oxnard, Ventura, Camarillo and Santa Paula as optimal  areas for a university.  </P> <P> "The Environmental Coalition has worked very hard at not allowing the  development of Taylor Ranch and at finding an alternative site," coalition  representative Russ Baggerly told the Oxnard City Council Tuesday. "If you want  to see a university in Ventura County, now is the time to act."  </P> <P> The council then suggested two alternative sites. One site lies immediately  south of U.S. Highway 101 between Del Norte Boulevard and Rice Avenue. The  other is located in the Ormond Beach region.  </P> <P> "If it's not going to be Taylor Ranch, I certainly would want it to come to  Oxnard," council member Dorothy Maron said.  </P> <P> Sites in Oxnard offer advantages over Taylor Ranch because they are more easily  accessible and pose fewer environmental concerns, said council member Manuel  Lopez.  </P> <P> The Ventura City Council does not plan to suggest alternative sites because of  Reynolds' decree that only Taylor Ranch will be considered, said City Manager  John Baker.  </P> <P> "They've been told there's no alternative, and if that's the case, why go  through the drill again?," he said.  </P> <P> The council proposed several sites that have been rejected over the years, but  ultimately went on record supporting Taylor Ranch.  </P> <P> But November's election brought in three council members who oppose the site on  environmental grounds and might attempt to block its construction.  </P> <P> However, the council has not passed a resolution opposing the site and,  according to Baker, continues to support it.  </P> <P> Santa Paula, which did not take part in the original bidding for a campus, has  yet to consider putting parcels forward for consideration, council member Carl  Barringer said.  </P> <P> However, Camarillo reiterated last month that it had two or three possible  sites that were rejected by the university three years ago because they do not  have ocean views, council member Sandi Bush said.  </P> <P> "It's so frustrating to come so far and have nothing accomplished," Bush said.  </P></p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Factory automation group confident ALLEN-BRADLEY, the factory automation company owned by Rockwell of the US, hopes to double its share of the market for computer numerical control (CNC) equipment over the next five years, according to Mr Don Davis, president. Leadership of the world market for CNC equipment, used to run machine tools, has passed from the US to Japan and Germany over the past 15 years, in line with trends in the machine tool industry. However Allen-Bradley plans a comeback. Earlier this year it launched a new CNC range, the 9/Series, which Mr Davis hopes will help it raise world market share from about 6 per cent. 'I would be very disappointed if we can't double that,' he said. Mr Davis admitted Allen-Bradley had struggled in the past because of the dominance of Japan's Fanuc, which has about 50 per cent of the world CNC market, and Germany's Siemens. CNC is crucial in factory automation, and is increasingly bought by the machine tool industry as a package. 'I can't say we will regain leadership, but a lot of customers are looking for an alternative,' Mr Davis said. The new range had been well received in Japan and Germany, respectively the largest and second largest machine tool producers. Allen-Bradley has until now had difficulties penetrating both these markets, but it now plans to expand its presence. It has largely missed out on the CNC market in Japan and eastern Asia, which account for between 35 and 40 per cent of consumption and could become increasingly important as machine tool builders in countries such as Taiwan and South Korea seek to increase exports. Mr Davis also hopes the CNC business will be strengthened by a recent reorganisation combining CNC and all other motion control products into a new division based in Italy. The move coincides with Allen-Bradley taking full control of Osai A-B, a CNC joint venture with Olivetti. Allen-Bradley, formerly privately-owned, was bought by Rockwell for Dollars 1.6bn in 1985, after a keenly-contested auction. The US aerospace, electronics and vehicle parts group narrowly beat a bid from Siemens. The deal brought Rockwell a new 'leg' and Allen-Bradley financial stability in an era of intensifying competition. Mr Davis said the two companies were just beginning to see real benefits, in technology terms, from the takeover. Apart from joint developments, including work on so-called 'fuzzy logic' - software that can help make a decision from unclear information - Rockwell had helped Allen-Bradley in advanced areas such as neuro-networks and artificial intelligence.</p>

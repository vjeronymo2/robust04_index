			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N. V. Rodionova, V. P. Sinilo, Fryazino, Moscow </F> Oblast; UDC 62 1.396.96:621.391.26]    [Abstract] This article examines three possible approaches  to the suppression of speckle noise in radar images: incoherent  integration, nonlinear image filtering, and homomorphic  processing. Merely increasing the number of uncorrelated  measurements, the first method, is a radical method. At least  four-to five-fold incoherent integration is necessary for  satisfactory perception of a radar image. The other two methods  may be used successfully only for certain types of radar ima ge  processing. Three types of smoothing by filtering are examined.  The filtering methods are intended to suppress the large  scatters characteristic of high resolution radar image speckle  noise. A table contrasts the results obtained using various  filtering methods on an image of the surface of Venus. Nonlinear  filtering reduces the level of speckle noise, and image  distortions have a noise-like character. Homomorphic processisng  also reduces the level of speckle noise, but the image is  distorted by smoothing. Figures 7; table 1; references 5: 1  Russian, 4 Western.</p>

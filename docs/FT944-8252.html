			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Germany set for small offerings - Commerzbank Commerzbank kicks off the autumn reporting season of the big German banks on Wednesday with its 10-month results. Like other international banks, those in Germany have suffered from the downturn in bond markets which was triggered earlier this year by rises in US interest rates. Commerzbank suffered a 68 per cent drop in trading profits for its own account to DM87m (Pounds 36m) in the first six months, but this was partly cushioned by a 15 per cent fall in bad debt provisions to DM710m. Full operating profits (including own account trading and normal bank business) were 11 per cent higher at DM438m. Deutsche Bank reported a 1 per cent rise in full operating profits, also suffering a sharp fall in own-account trading results. Commerzbank has already put out a brief statement of its performance over the first nine months to accord with the share listing requirements of the Madrid Stock Exchange. These showed that the group's partial operating results, excluding securities, foreign exchange and other trading on its own account, rose by 2.4 per cent to DM1.5bn. With an improvement in the net interest margin, net interest income was 7 per cent higher at DM3.8bn. Net commission income was down, while operating costs were 4.8 per cent higher.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Telecom Italia fights ruling on Telsystem Telecom Italia, the Italian telecommunications operating company, is to appeal against a court ruling earlier this week, forcing the group to open its network to increased competition. Telecom Italia said yesterday it favoured liberalisation of the sector, but only if properly co-ordinated. Milan's appeal court ruled on Monday that Telecom Italia had to provide leased lines for Telsystem, a small Italian company seeking to sell telecoms services to businesses, in competition with the main Italian operator. Telsystem had argued that without such a provision, it risked going bankrupt, because Telecom Italia had not leased sufficient lines to construct a 'virtual' network for its clients. The ruling is a temporary injunction, pending a decision on the case by Italy's anti-trust authority on the substance of the case. In theory, it is only a substitute for EU rules on the liberalisation of telecom services, which were supposed to come into force throughout the Community at the end of 1990, but have yet to be enacted by Italy. However, according to Telsystem and its advisers it is a big step forward for those who want to see Telecom Italia's monopoly broken up. Ms Alessandra Perrazzelli, of Brosio, Casati e Associati, the lawyer representing Telsystem, said yesterday: 'Of course, what we want is to win the anti-trust case. But the importance of this ruling is two-fold. The court is telling Sip (the domestic telephone monopoly) it can not go on with the monopoly on lines, but (the ruling) is also very important because it says you don't only have to give leased lines now, you have to give them in the future.' However, Mr Umberto Silvestri, chairman of Telecom Italia, said last night that under the current state of Italian law 'there is no doubt that we have a legitimate monopoly'. If upheld, the ruling could add to the pressure on Telecom Italia and its state-controlled parent company, Stet, which are already attempting to manage a difficult programme of change. The fusion earlier this year of five telecoms operators, including Sip, to form Telecom Italia was part of this programme. The Italian authorities are now preparing for the sale of their outstanding shares in Stet, which should take place next year. At the same time, Telecom Italia is having to adapt swiftly to the 1998 deadline set by the Community for opening up ordinary telephone calls to competition. Between 1992 and 1998, Telecom Italia is set to spend more than L50,000bn (Dollars 31bn) on investment, which includes modernising the Italian network for the coming multimedia technology. At the same time, the group must continue to rebalance its tariffs to fall in line with international competition. Mr Silvestri estimates that domestic telephone charges in Italy will have to rise by 25 per cent, while international charges - among the highest in Europe - may have to fall by about the same amount. More urgently, Italy's state telecoms companies are searching for a partner, to give themselves a place alongside other European competitors, such as France Telecom and British Telecom, many of which have struck defensive deals with global operators such as AT&amp;T of the US. Mr Silvestri says the search for a global alliance is a priority, and adds that Telecom Italia is negotiating with 'three or four' companies. 'We have to find a medium-sized operator - not large, because we don't want to be choked,' he says. He is hoping the form of Stet's privatisation will be decided soon, because uncertainty could delay the conclusion of such talks. Advisers to the sell-off should be named shortly, and the government will have to decide, with their assistance, whether and how to limit foreign control of Stet, for example, by retaining a golden share, or forming an Italian-dominated hard core of investors. Telecom Italia's second priority, according to its new chairman, is to adapt a bureaucratic management to the forthcoming changes. 'Our managing class is very high-calibre, but it's a class which has managed a monopoly for 60 years,' says Mr Silvestri, himself a long-serving executive in the state sector. 'Between 1994 and 1998, we have to change the culture: a large company has to become a competitive company.' In this respect, this week's decision by the Milan court of appeal could provide an incentive to accelerate those changes, even if the business represented by leased lines only represents an estimated 5 per cent of Telecom Italia's total domestic turnover.</p>

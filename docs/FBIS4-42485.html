			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "d.n.": "SPOe Poll: 55 Percent for Entry"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- "It is a fact that 12 June is not yet in  the bag." Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] Federal  Manager Josef Cap has announced a final offensive by his party  before the referendum on Austria's entry into the European Union  [EU] on Sunday [12 June]. According to a new SPOe poll, 35  percent say they will "definitely" vote for entry, while 20  percent say they would "most likely" vote yes.    Another view is seen if one asks about the attitude of  relatives and acquaintances: 38 percent advocate it, while 27  percent oppose. At a news conference on Friday, Cap reported on  the results of an IFES [Institute for Empirical Social Research]  telephone poll among 600 Austrians. Fifteen percent will  "definitely" vote for entry. During this last phase, the SPOe  will, above all, address women, because 24 percent of them (as  compared to 47 percent of men) are definitely for EU membership.    Even 55 percent of the voters of the Freedom Party of  Austria  [FPOe] believe that Chairman Joerg Haider is not interested in  Austria but rather in the strengthening of his position for the  Nationalrat election.    The SPOe's arguments for the last week before the referendum  are: Without the EU, tens of thousands of jobs will be lost, and  Austria is "twice as safe" in the EU. Cap made the appeal that  12 June should be "free from any domestic policy constraints."  Austria's future is at stake, he said.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Estate agents say market is still fragile FURTHER evidence of a slow-down in the pace of recovery in the housing market is provided by a survey of more than 100 estate agents published today by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The institution has warned the chancellor not to introduce measures in his autumn Budget which might undermine any recovery in house sales and prices. It said: 'The recovery is still evident but it remains fragile. As we enter the summer holiday period activity has slackened in line with the traditional seasonal trend.' Mr Peter Hayward of Peter Hayward Associates in Carlisle, Cumbria said: 'June has seen a tailing off in the level of demand from purchasers in spite of attractive interest rates. The progressive surge in the market from the turn of the year appears now to have dissipated.' The institution said only 9 per cent of agents polled in England and Wales reported increases in house prices in the previous three months. Most reported static prices and 8.5 per cent reported falls. Michael Everett, estate agents in Epsom, Surrey, said: 'A continued shortage of new instructions is slowing the market and now causing difficulties in completing sales.' The institution said that the price expectation of prospective sellers was still too high while buyers expected to find bargains. This had led to a shortage of properties for sale with many sellers waiting for signs of price rises before putting properties on the market. A separate report by the Woolwich building society has estimated that the number of home owners trapped in homes worth less than their mortgages has fallen by a fifth as a result of price rises this year. The society said price rises since March meant that about 350,000 owners, mostly those who would have bought homes since last autumn, should no longer be suffering from negative equity. The largest fall is estimated to be in the south-east, where the number of households with negative equity dropped by 51,000 to 404,000. Overall the number of homeowners suffering from negative equity is estimated to have fallen from 1.8m to 1.45m. The society said that this was encouraging, but warned that the recovery in the housing market remained fragile. It forecast that prices would rise by only 1.7 per cent this year, leaving 1.25m householders still trapped in homes worth less than the money they had borrowed to pay for them.</p>

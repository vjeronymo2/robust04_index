			<p>Language: <F P=105>Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Finance Minister Liu Zhongli and Vice </F> Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng with moderator Wang Zheren and  foreign and domestic correspondents at the Information Center of  the Second Sessions of the Eighth NPC and the CPPCC Eighth  National Committee in Beijing on 16 March; from the "Special  News Program on the Second Session of the Eighth NPC"]    [Text] [Wang Zheren] Today, the Information Center of the  Second Sessions of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC]  and the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] is holding its seventh  news conference. We are very glad that the persons in charge of  the Finance Ministry and the State General Administration of  Taxation [SGAT] are attending this news conference at our  invitation. They will answer your questions on the reform of  China's fiscal and taxation systems. Those present here are Mr.  Liu Zhongli, finance minister and SGAT director; Mr. Jin Xin,  SGAT deputy director; and Mr. Xiang Huaicheng, vice finance  minister.    [Liu] To save time, we will dispense with opening remarks.  Your questions will be welcome, and we are willing to answer  them.    [Liu Shaobo] I am Liu Shaobo from the Central Television  Network, and I have a question for Minister Liu. The 30 billion  yuan treasury bond issue did not go very smoothly last year, and  this year's issue will exceed 100 billion yuan. What measures  will you take to ensure its smooth issue this year, and will it  be apportioned?    [Liu] In issuing the 30 billion yuan of treasury bonds, we  did indeed encounter some difficulties for a while. This was  because the financial situation and financial order were poor  last year. There were many unauthorized loans and instances of  the illegal raising of capital funds, which diverted funds from  legitimate uses to unnecessary purposes and which caused an  irrational flow of funds. The situation improved soon after the  State Council rectified the financial order, and the treasury  bonds were in fact successfully issued by June or July of last  year. The situation this year is different from last year, and  our financial order has improved. At the same time, we will  offer a preferential interest rate on treasury bonds and improve  the methods of their issue. We will cooperate more closely with  financial institutions this year. We will adopt international  practices and gradually establish a system of first-class  agents, and the bonds will be sold openly at second-class  markets. We will also provide as many conveniences as possible  to bond buyers so that people can buy and cash their bonds  anytime they want. Judging from the size of the issue and our  current financial situation, I believe that the issue will go  smoothly and will win the people's support.    [Unidentified correspondent] I am a Hong Kong reporter and  have a question for Minister Liu. According to estimates, China  will reach a peak period of servicing its foreign debts. To my  knowledge, China's foreign debts in the first half of 1993  totaled $74 billion, while they were $69 billion in 1992. Will  you tell us about China's current foreign debt situation, and  can you give us some examples? What measures will the state  take to service its foreign debts?    [Liu] At present, China's foreign debt ratio stands at  around  90 percent and its debt service ratio at 7.6 percent. According  to international standards, the warning levels for debt ratio  and debt service ratio are set at 100 percent and 15 percent,  respectively. Our 7.6-percent debt service ratio is far below  the international warning level. So, I don't think we have any  big problem concerning our foreign debt. In addition, since we  started opening to the outside world and using foreign funds,  our credit rating has always been good.    [Unidentified foreign correspondent in English, fading into  Mandarin translation] I am from the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST. I  have a question about the budget law that was submitted to the  NPC yesterday. According to a plan to revise the law, China  shall maintain a balance between its domestic budget [guo nei yu  suan] and its external budget [guo wai yu suan]. If the deficit  goes beyond its ceiling, will you, as the finance minister, be  held accountable?    [Liu] There are two parts to the budget law. One part says  that no deficit is permitted for the routine, public portion of  the central budget. A deficit, in the form of a bond issue, is  permitted, to meet the needs of national construction projects.  The law stipulates that the size and structure of the debt  incurred from the bond issue must be rational. In other words,  it must be within our solvency. At the same time, the law also  stipulates that whoever violates the deficit ceiling and borrows  more than an authorized amount of debt shall be held legally  liable. So, if the deficit and the debts exceed the  NPC-approved figures, the finance minister should of course be  held accountable. If something unforeseeable, such as an  extraordinary natural disaster, happens during the course of  executing the budget, we may readjust the budget with the  approval of the NPC Standing Committee. Then our responsibility  will be assessed according to the adjusted amount of the budget.    [Unidentified correspondent] I am from ZHONGGUO RIBAO and I  have a question for Vice Minister Xiang. The promulgation of  the tax assignment system [fen shui zhi] has caused more  reactions in the central and western regions, particularly the  old revolutionary base areas, ethnic minority regions, border  regions, and poor regions, than in other parts of the country.  They are worried that they might lose the preferential  treatment and financial subsidies that they currently enjoy.  Are their fears warranted?    [Xiang] Their fears are unwarranted. First, after the new  system takes effect, the old distribution pattern will remain  unchanged. Some provinces in the western region which receive  central financial subsidies will continue to receive them, with  the amounts not being changed. Second, existing preferential  policies will remain valid if they are the basis for the base  figures of local revenues and expenditures. Third, after the  tax assignment system takes effect and the central revenues  gradually increase over the next several years, we will  formulate procedures for spending transfers according to  international practices. Then, the regions encountering  difficulties and ethnic minority regions in the western part of  our country will be the first to enjoy the benefits of the  procedures. For this reason, if I represent the western region,  I would be the first to approve of the tax assignment system.    [Unidentified correspondent] I am a reporter with XINHUA.  I heard that Minister Liu will leave for the United States  tomorrow to attend an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC]  meeting of finance ministers. I would like to know what the  meeting's discussions will focus on and whether the issue of the  trade deficit between China and the United States will be  discussed at your talks with the U.S. treasury secretary. Thank  you.    [Liu] After consultations, it has been decided that the  Asian-Pacific regional finance ministers meeting will be held in  Hawaii on 18 to 19 March. The meeting will be a formal meeting  of the finance ministers of Asian-Pacific countries. The  primary goal of the meeting is to provide an opportunity for the  finance ministers of the APEC member states to exchange views  and opinions on regional issues of common concern to enhance  mutual understanding. The main topic of the meeting is to  discuss the strategy of macroeconomic growth, international  financial issues, and building a domestic financial market -- a  capital market. The meeting will be a multilateral forum, and  thus it will not discuss bilateral issues. Therefore, China and  the United States also will not discuss bilateral issues.    [(Li Gao]) I am reporter (Li Gao) of GONG SHANG SHI BAO. I  would like to ask Minister Liu a question, that is, will the  implementation of the system of sharing tax revenues between the  central and local authorities affect the economic growth of some  economically developed provinces in the coastal region?    [Liu] It should not and will not have any impact because the  results of January and February have already proved this. This  is especially true when it comes to the kind of tax called the  value-added tax, which everyone and all localities are most  concerned about. We have adopted a sharing system for  value-added taxes, so they are actually shared taxes -- that is,  after a locality's economy is developed, both the central and  local authorities will benefit, and whoever develops faster will  benefit more. Therefore, there will not be any impact.    [Unidentified correspondent in English, fading into Mandarin  translation] I would like to know what is the interest rate of  your treasury bonds. The inflation rate in cities is about 20  percent, while your risk rate [as heard] is only about 13  percent. How can this encourage city residents to purchase  treasury bonds?    [Liu] I think that our goal this year is to keep the  inflation rate at 10 percent. We are working on this. If it is  10 percent, then the (?annual interest rate of our three-year)  treasury bonds, which is 13.96 percent, is a positive rate.  Second, when we announced the interest rate for treasury bonds  last year, we said that treasury bonds were meant to hold their  value. If for some reason the inflation rate goes out of  control, then [words indistinct] will still have to purchase  [words indistinct]. Now that everyone understands the policy, I  hope that everyone will enthusiastically purchase [treasury  bonds].    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Minister, if your draft  budget is approved by the NPC, it will be implemented as of 1  January 1995, which is only two and a half years from when Hong  Kong reverts to China. Your draft Budget Law stipulates that  localities are not allowed to permit deficits, and the Hong Kong  Basic Law also stipulates that Hong Kong is not allowed to  permit a deficit. But, Hong Kong's finance department has  estimated that as of 1 January 1997, during the 1997-98 fiscal  year, the money, including the land fund and financial surplus,  left to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] by the  British Hong Kong Government will be around 270 billion Hong  Kong dollars. As a financial expert, do you think it is  financially reasonable to leave more than 200 billion Hong Kong  dollars idle and not be allowed to spend it?    [Liu] Hong Kong is an SAR. It has its own Basic Law, and it  should do things according to the Basic Law. There is a special  clause in the Basic Law that concerns financial problems.  Therefore, things should be done according to the Basic Law.  The central government will not seek financial help from Hong  Kong. I will not discuss this issue in detail with you, but  there is one thing -- that is, the current Chinese Government  has taken the Hong Kong people's long-term interests into  consideration.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 17 (CTK) -- Milan Janicina, the  new minister for the administration of national property and  privatization, has promised to change privatization decisions  made during the last few days of the previous government.    According to the Bratislava press, Meciar's government at an  extraordinary meeting last Friday [11 March] approved with  lightening speed nine privatization projects, including one for  the lucrative spa of Piestany in west Slovakia. Similarly the  cabinet agreed to almost thirty privatizations through direct  sale in the second half of February, when the threat of the  government's fall hung in the air.    "Privatization in Slovakia almost stopped in 1992, but from  February 15 began to proceed very quickly," said Janicina in a  radio interview, "until I got the impression that the same thing  was happening as when William the Conqueror invaded Britain and  handed out properties to his loyal Normans."    "I have the feeling that it is a form of political  corruption. It is necessary to stop these sales. Fortunately  there are not so many of these cases that it isn't possible to  correct them in a couple of days," he continued.    During his tenure until the autumn elections the new  minister  intends to carry out privatization in accordance with the law in  order to renew confidence both here and abroad, reconsolidate  the situation at the ministry, and prepare the conditions for  starting the second wave of coupon privatization.    According to hitherto officially unconfirmed information,  Meciar's government last Friday approved privatization projects  for: Chemosvit Svit; Paliva Skalica; Slovenske liecebne kupele  Priestany; part of Interhotel Bratislava; part of  Zapadoslovensky ZDROJ; Polygraficke zavody Trnava, Kovohuty  Krompachy, VAP Presov. It also agreed a change to the approved  project concerning VSZ Kosice.    At the center of attention is the Piestany spa, with assets  of 1.6 billion korunas. A fifty-percent share was obtained by a  limited liability company whose agent is the spa's director  Gajdos, and whose silent partner is the ex-minister for health  Viliam Sobona. The first instalment payment was fixed at 87  million korunas. Last year the spa made a profit of 180 million  korunas.</p>

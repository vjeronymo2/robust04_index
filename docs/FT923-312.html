			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: Total cautious on second-half prospects TOTAL, the French oil company, remains cautious on the outlook for the second half of 1992 in view of continued low demand for oil, declining refining margins, over-capacity and currency fluctuations, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Serge Tchuruk, chairman, said he could not predict the performance for the remainder of year, but he indicated that third-quarter refining margins showed no improvement from the second quarter and were well below the level recorded in the same period last year. Mr Tchuruk said the outlook for the rest of 1992 was 'unpredictable' in view of the high level of capacity utilisation in Europe and a 5 per cent decline in demand for oil products. Other factors accounting for Total's weaker first-half performance - half-year net profits tumbled 47 per cent to FFr1.9bn (Dollars 395m) - were the impact of freight losses on trading and the weakness of the dollar.</p>

			<p>Reform   <F P=102>   HK2204055494 Beijing CHINA DAILY in English 22 Apr 94 p 1 </F> <F P=103> HK2204055494 </F> <F P=104>  Beijing CHINA DAILY </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Tan Hongkai: "Problems Remain in Reform </F> of Government"]    [Text] China still has to solve problems on the way to  reforming government structures, senior officials told a  conference in Beijing yesterday.    Reforms had made initial progress, personnel vice-minister  Zhang Zhijian told the first day of the International Symposium  on Administrative Reform.    But he called for serious attention to "such outstanding  problems as strategies for administrative reforms, relations  between central and local governments and reform of  administrative legislation."    Qian Qizhi, a bureau chief with the Central Organization and  Establishment Committee (COAEC), said there was a "pressing  need" for a solution to three problems. They were:    -- How to make the transfer of government functions  acceptable to everyone they affected.    "Besides some fetters in people's minds, an important factor  is some government departments' reluctance to relinquish their  powers," he said.    -- How to coordinate structural reforms with reforms in  other  fields.    Structural reforms must advance in harmony with economic,  political and personnel reforms, he said.    -- And how to properly and effectively accommodate redundant  officials who are removed from government offices.    "The ultimate results of government reforms, in a certain  sense, rest on a solution to this problem," he said.    Gu Jiaqi, deputy director of the General Office of the  COAEC,  proposed a step-by-step approach to the country's administrative  reforms and placed major emphasis on practical strategies.    "Strategic plans will be of no avail in the absence of  powerful executive bodies," he warned.    The number of agencies directly under the State Council has  already been cut from 86 to 59, and the staff of 37,000 reduced  by 7,500 or 20 percent.    With the first stage of reforms at ministry level coming to  a  conclusion, similar changes are spreading nationwide at local  level.    Streamlining of redundant personnel will remain an important  part of administrative reforms in China, said Gu. And more than  2 million officials would leave government offices in this round  of reforms.    The three-day symposium is sponsored by United Nations  Development Programme (UNDP) as part of its role in  restructuring China's State agencies.    It has attracted experts from UNDP, Australia, Britain,  France, Hong Kong, India, Thailand, the United States as well as  Chinese officials and researchers.</p>

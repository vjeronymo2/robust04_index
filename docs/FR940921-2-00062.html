Kappler, Deputy Director (O/TA&amp;TA) (202&hyph;205&hyph;2598), U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20436.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Scope of Investigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has reopened investigation No. 1205&hyph;3,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, Pursuant to Section 1205 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to address (1) the non-acceptance by contracting parties to the Harmonized System Convention of certain proposed amendments to the Harmonized System nomenclature and (2) changes in the tariff treatment accorded by the U.S. Customs Service to certain other products covered by the Commission's August 1993 report on this investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1205 (19 U.S.C. 3005) directs the Commission to keep the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) under continuous review and to recommend modifications of the HTS to the President (1) when amendments to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonized System or HS) are recommended by the Customs Co-operation Council (CCC) for adoption and (2) as other circumstances warrant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In July 1993, the CCC recommended certain amendments to the nomenclature of the international Harmonized System, in accordance with Article 16 of the Harmonized System Convention. The Commission's report on investigation No. 1205&hyph;3 addressed the CCC recommended amendments. However, since the issuance of the Commission's report, a number of HS contracting parties have entered objections with the CCC with respect to certain of the proposed amendments to the HS Convention. As a result, the CCC withdrew those amendments from its final recommendation. The modifications in the recommended amendments to the HS Convention will necessitate conforming changes in the Commission's recommendations made in its report of August 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Commission has received further information concerning the tariff treatment accorded by the U.S. Customs Service to certain other products covered by the August 1993 report. This additional information and certain technical corrections should also be reflected in the Commission's report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, the Commission has decided to re-open its investigation in this matter for the purpose of issuing an addendum to its report on investigation No. 1205&hyph;3 with respect to the matters described above. The Commission's August 1993 report on investigation No. 1205&hyph;3 (USITC Publication 2673) and the addendum proposed to be appended thereto are available from the Office of the Secretary, Room 112, United States International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436 (telephone (202) 205&hyph;2000).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of the proposed modifications to the Commission's report result from the non-acceptance by the contracting parties of certain proposed amendments to the Harmonized System nomenclature and from technical and editorial amendments appearing in the final CCC recommendation. These amendments principally concerned: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _subdivision of refined petroleum products under heading 27.10,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _revision of the subheadings for oxygen-function amino compounds under heading 29.22,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _subdivision of the provision for acrylic polymers under subheading 3906.90,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _modification of the chapter 61 and 62 notes concerning the definition of ensembles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _creation of new subdivisions for high-definition television apparatus under headings 85.28 and 85.40, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _transfer of certain optical fiber cables from heading 85.44 to heading 90.01. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other proposed modifications to the Commission's report concern the classification of: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _snowboard boots,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _still image video cameras,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _power supplies for automatic data processing machines, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _cordless handset telephones. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission must solicit, and give consideration to, the views of interested Federal agencies and the public before proposing recommendations to the HTS under section 1205. Further, the Commission's report to the President must present its recommendations, summarize the information on which its recommendations are based, and provide a statement of the probable economic effects of recommended changes on any industry in the United States. A copy of all written comments received from Federal agencies and a copy (or Commission-prepared summary) of the views of other interested parties must also be included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to section 1206 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 3006), the President may proclaim modifications to the HTS (on the basis of recommendations by the Commission under section 1205) if he determines that the modifications are in conformity with U.S. obligations under the HS Convention and do not run counter to the U.S. economic interest. The President may proclaim such modifications only after the expiration of a 60 legislative day lay-over period beginning on the date he submits a report to the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee that sets forth the proposed modifications and the reasons therefor. Modifications proclaimed by the President may not become effective before the 15th day after the proclamation is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of institution of the original investigation and scheduling of a hearing was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of May 20, 1993 (58 F.R. 29433).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Written Submissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested parties, including other Federal agencies, are invited to submit written statements concerning the subject of the draft addendum.

Commercial or financial information that a party desires the Commission to treat as confidential must be submitted on separate sheets of paper, each clearly marked ``Confidential Business Information'' at the top.

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / BT opposes CD phone directory British Telecommunications will today apply to the High Court for an injunction preventing Pro Cd, an American database company, from selling the entire British telephone directory on a compact disc. BT claims that the Pounds 50 disc would breach its copyright. It also objects to what it says would be the indiscriminate access that companies would have to individuals' telephone numbers and addresses. It said the move would increase inconvenience as more people would choose to go ex-directory.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Buck stops at De Benedetti: How the Olivetti case will affect Italy's corruption scandals The direct involvement of Olivetti, Italy's fifth largest private industrial group, in the country's ever-widening corruption scandals has removed any lingering doubt that it was possible to do business with the Italian public sector without paying bribes to the political establishment. At the weekend, Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the head of the computer and office equipment manufacturer, provided Milan magistrates with details of how over the past decade it had been obliged to pay bribes to be considered for government contracts. Olivetti joins a long list of Italian groups, topped by Fiat, who have admitted - either forcibly or voluntarily - to providing illicit funds to the politicians in return for obtaining favourable treatment. The impact of Olivetti's disclosure is likely to be profound, hastening the process whereby other business leaders come forward to declare their own illicit payments. The news also emphasises the need for a new ethical code for both Italian businesses and international companies operating in the country. The headline on one of yesterday's Italian newspapers summed up the sentiment: 'Even Olivetti has paid'. Until now Mr De Benedetti has consistantly denied his group was tainted by the system of corruption which has been uncovered over the past 15 months. This was his message to shareholders as late as last month. But on Sunday he decided to hand over to the magistrates a dossier of Olivetti's behind-the-scenes dealings with the politicians over the past decade. Five episodes are detailed, the most important of which concerns L10.4bn paid to a 'collector' on behalf of the political parties for contracts with the Ministry of Posts. In all Olivetti has paid out close to L20bn to politicians since Mr De Benedetti took control of the group in 1978. 'I personally have never paid any money myself but I accept full responsibility for the actions of my group,' he told the FT yesterday. He said he had no intention of passing the blame lower down the management ladder. Mr De Benedetti's behaviour contrasts sharply with that of Fiat. The Turin-based automotive group, headed by Mr Giovanni Agnelli, pretended for almost a year to be above paying to obtain contracts. Even when its executives were arrested, they spent long periods in jail refusing to admit to any wrong-doing. But last month Fiat changed tactics. Mr Cesari Romiti, the chief executive, admitted the group had been involved in paying bribes and gave details to the magistrates. Nevertheless, blame for Fiat's past behaviour has not been placed on the shoulders of the company's two most senior figures. Thus the most senior people implicated remain Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, the chief operating officer, and Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, the chief financial officer - respectively number three and four in the organisation. Although Mr De Benedetti said he may not have known about the mechanics of Olivetti's dealings with the political establishment, he accepted full blame. Yet his statement to the magistrates in fact goes further than admitting guilt. Instead, he has cast the Italian business executive in the role of victim - the corrupted not the corruptor. 'The emissaries of the political parties (in government) imposed a general condition which could be summed up as 'if you don't pay, you can't work with us',' he told the magistrates. The threats, he said, were little short of those of racketeers and extortioners. Mr De Benedetti told the FT that the Ministry of Posts had threatened to withdraw business from Olivetti if it did not pay bribes. In 1987 purchases by this ministry were only L2.1bn. The following year - after the group had agreed to pay 2 per cent of the value of orders by the ministry - purchases jumped to L204bn. Politicians involved in the scandals have testified that the business leaders were often ready accomplices. They obtained not just contracts but a whole 'political cover'. Benefits included cheap state credits, government help in covering unemployment benefit and a series of invisible barriers operated by the Italian administration to exclude foreign competition. Mr De Benedetti insisted, however, he had been obliged to pay to maintain Olivetti's 60,000-strong workforce, and he resisted the system of corruption as much as he could. As a result, less than 5 per cent of his group's turnover was with the public administration - while international competitors such as France's Bull and Germany's Siemens had a far greater share of their turnover linked to government sales in their home countries. Asked why he did not publicly denounce such pressures, Mr De Benedetti said: '1993 is not 1987. Then there was a regime running the country.' This is a reference to the way in which the Christian Democrats and Socialists, the main partners in government, had carved up control of the public administration and needed vast sums of money to pay for their party bureaucracies and the luxurious lifestyles of their members. Mr De Benedetti told Milan magistrates these parties had exacted a sort of company protection tax. Mr De Benedetti claimed his attitude had been consistent throughout. Last June, when he discovered that one company in the group, Sasib, had been involved in paying bribes for the Milan metro contract, the manager was instructed to co-operate with magistrates immediately. He said he did not take the initiative in going to the magistrates himself until after Olivetti's name was directly questioned. This happened in the past 10 days with the arrest of two figures connected with the Ministry of Posts and Asst, the state telephone service company. 'I kept quiet for the simple reason that I wanted to protect both the company and the shareholders.' The group is already in a delicate financial position which reflects the downturn in the international computer market. Preliminary estimates of 1992 losses are in the region of L650bn; losses are also expected at CIR and Cofide, Olivetti's listed holding companies. Mr De Benedetti appeared sanguine on the possibility of shareholders' raising the issue of falsifying accounts to hide bribes. Olivetti accounts, he pointed out, contained a heading of 'non-itemised expenditure' under which illicit political payments had been made. By so declaring the payments, he says, 'we have even paid taxes on these monies'. Nevertheless these revelations have badly tarnished Mr De Benedetti's image, which he has fought hard to recoup since his brief involvement in the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano. Mr De Benedetti is still waiting for Italian justice to run its slow course in that case, in which he is appealing against the decision of a court of first instance in April 1992 to sentence him to six years in prison on charges of fraudulent bankruptcy.</p>

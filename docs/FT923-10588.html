			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Approval of treaty assured in Greece THE GREEK opposition has assured the conservative government of an overwhelming majority in favour of the Maastricht treaty in a parliamentary vote tomorrow by giving the pact its backing. Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek opposition leader, told a parliamentary debate that he supported ratification despite concern about Greece's ability to participate in European union. He said Maastricht gave Greece an opportunity to compete in 'a difficult and unfair race. Unfair because we are last on the starting block and because the treaty defines the interests of the rich north.' With the support of Mr Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), the government is assured of victory. Only seven hardline Communist deputies in the 300-member house are expected to vote against ratification. Pasok's decision should also make the Economy Ministry's task easier when it launches fresh austerity measures aimed at achieving convergence with the rest of the EC by 1997. A consensus, however grudging, on the need for reform is expected to soften the impact of continued wage curbs, pension cuts and higher unemployment as jobs disappear in the public sector. The government has brought the ratification process forward by several months. It was originally due to happen in November, when Greece's application to join the Western European Union is likely to be approved. The government also hopes to distract attention from what most Greeks will consider a serious diplomatic defeat over accession to the WEU. By joining the WEU, Greece had hoped to secure a guarantee against the perceived threat to its security from Turkey, its Nato ally. Under Article 5 of the pact, WEU members are obliged to assist each other if attacked. But last month the WEU ruled that the mutual assistance clause does not apply to conflicts between allies.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): ABC of business plan writing - In A Nutshell Many small and medium-sized businesses rely on the founder's instincts rather than formal planning. Practical Business Planning, a booklet* by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, provides an introduction to a subject overlooked by many business owners. Aimed mainly at the medium-sized company seeking outside funds, it is also of relevance to smaller businesses and start-ups. Written business plans must be interesting to read and the main text should be no longer than 20 pages, the authors suggest. If the plan is intended for outsiders it must take account of their needs. Obey the ABC rule - for accuracy, brevity and clarity - and avoid jargon. Well designed graphs, charts and tables can replace large amounts of text. Avoid unusual type-faces and page lay-outs. *From Sarah Bemrose, KPMG, 1 Puddle Dock, Blackfriars, London EC4V 3PD. Tel. 071 236 8000. 32 pages. Free.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Books: Last man of the Long March - The enigmatic career of Deng Xiaoping DENG XIAOPING AND THE MAKING OF MODERN CHINA by Richard Evans Hamish Hamilton Pounds 20, 339 pages If Deng Xiaoping's health has been holding up these past few days, he has probably been watching soccer matches on satellite television, and adding bits and pieces to half-written, perhaps never-to-be-published articles about economic reform and Marxism. He has played a few hands of bridge, flicked through the newspapers, and granted short audiences to the occasional guest at a heavily-guarded courtyard residence. Outside the walls of his compound, China is being redecorated. The cities are painted with bright strokes of neon, streets are lined with aggressive vendors selling clothes and gadgets from trestle tables that could be the beginning of a retail empire, and middle-aged Communist party officials running machine tool companies are discovering that mastering the market is more difficult than memorising the Four Cardinal Principles or the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existance. At 89, Deng is unable to comprehend the breadth of change inspired by China's second revolution, and he has given few clues to the breadth of his own character. Understanding Deng is much like his own description of the process of reform, crossing a river by feeling out the stones and, in his biography, Sir Richard Evans has touched on most of the stones peeking above the surface of the river. But Deng Xiaoping and the Making of Modern China provides more insight into the making of modern China than into Comrade Deng Xiaoping, still generally described in the West by his unofficial but appropriate title of 'paramount leader'. In a sense, he is one in a long line of Chinese emperors, though that comparison understates the complexity of the Communist party leadership and its diverse networks of friendships, grudges and occasional alliances. The biography gives a good sense of the survival skills that carried Deng through this political minefield, in which many of his revolutionary colleagues perished or were harshly punished by 'comrades'. China's leader is unassailable because he is almost the last man standing of the Long March brigade, and because economic reform, a product of the pragmatic side of his personality, has brought such obvious gains. But Deng has been ruthless and he has been wrong. In the 1950s, he was behind the Anti-Rightist campaign that followed a party campaign to encourage criticism and debate, the Hundred Flowers movement. The flowers which bloomed were cruelly uprooted and the party's character was changed, as idealism and honesty were found to be less useful traits than cynicism and silence. Not long after, Deng was in the chorus supporting the Great Leap Forward, which tragically sent the country's economy into rapid reverse at a still-to-be calculated cost of lives. And there was Tiananmen Square in 1989, the effects of which were obvious to television audiences and the blame for which must be shared among a two-parts brutal, one-part bungling Chinese leadership. To understand these events, we need to be given a sense of the rock formations below the river's surface and Evans, at this time, is unable to do that and is reluctant to make broad judgments on the limited evidence before him. He is not helped by the Communist party's inability to come clean about its history or by Deng's few public statements of a personal kind. A doting daughter has recently written in Chinese about her kindly dad, Deng Xiaoping, but it is not the stuff of critical biography. Daughter aside, the paramount leader has generally avoided a Mao-style personality cult, though billboards have appeared with a larger-than-life Deng urging the country onwards, and his few appearances are seen as heavily symbolic of something, even if the event happens to be a tour of a southern Chinese theme park in a golf buggy. The collected works of Deng are clearly argued, though made dull by the mandatory references to Mao Zedong Thought and other used concepts that were traded in long ago for a new market economy. Deng's achievement has not been to provide a grand vision of China's future, but to apply nationally the local economic experiments which he could see were successful. Even the one liners for which he was famous, 'seek truth from facts' and 'black cat, white cat, the colour doesn't matter as long as it catches mice', were first said by someone else. As the latter phrase suggests, Deng's motivation was to build a strong China, not to create a workers' paradise, and nationalism gradually got the better of communism when it became obvious that central planning was crippling the country. In his epilogue, Evans lists the economic gains, providing retail price index statistics and figures on taxation growth and gross national product, which, he indicates, provide evidence that democracy should grow more slowly than GNP in developing countries. As a biographer, and a former UK ambassador to Beijing, he is a touch too diplomatic in his final judgment, which he leaves to 'the people of China'. The statistics are impressive, but China does need a vision, if not many visions, and the reluctance of Deng to allow more vigorous debate is a failing that will be remembered. Chinese society has always been more than the labour cost on an assembled and re-exported refrigerator, but only economic diversity is officially encouraged. In these years of upheaval in a great culture, when social comment is needed to provide a context for change, Deng Xiaoping has forced thoughtful Chinese to be very selective in their public speech or to be silent.</p>

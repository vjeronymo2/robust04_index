			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Supervision head quits Bank early MR ROGER BARNES is to retire early from the post of banking supervision head at the Bank of England. Mr Barnes, 55, is five years short of the Bank's normal retirement age. He will stay in the job for several months. His 20-year career in banking supervision was marred towards its end by criticism of his department for its role as supervisor of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the corrupt bank closed in 1991. He was accused in Lord Justice Bingham's report into the affair of having 'a rooted unwillingness to believe ill of BCCI'. That report also said he showed 'misjudgment' in March 1990 in not reporting allegations of fraud at BCCI to the Bank's Board of Banking Supervision, which oversees his department. The Bank said yesterday, however, that there had been no pressure on Mr Barnes to retire early. The Bank added that 'he approached the Bank early last year with a request to retire in the summer of the current year'. His job is widely regarded as one of the toughest and most thankless in the City of London. He will be replaced by Mr Michael Foot, 46, who is head of the Bank's European division. Mr Foot was described by a colleague as one of the Bank's 'brightest and best'. A banker said he was 'one of Eddie's men', meaning that he is close to Mr Eddie George, the governor-designate. Mr Foot has never worked in the supervision department, which monitors the financial strength and probity of banks operating in the UK. The Bank also appointed Ms Carol Sergeant, 40, to the new post of deputy head of banking supervision responsible for monitoring big UK commercial banks and merchant banks.</p>

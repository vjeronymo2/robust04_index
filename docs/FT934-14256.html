			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Patent law puts EC generic drugs companies at disadvantage Sir, In his article, 'Cheap drugs attract the giants' (October 12), Paul Abrahams stated that 'generic companies have proved increasingly aggressive in their ability to market drugs from the day of their patent expiry'. It should be pointed out that this situation has developed in the US because quick access to the market for generic medicines has been encouraged by law. Moreover, US patent law is markedly different from patent laws in the European Community, which operate against quick market access for generic medicines. Under US federal law generic companies are given the right to make their lengthy research and registration work (ie pre-market preparations) during the patent period. The right to work during the patent was given to US generic manufacturers as 'compensation' for the patent extension given to the US research-based companies. In most European Community countries, the right to work during the patent has either been judged to be illegal or remains ambiguous. Moreover, a recent EC regulation introducing extensions for EC pharmaceutical patents failed to provide European generic manufacturers with rights similar to those enjoyed by US generic companies. Consequently, it can take European generic manufacturers up to three years after patent expiry before they can market their products. This imbalance in European Community law has two major consequences. First, it undermines European health policy by delaying the marketing of less costly generic medicines. Second, it leads to the absurd situation of giving US generic companies (whether independent or owned by one of the 'giants') the potential to launch their drugs on the EC market before European companies. The situation arises because on the day of patent expiry a US company could be in the position of having legally completed its research work in the US; while a European company will only have just been allowed to start its research in the EC. Europe's generic medicines industry has requested the European Commission to propose measures to amend this imbalance. However, the industry is still awaiting a reply.

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / China cautious over N Korea China proposed to its United Nations Security Council colleagues yesterday that they issue a mildly worded statement urging North Korea to allow unhampered inspection of its nuclear facilities, Reuter reports from New York. The proposed text would not include any threat of sanctions if North Korea continued to baulk. The Chinese indicated they were opposed to an alternative plan, favoured by the US, UK, France and Russia, to pass a resolution aimed at North Korea. Security Council President Jean-Bernard Merimee of France Merimee said he still expected a resolution to be put to the vote today. He believed China would abstain rather than veto it. While a resolution would carry greater weight than a Security Council statement, a Chinese abstention would weaken the message conveyed to North Korea.</p>

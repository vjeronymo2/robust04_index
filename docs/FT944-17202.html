			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Management: Business lessons on the timetable - Companies should aim for more efficient links with education to improve the supply of skilled employees, their quality of life and employability Growing concern that education systems are failing to deliver a sufficient flow of good quality business recruits has been voiced around the world for several years. Companies are now more prepared to do something about it. In the UK, the greatest worry is a lack of scientists. Provisional figures suggest that UK universities have failed to fill all the places available on science degree courses this year, despite reducing the academic attainment targets required from applicants. Research by Motorola, the US-based electronics group, and Cellnet, the UK mobile telephone operator, suggests that schools and teachers are exacerbating this problem. It found that 85 per cent of teachers thought students found science and technology difficult. Only 29 per cent of the students agreed. Evidence like this has persuaded a growing number of companies to invest directly in education. In the UK alone, a survey by the London School of Economics shows that 80 per cent of UK companies intend to continue or extend school links in the next three years. Since 1988, 57 per cent of companies have increased their involvement with secondary schools. However, the Confederation of British Industry is concerned that this activity - which is new territory for many businesses - is being managed inefficiently. This month it published a new code of practice on education-business links - including involvement in preparing curriculum materials and work experience for pupils - and launched a campaign to persuade all its members to build such links by the year 2000. It also wants all primary and secondary schools to establish relations with at least one business. The CBI also advised companies to use performance indicators to measure their educational involvement. Only 14 per cent of the companies surveyed by the LSE did so. This is not philanthropic. The CBI believes that the links will not merely improve the long-term supply of recruits. In the shorter term, companies can teach new skills to existing employees and use the experience of students involved in enterprise projects to experiment with management techniques. 'Employees - as much as students - should participate in links to improve their quality of life, their employability and their specific skills,' it says. Such a strategy would also help attract and retain recruits. Graduates, in particular, are now looking for employers who can provide extra skills, rather than a secure job or a large salary. A conference held last month in London by the Student Industrial Society, which promotes industrial careers to students, found that students overwhelmingly looked for companies to teach them 'marketable, transferable skills', with 81 per cent saying they would expect this of any company. More traditional concerns were far less important, with only 11 per cent expecting companies to deliver a 'career for life'. The CBI's proposals on 'best practice' are influenced by experience from the US, outlined at the International Conference on Education-Business Partnership in Paris earlier this year by David Stern, a researcher with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Stern identified three 'stages' of links between businesses and schools and a momentum which leads each to develop into the next. These are: Resources for Education At this level, support for education is a sophisticated form of public relations. Companies provide materials free of charge, in return for positive publicity, or send employees to give talks to schools. This satisfies employers' basic 'enlightened self-interest'. However, these partnerships soon become more complex, as they do not give students actual experience of working, and do not teach them how to use the workplace as a 'place of learning'. This leads to: Placements for Learners Employers allow students work experience in return for low wages. Several continental European nations have highly developed 'dual' training systems where trainees spend most of the week in supervised training with the company, but also spend time at a state-funded school, studying general theory to back their vocational work. In the US, the trend is more towards 'career academies' set up within schools, of which there are now around 150 (see accompanying piece). Each academy is organised as a 'school within a school', allowing a group of students to take a distinct sequence of courses together, and covers a broad vocational theme, such as health, or computer-related jobs. Narrow trade specialisms are avoided. These academies are used by their host schools to enlist active involvement from local employers, who help to formulate the curriculum, serve as mentors and offer work experience. Growth of these academies was encouraged by the School-to-Work Opportunities Act signed by President Clinton in May. However there is a problem, according to Stern, that students in career academies or apprenticeships are 'mainly trying to become part of the workplace as it is', and not 'to change the way work is done'. This has led, he says, to the evolution of a more ambitious level of business-education partnership. Support for Model Workplaces Under this model employers help educational institutions to carry out productive activities which can serve as 'laboratories to develop techniques for the learning organisation'. The goods or services are then put on sale to people other than the students involved. Such programmes are common at university and graduate level - for example students staff teaching hospitals or produce law review journals. Stern's research for the OECD shows that 19 per cent of US secondary schools have at least one school-based 'enterprise'. US examples involve students in building houses and running restaurants. Similar schemes are emerging in Australia and Denmark. Stern believes these enterprises provide better learning experiences for the pupils than work experience in real companies, as there is less danger of being left with simple repetitive tasks with low educational value. As such enterprises need not have to make a profit, they can afford to allow students to work slowly and carefully, learning from mistakes. In this way they can also experiment with new production and management techniques. One US hotel, for example, is considering using its school enterprise to experiment with skill-based pay, while students operating a retail outlet in a commercial shopping centre have been divided by teachers into teams with different areas of responsibility. Each team is judged by a series of performance measures, including profitability, service and prevention of theft. According to Stern, this might provide useful lessons to neighbouring commercial retailers, who have been slow to introduce the principle of team organisation. As Stern's OECD report concludes: 'By supporting school-based enterprise, employers might learn a lot.'

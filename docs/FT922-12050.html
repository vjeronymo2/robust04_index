			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Sarajevo attack pushes Bosnia towards civil war SARAJEVO, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, was pounded by artillery and mortar fire yesterday as a Serbian assault pushed the newly independent republic closer to all-out civil war. Serbia, under President Slobodan Milosevic, appeared willing to risk economic and political isolation from the international community as its forces pressed home their attack on Moslem-dominated areas of the republic. The fighting in Sarajevo was seen by Bosnian leaders as an attempt to cut the capital in half, linking up Serb-controlled districts. Serb leaders said Moslem militia had attacked them first. The television centre was repeatedly hit by mortars. Eyewitnesses said United Nations peacekeepers headquartered in Sarajevo drove around in armoured vehicles to try to help the wounded, who could not be reached by ambulance because of sniper fire. The witnesses said corpses were lying on the streets in the Novo Sarajevo and Novi Grad districts. Casualty figures were difficult to confirm but Belgrade television said at least three civilians had been killed and dozens wounded. The federal army command in Sarajevo said two soldiers had been killed in an overnight attack. It said the army 'had not fired a single shot'. Gunmen have blocked most main roads in Bosnia. Sarajevo yesterday was divided by road barricades, some manned by Serb militants and others by Moslems. Elsewhere in the republic, Belgrade radio said Serb leaders in Vlasenica, a predominantly Moslem town in eastern Bosnia, had ordered the 55,000 inhabitants to hand over all illegal weapons. Serb irregulars over the past month have seized seven predominantly Moslem towns along or near the River Drina, which marks Bosnia's border with Serbia. They have formed a corridor of Serb-controlled territory to link predominantly-Serb regions throughout Bosnia with Serbia. The US and the European Community have warned Serbia of heavy sanctions, including a possible severing of diplomatic ties with the rump Yugoslavia, if the Serbian government does not curb the fighting in Bosnia. A diplomat based in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital, said yesterday: 'Serbia is ignoring private and public warnings from the US and the EC. Milosevic is aware of the consequences but has made no attempt to stop the fighting. If the fighting progresses, Serbia will face some very serious sanctions.' If Serbia fails to make any move towards ending the violence in Bosnia by the end of April, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has warned that it may exclude the rump Yugoslavia from the organisation. A western diplomat said: 'A stiff trade embargo is under serious consideration. But cutting off diplomatic ties may not be too far off.' Lord Carrington, chairman of the Yugoslav peace conference, is due in Belgrade tomorrow in an attempt to stop the fighting. Meanwhile, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, German foreign minister, is embarking on a series of talks on Yugoslavia with some EC and east European countries and with the US. Serbia has rejected international criticism that it is abetting Serb irregulars in an attempt to stake claims on huge portions of territory in Bosnia. 'Serbia has no territorial pretensions on others and from the very start has been for a peaceful and legal solving of the Yugoslav crisis,' the Serbian government said yesterday after Mr Milosevic had met a senior official of the US State Department. The fighting in Bosnia erupted over Bosnian independence. Serbs, who make up 31 per cent of the 4.35m population, vehemently oppose independence which is supported by Moslems, 44 per cent of the population and Croats (17 per cent). Clashes escalated after April 6 when the EC followed by the US recognised Bosnia. More than 200 people have been killed in fighting in Bosnia and some 170,000 have fled their homes. Another western diplomat yesterday said: 'The fact that Bosnia is now internationally recognised in many ways makes the situation much clearer. Serbia is violating international law and borders. Bosnia is no longer a part of the rump Yugoslavia.' Foreign Affairs, Page 19</p>

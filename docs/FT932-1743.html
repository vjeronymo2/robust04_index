			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (1): The cornerstone of the Empire - Geoffrey Owen on an absorbing study of how commerce made Britain economically dominant BRITISH IMPERIALISM: INNOVATION AND EXPANSION 1688-1914 by P J Cain and A G Hopkins Longman Pounds 38/Pounds 16.99 504 pages BRITISH IMPERIALISM: CRISIS AND DECONSTRUCTION 1914-1990 Longman Pounds 30/Pounds 11.99 337 pages 'THE GREATEST factor in the material prosperity of this country', wrote an official in the British Treasury in 1924, 'is not manufacturing, important as that is, but commerce. The diversion of commerce to other countries is the severest loss to which we could be exposed'. The theme of this absorbing two-volume study of British imperialism is the central role of finance and commerce, based in London and the Home Counties, in influencing Britain's economic policy and, in particular, her overseas expansion. The authors show in convincing detail how the interests of manufacturing industry consistently took second place to those of the 'gentlemanly capitalists' who held the levers of power in the City, the Bank of England and the Treasury. But this is not another diatribe against Britain's anti-industrial culture. It is a balanced and highly readable account of a well-organised, socially cohesive and internationally-minded community of bankers and merchants, which had a profound effect on Britain and the world economy. Cain and Hopkins argue that Britain's strength in financial services preceded the Industrial Revolution and persisted long after the country's staple industries had gone into decline. Financial innovations in the 1690s, including the foundation of the Bank of England and the creation of the national debt, led to the evolution of specialised merchant banks, the rise of the stock exchange and the growing use of bills of exchange to settle domestic and international obligations. Provincial cities such as Liverpool, Bristol and Glasgow took part in the financial revolution, but London was the biggest beneficiary, partly because of its proximity to parliament and the departments of state. 'The City was distinguished from the outset by its close involvement with government and its pronounced overseas orientation'. From the early 18th century the leaders of the City's banks and merchanting houses became socially and commercially entwined with the country's landowning families. They went to the same public schools and absorbed the same gentlemanly culture, in which the accumulation of wealth was acceptable, provided it was kept separate from the vulgar business of making commodities. As the Empire expanded, the same set of values was spread around the world through the trading companies and overseas banks, whose managers came from the same social background as the senior men in the Foreign Office and the Treasury. With the move to free trade in the 1840s, a new form of gentlemanly capitalism took shape. While the profitability of agriculture declined and with it the power of the landowners, the City used its financial skills to launch sterling on its international career and to secure the invisible earnings which became so important to the country's balance of payments. The growth of empire was, among other things, 'a means of capitalising on Britain's comparative advantage in finance and commercial services', turning the country into the warehouse and banker of the world, not its workshop. City, Whitehall and Parliament persuaded themselves that the interests of finance and services were those of the nation and that pressures coming from Manchester, Birmingham or Glasgow 'were at best partial and at worst self-serving'. Did the City's bias in favour of overseas investment and its social separateness from the provinces contribute to Britain's industrial decline? As Cain and Hopkins show, Britain had two capital markets, at least up to 1914. Provincial businessmen found local sources of finance adequate, without needing large-scale recourse to the City. The City's response was to find opportunities abroad. 'It is difficult to blame the City for failing to adapt to industry's needs when the industry it was supposed to serve did not put forth radical new demands for its services'. This is not to say that heavy overseas investment did not cause some long-term damage. The authors suggest that the ease with which capital could be invested abroad and earn handsome returns had the indirect effect of blunting entrepreneurial drive. Large invisible earnings created a level of prosperity which put off the need for fundamental industrial change. At the same time the availability of captive markets in the Empire, reinforced by direct investment in the colonies, was a force for conservatism in industry. It was not the City's fault, the authors suggest, that industry did not expand faster. 'It is idle to complain that no finance capitalism on a German model developed in Britain in the late nineteenth century when British industry did not grow and change as rapidly as it did on the Continent'. A recurring strand in the story is the failure of industrialists to influence government policy, even at the height of the industrial revolution. Richard Cobden hoped that the coming of free trade would usher in the triumph of industrialism in Britain, but the manufacturing interests which he represented did not have the wealth or influence to oust the dominant ideology. Joseph Chamberlain's tariff reform campaign was a cry of alarm about the prospect of a de-industrialised Britain. As he put it in 1904, 'whereas at one time England was the greatest manufacturing country, now its people are more and more employed in finance, in distribution, in domestic service and in other occupations of the same kind.' Chamberlain was strongly supported by the newer entrepreneurs, those most hurt by German competition and most impressed by German success. But traditional businessmen, like the Manchester cotton masters, were content with the status quo. Even in the inter-war period, when the world economic crisis prompted some closing of ranks, British industry Turn to Page 2 Cornerstone of Empire From Page 1 was 'too small in scale, too fragmented and too bitterly competitive to allow any strategy to emerge which could match that of the City in terms of coherence and simplicity'. How have the gentlemanly capitalists adapted to the loss of empire and the end of the sterling area? Here Cain and Hopkins are at their least convincing. While the City has shown remarkable powers of survival - 'the most dynamic region of the British economy for the past 150 years' - it is not so obvious that the Thatcher government 'fell into a pattern of decision-making which promoted the interests of the City, where gentlemanly capitalists still retain a strong influence', or that manufacturing is controlled by a small group of financial managers, with 'the gentlemanly directors of the clearing banks and merchant banks' at its heart. Both the City and industry have had to come to terms with Britain's new role as a medium-sized nation in an integrated European economy, and the character of both has been substantially changed in the process. Traces of the old gentlemanly values and lifestyle are still visible, but more as a historical curiosity than a dominant influence on national life.</p>

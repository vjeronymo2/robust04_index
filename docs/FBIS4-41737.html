			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia could become a "police state, and a very  strong one" in response to growing crime rates, the settling of  scores in politics and the absence of civilized civic  institutions, Sergey Shakhray told Interfax. He said that the  presidential anti-crime decree was one of the first signs of  emergency legislation on the issue.    Shakhray believes that Russia is doomed to live through a  period of extraordinary legislation. He says that in the  struggle against banditry and organized crime there can be no  place for competition between the State Duma, the president and  other institutions of power. "They still have to pool their  efforts," Shakhray said.    He said that a number of provisions in President Boris  Yeltsin's decrees had been followed up upon in a draft law  approved by the government and submitted to parliament for  approval. The future law would "dramatically enhance  responsibility for both committing and organizing crimes."    "The basic human right is the right to life and the safety  of  children and the family. All other rights must be made  subordinate to that right," he said.</p>

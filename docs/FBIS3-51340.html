The president held two meetings on Tuesday, one at 1000 with  the current foreign minister and another at 1200 with Ruiz de  Vielman, after which time he decided to make the cabinet change.    Mrs. Ruiz de Vielman, who is married to well-known banker  Julio Vielman, has specialized in international affairs and is  an expert in GATT issues. She is Guatemala's permanent  negotiator to the EC on banana issues. She has held that post  through three governments, during which time, in turn, there  have been eight foreign ministers. This is because her work has  been technical and satisfactory for official circles, according  to the source who disclosed President de Leon's decision. The  source, however, requested his name not be disclosed.    Mrs. Vielman has been a member of the board of directors of  the Guatemalan Association of Lawyers and Notaries (1986) and  president of the Association of Women Lawyers and Notaries.  Currently, she is a member of the board of directors of the  Guatemalan-American Institute and a member of the Center for the  Defense of the Constitution. She will take the oath of office  next Wednesday [19 January], and the president of the Republic  will officially announce her appointment on 15 January.    The Coordinating Committee of Agricultural, Commercial,  Industrial, and Financial Associations leadership met yesterday  with President Ramiro de Leon Carpio to discuss the current  economic situation and the results that could be obtained from  the referendum.    It was learned that during the meeting with the business  leaders, the president announced his government's plans for  reactivating the economy for 1994-95 as well as some changes in  his work team.    Other changes announced by the president include: Finance  Minister Richard Aitkenhead will be replaced by economist Ana de  Molina, who is the private secretary of the presidency of the  Republic, and banker Eduardo Gonzalez Castillo will become the  minister of economy.    De Leon Carpio also told the businessmen he was optimistic  about the results of the referendum because he is sure the yes  vote for constitutional reforms will win, and that the changes  will improve the economic, political, and social picture of the  country. The meeting was held at the presidential palace.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Payment due on Schneider Creditors of the Jurgen Schneider property group can expect their first payment since the group went bankrupt in April, the Frankfurt state prosecutors' office said yesterday. The German officials said that on a visit to Geneva last week they had found documentary proof that DM245m (Pounds 98m) of the property group's funds had been moved by Mr Jurgen Schneider and his wife Claudia. They said the money had been transferred in late March to Switzerland via London and the Bahamas shortly before the couple's disappearance triggered Germany's biggest property crash in decades. Of the DM245m, all but DM15m was likely to be made available to meet creditors' claims, the Frankfurt officials said yesterday. The DM230m has been frozen by the Geneva prosecutors' office for some weeks pending an inquiry into possible money-laundering offences. The DM15m was transferred out of the Geneva accounts in late March and has not yet been traced. It is thought likely that Mr Schneider managed to transfer other cash, perhaps as much as DM750m in total, from Germany in March before he went on the holiday to Tuscany from which he never returned. A warrant has been issued for his arrest on fraud charges but his whereabouts are still unknown, although the mass circulation Bild newspaper suggested yesterday that he is living in a villa in the Iranian city of Isfahan. The newspaper claimed that Mr Schneider bought a DM14m villa there last year in association with Mr Mehdi Djawadi, an Iranian friend and business associate arrested earlier this month on suspicion of helping him transfer funds abroad ahead of his flight.</p>

In January this year, China's industrial output value  chalked  up 290 billion yuan (about 32.3 billion U.S. dollars), up 33.2  percent over the same month last year, according to the State  Statistics Bureau (SSB).    The first month of 1994 also saw a 22 percent increase in  retail sales, with total volume topping 120 billion yuan.    China's imports and exports were worth 10.5 billion U.S.  dollars in January this year. The exports were 4.8 billion  dollars, up 43.1 percent over the same month last year.    The SSB figures show that state revenue went up 86.2 percent  in January, which means a relatively comfortable balance of  revenue and expenditure.    However, officials of the SSB said that inflation,  continuing  for several months, still posed a threat to the sustainable and  healthy growth of the national economy. The situation facing  state-owned enterprises was also tough, they said.    Economists here called on the government to continue  strengthening macro-economic control so that inflation and fixed  assets investment could be kept under check.</p>

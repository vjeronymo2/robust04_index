			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (10): Thessaloniki looks to 1997 - Blocked overland routes have cut the number of foreign tourists FOR YEARS, northern Greece seemed to lack both of the essential components of Greek tourism: impressive archaeological remains and a range of spectacular beaches. The region's main attraction for foreigners was the theocratic republic of Mount Athos, where Orthodox monks offer ascetic hospitality and keep a strict ban on women. Quite suddenly, both ruins and beaches were discovered. The excavation in 1977 of the tomb of King Philip of Macedon, Alexander the Great's father, at Vergina, put northern Greece firmly on the archaeological map. The tomb's glittering contents - from jewellery and gold-decorated armour to silver drinking cups and ivory miniatures - can capture the attention of even the most reluctant museum-goer. At the same time, the Halkikidi district was opened up for mass tourism, with a new road around the remote Sithonia peninsula, giving access to dozens of sandy beaches. With 18,000 hotel beds and a motorway link with Thessaloniki, Halkidiki is now the package holiday centre for the north of the country. However, the violent break-up of Yugoslavia, the route to Greece for tourists driving from central Europe, has brought problems. Despite a marked increase in charter flights to Thessaloniki, tourist arrivals dropped by 37 per cent in the first eight months of 1992. 'We used to have Germans and Austrians driving down to Halkidiki, but now it's Hungarians and Czechs coming by bus and car through Bulgaria. They can't afford the same standard of holiday,' says Mr Vassilios Brovas, chairman of the Thessaloniki Hoteliers' Federation. The flow of Yugoslav visitors from Belgrade and weekend shoppers from Skopje, amounting to over 1.2m arrivals in 1989, has also dried up. Smaller hotels in Thessaloniki and Halkidiki have suffered most from the tourist slump, with average occupancy rates dropping to only 43 per cent. The big hotels, with occupancy still above 60 per cent, can rely on the city's commercial attractions to bring in business. More than 1.5m visitors, both Greeks and foreigners, attend the half-dozen big trade fairs staged every year at Thessaloniki's international exhibition centre. Conference tourism is also on the rise, extending the season - two months shorter than in the rest of Greece - by several weeks in spring and autumn. For the moment, hotels in Thessaloniki can combine their facilities to handle conferences of up to 2,000 people. That will change after 1995, when a new congress hall is due to open at the exhibition centre, with capacity for 8,000 delegates. But the year already inked in on every hotelier's calendar is 1997, when Thessaloniki becomes the European City of Culture. The city's first major facelift in almost a century is already under way. Its centrepiece is a Dr65bn (Pounds 200m) project to build an underground railway through the city centre, to reduce traffic congestion. Although the timetable will be tight, after a long dispute over finding a site, city officials are still confident that a new Dr17bn concert hall can be built in time for 1997. Meanwhile, the city's unique collection of Byzantine churches, some still shrouded in scaffolding following an earthquake 15 years ago, is being spruced up, so that frescoes and mosaics will be on view again. A new Byzantine museum, displaying artefacts from all over northern Greece is due to open next year. In Halkidiki, hoteliers have turned to the international tour operators, accepting low room rates in return for guaranteed arrivals this season. The number of arrivals by charter flights to Thessaloniki rose by 50 per cent this summer, bringing over 200,000 tourists from northern Europe. 'Increased charter flights to Thessaloniki are an encouraging sign that Macedonia can be a place that people choose to come to, rather than just pass through says Mr Thomas Gudantsis, National Tourist Organisation director for Macedonia and Thrace. The expansion of passenger shipping in the northern Aegean is also bringing more tourists to Macedonia. Along with regular ferry connections to Piraeus and the southern islands, a hydrofoil service now links Thessaloniki with the Sporades islands, off central Greece. The city can now cater for two categories of sought-after tourists: passengers on cruise ships and on yachts, who spend much more freely than the package holidaymakers. A new passenger terminal at Thessaloniki port has encouraged cruise ships to make more regular calls, offering excursions around the city and to Vergina. The city marina has at last been completed, offering facilities for yachts in a still uncrowded part of the Mediterranean. Nevertheless, Macedonia's loss has been Epirus's gain in terms of tourist arrivals, with drivers taking a ferry from Italy to north-western Greece in order to avoid the former Yugoslavia. Epirus is still one of the least-visited regions of Greece, though it is not short of antiquities set in dramatic mountain scenery. Ioannina, the provincial capital, which is set on a lake, was a favourite stopover for 19th century tourists who liked to call on Ali Pasha, its hospitable but unpredictable ruler. A sizeable collection of Ottoman-era buildings survives inside the fortifications of the old castle - from which Ali Pasha's enemies were thrown into the lake - along with his summer retreat on a reed-fringed island.</p>

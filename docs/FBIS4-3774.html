			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ray Heath] </F>   [Text] Profits of Hong Kong companies are under threat  with an expected squeeze in the second half of this year, thanks  partly to rising interest rates, and the effect of soaring  property prices. The immediate outlook for the business  environment also is poor, according to the latest report on the  territory issued by the Politieal and Economic Risk Consultaney  (PERC), although the consultancy added that it was not yet time  to start sounding alarm bells.    The PERC's assessment of increased risk factor in the  territory is the result of the surge in property prices and  rents, which have both companies and households complaining.    The territory also faces the consequences of the precarious  state of China's economy and the negative implications this has  for Hong Kong trade and investment with the mainland, says the  consultancy.    Adding to the overall uncertainty which is raising the risk  factor of Hong Kong are concerns over strategies on the  mainland. The PERC says a possible problem is the pressure for a  slowing of the economy in Guangdong and a crackdown on its  free-wheeling ways. "Implementation of the currency, tax, and  banking reform measures announced late last year is going very  badly from Beijing's perspective, due to stiff provincial  resistance with Guangdong leading the way," the PERC say. It  said Beijing could look like an emperor with no clothes if the  efforts to pull power back to the political centre are  frustrated by the provinces.    This means two distinct risks for the territory this year.  One is a "slipping of economic gears" which could cause market  players to adopt a much less aggressive posture on investment.  The second is problems resulting from a crackdown on Guangdong  by Beijing authorities.    "Either way the territory's trade and investment in the  mainland would be seriously disrupted, as would the activities  of the mainland companies in Hong Kong," the PERC says. "This  would detract from Hong Kong's international reputation, at  least in the short term."    Hong Kong's domestic economic risks have risen sharply this  year with soaring property prices pushing costs levels up  sharply. "Profit margins are starting to be eroded as much of  the cream from the economic boom of the past two years is being  siphoned off into the pockets of the landlords," concludes the  PERC. It says that costs are threatening the territory's  viability as a base for some businesses.    Investor confidence is also being hit by the rise in  interest  rates, which could dampen the prospects for growth in banking,  fund management and broking, which have been among the most  buoyant industries in Hong Kong, the consultancy says.    It expects interest rates in Hong Kong to rise by a further  half to one percentage point this year, depending on United  States policies. The rise by itself will not be enough to lead  to a consolidation in property or to end the territory's  economic boom, it says, but taken with other bad news emerging,  its effects could be felt. "The cumulative effect could lead to  a much more profound change in Hong Kong's business mood than  the relatively modest interest rate rise would suggest," the  report says.    Although the PERC forecasts an unchanged gross domestic  growth rate of 5.5 percent this year and next, it argues that  the official statistics do not reflect the real position of  trade as much of the real economy is in China and not captured  by official statistics. "Just as the Government's figures  understated the extent to which Hong Kong has been benefitting  from China's boom, the same numbers will also down-play the  negative impact of a hard landing for China's economy -- an  event that is looking increasingly possible," the report warns.</p>

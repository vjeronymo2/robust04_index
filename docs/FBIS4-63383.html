			<p>BFN     [Text] On return from Baku, Thursday [19 May], President  Yeltsin's plenipotentiary emissary for Nagorno-Karabakh Vladimir  Kazimirov told Interfax that Azerbaijan wanted an agreement on  the withdrawal of the Armenian forces from the occupied Azeri  territories to supplement the protocol negotiated by the  Armenian and Azeri defense ministers and the commander of the  Karabakh defense forces under the mediation of the Russian  defense minister. Kazimirov met with the Azeri leaders in Baku.    Whether a formal agreement would be concluded, was  immaterial  to Baku but, Kazimirov said, Baku wanted a solution for that  problem. It seeks that the Armenians withdraw as soon as  hostilities are ceased in what it seen as the occupied areas.    The protocol was signed on May 17 by mediating Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev of Russia, his Armenian counterpart Serge  Sarkissyan and the commander of the Karabakh forces Samvel  Babayan. In addition to a cease-fire, it calls for the presence  of observers and the disengagement of the conflicting forces in  the disputed zone. Without signing the document, Azerbaijan's  Defense Minister Mamadrafi Mammadov left Moscow for Baku.    Kazimirov hoped the Armenians would meet the Azeri demand.  Understanding had been reached in principle, he said, on  Armenian withdrawl from the occupied areas. The Armenians would  withdraw as soon as they were sure that the hostilities were  over and there was no threat to Nagorno-Karabakh.    Kazimirov refused to confirm that the leaders of the  conflicting parties would possibly meet by June 1. Moves were  being made, he said, but uncertainty always remained when it  came to setting deadlines. Although they were perfectly  understandable from the human point of view, high emotions bred  nervousness, and even made one doubt the possibility of a  non-violent settlement. This kind of conflicts never ended  under anaesthesia, Kazimirov said, they always ended in pain, if  not agony.    Addressing the political role of Russia in the efforts to  settle the Karabakh conflict, Kazimirov said Russia could not  afford to discontinue mediation because its interests were at  stake.</p>

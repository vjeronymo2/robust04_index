			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON;  </P> <P> DINNER AT KACHINA OF LAGUNA BEACH COMES FROM A PAINTER'S PALATE  </P> <P> David Wilhelm is quietly establishing himself as a restaurant superstar, and  the view from here is that his reputation can only grow. Those who remember him  when he cooked at Pave, the Newport Beach restaurant he operated with his wife,  Nancy, are aware that he can fashion elegance out of humble ingredients. Those  who have eaten dishes he conceived for the El Torito Grill probably think of  him as a trend setter.  </P> <P> At Kachina in Laguna Beach, Wilhelm is doing something different still,  combining trend and elegance with a highly personal stamp. The restaurant,  named for a type of American Indian doll, is housed in the lowest level of a  building whose upper floor is a Southwest art gallery. The motif is that of an  adobe hut with glowing, almost translucent lighting to offset the burnt ochre  walls. Blond wood tables are adorned with pastel stoneware crockery, and the  servers wear colorful uniforms.  </P> <P> The restaurant is a family affair from start to finish. Wife Nancy is hostess  and maitre'd. Daughter Heather Wilhelm is one of the servers. Even the owner's  brother, artist Bob Wilhelm, gets into the act: The walls are graced with his  color-splashed modern sculptures.  </P> <P> The menu is splashed with color too, created by the owner with some help from  head chef Thomas Tran. How's this for color? Blue corn taquitos with smoked  chicken and green chiles with avocado sauce. Grilled swordfish with desert  sunset sauce and pink grapefruit salsa.  </P> <P> The tastes are almost as spectacular. After a few sips of wine and a bite of a  dry blue-corn jalapeno muffin, my senses were riveted by one of the best dishes  I have ever had: gulf shrimp and green-corn tamale with salsa verde and crema  fresca.  </P> <P> The shrimps were plump and full of flavor, and the tamale alone, which was soft  as pudding in a steaming husk, would have been good enough to bring me back.  But it was the humble sounding salsa verde, a rough-hewn, pale green puree that  made the dish so memorable.  </P> <P> That was followed by a fabulous salad: grilled quail salad with toasted onions  and mango chutney. The bird was perfectly charred on mesquite, the vegetables  fresh and crispy, the impossible sounding flavors stunningly well matched, and  the presentation so eye-catching it wouldn't have looked out of place on the  wall alongside the other objets d'art.  </P> <P> If this restaurant has one flaw, it is a menu with too much color -- putting a  meal together here takes some work. Wilhelm often seems dazzled by his own  skill. Too much creativity can cloud the canvas; the audience may miss the  point.  </P> <P> For example, four of us split a terrific goat cheese relleno with a crisp  cornmeal coating and a papaya-red onion salsa. The crunchy coating seemed born  for the soft, melted cheese filling, and the crazy quilt salsa worked like a  charm. After that we nibbled on a corn crepe filled with honey roast duck in a  jalapeno barbecue sauce; except for a sneaky sweet aftertaste the filling  reminded me of a prize-winning chili. But what would we do for an encore?  </P> <P> No one was sure. Matching the appetizers with the intricate main courses, (corn  flour fettuccine with chicken in fire-roasted tomato sauce with wild sage, or  honey-glazed pork with black beans, pueblo corn pudding and guacamole) was no  mean feat. A friend remarked it was like a foodie jigsaw puzzle.  </P> <P> The dishes we finally chose were all wonderful. Honey-glazed pork was probably  the best, crackling on the outside, tender on the inside, with a soft corn  pudding quite like the green-corn tamale. Grilled chicken came on fresh corn  and green pepper, in a smooth red-pepper butter. The grilled swordfish with  grapefruit salsa (something I was reluctant to try) worked well. A lobster tail  quesadilla was sheer artistry.  </P> <P> Any complaints? Well, only a couple. One dish I wanted most was sold out on  both nights I dined there (mesquite smoked duck with tequila mole sauce and  creamy Indian polenta.) And a corn crepe burrito of lobster, shrimp, and  peppers in smoked chile cream had too much pancake and not enough seafood.  </P> <P> There are only four desserts, but they are stunners. Warm chocolate bread  pudding (my favorite), a soupy, fudgy delight topped with steamed milk, tasted  the way I always hoped one of these desserts would, like chocolate cake right  out of the oven. A fine, deep-yellow flan with berries was full of egg yolk and  burnt sugar. The super-creamy tequila-raisin ice cream, made commercially for  Wilhelm from an original recipe, was about perfect. And the pinon-pecan pie  looked wonderful, although none of us had room for a bite. I flirted briefly  with the idea of bringing a piece home . . . to put on my wall, of course.  </P> <P> Kachina is moderate to expensive. Appetizers are $4 to $7.50. Combination  plates are $11.50 to $12.50. Southwest specialties are $9.75 to $16.50.  Desserts are $4.25 to $4.75. The small, appealing wine list on the back of the  menu is extremely well chosen. The restaurant takes no reservations.  </P> <P> KACHINA  </P> <P> 222 Forest Ave., Laguna Beach  </P> <P> (714) 497-5546  </P> <P> Open nightly from 5:30 to 10 p.m.  </P> <P> All major cards accepted.  </P></p>

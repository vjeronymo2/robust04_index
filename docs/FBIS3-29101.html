The resolution expressed deep concern over the fact that the  situation of the Korean peninsula has become acute due to the  political, economic and military pressure of the imperialists  and the reactionaries to isolate and stifle the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea under the pretext of the "nuclear  problem."    It said:    "The meeting of the presidential council of the WFTU  bitterly  denounces all the moves of the imperialists against the DPRK and  holds that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be  solved peacefully through the DPRK-U.S. talks, not by pressure  or threat.    "The meeting expresses full support and solidarity for the  Korean workers and people in their struggle for reunifying the  country through confederacy based on one nation, one state, two  systems and two governments in accordance with the three  principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great  national unity."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent: "A Quarter </F> Kopek for a Heifer, Transit for a Ruble; Some Heads of  Administration Do Not Want the Public To Know Its Rights?"    [Text] According to the presidential edict, all legislative  statutes, government decrees and documents signed by the  president become effective upon publication in ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA. That means free access to our newspaper is one of the  inalienable civil rights. The censorship of the department does  not exist today, but a barrier which has arisen between the  newspaper and the reader is the censorship of the pocketbook,  which may also be administatively controlled.    The newspaper does not get to the reader by itself. It is  delivered by mail. And in addition to the subscription price,  the postal service sets its price for delivery. While the  editors of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA determine the first price, the  second is determined in each region independently. The 9,000  rubles (R) for half a year set by the editors does not cover  expenses for maintaining and publishing the newspaper (a ton of  paper today costs R780,000, and no one knows what it will be in  6 months). However, the post offices have a special methodology  for computing the price to cover their expenditures.    Then what explains such sharp variations today? For example,  in Samara Oblast (where K. Titov is head of administration) they  charge R15,600 for delivery of RG, while nearby in Saratov  Oblast (head of administration Yu. Belykh) it is R10,396. Since,  according to the methodology, transport expenditures are among  the primary components of the price for delivery, we can only  assume that in Saratovo Oblast the roads are better and shorter,  and the gasoline is cheaper than in the neighboring oblast.  Which is absurd if we remember Griboyedov's address in the  "sticks" and the presence of well-developed oil processing and  local gasoline in Samara Oblast. And how can we explain that in  the neighboring Penza Oblast (head of administration A.  Kovlyagin) they charge R4,500 for six months of delivery of our  newspaper, but for the same operation with the "ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA Collection" they already charge R30,000?    One more inexplicable difference is in the delivery to  individual subscribers versus organizations. In Kaluga Oblast  (head of administration A. Deryagin), offices are charged as  much as R23,400 for the newspaper, while in Belgorod Oblast  (head of administration Ye. Savchenko) they charge R12,000.  According to V. V. Gogoleva, department head of the Federal  Postal Service Administration, the newspaper is delivered to  organizations with the aid of the GSP [city postal service]  system, which is about two times more expensive than the  ordinary mail. But why more expensive by different amounts?  Viktoriya Viktorovna believes that prices are higher where the  ordinary population is subsidized at the expense of  organizations.    And here we must go from the postmen to the heads of  administration. Since, in view of the open-field system of  postal price lists, it turns out that, in places where prices  are low, the administration knowingly subsidizes the delivery of  a newspaper which publishes documents and commentaries which are  of vital importance to all of Russia. We may say this about  Bryansk Oblast (head of administration V. Karpov), where  delivery costs R2,760; about Krasnodar Kray (recent head of  administration N. Yegorov)--R4,668, and about Tuva (president  Sherit-ool Oorzhak) and Karachayevo-Cherkesiya (Council of  Ministers Chairman V. Khubiyev). And in those regions where  prices are high, the administration, frightening the public away  from subscriptions, is facilitating the breakdown of all-Russian  ties and in practice conceals from the citizens the federal laws  and decrees, leaving them in the field of arbitrary activity of  local authorities. That is what they do in Vologda Oblast (head  of administration N. Podgornov), where the price of delivery is  R18,510, in Mordovia (Council of Ministers Chairman V.  Shvetsov)--R11,046, and in Moscow (Mayor Yu. Luzhkov)--R8,800.    However, the most pleasant thing is that in the places where  the local authorities are truly active in a positive way, there  no barriers are set for the governmental newspaper. Without any  prompting, benefits have been introduced for subscribers in  Kabardino-Balkariya (President V. Kokov), while in Kaliningrad  Oblast, an isolated little island of Russia, they even solve the  problem of employment with the aid of benefits. At the decision  of the oblast administration (head of administration Yu.  Matochkin), delivery is half as expensive for those newspapers  which are printed in Kaliningrad itself.    We might add, about the press. We are even published in  Cheboksary. However, there they charge both citizens and  organizations the same for delivery--R22,800. Moreover, the  price is the same for rural residents and for city residents  living within 100 meters from the printing-house or the post  office. While in Chelyabinsk, for example, the city price is  R9,200, while in the oblast it is R15,594.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEAUTY AND THE BEASTIES;  </P> <P> KANGAROO ISLAND, A PERFECT PLACE TO SEE AUSTRALIA IN THE WILD  </P> <P> Here on Kangaroo Island, sighting a platypus is the ultimate treat for those  who come to see animals and birds in the wild.  </P> <P> While some people imagine that in Australia koalas hang from the trees like  grapes and that kangaroos line up waving "welcome" signs, it just isn't so.  </P> <P> Granted, the country has scores of zoos and animal parks where you can see  everything from wombats to Tasmanian Devils, but ogling zoo-ified beasties  simply is not the same as viewing them in the wild.  </P> <P> To do that, you come here, to Kangaroo Island.  </P> <P> The island lies about 70 miles southwest of Adelaide, about nine miles off the  South Australia coast. It is Australia's third-largest island, after Tasmania  and Melville Island in the Northern Territory, and has been called "Australia  in microcosm" -- the place to go when you want to see all of the country but  don't have the time.  </P> <P> Shaped something like a startled turtle, its head extended toward the mainland,  the island is about 95 miles long and 35 miles wide at its widest point.  </P> <P> It's a sparsely populated place, with what passes for urban life concentrated  in three small towns on the east coast: Kingscote, the largest with a  population of about 2,000, and the two smaller communities of American River  and Penneshaw.  </P> <P> I first heard about Kangaroo Island from an Australian friend who used to talk  about its immense cliffs that reared up from the surf like the ramparts of a  medieval castle, and about its beautiful, pristine beaches. He talked of scuba  diving in search of treasure in the ribs of pirate ships, and of the odd little  fairy penguins.  </P> <P> Since the island lies only about nine miles across the Backstairs Passage from  Cape Jervis south of Adelaide (where I had gone to sample Australian wines), I  decided to see for myself whether it lived up to my friend's description.  </P> <P> I was met at the airport in Kingscote by Peter Telfer, the 40-year-old owner of  Adventure Charters of Kangaroo Island, which had been highly recommended by  Tourism South Australia.  </P> <P> Telfer, who grew up on the island, has parlayed years of personal exploration  into a first-class tour and guide service. His chosen mode of transport is a  high-off-the-ground, four-wheel drive vehicle complete with "roo bars," the  Australian equivalent of roll bars except that they wrap around the front of  the vehicle.  </P> <P> Joining us for the first day of my two-day island tour was Marion Saunders, a  friend of Telfer's and a former islander herself. Two days was all I had, but  to thoroughly explore the island and discover why its residents fight so hard  to keep it unspoiled one really needs a week or more.  </P> <P> Kangaroo Island has been isolated from the mainland since the last Ice Age, and  its flora and fauna has therefore escaped the ravages of such introduced  species as the fox and rabbit or the predations of the dingo.  </P> <P> As a result, wildlife flourishes, and visitors can find kangaroos, including  one species unique to the island, goannas (large lizards), native cats called  quolls, short-nosed bandicoots (a rat-like marsupial), pygmy possums and  wallabies in vast abundance, as well as seals, sea lions, fairy penguins,  koalas, emus, echidnas, platypuses and an Eden of rainbow-colored birds.  </P> <P> The scenery is as varied as the animal life. Much of the interior is farmland  tucked between gentle hills. Sheep and various crops failed when first  introduced, but after the soil was improved with minerals, agriculture thrived.  Away from the cultivated areas, farms give way to scrubland and even desert. On  the coast, rocky cliffs alternate with white-sand beaches. Island wildflowers  include orchids, blue asters, golden wattle, rice flowers, fuchsia and purple  fringe lilies.  </P> <P> My home base on the island was Kingscote on Nepean Bay, where I saw South  Australia's largest mulberry tree and very little else. To those with more  time, Kingscote, the state's first settlement, does have a good folk-history  museum and heritage walking trail.  </P> <P> Day one was an exploration of the northern part of the island. Our first stop  was alongside a tiny creek shaded by flowering eucalyptus trees, where Telfer  promised we'd see koalas.  </P> <P> Sure enough, there they were, draped like drunks in the gum trees. Saunders  claimed that the gum leaves they eat are narcotic, and the reason they look so  spaced out is because they're genuinely zonked. Others dispute this and the  debate goes on.  </P> <P> While Telfer set traps in the creek for "yabbies" (an Australian freshwater  crayfish), Saunders and I followed kangaroo tracks along the creek.  </P> <P> The variety and color of the birds we saw was stunning: rainbow lorikeets,  scarlet robins, rosellas and galahs swept from tree to tree in large flocks.  Galahs, a type of cockatoo, are considered a somewhat dimwitted bird, and  Australians use the name as a term of derision. To visitors, though, the sight  of the pink and dove-gray birds flying wild is a delight.  </P> <P> Just as we settled in to sample Telfer's barbecue, Saunders pointed out some  black-and-white animals in the distance. "Feral goats," she said. On Kangaroo  Island, the word feral (wild) ranks with some of our more colorful expletives.  Any introduced animal that can upset the island's ecological balance really  upsets the native islanders. Later, Saunders pointed out pine trees from North  America that are gradually taking over from the native gum trees.  </P> <P> One introduced species that has been accepted is the Ligurian bee. No other bee  has been introduced since 12 hives were brought to Kangaroo Island in 1881 from  the Italian province of Liguria. So the Ligurian strain has remained pure.  Today it is a unique species and is exported to apiaries around the world.  </P> <P> Kangaroo Island's attractions hug the coastline. On the northern (and less  frequented) shore, we climbed Constitution Hill for a bird's-eye view of  Snelling Beach.  </P> <P> Just east of the hill, we walked through a tunnel formed by a jumble of  limestone boulders to emerge on a sweeping sandy beach with a small lagoon  formed by protective rocks. This is Stokes Bay, where fairy penguins come in  the spring to have their chicks. There were no penguins there during our visit,  but we did see plovers, red-billed oyster catchers, cormorants, ducks and sooty  pied oyster catchers.  </P> <P> Kangaroo Island was named by English navigator Matthew Flinders in 1802. Its  first occupants -- not including the aborigines who had lived there centuries  before but later abandoned the island -- were bands of deserters from English,  French and American whaling ships and escapees from the prison colonies.  Together, they formed marauding bands of cutthroats called "straitsmen" or "sea  rats."  </P> <P> With Kangaroo Island as their base, these pirates roamed the Australian coast  in whaleboats, raiding villages, kidnapping women, plundering ships and  murdering crews.  </P> <P> At sunset, we stopped high on the Wisanger Hills to enjoy a view straight out  of Africa: sweeping fields of dry grass and scattered trees, with only the  sound of the wind to break the silence.  </P> <P> On the second day of my visit, we picked up another visitor and then set off  for Seal Bay, a 2,000-acre conservation area where a breeding colony of more  than 300 sea lions lay around on the sand barking and basking.  </P> <P> Because of constant contact with friendly islanders and the absence of  predators, the animals regard people as curiosities and not much more. The sea  lions and New Zealand fur seals waddle on the sand and barely raise a brown eye  as visitors walk by or pose for pictures near them.  </P> <P> Even though the mammals take only passing interest in people, it's a good idea  to get there early in the morning before the crowds -- or what passes for  crowds -- arrive. It's also advisable not to tease the animals, and to be wary  of a mother separated from her pup or an amorous male in the February mating  season.  </P> <P> Near Seal Bay are Vivonne Bay and Hanson Bay, two more of what seems an endless  stretch of perfect beaches -- great for picnics, bathing, fishing or for  launching a scuba diving trip. More than 60 wrecked ships have been found  around the island's 280-mile coastline, and that, coupled with coral reefs and  clean water, makes this a scuba diver's mecca. Just beyond Vivonne Bay is the  Little Sahara Desert, an oasis of folding white sand dunes surrounded by bush.  </P> <P> Continuing west, Kelly Hill Conservation Park is a haven for birds and animals,  and the Kelly Hill Caves offer conducted tours through the calcite formations.  Then, just a bit farther west, we arrived at the Remarkable Rocks.  </P> <P> Nature, over the centuries, weathered the massive rock formations so that what  emerged was a collection of weird and surreal towers and forms, precariously  balanced on a huge granite dome that plunges 90 feet down to the sea.  </P> <P> Nearby Admiral's Arch is another work of nature -- an immense cave carved by  the wind and sea. The best time to see it is in February when hundreds of seals  and sea lions and their pups use the area for swimming classes.  </P> <P> At the end of the island we stopped for lunch at Rocky River, headquarters of  the 185,000-acre Flinders Chase National Park. Here, it is the visitors who are  fenced off while the animals hop, waddle, strut and crawl around looking for  handouts. Under some gum trees, we pulled out a bag of cut-up apples. Young  kangaroos hopped up and gently took the apples from our hands with their paws.  </P> <P> Emus strut around among the visitors and an echidna roams around in circles not  really knowing where it's going. Koalas sit in the trees, zonked as usual, Cape  Barren geese parade around posing for the camera, and galahs, lorikeets and  cockatoos scream from the trees. The park is also home to about 150 of the rare  Glossy Black or Casuarina cockatoo that are found only in Australia, but we  weren't fortunate enough to spot one.  </P> <P> Still, that -- not to mention my failure to sight the elusive platypus -- gave  me the incentive to pay another visit to Kangaroo Island in the future.  </P> <P> Getting There: Qantas has daily flights from Los Angeles to Sydney, with  connecting flights to Adelaide.

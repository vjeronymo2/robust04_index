			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (2): Big stake in EC's future - Japan's relations with the European Community THE POLITICAL crisis in the European Community over the future of the Maastricht treaty has alarmed few countries more than Japan. Whatever its faults, Maastricht seemed to offer a degree of stability and predictability to Japan's relations with the EC. Now that the fate of the treaty hangs in the balance, the Community faces a prolonged period of debilitating uncertainty. This is a prospect which worries the Japanese almost as much as the Europeans themselves. Japan's cumulative investment in the EC amounts to more than Dollars 55bn. Although this represents less than half the Japanese investment in the US, it still marks a hefty stake in the Community's future. By the end of the decade, it is quite conceivable that the European market will become as important to Japanese industry as the American. But Japanese concerns extend beyond measuring business confidence. The big question is whether a Europe increasingly preoccupied by crisis management and recession will become more introverted, more nationalist, and less predisposed to foreign competitors, particularly Japan. Two years ago, the prevailing mood was much more optimistic. Despite enduring tensions over trade, fears about a Fortress Europe constructed around the 1992 Single Market programme had largely dissipated as tentative efforts got underway to build a broader relationship between the Community and Japan. This process led to the joint declaration in the Hague in July 1991 which for the first time attempted to treat Japan and the EC as two economic superpowers seeking a more mature relationship, rather than petty rivals squabbling over their respective shares of the European car market. An EC report submitted to the European Council last spring summed up the new approach: 'Both (Japan and the EC) are in many ways at a similar stage of taking up their responsibilities on the world stage, Japan because it is searching for ways of translating its economic power into political influence, the Community because it is adopting through the European Union institutions and mechanisms to enable it to play a stronger foreign policy role.' The gap between aspirations and reality is a common theme in the development of the EC. Recent examples include the EC's dilatory response to the Gulf crisis and the painful divisions in Community ranks provoked by the civil war in Yugoslavia. Since the Hague declaration, high-level contacts have taken place in areas such as the environment, development aid, science and technology and, more improbably, 'Japan-EC' industrial co-operation - including training for 50 to 60 young European executives to spend 18 months in Japan to learn the language for one year and receive six months training in Japanese companies. The most striking example of co-operation occurred earlier this year when, much to the surprise of the US, the EC and Japan joined forces at the World Environment conference in Rio, Brazil. American fears that this amounted to a new Brussels-Tokyo axis were premature; but as a senior Japanese diplomat noted, the Rio summit showed that Japan was willing, under certain circumstances, to step out of line with the US and play ball with the Europeans. The Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty last June has led to a fundamental change in atmosphere. The image of a European super-state, dominated by German industry and French technocracy skills has crumbled. In the new mood of Eurocentrism, there is obviously a risk that the single most important aspect of EC-Japan relations - trade - will come back to the fore. In 1991, Japan's trade surplus with the EC rose to Dollars 27.4bn, an increase of 48 per cent. Japan explained this politically sensitive increase in three ways: a rise in exports to Germany due to an upsurge consumer demand in former East Germany; the increase in the value of the yen; and, most worrying, a decrease in Japan's imports of luxury goods due to the end of the consumer spending boom and the collapse in asset values and real estate. However valid these explanations may be, the trade imbalance has once again focused attention in Brussels on the lack of market access in Japan, above all 'structural obstacles' to trade. This has led to renewed debate on how best to prise open the Japanese market. One option is to build on the EC-Japan deal on Japanese cars in the single European market, tentatively called 'Elements of Consensus'. Under the still secret agreement, both sides have attempted to address the central issues of the level of Japanese transplant production in Europe and what share the European and Japanese motor industries should have in the European market's future growth, or, crucially, what share they should have in any decline in demand. The deal is far from water-tight, notably in its failure to secure any commitment from Japan to limit the production of Japanese cars in Europe, and the lack of clarity concerning how Brussels and Tokyo might share future EC car market growth and decline. But it still marks a clear step in the direction of managed trade, based on an effort to calculate future trends in the market. Thus, EC officials are now looking at other European goods to check their performance in Japan and other foreign markets to establish more persuasive evidence on structural barriers to trade. Separately, they are reviewing the EC's own commercial instruments such as anti-dumping mechanisms as well as the US approach based on the Structural Impediments Initiative (SII). Few officials in Brussels rate SII as an unqualified success; but they look enviously at the way in which SII addresses systemic barriers across all sectors of the economy, an intrusive approach which focuses nevertheless on matters that generally have a long time horizon such as the scope of exclusionary business practices in Japan, the distribution system, land use and the savings-investment gap.

			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'WORKING GIRL' TITLE IS EMPLOYED, PLOT IS NOT  </P> <P> In name, at least, that nice little movie "Working Girl" now continues life as  an NBC sitcom.  </P> <P> "Working Girl" the series premieres at 8:30 tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39,  starting a six-episode trial and starring Sandra Bullock in the Tess McGill  role that boosted Melanie Griffith into the national spotlight.  </P> <P> Aside from the title and familiar theme, not a lot survives from the  Oscar-nominated movie about an underestimated secretary who outsmarts her  selfish and insecure boss to advance in the business world. That part of the  story is capsulized in the premiere, although in somewhat different  circumstances. Meanwhile, ensuing episodes will contrast Tess at the office  with Tess at home.  </P> <P> Although this first program is nothing you'd want to build a night around, it's  pleasant enough, with Bullock doing a nice job as Tess (an improvement over  Nancy McKeon, who played the role in an unaired earlier pilot). Tess remains  bright and ambitious while, in this version, having to cope now with a set of  parents and the advances of a playboy who lives in her apartment building.  </P> <P> The premiere is at its best when involving George Newbern as Tess' amusingly  preppy and sniveling colleague and especially Nan Visitor as Tess'  high-powered-but-insecure boss Bryn Newhouse, who must undergo an illogical  lapse in nastiness so that Tess can attain her goal of becoming a junior  executive. More often than not, however, most of the laughs are junior too.  HOWARD ROSENBERG  </P></p>

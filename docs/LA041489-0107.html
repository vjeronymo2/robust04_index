			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: LOOKING FOR PENNIES FROM HEAVEN? SEARCH FOR AN  'ANGEL'  </P> <P> Many entrepreneurs still believe that professional venture capitalists provide  seed money for most new businesses in America. But that is a myth, according to  Robert J. Gaston, author of "Finding Private Venture Capital for Your Firm."  </P> <P> In fact, Gaston contends that professional venture capitalists -- who reject  about 99% of the deals they consider -- invest in only 2,100 of the 600,000 new  businesses opening every year in the United States.  </P> <P> That means that most entrepreneurs are getting money from private investors or  "business angels," as Gaston calls them.  </P> <P> "Angels put almost six of every 10 dollars in very small firms with less than  four employees and sales of under $150,000 per year," Gaston said. He added  that these business angels are scattered across the country and eager to invest  in all kinds of businesses, not just those involved in high technology. Gaston  bases his book on a five-year study of the actual experience of 435 such  investors who invested $60 million between 1982 and 1987. The study was funded  in part by the Small Business Administration.  </P> <P> Gaston, a banker and economist, estimates that each year 720,000 angels make  490,000 investments in 87,000 entrepreneurial ventures. That translates into  $56 billion in risk capital.  </P> <P> And just who are Gaston's angels? His composite angel is a 47-year-old white  male with a college degree in business or engineering. He is a business owner  with entrepreneurial experience and income of $90,000 a year. A typical angel  has a median net worth of $750,000.  </P> <P> Unlike professional venture capitalists who seek a rate of return of at least  30%, Gaston's angels generally sought a 22% return on their investment.  Preferring to keep an eye on their money, they usually invested in companies  within 50 miles of their homes.  </P> <P> On the receiving end is an entrepreneur who is typically a white male between  25 and 35 years old.  </P> <P> Contrary to another financial myth, Gaston says, angels do not limit their  investments to high technology.  </P> <P> Now that you know where the money really comes from, how does an eager  entrepreneur find his or her angels?  </P> <P> Word of mouth, happenstance and luck, says Frank Kilpatrick, a Manhattan Beach  investment banker and financial consultant who specializes in helping companies  write business plans and develop strategies to find money.  </P> <P> "Angel investors will usually have some degree of familiarity with the business  or industry," Kilpatrick said. "They feel they can contribute something  tangible to the enterprise."  </P> <P> To help entrepreneurs meet their angels, Kilpatrick co-founded the Stanford  Entrepreneurial Forum -- a group of Stanford Business School alumni who review  business plans and invite new business owners to make presentations to  potential investors.  </P> <P> He recommends that new business owners seek law and accounting firms that  specialize in helping entrepreneurs, because the partners in such firms often  have contacts in the business community.  </P> <P> One 32-year-old Southern California entrepreneur agreed to discuss his  frustrating search for venture capital if his company's name were not revealed.  He said he is close to completing a financing arrangement and did not want to  jeopardize its success.  </P> <P> The man perfectly fits Gaston's definition of a hungry entrepreneur. For 10  years he worked at a major Southern California aerospace firm in a mid-level,  high-technology job. Eager to start his own business, he began developing a  computer-based product designed to perform a task now done by antiquated  equipment. His product is aimed at a specific industry, and he believes that it  provides a breakthrough solution to a problem.  </P> <P> About a year ago, he quit his job and moved into a tiny office behind his home.  He wrote and rewrote a business plan before convincing one company that his new  system would dramatically improve its operations. After several presentations  and meetings, the company agreed to provide seed money in exchange for the  privilege of buying the first system.  </P> <P> "We are looking for $1.1 million and we have been criticized because our needs  are too small," he said. "It might be easier to raise $30 million."  </P> <P> After repeated rejections from professional venture capitalists, he began  focusing his efforts on attracting business angels, mostly through personal  contacts.  </P> <P> So far, he has raised an undisclosed amount from two such investors and one  institution. And today, the fledgling company has a new office with five  full-time and three part-time employees. He says the first prototype machine  should be ready for demonstration by summer.  </P> <P> Looking back on his experience, he suggests first looking for money from  friends and relatives. "Spend two days with your address book, writing down the  name of everyone who may have money. Then contact them," he advises.  </P> <P> And he cautions against paying people who promise to help you raise money. "I'd  say, do not spend money to get money unless you are completely lost."  </P> <P> While he is not interested in borrowing money from anyone who wants to take  over his company, he says he is willing to take on an experienced investor who  wants to help him run things: "It's not how much money you get, but it's who  you get it from."  </P> <P> Entrepreneurs interested in making presentations to the Stanford  Entrepreneurial Forum should send two copies of their business plan to the  Forum, P.O. Box 7861, Burbank, Calif., 91510.  </P> <P> Two good books about finding venture capital are "Finding Private Venture  Capital for Your Firm," by Robert J. Gaston and "The Arthur Young Guide to  Raising Venture Capital," by G. Steven Burrill and Craig T. Norback.  </P> <P> Gaston's book is published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Business/Law/General Books  division, 605 Third Ave., New York, N.Y. 10158-0012.  </P> <P> The Arthur Young book includes a list of venture capital firms and is published  by Liberty House, a division of TAB Books Inc., Blue Ridge Summit, Pa.  17294-0214.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Change in Climate  </P> <P> The economic climate for small businesses declined slightly in the fourth  quarter of 1988, despite a sharp increase in demand for goods and services,  according to the American Express small business climate index.  </P> <P> The index is a quarterly measure of four factors affecting businesses with  fewer than 100 employees: financing costs, demand for goods and services,  operating costs and optimism. The optimism factor is based on a survey taken by  a national association of independent business owners.  </P> <P> "The small business market is concerned about the prospect of inflation at this  stage of the seven yearlong economic expansion," said David Birch, co-chairman  of the American Express Small Business Partnership.  </P> <P> He said operating costs rose 4.3% over the same period last year. Interest  rates for commercial and industrial loans rose to 11.78% from 11.1%. But demand  for small business products and services rose to an annualized rate of 7.8%,  almost double the third quarter's 4% increase.  </P></p>

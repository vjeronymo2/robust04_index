			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / PowerGen nears radical shake-up POWERGEN has won backing from union leaders for a radical shake-up of pay and collective bargaining procedures. It is the first UK electricity company to win union approval on a local pay and conditions package after the break-up of national arrangements. The proposals include harmonisation of terms and conditions for all employees, increasingly flexible working and introduction of 'single-table bargaining' - the company's six unions negotiating together rather than in the four forums under the national negotiating machinery. If the company's 6,500 employees agree to the changes, many will move to higher salaries. Nalgo, the public-services union, estimates that clerical assistants and typists on Pounds 9,631 will receive Pounds 1,087 and computer operators on Pounds 15,943 will receive Pounds 450 on top of the 5.5 per cent agreed in the national pay talks. Also, all employees will have one-off payments of Pounds 400 plus 2 per cent of salary for moving to the new structure. All 18 UK electricity companies are in talks about changed pay systems after giving notice that this year's national negotiations would be the last. Most want single-table bargaining, although National Power, the biggest generator, is among those which want to retain separate negotiations for different groups of staff. Like PowerGen, all companies will seek to negotiate pay systems that would exclude possible claims from predominantly female groups for pay equal with that of male staff. Mr John Hart, PowerGen personnel director, said the new structure would increase potential for teamwork and flexibility. Members of Nalgo and the other five unions will be balloted on the offer.</p>

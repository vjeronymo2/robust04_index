			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Tartan tidings to Iraq scotched Twelve corporate calendars bound for Iraq have been seized by Customs officers under the United Nations embargo on exports to Iraq. Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering company, had sent out 8,000 calendars worldwide. The Iraq box was held by the Customs and Excise seizure unit, which told Weir Group that the gift broke sanctions. The company had been helping to build a sewage treatment works in Iraq when work was halted by the Gulf war. It sent the calendars to keep in touch with authorities in Iraq. Customs and Excise said: 'There is a total UN embargo on the export of all goods of any kind to Iraq. That means absolutely nothing goes - and we have to enforce that.' The company said yesterday: 'We were shocked and flabbergasted. 'We agree with sanctions, but it does seem strange when they apply to business gifts like this. 'We have been given a month to decide whether to appeal, or otherwise they will be destroyed. But we are not going to appeal. 'All they show is typical Scottish scenes, and a different piece of tartan for each month.'</p>

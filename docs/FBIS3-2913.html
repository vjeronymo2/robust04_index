			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Yang Zhenwu (2799 2182 2976) and </F> XINHUA reporter Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 2429)]    [Text] Beijing, 14 Mar (XINHUA) -- When deliberating  Premier Li Peng's Government Work Report this morning with  People's Liberation Army's [PLA] deputies to the Second Session  of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], Jiang Zemin,  general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of  the Central Military Commission, delivered an important speech  on strengthening all aspects of army building, in keeping with  the new situation characterized by ever-deepening reform, so as  to make continuing contributions to promoting the country's  reform, development, and stability.  <H3>  The Entire Army Should Strive To Accommodate the New  Situation Characterized by Ever-Deepening Reform </H3>   Jiang Zemin said: This year is crucial for promoting reform,  opening up, and modernization. Keeping in mind the need to  build a socialist market economic system, we will combine  breakthroughs in key areas with package reform and strive for  substantial progress in reforming the economic structure. The  introduction and implementation of major reform measures set  forth by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee -- including those aimed at reforming the financial,  taxation, banking, investment, planning, and foreign trade  systems, as well as those designed to establish a modern  enterprise system -- is a "decisive battle" in our process of  reform and opening up. Our victory in this battle and our  establishment of a basic framework for the socialist market  economic structure will effectively guarantee sustained, rapid,  and healthy development in our national economy and will  facilitate the conduct of many affairs.    Jiang Zemin noted: Nationwide, the situation is very good.  The ever-deepening reform, however, dictates a readjustment of  certain economic relations and some interests, resulting in  quite a few new contradictions and problems. We must have a  secure and stable social and political environment in which we  can deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, and promote  development. Our Army comrades must be fully aware of their  historical responsibilities and strive to strengthen all aspects  of Army building so as to better carry out their sacred mission  of safeguarding the motherland's security and unity and of  defending the socialist modernization drive.    He said: Over the past few years, the entire Army has  withstood the test in the course of reform and opening up and  has always maintained a high degree of unified centralism and a  high level of agreement with the party Central Committee. The  establishment of a socialist market economic structure is a  profound socialist transformation, and new circumstances and new  problems will surface incessantly. Ideological problems of  various types will inevitably arise among cadres and fighters.  We should pay attention to improving ideological work among  troops, ensuring that such work will be carried out in a  meticulous, down-to-earth, lively, and deep-going manner. We  should address and solve various ideological and conceptual  problems among troops in accordance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  with the party's principles and policies. We should provide  guidance to everybody concerning the need to consider the  fundamental interests of the party and the state; to stress  ideals, discipline, unity, and overall interests; to  conscientiously subordinate personal interests to general  interests; and to consistently maintain the party's basic line  so as to make continuing contributions to promoting the  country's reform, development, and stability.  <H3>  All Officers and Men Should Be Further Motivated To Carry  Out Their Work </H3>   Jiang Zemin said: Reform, opening up, and modernization are  a grand and arduous undertaking which requires an uplifting of  the entire national spirit and the mobilization of positive  factors in all parts of the country. As the Army goes, it means  we should bring into full play the initiative and creativeness  of all officers and men so that they will render more  meritorious services in Army modernization and make more  contributions to the country's prosperity, strength, and  long-term stability. The most fundamental task at present is to  improve education on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and his ideas for Army  building during the new period, on the party's basic line, and  on the Army's functions and patriotism, so as to further whip up  the enthusiasm of officers and men for dedicating themselves to  national defense and Army building. We should make our  ideological and political education more appealing, relevant,  and effective. We should educate officers and men about the  need to firmly adopt a correct outlook on life and correct  values, always stress the interests of the party and the state,  foster lofty ideals, not to seek fame and wealth, work hard,  make positive contributions, and devote themselves to Army  building and reform.    Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out: Leading cadres'  efforts to forge close ties with the masses, to exercise strict  self-discipline, to set a good example, and to foster a good  image are very important for harnessing the enthusiasm of all  sectors. If officers of a unit identify themselves with  rank-and-file soldiers and follow the mass line in everything  they do, the unit will have unity, healthy work style, and  fighting capacity. Leaders at all levels in the Army should  carry forward the fine tradition of forging close ties with the  masses, uphold the principle of unity between higher and lower  levels and officers and men, truly bear in mind the interests of  the masses, and go down to the grass roots to perform concrete  work and listen to opinions of the masses, thereby drawing on  their wisdom and experiences to further improve the work.    Jiang Zemin also stressed the need to care about the life of  officers and men. He said: In recent years, the party Central  Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military  Commission [CMC], as well as organizations at all levels, have  adopted numerous measures to improve military personnel's living  standards. Nevertheless, quite a few practical problems do exist  in some grass- roots units, especially in units stationed at  hardship posts. The CMC and the Army's headquarters have  attached great importance to and adopted a number of measures to  solve the problems. Organizations at all levels should also  explore ways for improving military personnel's living  standards, especially through encouraging Army units to engage  in agricultural and sideline production. In improving military  personnel's material and cultural life, we should allow  rank-and-file soldiers at grass roots to take precedence over  officers of leading organs. We should first improve the life of  soldiers at grass roots and then officers of leading organs.  This should be a standard requirement and customary practice,  and should be passed on to the future generations.  <H3>  Continually Raise the Army's Level of Building Spiritual  Civilization to a New Height </H3>   Jiang Zemin said: Promoting socialist spiritual civilization  while striving to build socialist material civilization is  Comrade Xiaoping's consistent thought, as well as the party's  important guideline for the modernization drive. We should  unswervingly implement this principle at all times. Reform,  opening up, and the development of a socialist market economy  have exerted a positive influence on the people's ideology and  morality. This is primary. However, we should never ignore the  negative influence. The deeper the reform goes, the wider the  country is open to the outside world, and the further our  material civilization develops, the more necessary it is for us  to promote the building of spiritual civilization. The PLA  should be the vanguard of society in building spiritual  civilization. As far as this issue is concerned, the Army has  scored remarkable achievements and has presented a large number  of advanced models in theoretical study, ideological and moral  construction, and work related to science, culture, education,  literature, and art. For example, Xu Honggang, who risked his  life to save people in difficulty and who showed no fear in the  hour of danger, epitomizes the mental outlook of a people's  soldier and the fine tradition of the party and the Army. His  heroic deeds have aroused strong repercussions throughout the  Army and society. They show that our society can produce and  needs heroes like Xu Honggang. If each and every member of  society can behave like him, the general conduct of society will  keep improving and the cohesive power of our nation and society  will become stronger and stronger. We must further deepen the  campaigns to emulate Lei Feng, Su Ning, Xu Honggang, and other  heroes and models to develop revolutionary spirit, foster  healthy social mores, and promote the building of socialist  spiritual civilization.    Jiang Zemin stressed: To improve spiritual civilization in  the Army, the most important thing to do is to improve officers  and men ideologically and morally. In view of the new  circumstances and new problems that have arisen among officers  and men with regard to their outlook on life, values, and moral  concepts in the new situation, we should conduct various forms  of education to guide cadres and officers about the need to  always bear in mind our Army's goal of serving the people  wholeheartedly; to strengthen their ideals and convictions in  building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to promote the  "five types of revolutionary spirit" initiated by Comrade  Xiaoping; to measure their speeches and actions against such  ideological and moral standards as self- sacrifice,  selflessness, the practice of placing others' interests above  one's own, and hard work; to conscientiously resist the  influence of mammonism, ultra-egoism, and decadent ways of life  so as to become practitioners and preachers of new socialist  morals and customs.  <H3>  We Should Always Pay Attention to Army Building at the  Grass-Roots Level </H3>   Jiang Zemin said: In recent years, the entire Army has  conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the CMC's  directives and made great efforts to strengthen Army building at  the grass- roots level, achieving great success in this respect.  The Army's basic work begins with the grass-roots level.  Leading organs at all levels should further rectify the guiding  ideology of their work, always take the grass-roots level as the  point of departure and basis for their work, and make  unremitting efforts to strengthen the Army's foundations.  Toward the end of last year, the CMC promulgated anew the  "Program for Army Building at the Grass-Roots Level." This was  a major step taken by the CMC to implement Comrade Xiaoping's  ideas for Army building during the new period and to strengthen  all aspects of Army building at the grass-roots level. All units  must implement the program effectively to promote overall  progress in Army building at the grass-roots level. We should  take the buildup of party branches as a crucial aspect of the  effort to strengthen Army building at the grass-roots level.  The Army has rich and excellent traditions of strengthening  party building at the grass-roots level, and it is relatively  well-organized; therefore, it should be able to achieve even  better results in the new situation.    Jiang Zemin said emphatically: The Army is a highly  centralized and unified armed group, which must be trained and  managed strictly. An environment of long-term peace, coupled  with the Army's ever-changing membership, can easily lead to lax  management. This underscores an even greater need for setting  strict demands for troops and for managing and training troops  in accordance with relevant regulations so as to ensure the  strict enforcement of orders and prohibitions. Strict  administration, however, does not amount to doing things in an  oversimplified and crude manner. Our Army has the fine  tradition of promoting unity among officers and men, which  reflects the Army's character and goal; we should closely follow  and widely promote this tradition in the new situation.  Authorities at all levels should explore the distinctive  features and patterns of commanding troops in the new period so  as to constantly improve the level of troop management.    In closing, Jiang Zemin said: We should further improve  unity between the Army and the government and between the Army  and the people. Chairman Mao once said: "If the Army and the  people are united as one, who in the world can match them?" We  have always done a good job in this respect. In the new  situation, we should all the more consolidate and expand the  Army's relations with the government and the people. Local  governments at all levels should show concern and support for  national defense and Army building. The Army should support the  government, cherish the people, and take an active part in and  assist national economic construction. Troops stationed in  impoverished regions, in particular, should do their utmost to  help the poor and make positive contributions to national  development and people's prosperity.    Liu Huaqing, chief of the PLA delegation, chaired today's  plenary session. Zhang Zhen attended the session, along with  Army-affiliated NPC deputies Chi Haotian, Zhang Wannian, Yu  Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou. During the meeting, Deputies Xing  Shizhong, Li Yuanzheng, Yang Huaiqing, and Li Yunsheng spoke on  national defense modernization.</p>

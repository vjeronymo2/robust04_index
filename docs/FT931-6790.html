			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Alexanders falls Pounds 1m into the red ALEXANDERS Holdings, the Ford main dealer, reported a pre-tax deficit Pounds 998,000 for the year ended September 30 1992. That compared with a restated profit of Pounds 405,000 for 1991 and came from turnover up from Pounds 85.4m to Pounds 89m. Losses per share came out at 2.15p (0.65p earnings). The balance sheet shows a deterioration of net assets from Pounds 8m to Pounds 6.74m. As a result of an investigation instigated by Mrs Aleksandra Clayton, the chairman, prior year adjustments have been made to the profit and loss account amounting to Pounds 1.57m, of which Pounds 1.35m relates to 1990. A further loss has to be borne in the 1992 accounts on surplus and over-age used vehicle stock. A charge of Pounds 639,000 has been made to the profit and loss account and to the revaluation reserves relating to the properties at Greenock. This was offset by a profit of Pounds 98,000 on the sale of two of the properties. A revaluation of the other properties in the group as at end-September 1992 has led to a drop of Pounds 1.06m from their 1988 value.</p>

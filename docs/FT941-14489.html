			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / People: Bond trader settles deal Fears among top brass at investment banks in the City that their best bond traders would jump ship once they received their hefty 1993 bonuses are coming true - sooner than they thought. With the ink barely dry on his handsome cheque, Michael Sherwood, the 28-year-old whizz kid widely seen as one of the driving forces behind Goldman Sachs's rise to the top of the Eurobond league table, has traded in his stressful life as head of the Eurobond syndicate desk at the US bank for a more leisurely career as fund manager at a private Swiss bank in London. Goldman's head of Eurobond trading, Sean Church, 29, has gone with him to CBI-UBP International, the London subsidairy of Union Bancaire Privee. Union Bancaire Privee was created in 1990 when Compagnie de Banque et d'Investissements took over TDB American Express, the Geneva-based subsidiary of the US financial services group. 'We received an attractive offer to develop a fund management business for a major Swiss bank in a smaller working environment,' Sherwood said yesterday. Michael de Picciotto, the head of Union Bancaire Privee in London, said the duo will manage fixed-income investments for the bank's clients, and that their appointments are part of the bank's expansion plans. They are expected to be at their desks within one month. Senior management at Goldman Sachs are stoical about the unexpected departure of two of their most successful graduate recruits and point out that staff turnover at their bank is lower than most. Dan Cook, the 30-year-old head of Eurobond syndicate at Union Bank of Switzerland, is joining Lehman Brothers; further evidence that the Eurobond market's annual game of musical chairs has started.</p>

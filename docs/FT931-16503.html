			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Foreign acquisitions in Japan soar US AND EUROPEAN acquisitions of Japanese companies more than doubled last year as manufacturers attempted to improve their local distribution networks and distressed Japanese enterprises sought foreign assistance. Yamaichi Securities said the number of Japanese companies acquired by foreigners rose from 18 to 37, while the corporate finance arm of KPMG Peat Marwick said the number of deals increased from 18 to 43 last year and was on a steady upward trend. Meanwhile, Yamaichi said there were 477 Japanese mergers and acquisitions of foreign companies last year, down 22 per cent on 1991, and down 44 per cent in total value to Y550bn (Dollars 4.38bn). The broker said activity was restricted by a higher cost of capital at home and by the international recession, which weakened companies' desire to expand. The value of foreign acquisitions in Japan rose to Y62bn from Y39bn, according to the Peat Marwick survey, which found that 60 per cent of the 43 deals were acquisitions of distributors or of existing joint venture partners. Mr Thomas Lynch, senior manager of Peat Marwick's corporate finance division, said most of the acquisitions were strategic moves made by already established foreign companies looking to improve their penetration of the Japanese market. He said fear among Japanese employees of being taken over by a foreign company appears to be receding, while a few distressed Japanese companies, having fallen out with their banks, are searching for foreign partners. 'We haven't seen any really big acquisitions yet by foreign companies in Japan, but you might see that in the future. I don't regard this present period of recession as a brief window of opportunity, and I think we will see an increase in the future,' Mr Lynch said. Of the 43 deals, five were of lossmaking Japanese companies, while 14 were acquisitions of distributors, and 12 involved taking over a Japanese joint-venture partner's interests. Ten of the investments were significant minority stakes in Japanese companies. US companies accounted for 21 of the transactions, followed by German companies, five cases, Swiss companies, four cases, and UK companies, three cases, with the remainder other European or Asian-based companies. Eight were in the pharmaceutical industry, seven in the chemical and industrial machinery sectors and five in the computer industry. The fall in Japanese mergers and acquisitions abroad last year left the totals to close that of 1986, before the frenetic activity of the bubble era, when there were 451 cases involving Y544bn, according to Yamaichi Securities.</p>

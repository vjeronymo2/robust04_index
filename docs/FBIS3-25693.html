President de Klerk said at Postmasburg in the northern Cape  that room has been created for Gen. Viljoen's strategic  volkstaat [homeland] option. According to the state president,  Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg was engaging in  petty party politics by rejecting the latest constitutional  proposals.    President de Klerk had earlier said that he was prepared to  testify before the Independent Electoral Commission on  intimidation after another one of his meetings at Postdene, just  outside Postmasburg, was disrupted. He said several cases of  intimidation with the relevant evidence have already been  presented by the National Party to the commission, and it has  been said that such evidence was too vague. President de Klerk  said that today he had been an eyewitness of intimidation in  which people had apparently been provided with official ANC  [African National Congress] flags, banners, and placards.    The state president has canceled this evening's planned  visit  to (Agaleshuwe) just outside Kimberly. He said the move is  aimed at his supporters' safety in the township as two vehicles  have already been reported burned.</p>

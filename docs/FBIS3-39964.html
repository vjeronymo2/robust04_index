			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government does not intend to turn the  residents of Famagusta who will return to the fenced-off area  into an enclave. For this reason, the government is expecting  answers to the vitally important questions of safety and access  to Famagusta. This statement was made by Foreign Minister  Alekos Mikhailidhis, who added that next week the course of  discussions on the implementation of the confidence-building  measures [CBM's] will be determined.    Mr. Mikhailidhis was addressing a news conference this  morning on the results of his contacts in Germany and said that  the prospects for the CBM's are not favorable right now. He  also stressed that, if the Turkish side's intransigence and  filibustering tactics continue, the whole course will be  reexamined. Mr. Mikhailidhis further emphasized that the Greek  Cypriot side should be particularly careful so as to be  convincing about the Turkish intransigence and pointed out that  the discussions on the CBM's will have repercussions on Cyprus'  efforts for accession to the European Union [EU]. Referring to  these efforts, Mr. Mikhailidhis said that the next goal set by  the government is setting a date for opening official EU-Cyprus  negotiations on the island's accession. This goal, he added,  will be pursued during the Greek presidency of the EU. Mr.  Mikhailidhis also expressed satisfaction over his contacts with  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel who, he said, supported  Cyprus' accession to the EU.</p>

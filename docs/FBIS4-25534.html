			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kim Song-yong from Hong Kong] </F>   [Text] Western diplomatic sources in Hong Kong said on 11  June that China promised to send a ground army of approximately  85,000 troops to North Korea if a war breaks out on the Korean  peninsula and, also, to provide credit assistance -- such as  food and energy -- to the latter if UN economic sanctions are  effected.    The sources said: Such an agreement between China and North  Korea was discussed between the key leaders of the North Korean  party and government, who visited China in early June, and the  relevant high-level officials of the Chinese party and Army. As  a result, a final agreement was reached during the visit by Choe  Kwang, chief of the General Staff of the North Korean Army, to  China on 7 June.    Prior to these remarks, a military source in Hong Kong once  said that according to the China-North Korea Friendly Treaty  signed in 1961, China has formulated plans to support North  Korea by sending ground troops between 50,000 and 75,000  soldiers -- who belong to the three divisions of the 39th  Shenyang Military District Army stationed in Dalian -- as well  as approximately 10,000 rapid deployment troops [sinsok  paechigun] of the Jinan Military District to the latter. The  source said, however, that China will send its troops to North  Korea only if North Korea is cornered as a result of an invasion  by the United States and South Korea, and that if North Korea  invades South Korea, China will not directly provide military  support to North Korea, except for spare parts or ammunition for  the Chinese-made weapons North Korea currently possesses.    The sources said: Prior to the China visit by Choe Kwang,  chief of the General Staff of the North Korean Army, North Korea  had sent over 10 high-level leaders from each ministry -- such  as the Workers Party of Korea, the Army, the Ministry of  People's Armed Forces, the Ministry of Public Security, the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Metal Industry  -- to Beijing to discuss the issues -- such as China's  participation in a war if it breaks out on the Korean peninsula,  as well as its economic support for North Korea if the United  Nations imposes economic sanctions on North Korea -- with the  relevant Chinese authorities, including leaders of the Communist  Party of China and its People's Liberation Army. In return for  China's support for North Korea, North Korea has proposed that  it will grant China the right to use the ports in the East Sea  areas, and that it will provide materials such as nonferrous  metals and cement to China.    They also said: Kim Kyong-hui, younger sister of Kim  Chong-il, a director of the Light Industrial Department of the  Workers Party of Korea, visited Beijing in late May to hold a  working-level meetings with the Chinese side in order to discuss  its economic support for North Korea. She is expected to return  home around 13 June.</p>

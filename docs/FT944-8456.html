			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Bids Higher offers were made this week as both the big take-over battles continued to rage. Yesterday, British Aerospace raised its offer for VSEL, topping the rival bid from GEC, while Browning-Ferris Industries increased its share offer for Attwoods on Thursday. BAe increased its offer from 2.727 to 3.3 of its shares for each VSEL share. This was worth around Pounds 14.70 yesterday compared with GEC's cash offer of Pounds 14. BAe increased its cash alternative from Pounds 11.40 to Pounds 14. While this battle could have some way to go yet, BFI's hostile Pounds 391m bid for Attwoods, the waste services company, is nearing its climax, writes Peggy Hollinger. Shareholders have two simple choices in deciding which company to back. The increased offer from BFI of 116.75p a share is a mere 7 per cent higher than the original bid, which valued the company at Pounds 364m. It is not so generous that investors are likely to fall over themselves in accepting it. Yet, this is a firm cash offer. It also includes the promise to pay, in addition to the share offer, the proposed 3.25p dividend to shareholders who accept the bid. Attwoods is proposing a break-up plan which, it claims, will return better value to shareholders. But it is unable to quantify the amount it will net from a break-up. Nor can it name potential buyers, although Waste Management International has already declared its interest in acquiring the UK businesses. The feeling from potential purchasers is that Attwoods resorted to the break-up option too late in the defence to give it any real weight. Shareholders will have to come up with their own estimates of what the various businesses are worth. Then, they will have to accept that the process will take time. They will also have to be convinced in the next couple of weeks that Attwoods has serious buyers lined up to carry out the break-up plan. Unless it can do this, it is likely that the increased offer put forward by BFI will win the day. Last week's biggest bid came from Boots which, on Tuesday, launched a Pounds 500m offer - for its own shares, writes David Wighton. Private shareholders were not invited to apply. Through its stockbroker, Warburg Securities, Boots spent a total of Pounds 508m in the morning buying back 10 per cent of its shares at prices between 528p and 535p. The offer was only slightly more than the market price but Boots was swamped with demand from institutions. This is because such share buy-backs are very attractive to non-taxpaying investors such as pension funds. In addition to the cash from Boots, they should be able to claim a tax credit from the government of more than 110p a share. Although Boots could not make the offer available to private shareholders, they should also benefit. Because the reduction in the number of shares in issue outweighs the interest foregone on the Pounds 508m, the buy-back should enhance Boots' earnings per share. That, in turn, should increase the value of the shares. The buy-back followed the announcement on Monday that Boots plans to sell its prescription drug business to BASF of Germany for about Pounds 850m. The deal will leave Boots with much more cash than it needs and an inefficient capital structure. Although strategically sensible, it will also dilute earnings, an effect which will be partly offset by the share buy-back. Analysts estimate that the two deals together will leave Boots with dilution of around 3 per cent - and plenty of cash to pursue acquisitions in over-the-counter medicines.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CURRENT TAKEOVER BIDS AND MERGERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company    Value of bid   Market       Price  Value of   Bidder bid for      per share+   price+  before bid  bid Pdsm+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aitken Hume         55*       51          51     29.60   Allied Group Andrews Sykes       65*       95          67     10.70   Euro Fire Prot.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chong Chang-won] </F>   [Text] An International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  reliable source said: In the course of its inspection of  nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, North Korea, the IAEA inspection  team discovered today that some seals of main nuclear facilities  were damaged and is taking follow-up measures.    The source said that seals for reactors of five megawatt and  over, which had been used for extracting plutonium, were not  damaged and that some seals in the radiochemical laboratory -- a  nuclear waste reprocessing facility -- and in the nuclear fuel  producing plant seemed to have problems.    The source explained: It is a convention for an inspection  team to confirm if nuclear materials in containers with damaged  seals are identical to those listed in the first report  submitted by a country that is subject to IAEA inspections, as  soon as seal damage is confirmed. This enables the inspection  team to determine if nuclear materials have been diverted to  other purposes.    David Kyd, information director of the IAEA, said: I am  unable to comment now on the question about seal damage in North  Korea's nuclear facilities. I will report the details of the  result of the ongoing inspection on North Korea to the next  meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors.    Saying that the inspection team is now smoothly conducting  inspections at Yongbyon, Director Kyd hinted that the question  about the seal damage, which caused arguments between the  inspection team and the North Korean authorities, has been  solved smoothly.    The inspection team will continue to inspect nuclear  facilities in Yongbyon until this weekend and will leave  Pyongyang around 15 March after winding up its inspection early  next week.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GUARD ISSUE CITED IN PRINGLE-UMBERG CONTEST  </P> <P> "Pringle Defends Seat in Hot O.C. Assembly Race" (Oct. 21) exposes several  issues concerning this Assembly seat.  </P> <P> First of all, it is true that the district is largely Democratic and that its  voters are still conservative and are perfectly willing to elect a Republican.  However, even conservative Democrats are intelligent and sensitive. They are  very well aware of the racist and prejudicial act of the Republican Party in  1988.  </P> <P> Contrary to what (Curt) Pringle says, this past action on behalf of Pringle is  an issue and will continue to be an issue in future elections. The Republican  Party, and in particular Pringle and his cohorts, paid uniformed guards to  watch the heavily Latino/Chicano voting places.  </P> <P> The posting of these guards at the 22 most heavily Latino/Hispanic/Chicano  polling places by the Republican Party and directed, supported and paid for by  Pringle, is not a case of conservatives versus liberals or Democrats versus  Republicans. It is anti-American, anti-civil rights and anti-human rights. Many  Anglo, Republican, conservative, moral Americans have spoken against this  racist act. These persons will be voting against Mr. Pringle this time around.  </P> <P> Second, either Mr. Pringle is talking out of both sides of his mouth or speaks  with a forked tongue, or both. (Pringle) stated that "Politics was a way to  improve your area and have a say." Well, posting poll guards paid with  Republican funds can hardly be a way to improve "his" area.  </P> <P> Improving means to make it better. I fail to see how the posting of the  uniformed poll guards to deprive a segment of people of their civil rights --  the right to vote -- can make an area better. Mr. Pringle has yet to apologize  or acknowledge any wrongdoing on his behalf.  </P> <P> The settlement of $400,000 cannot buy the Latino out. No amount of money is  going to wash away the pain or the shame committed against a group of people  who have for so long worked, fought and earned this most privileged right, the  right to elect a person who can and will represent them. The right to vote is  sacred for it gives us representation.  </P> <P> Jim Crow days are past, even for the Latinos. We will no longer be intimidated!  Justice will be served and Mr. Pringle can return to his family business.  Meanwhile, in Sacramento, Mr. Tom Umberg will be representing all of his  constituents -- liberals, conservatives, Democrats and Republicans.  </P> <P> ENRIQUETA LOPEZ RAMOS, Santa Ana  </P></p>

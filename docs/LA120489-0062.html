			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 CATHOLIC CHURCHES DEFACED IN AIDS PROTEST;  </P> <P> VANDALISM: CALLER SAYS GAY ACTIVISTS WERE ANGERED BY ARCHBISHOP ROGER MAHONY'S  CONDEMNATION OF THE USE OF CONDOMS TO FIGHT THE DEADLY DISEASE.  </P> <P> Gay activists, saying they are angered by Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M.  Mahony's recent condemnation of the use of condoms to fight the spread of AIDS,  claim they splattered bright red paint on four Los Angeles-area Roman Catholic  churches early Sunday morning.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the activists -- who said he is part of a newly formed group  called Greater Religious Responsibility! (GRR!) -- said members of the group  also pasted posters featuring a full-face photo of Mahony on church doors.  "Safe sex is a lie and a fraud" was printed above the picture. In larger  letters, "MURDERER" appeared at the bottom.  </P> <P> Roman Catholic bishops have come under fire from AIDS activists for  overwhelmingly approving a major policy statement rejecting the use of condoms  as a means of fighting the spread of the fatal disease. The statement was  drafted by a committee that Mahony chaired at last month's National Conference  of Catholic Bishops in Baltimore.  </P> <P> In presenting the policy paper to the bishops, Mahony declared that young  people should avoid "being trapped into the 'safe-sex' myth, which is both a  lie and a fraud." That paraphrased statement was featured atop the posters.  </P> <P> In a call to The Times on Sunday, a person who described himself as one of the  activists and who declined to give his name, asserted that in endorsing the  anti-condom position, the bishops committed "an immoral act." The red paint  symbolized blood and the tragedy of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, he  said.  </P> <P> About 20 activists were involved in the vandalism, the caller said.  </P> <P> "We will probably be doing more postering around town before Christmas," he  added.  </P> <P> Mahony could not be reached for comment Sunday.  </P> <P> The four vandalized churches were: Immaculate Conception Church on West 9th  Street, part of the headquarters complex of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of  Los Angeles; St. Basil Church, mid-Wilshire District; St. Ambrose Church, West  Hollywood; and St. Charles Church, North Hollywood.  </P> <P> By the time Sunday morning services had begun at the churches, much of the red  paint had been washed off main, side and rectory doors, and several of the  11-inch by 17-inch black-and-white Mahony posters had been scraped off.  </P> <P> At St. Ambrose, however, the red paint and posters were generally left intact.  </P> <P> "I left it there deliberately this morning," said the church's pastor, Father  John A. Beattie, "as a reminder that there's still anger and prejudice and  intolerance" in the world.  </P> <P> During an interview in the church's office, Beattie noted that the vandalism  took place on the first Sunday of Advent, the beginning of the liturgical year  when people are looking ahead to a Christmas season of brotherhood and good  will.  </P> <P> The anonymous GRR! spokesman said that, indeed, the vandalism was timed to  Advent "to bring more attention to it."  </P> <P> Beattie, who observed that about one-third of the West Hollywood church's  congregation is gay, said he called attention to the vandalism during his  sermon Sunday. He said he declared that "we should ask for more understanding,  more tolerance and more compassion of each other."  </P> <P> The activists, Beattie added, may have misunderstood the message that came out  of the bishops' conference.  </P> <P> "I thought the whole tone of the (bishops') statement was compassion," he said.  "I think that wasn't heard, and that's unfortunate."  </P> <P> At St. Basil, a priest denounced the vandalism. At the same time, though, he  declared that Mahony's position was "not realistic" to say that, in effect,  "you can't even give people information" about the use of condoms in the fight  against AIDS.  </P> <P> The priest, who requested anonymity, pointed to red paint streaking the  church's rectory and said, "That's not the Catholic teaching." Still, he said,  many Catholic priests disagree with last month's anti-condom position.  </P> <P> "This is a horrible struggle for us priests who are trying to be pastoral," he  said.  </P></p>

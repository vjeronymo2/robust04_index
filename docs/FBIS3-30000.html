Zhu made the request in a  meeting with Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP).    Kono replied that the LDP will actively support China's bid.    Zhu also asked for the LDP's support in Japan's expected  provision of a fourth yen loan to China starting in fiscal 1996.    Zhu, currently on a nine-day visit to Japan which started  Wednesday, also met three former prime ministers, Toshiki Kaifu,  Noboru Takeshita and Kiichi Miyazawa.    Miyazawa, noting the need of stepping up Japan's support of  the Chinese economy, expressed concern over China's potential to  become a military superpower, the officials said.    "If China becomes economically strong, it will be also  militarily strong. Japan has a policy of not becoming a  military superpower, so I also want China not to be one,"  Miyazawa was quoted as saying.    Zhu, calling Miyazawa's concern "groundless," replied that  "China will never seek hegemony."</p>

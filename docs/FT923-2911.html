			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Optimism among builders BATTERED and bruised in recent weeks by hefty downgradings and announcements of trading losses and dividend cuts, the building materials and contracting sectors were among the market's best performing areas yesterday after the German interest rate reductions. Redland and RMC, two of the most important companies in the building materials sector and both heavily involved in the German market, surged ahead as some industry analysts took the view that the reduction in German rates could well mark a watershed in European interest rates. A specialist commented: 'There is a modest groundswell of opinion that we may have passed the worst of what has been a hideous period for the building materials companies, but we still have the French referendum ahead of us and it could still go horribly wrong.' Redland shares, buffeted by recent profits downgrades and due to report interims on October 1, jumped 24 to 357p. RMC, which last week suffered the indignity of being dropped from the FT-SE 100 Index, advanced 23 to 436p. The latter is expected to announce a modest increase in its interim dividend on Thursday, along with a slight decline in half-year profits. Utilities languish The utilities sectors were among the handful of areas of the market not to participate in the general upturn. 'They are simply not fashionable on a day when the hint of interest rate cuts is in the air,' said one dealer. He added that the stocks had performed well against the market during the recent bout of currency-inspired turbulence and also amid hints of a new five-year coal agreement between the generators and British Coal. The generators were heavily traded, with National Power closing 7 down at 254p on 5.3m shares dealt and PowerGen 6 easier at 267p on 6.9m. Manweb was the worst casualty in the electricity distribution stocks, sliding 20 to 426p. South West gave up 18 to 396p and London 13 to 385p. The water issues had Anglian 7 cheaper at 425p, Severn Trent 6 down at 404p and Thames 4 off at 439p. Hints of a cut in UK interest rates were enough to send the housebuilders sharply better. Tarmac moved forward 10 to 69p, Bryant 8 to 74p and George Wimpey 6 to 80p. The high street banks led the market charge at the outset of trading but closed well below the day's best levels. Barclays attracted the heaviest support and settled 9 up at 323p, after touching 336p, on turnover of 9.6m. HSBC finished 8 1/2 stronger at 354p on 6.5m traded. Hopes that the sharp rise in the market will trigger an increase in turnover and more corporate activity boosted SG Warburg, finally 20 higher at 454p. The prospect of a reduction in UK interest rates saw discount houses turn upwards, Gerrard &amp; National gaining 16 at 276p. United Friendly moved up 19 to 390p in response to the increased interim profits and dividend. The latest steep rise in the dollar gave a strong fillip to insurance brokers, CE Heath climbing 11 to 268p and Willis Corroon 7 to 173p. Oil shares attracted a fresh burst of support from domestic and overseas sources, notably the US, where buyers responded to the upswing in the dollar. But a number of oil specialists said the sharp gain in the dollar was needed to head off an expected series of substantial profits downgrades in the sector. Dividend growth in BP, an analyst said, remained a long way off. BP shares, stimulated by US support, ran up 7 to 204 1/2 p on 8.4m traded, while Shell appreciated 8 to 482p on 3.6m. Calor put on 9 to 196p in front of Thursday's interim figures. The exploration and production sub-sector performed well, notably Enterprise Oil, which improved 11 to 339p. Although closing well below their best levels after a session of erratic movements, shares in the big international drug companies recorded substantial gains on the back of their heavy dollar-earning capability. Glaxo raced up to 815p before settling 22 1/2 ahead at 790p, SmithKline Beecham advanced 13 to 502p and Wellcome 5 to 884p. The 40 per cent-plus jump in interim profits and increased dividend left British Polythene 24 stronger at 409p. There were some stocks, however, that not even a strong market trend could help yesterday. Food manufacturing group Hillsdown Holdings was among these, easing 3 to 82p in heavy trade of 6.5m shares. The group reported disappointing figures last week well below the market's best estimates, which had precipitated a downward trend in the shares. Sentiment in the stock was further weakened by reports that three substantial lines of stock - one of between 7m and 8m shares - were trying to find buyers in a reluctant market. Shares in Granada Group ignored the market's upsurge and slipped 3 to 235p in light trading. The damage appears to have been caused by the gloomy outlook that analysts visiting the company yesterday came away with. Brokers were particularly downbeat about the rental division, in which trading over the last few months is said to have been poor. The sentiment in Granada appeared to spill over into Thorn EMI, which also has a rental division, and the shares ended a penny lighter at 670p. Volume was 1.7m. This year's poor summer weather in the UK has started taking its toll. USM-quoted Clarke Foods plunged 43 to 21p after stating that it was no 'longer appropriate to pay an interim dividend' as previously intended, because of the fall in ice cream sales which has had a severe effect on the company's finances. The view that UK interest rates are unlikely to be lowered in the short term hurt business services group BET, a penny easier at 108p after 1.4m shares traded. Car repair group Kwik-Fit fell sharply after it surprised the market by announcing a sharp fall in interim profits to Pounds 9.74m, from Pounds 16.75m at the same stage last year. Having dropped to 86p on the release of the figures, the shares rallied to close 13 down at 96p. Inchcape jumped 23 to 420p after reporting an improvement in interim figures. US investors were once again reported to be the day's main buyers of British Steel. Turnover reached 13m as the shares hardened 3 to 54p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (52).

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Guatemala Flash" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Nationalist Authentic Central (CAN) party  leadership expressed through its general secretary, Roberto Tito  Arana, its satisfaction with the patriotism demonstrated by the  Guatemalan people by going to the polls to cast their vote in  favor of the referendum. This action resulted in the approval  of the constitutional reforms, thereby laying the foundations  for purging Congress and the Supreme Court. The CAN leadership  concluded by stating: "Although we are immersed in a sea of  uncertainty and indecision, the people's will as expressed in  the referendum compels us to demand the immediate purge of state  institutions. As a direct consequence, elections must be held  immediately in order not to frustrate the aspirations of the  Guatemalan people, who for several months have been demanding  the election of a new congress.</p>

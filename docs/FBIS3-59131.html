Reporting to the secret  services committee today were Sisde chief, Domenico Salazar, and  the head of Sismi, General Cesare Pucci.    Coming out of the meeting, committee members said that both  men have made mention of an episode which occurred on December  31 when fishermen found a container containing a vest and two  handguns 50 meters from the shore at Santa Severa, the town  north of Rome where Scalfaro has a home. However, both secret  service chiefs tended to downplay the find, saying it was more a  matter for the local police force. Salazar said that whenever  there is an institutional void there is always a greater risk of  destabilization as subversive elements look for their chance to  move. The important thing is not to let down one's guard, the  Sisde chief said.    Pressed by journalists to elaborate on his reference to  subversive or "deviant" elements, Salazar said every now and  then there was a telephone call from the "Armed Phalange," for  example, and that there might well be deviant strains running  through other, unspecified "forces," persons "who cannot accept  the present state of things; this inevitable process of  evolution." Forces different from the security services? he was  asked. "That's the way it looks to me," he replied.    Security is tight around the head of state, who has also  been  advised during this period to spend more of his time living at  the Quirinale (presidential) palace.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Radiation leak at Sellafield 'serious but within limits' A RADIATION LEAK at the Sellafield nuclear site last week, believed to be the first since 1986, was described yesterday as 'serious' by the government, although it added that radioactivity levels were 'well within safety limits'. Since last Wednesday one of the main chimneys on British Nuclear Fuel's site had discharged more than five times the amount of radioactivity that it normally discharged in a whole year, Mr David Maclean, environment minister, said yesterday in an emergency statement in the Commons. However, he added that the release of 1,000 megabecquerels of radioactivity was less than a quarter of the site's current authorised limits of 4,300MBq a year. BNF said last night that monitoring since the weekend showed that discharges had fallen to 20MBq a day. The latest incident follows an internal leak last year when no radiation is believed to have escaped into the air. It comes at a sensitive time for BNF, which is waiting for the pollution inspectorate to approve new discharge limits, including those for BNF's controversial new Thorp reprocessing plant. Last week's discharges would have breached the terms of the proposed new licence by around 50 per cent, according to Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman. BNF was still unclear last night about the cause of the leak in Building 203, a now disused plant for reprocessing nuclear fuel. Particles of alpha radiation escaped through a ventilation system to the central chimney stack on Building 204 at the heart of the site. BNF found that levels of alpha radiation had risen at 3pm last Thursday when the monitoring device attached to the chimney stack, which is changed every day for testing, was removed. Mr Maclean said yesterday that he was concerned about the time it took for the incident to to be reported to the inspectorates, which were not told until 4pm on Friday. BNF declined to say on Friday how much radiation had been emitted. Mr Maclean said a full investigation by the pollution and nuclear installations inspectorates and the agriculture ministry was under way and the results would be published. He told the Commons that, on the basis of pessimistic estimates, the increase in dose to the public close to the plant was less than  1/2 per cent of the annual average dose in the UK. Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary whose constituency covers the plant, said: 'It is unacceptable that one quarter of the annual authorisation of particular radio nucleids should be discharged in just a 24-hour period.' He complained that he had not been told of the incident when he visited the plant on Thursday and Friday of last week. BNF said it sent him a facsimile late on Friday. Greenpeace, the campaign group, said yesterday: 'If this is how BNF behave under the existing licences, how can we trust them under the new ones?'</p>

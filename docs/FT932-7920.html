			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / BR freight to be split for sell-off: Rail businesses could pass into foreign ownership MOST OF British Rail's Pounds 700m-a-year freight business is to be split into three regional companies and sold to the private sector in 1995, the government announced yesterday. One stock market analyst estimated that the three companies - mainly comprising BR's profitable coal, steel, iron ore and petroleum operations - could have a combined value of Pounds 500m in a trade sale or stock market flotation. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said he had already received inquiries from companies interested in buying the freight operations, and added that management buy-outs would be considered. He also opened up the possibility that the freight businesses could pass into foreign ownership. 'We have had visits from overseas,' he said. The freight operations are being sold as part of the government's plans for the privatisation of BR. The plans will start taking effect in April next year if the Railways Bill, currently before parliament, is passed. Mr MacGregor said the government's aim was to create a 'thriving, competitive' railfreight business. He said: 'Our proposals offer the best hope of getting more freight back on to the railways.' The plans envisage that BR's profitable bulk freight business, which made an operating profit of Pounds 67.5m on turnover of Pounds 505.5m in the year to March 1992, will be split into three geographical units next year in readiness for privatisation. These units will include BR's contract services businesses, carrying goods such as china clay, chemicals, food and drink. These are among the few profitable parts of the heavily lossmaking Railfreight Distribution business. Existing bulk freight contracts will be evenly split between the three geographical units. But once in the private sector the companies will be free to compete against one another for existing and new business in all parts of the country. They will also have to compete with any new companies wishing to enter the railfreight market, all of which will enjoy equal rights of access to the railway tracks once privatisation takes place. Mr MacGregor said the freight operations were being split into three to promote competition. 'BR's customers very strongly agree with the idea of breaking up BR's monopoly,' he said. One other part of BR's freight operations - Rail Express Systems, the BR business responsible for Royal Mail trains - is to be privatised as soon as possible, but the government has not yet decided what form the sale should take. The lossmaking freight operations, including Freight-liner, the container business, will have to stay with whatever is left of BR after privatisation while the government looks for ways of getting the private sector involved in running them. These account for about 20 per cent of BR's freight business in revenue terms. BR will also retain responsibility for Continental freight for the present so that it can see the launch of Channel tunnel services through their initial phase.</p>

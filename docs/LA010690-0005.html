			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRS AND PHONY DEPENDENTS  </P> <P> Once again an editorial in The Times focuses on the micro and ignores the  macro. Yes, it's true, computers can give us the power to squeeze taxpayers for  every penny due the government, and the IRS is well-known for using computers  like Jimmy Connors uses a tennis racket.  </P> <P> When outrage at an exercise of power without due process is appropriate  (requiring parents to "register" their 2-year-old babies with a bureaucracy  heretofore empowered to issue numbers to "working people," i.e., people old  enough to hold a job!), The Times instead exhibits pious glee at the IRS'  computerized efficiency in collecting taxes. The Times shirks its civic duty,  trust and responsibility when it fails to point out these subtle, grievous and  insidious governmental incursions into our lives.  </P> <P> Yes, something must be done to bring tax cheaters to account, but a free  society cannot long endure when $2.8 billion in taxes is all that stands  between dignity and respect for all of our unnumbered children and Uncle Sam's  depleted coffers.  </P> <P> The tax monies accrued by using this reprehensible program will never begin to  equal the loss of privacy to citizens.  </P> <P> My Social Security number was issued to me, and proudly accepted by me, at the  advanced age of 14. I remember it as a proud rite of passage. It meant that I  had a job. The number was for people who work! Not babies!  </P> <P> I fear that as a nation of free people we are in great peril when a major  newspaper like The Times fails to see the real violation of our rights as  private persons.  </P> <P> DAN PEARSON  </P> <P> Port Hueneme  </P></p>

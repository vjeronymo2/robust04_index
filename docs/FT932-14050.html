			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Greyhound ends bus dispute with union GREYHOUND Lines yesterday finally made peace with the Amalgamated Transit Union, three years after a bloody and bitter strike by the union against the US bus company began. The ATU, which in 1990 represented about 8,500 drivers, clerks and mechanics at Greyhound, signed a tent-ative six-year pact with Greyhound. Under this agreement, Greyhound would pay Dollars 22m (Pounds 14.5m) in back pay to striking workers and recall a minimum of 550 strikers. The deal must still be ratified by union members, the National Labor Relations Board, and the bankruptcy court which oversaw Greyhound's Chapter 11 reorganisation. During the bankruptcy reorganisation, Greyhound set aside a pool of assets to meet the potential back-pay liability. The pool has recently been reported to be worth about Dollars 24m. Greyhound was subject to a leveraged buy-out in 1987 and although management was able to secure substantial wage concessions at this stage, its subsequent efforts to negotiate a new contract with ATU members proved fruitless. The strike which followed was particularly bruising, even in the context of US labour battles, and Greyhound filed for bankruptcy shortly after it began. It also recruited non-union drivers, and claimed to be running almost 90 per cent of its pre-strike service within weeks. Since then, the company has reorganised its operations and capital structure, emerged from bankruptcy and floated its shares on the stock market. The settlement, however, may help restore the group's image with the public. The timing may also be advantageous, since the company usually adds drivers in the summer season.</p>

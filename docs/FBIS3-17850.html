			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baku (March 29) TURAN -- This morning the meeting of  Milli Majlis [National Assembly] resumed. There is an  acceptance of the resolution about the events of January 20,  1990 on the agenda. As it was announced that last week Milli  Majlis discussed the question for three days, but failed to  adopt a final decision.    During today's discussion the Speaker Rasul Guliyev and his  deputy Afiaddin Dzhalilov closely support the draft of the  document, however the oppositional and independent deputies are  against the document.    As it was earlier informed, the aim of the document is to  accuse the Popular [People's] Front of Azerbaijan [PFA] as well  as the former leadership of Azerbaijan (Mutalibov and Vezirov)  in the bloody events of January 1990. However, the number of  the deputies supporting the former leadership and the Popular  Front of Azerbaijan in today's meeting is considerable.    As TURAN NEWS AGENCY was informed by one of the Milli Majlis  members "though President Aliyev and his supporters try to make  decisions in favour of their ideas, they will fail".</p>

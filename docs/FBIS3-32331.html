			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gerardo Segura; from the "Good Morning From </F> Mexico" newscast; passages within quotation marks recorded]    [Text] Brigadier General Mario Guillermo Fromow, National  Defense Secretariat judge advocate general, stated he is  investigating complaints of two alleged executions by the Army  in Ocosingo, Chiapas State.    [Fromow] "When soldiers succeeded in liberating Ocosingo  Square they found a number of corpses covered with blood, but  they had been killed some time earlier. Two of them do appear to  have been shot in the head with a small caliber firearm. It is  not the type of firearm the Army uses. Others had wounds caused  by rifles. The Army does not use those either. In sum, we are  investigating that."    He said action will be taken if soldiers are found  responsible.    [Fromow] "We will proceed immediately against anyone, no  matter who it is, if he belongs to the Army. I can tell you this  is an act of violence against people, nothing less than  homicide."    The judge advocate general stated that his office handles  the  complaints filed by the National Human Rights Committee [CNDH].    [Fromow] "In Chiapas' case, this office has received 25  complaints. I am already responding with full information to the  CNDH so it can have the elements and judge whether or not the  rights of a citizen were violated or the law was broken."    During an interview with Television Azteca, Gen. Fromow  talked about the attitude of some servicemen and their  involvement with the complaints that have been filed.    [Fromow] "Generally these cases involve the arrests of  certain people by soldiers. That is not far from the truth. They  were arrested, but they were immediately handed over to regular  or federal authorities with medical certificates attesting to  their physical well-being." The Army carried out no bombings  in the Chiapas conflict, the judge advocate general stated.    [Fromow] "One cannot even imagine that the Army bombed  towns.  First, not a single bomb was used, because it was not necessary.  We are not going to get to that point either. The Army has  strafed those individuals who conducted attacks." In sum, he  said, we are seeking peace, because servicemen have suffered in  the conflict. The Army has sustained casualties, and soldiers  are risking their lives.    [Fromow] "More than anything else, the Army wants peace and  tranquillity. It wants peace the most, because soldiers know the  consequences of these incidents; they know they are losing or  risking their lives."</p>

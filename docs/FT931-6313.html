			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trafalgar to press on with cash call TRAFALGAR House is to proceed with its rights issue after winning support from small shareholders at yesterday's extraordinary meeting. The engineering, construction and shipping group already had more than 274m proxy votes, mainly from institutional investors, in favour of its Pounds 204.5m cash call with only 800,332 against. Directors were visibly relieved that small shareholders, after voicing criticism of the management, voted overwhelmingly in favour of the 1-for-2 rights issue at 60p. Small shareholders voted at the recent annual meeting against reappointing Touche Ross, the auditors, after 1991 results were restated. Although institutional investors voted in favour of retaining the auditors, Trafalgar said it would look at the question later this year. Small shareholders yesterday asked whether the Pounds 120m of exceptional losses and write-downs which may be required in the year to end-September would be the last word on the subject. The warning of further write-downs followed the decision to announce substantial write-downs for 1992. Mr Alan Clements, chairman, said: 'I cannot say that this is the last final word on the subject.' The rights issue proceeds will be used to repay borrowings. Mr Clements said it would take the pressure off the group to make quick disposals. The group has said it wants to sell its hotels, which include the Ritz and the Stafford. Mr Clements said there were no plans to change the group's advisers, which include Kleinwort Benson and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, or to make further changes to the board. other than those already announced. He accepted that non-executive directors, who include Mr Tony Ryan, chairman of GPA, the aircraft leasing company, and Mr David Howell, Conservative MP, 'did not realise early on enough the problems facing the company'. Mr Clements is non-executive chairman.</p>

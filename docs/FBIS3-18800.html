However, a precondition for that is better access to the  markets in the region, Rexrodt will say at the traditional "East  Asian Love Feast" of the East Asian Association in Hamburg on  Friday [4 March] evening, according to the prereleased script of  his speech. Asian products have almost unlimited access to the  German and the European markets. "We wish for similarly good and  fair conditions in Asia," the minister will say.    Thus, foreign trade in particular is to be promoted, but  also  cooperation in the fields of science and technology,  environment, development, education, and culture. Trade and  industry are to be supported more intensively in their efforts  by the German trade chambers on site, the Federal Office for  Foreign Trade Information, and the German embassies. Already,  10 trade delegations or chambers are operating in the  Asian-Pacific area. Other representations in Shanghai and  Guangzou (China) are being planned. Hermes export guarantees  and federal loan guarantees are to be issued in greater numbers  to ensure direct investments. At the end of 1993 these  investment guarantees in this region amounted to 1.8 billion  German marks.</p>

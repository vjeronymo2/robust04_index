			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK bank losses blamed on government policies: Leigh-Pemberton identifies 'errors' in 1980s MISTAKES in economic policy in the 1980s were a significant cause of the huge losses now being suffered by the country's banks, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said last night. His remarks come at a time when relations between the banks and the government are strained. He did not address the Treasury's allegation that banks are behaving insensitively in their dealings with financially stretched small businesses. But he expressly denied a claim being investigated by the Treasury that lending margins have widened significantly. Mr Leigh-Pemberton, who is due to retire in June, said poor credit assessment by banks was also a factor in causing the loan losses. But he absolved the Bank's supervision department of any blame. 'Supervisors . . . cannot and should not second guess the management of individual institutions,' he said. He said the main role of the supervision department was to prevent damage to the financial system. 'The UK banking industry is well-placed to absorb the pressures of the longest and deepest recession in many decades.' UK banks have suffered billions of pounds of losses on loans made in the mid-1980s. Many of the bad loans were to property companies or were backed by property collateral. Mr Leigh-Pemberton, talking to the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland, said 'it was not surprising that banks sought to increase the volume of their lending (in the 1980s) . . . it may well be that banks, lulled by the strength and the persistence of the upswing, became less sensitive to cyclical risks'. He added: 'Many financial arrangements that had seemed reasonable in the heady days of the 1980s, reasonable even against normal expectations of cyclical behaviour, were fatally undermined by the length and depth of the recession.' He said the recession would not have been so deep if the government had not allowed the growth rate immediately before to be excessive. 'The lesson for policymakers is that we can never afford to take risks with stability . . . we need, above all, a stable monetary environment, one in which policy is geared to the achievement of price stability.' Mr Leigh-Pemberton did not argue that banks were blameless for their loan losses. He identified three lessons for them: 'Do they really pay sufficient attention to the lessons of history - for example the property crisis of the early 1970s?' 'Did they really monitor the credit criteria which had served them well in the past?' 'Were the incentives given to loan officers really appropriate, or did they encourage new business at the expense of sound business?' He lectured the banks on the need to attach the highest priority to the 'control and pricing of risk'. But he said the deregulation of banking and financial services was 'irreversible and, in any case, desirable'. Calling the lenders to account Page 11 Observer Page 17 Lex Page 18</p>

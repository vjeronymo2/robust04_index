			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOP FIRES AIDE WHO ADMITTED EXTORTION  </P> <P> A top Republican aide fell victim Friday to a continuing federal investigation  of Capitol corruption when GOP leaders fired her, three days after she admitted  extorting $12,500 for her bosses.  </P> <P> Karin Watson, 42, a former fund-raiser who had been restricted to a research  role in recent months, was fired by Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of  La Habra on Friday morning.  </P> <P> "I have indicated to her that we are terminating her employment," Johnson said  in an interview after meeting briefly with Watson. He declined to discuss the  matter further.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana), chairman of the Assembly Rules Committee,  which oversees all staff for the lower house, said he expected to ratify  Johnson's decision without requiring a vote of the committee.  </P> <P> "We have never overruled a member," Bane said.  </P> <P> Johnson said Watson, who was paid more than $58,000 a year, still has several  unused vacation days on the books and her firing will not become effective  until those days have run out.  </P> <P> Watson's attorney, Clyde M. Blackmon, said his client would not comment to the  press.  </P> <P> Watson pleaded guilty Tuesday to a felony extortion charge for her part in  coercing undercover FBI agents posing as businessmen to pay campaign  contributions and appearance fees, or honorariums, to two ranking GOP  lawmakers.  </P> <P> She also agreed to cooperate with federal authorities as they continue to  investigate former Assembly Republican Leader Pat Nolan of Glendale and  Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), who was one of Nolan's chief lieutenants  until Nolan resigned his leadership post in November, 1988.  </P> <P> According to federal court documents, Watson was caught up in the FBI sting  operation in 1988 when she told a fellow legislative staffer who was working as  a federal informant that it would take roughly $10,000 to secure her bosses'  support for a bill the informant was promoting.  </P> <P> Later, she helped arrange and attended meetings between undercover agents and  two lawmakers, who are not identified in the court documents.  </P></p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Fund launched to invest in Peru privatisation A new fund to invest in Peru's radical privatisation programme is to be launched next month using a format previously successfully in Chile and Argentina. Midland Bank of the UK, Chase Manhattan of the US and Banco de Credito del Peru are sponsoring the fund, expected to attract up to Dollars 250m in cash and sovereign debt paper from banks and other financial institutions. The International Finance Corporation, the private sector financing arm of the World Bank, is also expected to be an investor. A participation of up to 10 per cent of the fund's value, probably in cash, is awaiting approval by the IFC's board. The Peru Privatisation Fund will be managed by Montagu Mining Finance, mining subsidiary of Midland's merchant banking unit. Although mining will be an important element in the privatisation programme, the fund will also consider investments in oil and gas, electricity generation and distribution, fishing and manufacturing. The fund aims to be operational by early next month when the privatisation of Centromin, the mining, smelting and refining conglomerate, is scheduled to take place. The government has said that the base price for the company would be Dollars 280m in cash, plus at least Dollars 60m in debt paper and a minimum investment of Dollars 240m over three years. Previous debt-for-equity funds - also involving Midland and the IFC - have been successful in both Argentina and Chile. Montagu said the acceptance of debt in part payment for privatised assets should increase investor interest in privatisation, reduce overall debt and pave the way to an overall debt restructuring. It should also, said an IFC official, help in the development of Peru's domestic capital markets. Peru has raised some Dollars 2.5bn in its privatisations so far, Dollars 2bn coming in one unexpectedly large bid in the most recent telecommunications sale. After numerous delays, the process now appears to be going ahead in earnest, although uncertainties remain about how exactly the debt swap mechanism will work.</p>

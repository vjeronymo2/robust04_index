			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Poor conditions drive away investors SENTIMENT in the Eurobond market worsened yesterday as investors were driven away by poor conditions in most government bond markets, writes Tracy Corrigan. Most of the new issues launched were either aimed at groups of investors or were added to outstanding issues. In the first category, The European Coal and Steel Community launched a L500bn five-year deal which was placed with Italian investors, for whom the agency's paper is exempt from withholding tax. Among several fungible deals, the financial arm of General Electric of the US added CDollars 150m of five-year bonds to an existing CDollars 150m deal, via Wood Gundy. The deal was priced to yield 30 basis points above the comparable Canadian government bond, which was not considered particularly generous, even though it offered a 16 basis point yield pick-up over the outstanding deal. Credit Foncier, the French agency, added FFr500m of 10-year bonds to an outstanding FFr3bn deal, via a block-trade by Credit Commercial de France. East Japan Railway Company (JR East) is expected to tap the Euroyen market in April with a Y20bn deal, via Yamaichi International.</p>

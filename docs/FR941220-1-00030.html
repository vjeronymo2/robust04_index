			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are insufficient data to calculate a precise and reliable quantification of the exact dose which will cause diarrhea in a given percentage of the susceptible population. Some sulfate salts are used as laxative agents. Their mechanism of action is known, and there is apparently little interest in the medical community in additional research on the subject. Acclimation to sulfate is assumed due to the fact that people living in regions with high-sulfate drinking water seem to have no adverse effect, whereas newcomers drinking that region's water will initially experience the laxative effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing the MCLG for sulfate, issues were raised concerning the ability of infants to acclimate to sulfate in drinking water. In 1992, EPA convened an expert panel to discuss the sulfate data base (US EPA, 1992). The panel (D.E.C. Cole, Children's Hospital, Halifax, Nova Scotia; M. Cassidy, George Washington University, Washington, DC; and M. Morris, State University of New York, Amherst, NY) concluded that the lack of data on the sulfate content and the osmolarity of the formulas used in the Chien et al. (1968) study prevents it from being a reliable estimate of the level of sulfate that would induce diarrhea in infants. They concluded that: (1) Additional studies on sulfate are desirable, (2) the Chien et al. (1968) study cannot be used quantitatively, (3) the 500 mg/L value for sulfate is conservative for adults, and there are no differences between sulfate levels of 400 and 500 mg/L, (4) the three cases of diarrhea reported in the Chien study may or may not be attributable to sulfate, and (5) acute short-term effects are the appropriate focus for risk assessment and further research. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The panel members recommended additional research with piglets and humans. EPA agreed and initiated studies in collaboration with the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and the North Carolina State University Department of Animal Science. These studies have been completed and are undergoing internal and external peer review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Occurrence and Human Exposure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The available information on the occurrence and human exposure to sulfate was fully described in the July 25, 1990 proposal. Since that time, additional State data have been gathered and used to update the information in Table 8. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Review of data sources for estimating national occurrence levels of sulfate included: The Community Water Supply Study (CWSS) released in 1969; the Rural Water Survey (RWS) from the late 1970s; new State survey data from Utah, North and South Dakota, and Texas: The Federal Reporting Data System (FRDS) and STORET, EPA's computerized water quality data base. In the CWSS, 106 surface water supplies sampled had an apparent detection limit of 1 mg/L. For the ground water supplies the mean of the positive sulfate detections was approximately 43 mg/L (range of 1 to 480 mg/L), and for surface water it was approximately 49 mg/L (range of 2 to 358 mg/L). The Rural Water Survey (RWS) reported a lower frequency of positives and a higher mean of the positive values, but this lower frequency probably reflects the higher detection limit of 15 mg/L. In the RWS, sulfate was reported to be present in 271 of 494 ground water supplies with a mean of about 98 mg/L (range of 10 to 1,000 mg/L) for the positives (some laboratories can achieve accuracy at levels lower than the published detection limit of 15 mg/L). In surface water, it was found in 101 of 154 supplies, with a mean of 53 mg/L (range of 15 to 321 mg/L) for the positives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, sulfate can be formed in the atmosphere, and EPA has reported ambient levels during the period of 1980&hyph;1986 to range from 0.2 to 199.4  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> g/m3. Since the amounts of sulfate that could be transferred from the atmosphere through the pulmonary system to the gastrointestinal tract are minuscule compared to what could be ingested in drinking water, atmospheric levels are not of concern for the purposes of this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No information is available on the occurrence of sulfate in foods, nor are there any estimates on dietary intake. The Agency did not follow its usual practice of determining a relative source contribution (RSC) factor. As with certain other inorganic contaminants (nitrate, fluoride, barium, manganese), calculation of RSC is not appropriate for sulfate because the MCLG is derived directly from human exposure to the contaminant in drinking water. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Previously Proposed MCLG <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In July 1990, EPA proposed two alternative options for the sulfate MCLG based on the available health information. The first option was to set the MCLG at 400 mg/L, based on a Science Advisory Board (SAB) conclusion that sulfate's mode of action is well known and some human data are available indicating that ill effects occur only at concentrations above 600 mg/L (Peterson, 1951). SAB applied a small uncertainty factor of 1.5 to the 600 <!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->  mg/L level to give a recommended MCLG of 400 mg/L. Their recommendation corresponded to the World Health Organization (WHO) sulfate standard of 400 mg/L, which is based on aesthetic considerations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second option was to set the MCLG at 500 mg/L. As a basis for choosing this option, EPA referred to the survey conducted by Peterson (1951) and evaluated by Moore (1952). Combining the questionnaire respondents into discrete groups, Moore indicated that the number of adults reporting laxative effects increased at sulfate concentrations above 500 mg/L. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Health Protection Branch of Health and Welfare/Canada has indicated to EPA (Canadian Guidelines, 1991) that the maximum acceptable concentration of sulfate in water is 500 mg/L, considered an aesthetic objective, since ``at this level sulfate gives an objectionable taste, but is still below the level at which we would expect to see deleterious health effects''. The Agency notes that the Canadian sulfate guideline of 500 mg/L and the lack of health problems reported at that level lends support to the proposed MCLG. Canada does not yet have national drinking water regulations. Their guidelines are offered to the provinces, which may choose to adopt them as provincial regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were 15 separate comments concerning sulfate on the 1990 proposed rule. Several commenters believed that EPA should not regulate sulfate due to a lack of adequate health data, lack of chronic effects and because people acclimate to the laxative effects of sulfate. Eleven commenters stated that if it were necessary to regulate sulfate, that the MCLG should be higher than 500 mg/L (between 600 and 1,000 mg/L). The remaining four commenters stated that 500 mg/L was protective. One commenter stated that the usual approach for deriving the MCLG_an RfD calculation_should be used for sulfate. Another commenter cited a July 17, 1989 letter from the Metals Subcommittee of the Science Advisory Board's Environmental Health Committee to the Administrator stating that the Subcommittee could not support the setting of an acute MCLG, and recommending additional study before regulation. Several commenters urged EPA not to regulate sulfate, stating that a secondary MCL is sufficient. They noted that infants as well as adults acclimate to sulfate, sulfate is present in food, and the WHO guidelines are based on taste considerations and not health effects. Several commenters noted that systems which do not serve the target population, infants in particular, should be excused from complying with the sulfate regulation. Several commenters questioned EPA's cost analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

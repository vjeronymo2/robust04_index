			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Renewal of dialogue raises spirits at Tecs: The new consensus on training IN STARK contrast to just three months ago, chairmen and chief executives of Training and Enterprise Councils were talking last week as if Tecs had a future. In April a confidential memorandum from Tec leaders to Mrs Gillian Shephard, the new employment secretary, claimed that the initiative was in danger of collapse. Last week more than 500 representatives of the employer-led movement, which was set up two years ago with the ambition of revolutionising training, were talking at their annual national conference about a five-year agenda. What, if anything, has changed? Behind closed doors, Mrs Shephard was left in no doubt about the damage that would be inflicted by additional spending cuts - as suggested in her speech to conference. For a start, Mrs Shephard, a woman with considerable inter-personal skills, raised Tecs' expectations that she would bring a new momentum to training, and she received an enthusiastic welcome at the conference. Prior to the general election, Tecs had been demoralised by a brutal round of spending negotiations, preceded by 18 months of government inertia on training issues. The conference revealed the new thinking on both sides since the election. Mr Nigel Chilcott, head of the small secretariat which services the Tecs, said after the conference: 'We are drawing up an agenda of what Tecs believe they want from government and it, in turn, is making explicit what it wants from Tecs.' The government offered a mixed bag of policies, a few of which could make Tecs' financial situation sounder. Mrs Shephard hinted at possible financial sweeteners - she would try to persuade Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, to accept that Tecs needed three-year funding commitments on the lines of National Health Service hospital trusts. This would help them and their providers of training to plan more effectively. She also said she wanted more result-based payment to Tecs. These are both strong ambitions of Tecs, but are likely to be resisted by the Treasury which prefers finite funding over a single year. Although Mrs Shephard is a junior cabinet member, she has experience of the Treasury and is a personal friend of the prime minister. The secretary of state invited Tecs to join two working parties on help for unemployed adults and education and training for young people. While this gesture of partnership was warmly received by Tecs, they will have to make contributions quickly. The Department of Employment has been reviewing both areas and the Treasury has intervened considerably in the debate. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced that he wanted Tecs to contract with his department and to be the lead strategic body in the creation of 'first-stop shops'. These will group the different agencies providing advice to business, including chambers of commerce. He hinted that the DTI might place some of its small business initiatives with the shops if they were successful. Although Tecs are pleased with the new relationship with the DTI, they understand that they will have to work quickly to bring sparring parties to one table. Mr Heseltine admires Continental-style chambers of commerce, and could ask chambers to be the lead bodies if Tecs are slow. While the government lobbed a couple of balls into the Tecs' court, they showed they were becoming more effective at returning them. The government was asked, for example, to give a lead on Investors in People (IIP), the scheme to improve training of people in work, by introducing it into all government departments. Tecs have been starved of resources to promote the scheme, and at the conference they decided to sponsor research into how different time-limited incentives - such as levies, tax and national insurance options - could stimulate the take-up of IIP. Such a study could be a powerful tool in their fight to get the scheme more widely accepted. Representatives also showed growing sophistication in discussing what they wanted in training programmes and the relative cost-effectiveness of different programmes. In the lively debate over Employment Training, the training scheme for long-term unemployed, Tec directors said the argument with the government should not be over who was trained, but over training quality. But if there was a new mood of consensus, there was also a strong demonstration of the division which might hinder the development of the Tec movement, whose 82 members are fiercely independent. The argument was over whether they should press for a new intermediary body between them and the government - which advocates believe would give Tecs more political clout and greater freedom from government interference. The debate ended in disarray, although members agreed to consult on the issue. The conference may have illustrated that Tecs were putting more forcefully their own agenda to the government. But they need a more effective national umbrella body. As one observer noted: 'This is the first time Tecs have publicly confronted the fact that there are major divisions. The next stage in the maturing process will be for Tecs to realise on this issue it might have to come to a vote.'</p>

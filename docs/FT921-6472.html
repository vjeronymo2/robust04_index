			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Paternoster developers baffled by Heseltine's 'new initiative': The latest twist to one of London's longest and most sensitive planning controversies ANOTHER CHAPTER has been opened in one of London's longest and most sensitive planning controversies. Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, took planners and developers by surprise on Tuesday when he announced a 'new initiative' for the square beside St Paul's Cathedral. He described the square as 'one of the nation's most important sites'. It is the latest twist in an argument that has raged for more than five years about what should replace the bleak, windswept 1950s office blocks. A modernist design for the square was proposed in 1987 but was shelved after the Prince of Wales described the competition that produced it as 'deeply depressing' and 'demoralising'. Mr Heseltine has called in planning applications by Paternoster Associates, the consortium developing Paternoster Square, and Nuclear Electric, which is developing the adjacent Sudbury House. This suggests that the future of the square will be the subject of a public inquiry at the end of the summer. He has also called for a master plan covering the area north of St Paul's to guide development. Mr Heseltine's announcement hinted at his dissatisfaction with the proposed neo-classical design. The plans for 630,000 sq ft of office space and more than 80 shops and restaurants attempt to restore the pattern of streets and lanes that existed before the area was destroyed in the blitz. He warned that the applications would be judged 'against the high standards I consider to be appropriate for this site and the need for the area to be developed coherently'. His decision to intervene in the planning process baffled the developers and the Corporation of London, the local authority for the City. All believed that negotiations over planning permission were close to agreement. One observer said: 'Why should a government facing an election want to take on a battle that is already resolved?' The corporation barely concealed its annoyance. Mr Tom Jackson, chairman of the planning and communications committee, hoped that 'this already lengthy process will not be unduly prolonged by the decision to call in these applications, nor by an enforced return to an empty drawing board'. The request for a master plan was also greeted without enthusiasm by the corporation, which believes that agreement is more likely to be reached if developers take the initiative. Speculation about the reasons behind Mr Heseltine's decision included that he mistakenly believed negotiations over planning permission had become bogged down after the corporation lodged 22 objections to the plan in December. His decision to ask for a master plan could be interpreted as an attempt to find a consensus, said one of those involved in the development. A more common view is that Mr Heseltine wishes to see a more ambitious, modernist scheme on the site. His decision to intervene in the planning process, which followed an informal visit to the site a week ago, was described by the Department of the Environment as 'genuinely personal'. The suggestion that his decision was a matter of architectural taste is controversial. 'No one, whether an official or an elected representative has a right to impose their taste on the planning process,' said a planning expert. If Mr Heseltine has taken a dislike to the proposed scheme, he is not alone. Its neo-classical style was panned by many critics who disliked the bulk of the buildings and their design, which they said was reminiscent of dolls' houses. But the plans were warmly received by the public. Gallup, the research company, reported 'an exceptionally positive response among the public to the proposed scheme'. Support for the proposals and the progress made by the developers in meeting the objections of the City planners raise the possibility of a public inquiry finding in favour of the proposals. But it is possible that the developers will withdraw their plans in the hope of a change of leadership at the Department of the Environment after the election. The uncertainties surrounding the site are exacerbated by the depressed state of the property market. The market has turned down sharply since November 1989 when Paternoster Associates, a partnership between Greycoat, a UK developer, Park Tower Group of New York and an affiliate of Mitsubishi Estate Company of Japan, paid Pounds 160m for the site. Until the market recovers, the scheme is not viable. Greycoat has already written off its stake in the project. It is hard to rule out the possibility that Mitsubishi Estates, the main financial backer, could pull out. The unloved concrete slabs on the site could yet receive a new lease of life.</p>

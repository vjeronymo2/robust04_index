			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / MoD advertises for merchant bank help on homes sell-off The Ministry of Defence has advertised for a merchant bank to help overcome problems dogging its scheme to transfer servicemen's quarters to the private sector. The MoD faces a Pounds 500m gap in its 1995-96 budget unless the 68,000 homes can be transferred to a non-profit housing trust next year. The advertisement, which appears in the Official Journal of the European Communities, admits for the first time that the scheme has fallen behind schedule. Only a week is given for submission of applications to be on the tender list, an abnormally short deadline under European Union public procurement rules. The advertisement says: 'Urgency, consequential upon a change in project direction, has rendered impractical the standard timescale.' Yesterday the MoD said that, while the scheme had 'hit some snags', it expected to achieve the objectives of raising cash from the transfer and improving the quarters within the original timescale. Under the scheme the married quarters were to have been transferred to a trust under 30-year leases. The trust would be independent of the MoD, but would contract to provide it with accommodation and improve its quality. Capital for the deal would be raised in the City secured against future rent. Although potential investors have expressed interest in the scheme, there have been concerns about details. These include worries about the location of many of the homes away from towns and in secure areas, which would make it hard to sell or rent them if they were not needed by the armed forces. The Treasury has objected to the scheme as little more than creative accounting. It wants the trust to be more independent of the MoD and to own the homes outright, borrowing against the security of the property in the same way as other housing associations. The advertisement says that the MoD is considering a trade sale as well as a long lease.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Campaigners go to work on smoking: Legal action will lead to more bans FOR Midland Bank's 45,000 UK employees, a smoke-free working environment has been a fact of life since May last year. The bank, like an estimated 20 per cent of employers, forbids staff and public to smoke on its premises. The case of Ms Veronica Bland, awarded Pounds 15,000 in an out-of-court settlement for the alleged ill-effects of passive smoking, illustrates why Midland and many other organisations no longer wish to risk exposing workers to cigarette smoke. Indeed, Ms Bland's employer, Stockport Borough Council, has itself introduced a no-smoking policy - implemented, it pointed out yesterday, six months before she started her legal action. Other organisations which ban smoking include Marks and Spencer, IBM and the Inland Revenue. The move in the UK away from smoking in public places and at work is in line with developments elsewhere in Europe, and in the US and Australia. The latter, in particular, presents close parallels with developments in the UK, says the pressure group Action on Smoking and Health (Ash). The case in 1989 of Mr Sean Carroll, a Melbourne bus driver, produced an overnight change in employers' attitudes, according to Ash. Before he died of cancer Mr Carroll won a Pounds 32,000 out-of-court settlement for the alleged effects of passive smoking. Almost immediately, states began to legislate against smoking in public places and at work. Even in France, where Gauloises are practically a national emblem, smoking has been severely restricted in public places and open-plan offices. In the US federal regulations are imminent which will force companies with more than 10 workers to ban smoking. The move follows the Environmental Protection Agency's classification of the smoke breathed out by smokers as a significant carcinogen to those around them. The agency attributes about 3,000 lung-cancer deaths a year to passive smoking. UK experts take a slightly lower-key approach. In 1988 a government advisory body, the Independent Scientific Committee on Smoking and Health, reviewed all the evidence and concluded that passive smoking caused a small increase in the risk of lung cancer. Even so, it added, several hundred lung cancer deaths a year in the UK might be attributable to passive smoking. How much compulsion UK companies should face remains an open question. The Confederation of British Industry is adamant that individual employers should be left to assess the risk of passive smoking. The same line has, until now, been taken by the government, but this may change. Dr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, has warned recently that the government would not rule out legislation if voluntary bans failed to work. Back at Midland Bank, the need for flexibility and compassion towards addicts is recognised. 'If a customer has a problem with his business and comes in to see the manager, he might feel he needs a cigarette,' the bank said. 'You have to have some element of common sense about whether you would stop him.'</p>

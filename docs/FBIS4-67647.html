			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  disease reports monitored from FBIS Abidjan Bureau and EAU  coverage areas. Source information is given in parentheses after  each item.  <H5>  Nigeria </H5>   Iodine-deficiency disorders -- The Edo State commissioner  for  health has said that the (Akoko Edo), (Etsako East), (Etsako  West), and Owan East local government areas in the state are  severely affected by iodine-deficiency disorders, especially  goiter. A campaign has been launched to control and eradicate  the disease. [Lagos NTA Television Network in English 2000 GMT  6 Apr 94]    Measles/cholera -- Fifty-three children have died from an  outbreak of measles and cholera in a village in southeast  Nigeria where local officials feared the death toll could rise,  the official NAN news agency said. The report released 13 April  did not say when the diseases broke out, but said most of the  victims were refugees from the disputed Bakassi Peninsula on the  border with Cameroon.    The report quoted an official for the area, in Nigeria's  Akwa  Ibom state, who said emergency medical help was needed to keep  the death toll from rising.    Last week, 25 children were reported to have died from  measles in Uquo Ibeno village near the Bakassi peninsula, NAN  said. Refugees who fled the disputed zone, a 1,000  square-kilometer (400 square- mile) area rich in fish and oil,  are camped in villages in nearby Akwa Ibom and Cross River  states.    Nigeria and Cameroon have vowed to find a diplomatic  solution  to the dispute, which broke out early this year, but both have  sent troops to the zone. (Paris AFP in English 1657 GMT 14 Apr  94)  <H5>  Burkina Faso </H5>   Measles/cerebro-spinal meningitis -- The director of public  health has disclosed that this year's incidence of measles was  not as high as last year's. Some isolated cases of  cerebro-spinal meningitis have been reported. According to  statistics there were more cases this year than last year, but  the situation could not be described as an epidemic. In the  case of Yalgado Ouedraogo Hospital -- where there have been  rumors of a new, deadly form of meningitis -- from 1 January to  31 March 1993, 70 cases were recorded, with 27 deaths reported  for all forms of meningitis. This year, for the same period, 97  cases were recorded, with 31 deaths. Although the number of  cases this year is higher than that of last year, it should be  noted that all these cases do not come from one locality.  [Ouagadougou Radiodiffusion Nationale du Burkina Radio in French  1300 GMT 21 Apr 94]  <H5>  Ghana </H5>   Malaria -- Malaria is still the No. 1 killer disease in  Ghana. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality,  especially among children below the age of five, and accounts  for nearly 30 percent of all clinic attendance in the country.  Malaria, related to development and economic activities, is  even more rapidly becoming a major problem. As a way of  controlling the vector and the disease, the Ministry of Health  in 1992 worked out a plan of action for the control of malaria.  The director of technical coordination, Dr. Kofi Ahmed, said  that the action plan, which is now being implemented, has a  long-term objective of reducing the incidence of malaria to  tackle levels that will make it cease to be a public health  hazard. He said a series of workshops has been set up to train  health workers to accurately diagnose what malaria is and the  correct treatment for the disease. Dr. Ahmed said apart from  medical care, which will be the major strategy, vector control,  house education, and revision of health legislation are some of  the strategies that would be pursued. [Accra Ghana Broadcasting  Corporation Radio Network in English 1300 GMT 19 Apr 94]    Measles/cholera -- The regional director of medical services  in the Upper East Region has told the GRAPHIC that there is an  outbreak of measles affecting children between the ages of five,  six, and seven in the region. The TIMES also reports that  cholera has claimed the lives of 16 people in Sefwi Akotombra.  [Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in English  1300 GMT 22 Apr 94]  <H5>  Niger </H5>   Measles/malnutrition -- A high incidence of measles and  malnutrition has been reported in Dosso recently. This year,  the district almost experienced a measles epidemic, with close  to 75 cases a week per health center. Most of the cases involved  children who had not been vaccinated. Fortunately, with the  arrival of the first rains, there has been a decline in the  disease. Around 25 to 30 cases of malnutrition were recorded in  the first quarter of this year. [Niamey Voix du Sahel Network in  French 1200 GMT 22 Apr 94]  <H5>  SAO-TOME AND PRINCIPE </H5>   AIDS -- It was reported today that Sao-Tome authorities  estimate that at least 1,200 people carry the AIDS virus in  Sao-Tome and Principe. This estimation is, however, very likely  below the actual figure, since the government so far has not had  any means to control the spread of the epidemic, a medical  source also stated.    Thirteen cases of the disease were recorded in the  archipelago for a total population of about 120,000 inhabitants,  according to the conclusions of a seminar organized during the  visit of some Portuguese student nurses. A national AIDS  control program has been launched in Sao-Tome thanks to external  financing, mainly from the WHO and Western countries.  Furthermore, an epidemiologic investigation is under way on a  part of the archipelago to know this disease in Sao-Tome. [Paris  AFP in French 1727 GMT 20 Apr 94]</p>

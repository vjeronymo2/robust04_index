			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The preparatory  committee for the formation of the South side headquarters of  the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification released a  statement on April 15 denouncing the South Korean trip of the  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry.    Noting that the United States is the very one responsible  for  the division of the Korean nation and is still blocking its  independent and peaceful reunification, the statement says:    "We cannot overlook the fact that the U.S. defense  secretary,  William Perry, threatened the lives of our 70 million fellow  countrymen with the bellicose remarks that the U.S. would not  rule out a war on the Korean peninsula.    "We are convinced that the South Korean trip of Perry who is  the most stubborn hard-liner in executing the U.S. policy of  increasing the tensions on the Korean peninsula and perpetuating  national division will not be helpful at all to peace on the  Korean peninsula and its independent and peaceful reunification,  the cherished desire of our fellow countrymen. On the contrary,  it will heighten tensions and further wreck reconciliation and  unity of our nation.    "Therefore, we resolutely oppose Perry's jackboots treading  on this land where our fellow countrymen desirous of independent  and peaceful reunification live.    "We denounce the threat of war provocation by outside forces  and declare to the world that we will fight against it."</p>

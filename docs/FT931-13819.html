			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Construction hits Lyonnais earnings LYONNAISE des Eaux Dumez, the French water and building group, yesterday announced that 1992 profits would be between FFr350m (Dollars 64.2m) and FFr400m, less than one-third of what it had forecast. Lyonnaise's sudden profit revision, entirely due to large losses and provisions on property and construction in France and abroad, led to a wave of selling in its shares which were suspended 5.5 per cent down at FFr435.5 on the Paris bourse yesterday. By taking large losses and provisions and 'purging our 1992 balance sheet, we are perhaps being excessively prudent,' a company spokesman said. 'But we are very pessimistic about real estate prospects.' By contrast, the water and environmental services of the old Lyonnaise des Eaux which merged with the Dumez group in 1990 produced a profit, as did the group's other interests. Lyonnaise said it planned to maintain its Fr10-a-share dividend because the 'particularly heavy' charges for last year did not affect the group's fundamental financial soundness. Lyonnaise said it had had to make extra provisions of FFr1bn for real estate problems and FFr500m for construction difficulties. In addition to problems in France leading Dumez to lay off some 500 people at a cost of FFr400m, the group was experiencing troubles abroad. One area of difficulty was in Spain, where its Copisa subsidiary had seen business collapse after completion of the Barcelona Olympic facilities. Losses and provisions were FFr250m. Another FFr275m in provisions had been made to cope with the downturn in Saudi Arabia, particularly after the Gulf war. Lyonnaise had set aside FFr100m because the political and security situation in Kashmir was delaying completion of a dam there. Last June, Mr Jerome Monod, chairman, had forecast a 20 per cent rise in 1992 group profits which had fallen to FFr1.17bn from FFr1.4bn the year before. The company said yesterday it had had to revise its forecast because the last few weeks of 1992 had proved far worse than expected in property and it saw no improvement for most of 1993.

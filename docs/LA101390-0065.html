			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THIS READER DISAGREES WITH ASSESSMENT OF SEAU  </P> <P> Regarding Robert W. Rae's slanderous remarks about Junior Seau (Oct. 6): I  talked with Junior when he was in our restaurant just last week.  </P> <P> He is the nicest, most courteous man I have ever met. Even though he was having  dinner, he took the time to talk with everyone who wanted to talk to him. He  was quiet, sincere and a pleasure to be around. If Junior is "the biggest jerk"  or "idiot loudmouth," I'm Saddam Hussein!  </P> <P> As far as his linebacking skills, an oak tree does not grow in a day. Give him  time. He will be a great one.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER B. PIPER  </P> <P> Oceanside  </P></p>

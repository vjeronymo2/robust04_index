COURRIER DE LA CONFERANCE DE LA PAIX published in Hague, the  Netherlands, quoted the Korean envoy, Yi Wi-chong, who went to  the Second World Peace Conference as saying that the socalled  "Ulsa Five-Point Treaty" in 1905 was nothing but an accord  signed by the then foreign minister without the approval of the  Korean emperor, that the signed document had not been ratified  and that the "treaty" had not taken effect.    Egyptian GAZETTE said that with the discovery of a personal  letter of Korean Emperor Kojong in 1906 as regards the  illegality and invalidity of this "treaty", it has been proved  that the colonial rule of Japan over Korea had no legal ground.  The paper noted: Kojong said he as the emperor did not  authorize the ministers to sign the "treaty" and the Japanese  side faked up the "treaty" after locking up ministers. He  declared that "it is against public law to claim that the  `treaty' was concluded and so it is null and void."    The Mozambican Magazine TEMPO said the "Ulsa Five-Point  Treaty" was faked up by Japan to colonialize Korea by  "legalizing" its occupation of Korea and forging Korean history.    The Shihata News Agency of Tanzania said the personal letter  of Emperor Kojong showed the absurdity of the argument of the  Japanese Government for the "lawfulness" of the past "treaty".    Radio of Mongolia elaborated on the illegality and  invalidity  of the "Ulsa Five-Point Treaty" and said the Japanese  authorities must repent of the crimes against the Korean people  and honestly liquidate the past.</p>

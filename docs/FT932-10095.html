			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Stronger US-UK links Corporate links between London and New York are not limited to the multinationals. Next month sees the launch of a partnership between Wandsworth Enterprise Agency and the National Minority Business Council, based in New York. The aim of the venture is to provide small UK businesses run by members of the ethnic minorities with help and advice in establishing international trading links. Similarly, the 500-or-so members of the NMBC, most of whom are based in New York, New Jersey or Connecticut, will gain access to British expertise. Small businesses often lack the resources to establish overseas links but the joint venture between Wandsworth and NMBC will provide help with training and organising trade missions, said Alex Amponsah, chief executive of the enterprise agency. It may also open trading links with home countries of recent immigrants. The NMBC, a non-profit organisation, was established more than 20 years ago and is funded mainly from membership fees, currently Dollars 275 (Pounds 179) a year, although it does receive public- and private-sector donations and grants. Its members - who include Afro-Caribbeans, Latin Americans, Asians and Eskimos - are provided with a broad range of business advice. John Robinson, president of the NMBC, hopes that the London link will lead eventually to an umbrella organisation for all UK small businesses run by ethnic minorities, on an equal footing with chambers of commerce. He already has plans for further expansion, seeking ties with similar organisations in Asia and the Pacific Rim. The NMBC has strong ties with the Caribbean and has an affiliation in Nigeria. *National Minority Business Council, 235 East 42nd Street, New York 10017. Tel. 212 573 2385.

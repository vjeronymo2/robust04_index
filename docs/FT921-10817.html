			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Arts: Henry Threadgill's Very Very Circus - Queen Elizabeth Hall The Circus was bound to be a challenging evening's entertainment with a line-up like this. It turned out to be a challenge which much of the audience was not willing to meet. They could have guessed it would not be easy. American altoist Henry Threadgill has always been an experimentalist, writing for 55 piece marching bands or a line-up of four woodwind, four strings and voice, for example. A septet consisting of a french horn, two electric guitars, two tubas and drums as well as his own raw alto is almost conventional by Threadgill's terms. Nor should anyone have expected the Very Very Circus to swing. Threadgill likes his music to have a morbid atmosphere and will often purposely collapse his pieces into a jazz dirge. The Circus started cheerfully enough, Gene Lake's drums beat a busy rhythm to the trump, trump of the tubas. The guitars of Masujaa and Brandon Ross provided angular and distorted background and the french horn of Markus Taylor took a kind of detached classical tour. As the march continued, the guitars made an interesting diversion into Western themes and Harry Lime zither effects. The urge to dirge soon took over, however, leavened only by the comic bounce of the tubas, Threadgill set a flat and eerie soundscape for himself to solo against, guitars clanking occasionally to either side of him. Perhaps in reaction to his audience's response (heading for the bar), Threadgill next whipped up the guitars and indefatigable tubas to a tune more suited to a lively wake, the dignified horn keeping the lid on things. But it was when Brandon Ross managed to disentangle himself from the others for some grey and grotesque distortion that attention, and members of the audience, began to wander. The surge in energy created by the eventual return of quickstep tubas and drums came too late. The first part of the Rolling Rock-sponsored, Contemporary Music Network show was shades lighter but complementary. London vibraphonist Orphy Robinson, whose group has a debut album on the racks this week, When Tomorrow Comes (Blue Note 7985812), also keeps unusual company. In The Annavas Project his vibes and reverberating marimba are augmented by Tunde Jegede's kora and cello, and Rowland Sutherland's flutes (down to the piccolo), as well as co-writer Joe Bashorun's keyboards and Dudley Phillip's bass. Winston Clifford on drums completes the line-up. As a preview to a promising new recording the poor quality of sound early on was a distraction - especially as the music relies heavily on a crisp back beat with dancing, repeating melodies from Robinson and Sutherland.</p>

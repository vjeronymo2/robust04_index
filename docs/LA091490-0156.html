			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> LOW-VOLTAGE OUTING FOR NEW KIDS;  </P> <P> THE GROUP FAILS TO HARNESS THE YOUNG CROWD'S ENERGY, INSTEAD DELIVERING AN  UNFOCUSED PERFORMANCE THAT WASTED CONSIDERABLE TIME ON DISORGANIZED PATTER AND  ANTICS.  </P> <P> New Kids on the Block operated like a true American industry Wednesday night at  the Pacific Amphitheatre: The kid-pop phenomenon from Boston made plenty of  money, but it wasted a great deal of energy.  </P> <P> A considerable resource was on hand waiting to be harnessed -- a sold-out house  of nearly 19,000 fans, the vast majority of them deeply infatuated young girls  just tingling with energy.  </P> <P> New Kids, the object of one of the most pervasive outbreaks of puppy love in  pop history, didn't have the foggiest notion how to focus that abundance of  adoration and make it explode. Oh, the girls screamed like little Beatlemaniacs  the whole time (Southland sales of candy-flavored cough drops and throat  lozenges should be humming this week, what with New Kids' two sold-out Pacific  shows and a big outing at Dodger Stadium tonight). But this was a crowd primed  to scream at almost anything -- when stage hands made some pre-show adjustments  to a tarpaulin covering the set, that alone caused an uproar.  </P> <P> Instead of concentrating and multiplying their fans' hysteria, the five New  Kids gradually drained it during a plodding two-hour show that wasted  considerable time on disorganized patter and antics. The New Kids have been  accused of being just cogs in a well-oiled machine wound up by Maurice Starr,  the entrepreneur who put the group together and has written and produced  virtually all of its music. Maybe the New Kids, who range in age from 17 to 21,  figured that a tightly organized, quick-paced performance would confirm that  they are just pale markings on their producer's blueprint for a white Jackson  5.  </P> <P> So they decided that the way to establish some personality of their own was to  hang loose, investing the show with a playground feeling that involved lots of  yakking and hollering, not to mention interminable stretching of songs.  </P> <P> The chief slacker was stubble-faced Donnie Wahlberg, who carved out an  oh-so-calculated bad-boy persona. Wahlberg played the kid with the worst  attitude in class, the one who always got the girls tittering with his  deliberately obnoxious antics. But he went overboard and managed to make  himself truly obnoxious. At one point Wahlberg picked up a stuffed toy tossed  his way as a gift offering and heaved it back into the audience with this  peeved admonition: "You oughta stop throwing things." Maybe the fans and their  parents ought to stop throwing away money on New Kids paraphernalia bearing  this lout's likeness.  </P> <P> New Kids launched most of its best ammunition at the start, with fire-pots  flashing, lasers glowing, and all five members engaging in some energetic  hoofing. But after a brisk opening 15 minutes or so, the time-killing began  with a long, laborious introduction of the group's five-piece backing band.  After that came an extended series of solo and duo turns by all the New Kids  except oldest member Jonathan Knight, a serious candidate for the Andrew  Ridgeley Award for superfluous presence in a pop act. The show offered only a  handful of flashy, tightly crafted ensemble song-and-dance numbers.  </P> <P> If there's any real promise cocooned in New Kids, it lies with Jordan Knight,  the 20-year-old singer who carried most of the show's musical load. Knight, the  handsomest and by far the most talented New Kid, turned in a solid performance  that showcased a generally assured falsetto, some limber dance moves and an  appealing, earnest personality.  </P> <P> Knight had a few rocky moments vocally, but he shone in comparison to what  </P> <P> surrounded him. Danny Wood was gratingly off-key most of the time. Wahlberg was  somewhat better than that, but his pitch was iffy too, and his grainy voice was  only slightly less unpleasant than his manner. Wahlberg and Wood were in charge  of giving New Kids' a rap dimension -- a shrewd division of labor, considering  their singing abilities.  </P> <P> Curly-mopped Joe McIntyre, the youngest and cutest New Kid, apparently is too  ancient and husky-voiced now to pull off the imitations of a pre-pubescent  Michael Jackson that have fallen to him on record; in concert, most of his  numbers were strung together in a solo medley, suggesting that full versions  would have taxed his ability.  </P> <P> Judging from this show, accusations of lip-syncing leveled against the New Kids  have been exaggerated -- or perhaps those accusations have caused the group to  become more honest. As the abundant flaws made clear, this singing was live,  except for some incidental (though still unacceptable) use of taped backing  vocals during the more fevered dance numbers.  </P> <P> Before anyone starts congratulating New Kids for their probity, though, it  should be noted that the show was preceded by a video-screened fast-food  commercial, courtesy of the New Kids' tour sponsor. Remember just a few years  back, when the mere appearance of a corporate logo on a banner was considered a  sellout? If the public doesn't express a distaste for commercials in concert  venues, we're sure to see more of them.  </P> <P> An alertness to such marketing opportunities -- which are vastly greater today  than they were for the Monkees, the Partridge Family and other teen idols of  the past -- has turned New Kids into a cash cow generating hundreds of millions  of dollars. It could be that increased parental guilt in a two-earner economy  has something to do with the band's income explosion as well.  </P> <P> But no amount of money can turn the New Kids' sweet-nothing songs into  something. Puppy love -- whether lost, found or sought -- was the group's main  subject, expressed in a way that lacked any shading of complexity or emotional  depth. The only departures were "Hangin' Tough" and "Games," which appropriated  the familiar us-versus-them theme of heavy metal, "us" being the New Kids and  their fans, "them" being all those who question the group's ability and staying  power. The show also included a treacly ballad, "This One's for the Children,"  that paid lip service to caring -- presumably for the less fortunate -- without  bringing up any unpleasant particulars.  </P> <P> Starr's savvy for clean, catchy musical settings patterned after successful  models (the Beatles on "Tonight," for example, and Stevie Wonder's sugary side  on "Funny Feeling") may allow New Kids to keep reeling in fans and raking in  dollars for a while. Of course, there's something to be said for getting  pre-adolescent audiences interested in music -- any kind of music. But lacking  songs with expressive peaks, songs that speak for the singers themselves, it's  hard to imagine New Kids on the Block ever being able to hit any peaks in live  performance. It's also hard to imaging them mattering in five or 10 years to  the masses of kids who scream for them now.  </P></p>

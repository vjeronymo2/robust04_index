			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Noble Traits of Korean People Sharing </F> Same Destiny With the Party" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- In Korea today the  leader and the people form an integrated whole, and the Korean  revolution is advancing triumphantly under whatever storm and  stress because the entire people uphold the party and the leader  with loyalty and share the same destiny with the party, says  NODONG SINMUN today.    The daily comes out with a by-lined article entitled  "Sharing  the Same Destiny With the Party Is Noble Traits of Our People"  on the lapse of 30 years since the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il assumed leadership over the party affairs.    It quotes Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying:    "The dignified life and honour of a revolutionary lie in  sharing the same destiny with the party and dying at his post of  duty while fighting it out for the sake of the revolution."    Noting that the imperialists have left no stone unturned in  a  bid to isolate and stifle the Korean-style socialism, the life  and soul of the Korean people, the article says:    Under such circumstances our people repose unquestioned  trust  in Comrade Kim Chong-il and are defending him and firmly  resolved to fight with fortitude along the road indicated by the  party, entrusting their destinies to the party and the leader,  no matter what the others say.    The noble ideological and spiritual world of the Korean  people determined to share the same destiny with the party finds  clear manifestation in the fact that they firmly believe in and  follow their illustrious leader as the defender of their  destinies, as their mental support and are vigorously struggling  with an unshakable determination to defend him politically and  ideologically and with their lives.    In Korea today all the people firmly believe in and follow  Comrade Kim Chong-il as the defender of their destinies.    It is because the unshakable will to firmly believe in and  follow our general had settled in their hearts that corporal Kim  Chol-chin and Private 1st Class Kim Kyong-chol of the Korean  People's Security Forces could fight in defence of their honour  as revolutionary soldiers under the difficult circumstances in  which they happened to be drifted overboard to the  enemy-controlled area.    The Korean people's unquestioned worship of the dear leader  is so strong and invariable as they cherish through their life  experience the greatness of his ideas, leadership ability and  personality.    A countless number of revolutionary soldiers becoming a fort  and shield to firmly defend Comrade Kim Chong-il in any storm  and stress and unhesitatingly laying down even their youth and  lives on this road have been witnessed among the Korean people.  Among them are revolutionary soldiers who plunged themselves  without hesitation into a raging fire to carry away portraits of  their leaders to a safe place, and heroic soldiers who laid down  their precious youthful lives by covering handgrenades on the  point of explosion with their bodies.    The noble ideological and spiritual world of the Korean  people determined to share the same destiny with the party also  is clearly expressed in that they are doing their utmost to  repay the deep benevolence of their leader who has brought their  own destinies into full bloom.    Noble traits are being displayed highly among our people;  they volunteer into grand socialist construction sites, coal and  ore mines and rural villages in groups, not seeking any fame or  reward, in order to carry the intentions and plans of the party  into effect; they faithfully perform their duties at their posts  till the last moments of their lives.    This clearly shows the noble spiritual world of the Korean  people determined to silently devote their whole lives to the  struggle for implementing the ideas and policies of their leader  with one mind.</p>

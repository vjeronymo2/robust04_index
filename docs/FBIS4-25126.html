			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special commentary" by Fang Ming (2455 2494): "NATO and </F> Russia"]    [Text] While attending the meeting of defense ministers of  the North Atlantic Cooperation Council in Brussels on 24-25 May,  Russian Defense Minister Grachev stated that Russia would  "unconditionally" sign the "partnership for peace plan," but he  stressed that Russia must first establish a bilateral security  mechanism with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  NATO was not willing to compromise and so the two sides laid  aside the issue of signing the "plan" once more.    NATO's "partnership for peace plan" was put forward in  January this year. To date, 18 East European countries,  countries separated from the former Soviet Union, and neutral  countries of Europe have signed the "plan" with NATO and five of  the partners have submitted "memoranda of cooperation" to NATO.  The "Partnership for Peace Plan Coordination Group" formed by  military officers of the partnership states was set up at NATO's  Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe on 18 April, the  liaison group will start work at NATO headquarters on 3 June,  and the partnership states will carry out joint military  exercises in the next few months. The implementation of the  "partnership for peace plan" will undoubtedly strengthen NATO's  position and role in modeling a new pattern for the future  security of Europe.    However, the plan has also met many problems: a crisis of  confidence in the "plan" among East European countries;  different views among NATO member states, difficulties in  raising the large amount of funds needed for the implementation  of the plan, and so on. However, the greatest difficulty is how  Russia should join the "partnership for peace."    Since the beginning of this year, many negotiations on  Russia  joining the "plan" have been held within NATO and between NATO  and Russia. Russia has changed its position on several  occasions and this has greatly troubled NATO. The two sides  have reached an impasse on the issue of a "special  relationship." In the beginning, Russia adopted an attitude of  opposing the "plan" and later expressed on 21 April its  willingness to sign the "plan" with NATO under the condition  that NATO should give Russia the "status of a special  partnership state." Because NATO did not agree to meet Russia's  demand and other factors, Russia did not sign as scheduled. In  addition, Russia also formulated a "document on cooperation  projects" which it intended to sign with NATO. The document  demands that NATO should inform Russia about bilateral  activities with other partnership states and that should NATO  take any action which involves the security and interests of  Russia or other members of the CIS, it first obtains the  agreement of Russia, and Russia may carry out joint exercises  with NATO within the scope of peace-keeping and other  humanitarian activities, but will not cooperate with NATO in the  formulation of military strategies, defense budgets, the  modernization and standardization of weapons, training of  military officers, and so on. On 6 May, Grachev announced in  Moscow that Russia had drafted new ideas on the "partnership for  peace" concerning the security of Europe which would enable  Russia to "play its role in the establishment of a collective  security structure in Europe."    It appears that the main considerations which have caused  Russia to change its attitude of opposing the "plan" to joining  it on certain conditions are as follows: The first is to avoid  being isolated and to maintain a distance in relations between  NATO and the countries of central and Eastern Europe. The  second is to try to establish a special relationship with NATO,  to jointly manage the countries of central and Eastern Europe  with NATO, and to gradually turn NATO's plan into Russia's  strategic idea of a "pan-European partnership relationship" so  that Russia can play a greater role in any European security  system in the future. The third is to alleviate differences and  contradictions on this issue within Russia.    At present, NATO can be said to be in a dilemma. On the one  hand, NATO knows full well that it is impossible to stabilize  security in Europe without Russia, and it therefore hopes Russia  will join the "plan." This would make use of Russia's strength  and influence and could also transform and restrain Russia. On  the other hand, NATO does not want to give a special position to  Russia. Otherwise, other partnership states will be disappointed  and dissatisfied. At the same time, NATO wants to prevent  Russia from making use of such a special relationship to take an  equal footing and to change the original objective of the  "plan." At present, people at NATO's highest level are stepping  up negotiations with various sides and are striving to reach  special cooperation with Russia while not openly recognizing  Russia's special position. Since neither NATO nor Russia wants  to return to a state of hostility, they may eventually sign the  "plan" on the basis of compromise, but this does not mean  differences between the two sides will be removed. Cooperating  with each other while struggling against each other will be a  major characteristics of the "partnership for peace" between  NATO and Russia. As for how things develop, the "plan" may be  like the Conference on Security and Cooperation of Europe or the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council and could become merely  nominal. At the least, the original idea of the United States  and the NATO states will be changed.</p>

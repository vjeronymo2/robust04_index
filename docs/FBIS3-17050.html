He said the delegation appointed was not going to sign any  agreements, but would make the first steps toward closer  economic cooperation with the other former Soviet republic. The  Estonian delegation will be headed by Urve Nou, adviser at the  Foreign Ministry's department for foreign economic policy.    The Cabinet also gave its approval to the bills of  amendments  to the alcohol and tobacco excise tax laws. The draft bills,  together with a proposed amendment to the administrative code,  were submitted to the parliament.    Jurgenson said no changes were made in the alcohol excise  tax  rates. He added that the amendments had been about bringing the  law into conformity with other legislative acts.    The Cabinet on Tuesday ruled to postpone its formal decision  on setting up the country's Agency of Foreign Investment and a  National Business Registry.</p>

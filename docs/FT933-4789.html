			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Costs of acquiring Roulement Service leave Brammer unchanged at Pounds 4.2m BRAMMER, the industrial services group, reported flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.2m in spite of increasing sales by 27 per cent to Pounds 71.2m, against Pounds 56.1m, for the six months to June 30. A strong performance by BSL, the distributor of ballbearings and power transmission products, helped increase group operating profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 5m, compared with Pounds 3.91m. However, the pre-tax figure was affected by the impact of last year's acquisition of Roulement Service, a French distributor of bearings. Net interest costs of Pounds 732,000 compared with interest receivable of Pounds 317,000 last time. Mr Robert Ffoulkes-Jones, chief executive, said BSL had an excellent half year, with sales 4.1 per cent ahead of the same period last year and 9.2 per cent higher than the second half of 1992. Market share and sales per employee were both significantly higher. Roulement had made good progress, increasing market share, but was unable to buck the recession in France. The company managed to make a small operating profit, although sales were 4.3 per cent lower than in the first half year and gross margins were under constant pressure. Mr Ffoulkes-Jones said Roulement had been recently appointed the first nationwide distributor in France for the products of SKF, the Swedish roller-bearer manufacturer which dominated the French market. Brammer planned to make more acquisitions in Europe. The rentals group, which specialises in electronic testing equipment, increased sales by 19 per cent. Livingston Hire of the UK increased profits substantially in generally better market conditions, but smaller companies in France, Germany and the Netherlands all had a difficult six months. Mr Hugh Lang, chairman, said: 'Trading in the UK is currently at the improved levels experienced during the first half of the year but recovery remains fragile. 'In the rest of Europe the recession continues and we need to see an improvement in business confidence, particularly in France which now represents more than 20 per cent of group turnover.' Earnings per share fell to 6.6p, against 6.9p previously, but the interim dividend is being held at 4.5p.</p>

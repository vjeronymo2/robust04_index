			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> SCHOOL BOND ISSUE OKD FOR BALLOT  </P> <P> Moorpark voters will decide in November whether to approve a $25.5-million bond  measure that would be used to build three new schools and renovate several  existing ones.  </P> <P> The Moorpark Unified School District, which decided in a special meeting Monday  to place the measure on the ballot, submitted the measure Tuesday to county  election officials.  </P> <P> The deadline for a measure to be placed on the ballot is July 6.  </P> <P> The bond measure needs a two-thirds vote to pass, and would increase property  taxes an average of about $280 a year for a house with an assessed value of  $200,000.  </P> <P> District officials had considered a $32-million bond measure, but decreased it  by $6.5 million after meeting with architects, facilities managers and the  district's financial adviser. The meeting produced a precise list of facilities  needed and a streamlined schedule for carrying out the projects, said Carmela  Vignocchi, assistant superintendent for business services.  </P> <P> In addition to building three schools, district officials would use the bond  money to renovate several existing schools, including Flory and Peach Hill  elementary schools, Chaparral Middle School and Moorpark Memorial High School,  Vignocchi said.  </P> <P> But funds from the measure will cover only some of the needs of the  fast-growing 5,400-student district, which has been expanding at a rate of  about 400 students a year.  </P> <P> District officials estimate that an additional $22 million will be needed for  new construction, land and equipment.  </P> <P> Officials hope to get the additional money from state school building funds and  from the lease and sale of surplus school property, Vignocchi said.

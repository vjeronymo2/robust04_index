			<p>BFN     [Text] An official source in the Ministry of Electricity  and Water told the Yemeni news agency, Aden, that in  continuation of the all-out war launched by the Sanaa military  rulers against the people of the Democratic Republic of Yemen,  particularly the brutal shelling of the economic and social  establishments, the al-Ahmar gang's warplanes last Saturday [4th  June] shelled the (?Aden- Lahij) water electricity generator and  stopped pumping of water to the residential quarters in the  capital, Aden. The Public Corporation for Water was able to  repair the generator and pump the water. The enemy warplanes  once again shelled the same generator yesterday by personal  instructions of the head of the Sanaa ruling regime. The source  confirmed that the Public Water Corporation is currently  repairing the generator.</p>

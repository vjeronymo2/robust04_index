			<p>BFN     [Text] Belmopan [dateline as received] -- Belizean Prime  Minister Manuel Esquivel today announced that at the upcoming  meeting of the Caribbean Common Market [Caricom] scheduled for  July, he will propose the creation of a regional commission to  establish a dialogue with the Haitian military.    Esquivel voiced his desire for such a commission to serve as  mediator in the search for a solution to the crisis that Haiti  has been experiencing since 30 September 1991, when a military  junta overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.    Esquivel, who is taking part in a meeting of representatives  and governors of Central America, the Caribbean, and the United  States, said the proposal may be supported by other countries of  the region, including Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and  others. Delegates of 13 Caricom member-states, Central American  economics ministers, and eight governors from U.S. southern  states are participating in the two-day meeting.    Esquivel said there is a great deal of resistance on the  part  of the Haitian military, perhaps because it views the United  States as a great power. With the creation of the commission,  which would not attempt to displace Washington, "there could be  other alternatives," he said.    He added: "It is perhaps easier for the Haitians to talk  with  the small countries of the region rather than with the United  States. The message would be the same; only the messenger would  be different."    He believes the U.S. Government has dealt with the problem  well. He said: "Its ideas are good. The problem is that the  United States is the world's most powerful country. It is  difficult for it to talk with one of the smallest countries in  the region. I think it is also easier for the rest of the  countries to talk with one another than with a larger country."</p>

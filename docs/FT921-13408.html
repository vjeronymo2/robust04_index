			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Serbs draft law for new Yugoslavia SERBIA has drawn up a draft law for the creation of a new, reduced Yugoslav state following international recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. A commission set up by the Serb-controlled federal parliament has proposed 'the basis for the historic reconstruction of Yugoslavia', the Belgrade-based news agency Tanjug said yesterday. The law, which is expected to be adopted in mid-February, is the first concrete step towards the creation of a rump Yugoslav state whose borders have not yet been defined. 'The borders would be democratically agreed by the nations which wish to remain in Yugoslavia,' Tanjug said. The draft law calls for the formation of a provisional constitutional assembly comprising 30 representatives from each republic. It says elections in the constituent republics could be held by autumn. However, the plans are likely to face opposition both from within the republic and beyond. On Friday the parliament of Bosnia-Hercegovina is expected to approve a referendum on independence for the republic's 4.4m Slavic Moslems, Serbs and Croats. Ethnic Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo, controlled by the Serbian police, also oppose the attempt to create a rump, Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. Representatives from Croatia and the federal army met EC monitors in Pecs, southern Hungary, yesterday to discuss ways to bolster the ceasefire.</p>

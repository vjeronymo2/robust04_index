			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Tariff cuts 'will stabilise world food markets' The Uruguay Round trade accords will lead to more stable world food markets in the coming decades and open up important new markets for efficient agricultural producers, according to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Gatt secretariat, which has analysed the impact of reductions in tariffs and other farm trade barriers negotiated over the eight years of talks, says new market opportunities will be of particular value to developing countries exporting temperate food products where protection in the industrialised world has been greatest. Developed countries, which account for about two-thirds of world imports of farm products, will cut tariffs by an average of 37 per cent over six years, according to Gatt's calculations. Above average tariff cuts will apply to oilseeds, flowers and plants and below average reductions to sugar and dairy products, with other tariffs declining by close to the average. For tropical products - which comprise half the agricultural exports of developing nations - the average tariff reduction will be 43 per cent. Under the terms of the Uruguay Round farm trade accord, countries agreed to convert all import restrictions into tariffs and reduce those tariffs by at least 36 per cent over six years for industrialised countries and 24 per cent over 10 years for developing countries. Gatt says minimum market access commitments by countries which previously had closed markets will boost coarse grain imports by 1.76m tons and rice imports by 1.08m tons. Total outlays on domestic support for farmers will fall by 18 per cent from Dollars 197bn to Dollars 162bn. In addition, export subsidies will be cut by 36 per cent from Dollars 21.3bn to Dollars 13.7bn by the end of the transition period. These reductions will bear most heavily on highly subsidised products such as wheat, beef, coarse grains, dairy products and sugar, Gatt points out. The quantities of exports that can be legally subsidised will be reduced by 21 per cent. During 1986-90, developed countries subsidised annually on average 48.2m tons of wheat, 19.5m tons of coarse grains, 1.8m tons of sugar and 1.2m tons of beef.</p>

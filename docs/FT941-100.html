			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / C&amp;W and Bell Canada seek offering for joint cable group A new cable television group linking the UK cable interests of Cable and Wireless, Bell Canada International and Jones Intercable is planning a public offering which could be the first to reach the London Stock Exchange. The new cable group, to be known as BCETI Cable, which will be the third largest in the UK, is planning a listing on the New York Stock Exchange and probably also in London. The groups have signed a letter of intent to consolidate their interests in cable television and cable telephony and have announced a public offering. C&amp;W, which has a 20 per cent stake in Bell Canada's UK cable holdings, said last night it hoped to see a flotation in both London and New York. Mr Alan Bates, managing director of the UK arm of Jones Intercable, a US group, will be chief executive of BCETI Cable. He said the proposed amalgamation meant 'our interests in the UK can achieve the full benefit of access to both capital and expertise, allowing us to deliver a wide range of video, voice and data products to consumers and businesses.' The group will have significant cable interests in London, Yorkshire, East Anglia and south-east England. The decision to go for a flotation is a symptom of growing confidence in the UK cable industry largely because of the dual streams of revenue from television and telephone services. At least three other large cable groups are considering coming to the London Stock Exchange this year: TeleWest, Comcast and Generale Des Eaux, the French utility and communications group. Mr Richard Woollam, director of the Cable Television Association, said the deal underlined the cable industry's commitment to build 'super highways' in the UK. It could also be a chance, he said, for British investors to back the industry. At the moment the multi-billion pound task of building cable networks in the UK is largely being financed by North American money. Details involving minority shareholders in the BCETI agreement are likely to be resolved within the next couple of weeks with a prospectus likely within two months.</p>

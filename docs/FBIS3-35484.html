A MENA correspondent in Baghdad has learned that  negotiations  have been going on behind the scenes between representatives of  several international oil companies, particularly Western and  U.S. companies and Iraq, to exploit the Majnun oilfields in  southeast Iraq, which are known to hold the biggest oil reserves  in the world.    The correspondent has learned from oil experts in Iraq that  Iraq prefers the French to the Western and U.S. companies  because it believes that the French stance on the embargo  imposed on Iraq has recently changed, especially at the Security  Council.    Observers base this view on a statement made by Dr. Riyad  al-Qaysi, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry under secretary, in which  he referred to the change in the French stance during a news  conference he held with UN team leader Rolf Ekeus earlier this  month.    A responsible UN source in Baghdad told MENA's correspondent  that these oil talks are not regarded as a violation of UN  resolutions.    Iraq has 110 billion barrels of crude oil--the second  largest  oil reserves in the world. The Majnun oilfields have 50 billion  barrels of proven and unproven oil reserves in the so-called  "al-Rumaylah rectangle," which extends from south Iraq to Kuwait  and Saudi Arabia and some parts of southwest Iran.    This field was one of the reasons the eight-year  Iraqi-Iranian war erupted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondents Captains 1st Rank </F> Vladimir Urban and Valeriy Gromak, under the rubric: "Military  Review":"`If We Can Just Hold Out for Another Year' -- After  That the Baltic Countries Hope To Form a Military Alliance"]    [Text] All military alliances are similar to each  other. And perhaps the only question to which the answers will  be different is: "Why is the bloc being created?" Literally a  year from now we will become witnesses to the birth of a new  alliance -- the Baltic Alliance. And this is not a prediction  but a visible prospect. So, this question is already  appropriate: "Why?"  <H6>  We Have Sent A Note to NATO </H6>   As had been anticipated, a sensation due to Lithuania's  entry  into NATO did not occur. But President Algirdas Brazauskas'  official request, which was sent to the North Atlantic  Organization at the beginning of this year, once again confirmed  the strategic goals not only of that country but also of the  Baltic states as a whole.    In the middle of December, the general opinion that only  NATO  is capable of guaranteeing the security of the Baltic republics  was expressed at a meeting in Tallinn of the three presidents --  Algirdas Brazauskas, Guntis Ulmanis and Lennart Meri. It is  erroneous to think that these conclusions were arrived at under  the influence of the "Zhironovskiy factor" in the Russian  parliamentary elections. We think that this is only a reason for  the outcome because, in a joint statement on the meeting's  results, even the presidents stressed that attempts for a  rapprochement with NATO arose, not under the influence of the  elections in Russia, but because the Baltic countries have  already been long interested "in closer ties" with that military  bloc.    It is characteristic that last summer and autumn we saw in  local politics the banner of the creation of a regional security  system. And the priorities of cooperation began to be seen more  clearly as winter approached.    At a meeting of the armed forces (defense forces)  Commanders-in-Chief of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and this  was in October, it was announced for the first time that the  Baltic states need their own "Baltic NATO". And the need to  create a "unified Baltic countries military system according to  the NATO type" was officially confirmed already at the prime  ministers December meeting.    According to certain data, they plan to sign a  comprehensive treaty on a defensive alliance already at the end  of this year, immediately after, as they think here, the  withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and Estonia. And during  the time remaining they propose developing a package of specific  agreements in the military sphere which will help to immediately  begin the realization of the main treaty.    Now obviously the time has come to answer the question: "Why  is the new bloc being created?" Lithuanian Minister of National  Defense Linas Linkyavichyus expressed that most frankly when he  said in a national television interview that the Baltic  countries "should not knock at the door of the collective  security system with their hands extended" but that they need to  have their own effective military structures which will then be  added to NATO.  <H6>  One Battalion Is Already Standing Roll Call </H6>   What documents already exist? The Lithuanian Ministry of  National Defense had already prepared one of the drafts of the  treaty on military cooperation during the summer and it was sent  to the Latvian and Estonian ministries of defense. It provides  for the creation of a unified air defense system, joint  protection of ground and maritime borders, and the exchange of  operational information. Furthermore, it is considered advisable  to have a common training facility to train troops and a Baltic  arms development and production program.    For now we know that on the whole the Lithuanian draft was  supported by its neighbors. They decided to create a "hot line"  between the three ministers of defense and to exchange military  attaches as "operational measures", and they also planned to  strengthen the eastern borders in the near future. They plan to  discuss these problems in more detail in January at the prime  ministers meeting in Riga.    It is understandable that the development of military  cooperation will primarily depend upon the level of  "rapprochement of the politicians". Right now a working group  has been created to develop the charter of the Baltic countries  presidential council. (A statute on the Baltic Assembly, a  distinctive Baltic parliament, has already been adopted  --Authors' comment). Later, as usual, the creation of  all of the vertical structures of the new alliance will begin.    Analysts agree that only the proposals on the organs of  military command and control could cause serious disagreements.  If you take the Lithuanian variant as a basis, you can hardly  restrict yourself to the armed forces Commanders-in-Chiefs  conference (council). A permanent organ in the form of a unified  command authority will most likely be required. But even this  diagram is not at all flawless. If, for example, you count on  the entry of the Baltic republics into the North Atlantic  Organization in the relatively near future, the organs of joint  command and control that are being created will simply remain  unnecessary.    Well for the time being the politicians have only begun to  discuss the problems of a military alliance and the military  personnel themselves have already taken part in the matter. The  October commanders-in-chief meeting that was mentioned here made  a joint decision on the creation of a "Baltic Battalion" by the  end of 1994 which will then be placed at the disposal of UN  peacekeeping forces.    <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008C-48A>           Diagram of One Possible Variant of the Future Alliance </FIG>     They plan to deploy the battalion at Alitus  (Lithuania). It will have a strength of 650 men. The structure:  command structure, staff and three companies (Lithuanian,  Latvian, and Estonian). A Lithuanian officer will become the  commander, a Latvian officer will be deputy commander, and an  Estonian officer will be chief of staff. The leadership and  staff will be changed annually. They plan three exercises, an  infantry company from each country will participate, in order to  create the battalion this year.    But what if the UN does not require this battalion? Or if  the  leaders of the three countries do not decide on the  participation of this subunit in peacekeeping operations?  Estonian Defense Forces Commander-in-Chief Major-General  Aleksander Eynseli thinks that even if the politicians do not  determine their positions, the creation of the battalion will  become "one more step toward the military cooperation of three  countries".  <H6>  But CNN Will Be the First To Arrive to Assist </H6>   As we know, any military alliance assumes that armies are  structured on approximately identical principles. But if Estonia  has already begun the transition to NATO standards (it concluded  a contract for the delivery of $50 million worth of Israeli arms  -- small-arms and antitank weapons, light air defense systems,  etc.), Latvia is counting primarily on "humanitarian weapons  assistance" from Germany and Sweden, and for now Lithuania is  oriented toward Russian arms.    In the future, Lithuania intends to resolve part of its  own light weapons needs using its own resources. An experimental  enterprise to produce military output ("Vityaz-2"  machine-pistols, hand grenades, etc.) has been created based on  Kaunas NII [Scientific Research Institute] of Construction and  Architecture. Estonia plans to independently produce small-arms  ammunition according to NATO standards.    There are differences in the organization of the armed  forces  and "standardization" must entail changes in legislation. Time  will be required to do that. Enormous resources will have to be  spent on the creation of an air defense system and on real air  forces that are practically nonexistent right now. The budgets  of all three countries are incapable of supporting these costs.    So, the new alliance's capabilities "to support defense"  will  not emerge from the purely political sphere for a long time yet.  It is no accident that one Finnish analyst has noted without  irony in this regard: "It would probably be more correct to  characterize the current strategic doctrine of the Baltic states  as defense oriented on CNN. The idea consists of the need to  defend yourself... until the entire world is able to learn that  you have been subjected to attack".    But you can rest assured that the Baltic states will not  have  to carry out this "dream". Indeed, the impression has formed  that Latvia and Estonia are increasingly proceeding from  Russia's allegedly inherent hostility toward them in their  international policy. So one can anticipate that they will also  begin to utilize the new alliance in order to present  themselves, as before, as "hostages" of their Eastern neighbor.  And then appeals will follow to fill the existing "security  vacuum" with the assistance of the Western states.    As for Lithuania, while submitting a request for entry into  NATO, it especially stipulated in advance that its desire is not  directed against third countries. But even Baltic military  integration, in which Lithuania has been quite definite, will  inevitably affect the displacement of the Baltic region states'  cooperation with the West in the military sphere. And this can  already be considered to be a challenge to Russia.  <H6>  The First Measures For the Creation of a Military Alliance: </H6>   -- establishment of a "hot line" between the ministers of  defense;    -- obligations to strengthen the states' eastern borders;    -- the exchange of military attaches;    -- the conduct of joint exercises (February 1994 -- on the  territory of Estonia, July 1994 -- on the territory of  Lithuania; October 1994 -- on the territory of Latvia) in the  context of creating a unified "Baltic Battalion";    -- monthly meetings of the heads of the main staffs (in the  beginning of January 1994 in Tallinn, they discussed the  specific problems of the formation of the "Baltic Battalion" and  they will next meet on 14-15 February in Riga).</p>

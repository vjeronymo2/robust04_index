			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> RIPKEN IS SECOND ON CONSECUTIVE-GAME LIST; ORIOLES WIN  </P> <P> Cal Ripken Jr. has the second-longest playing streak in major league baseball,  yet the Baltimore Orioles' shortstop has received as much criticism as acclaim.  </P> <P> Ripken played in his 1,308th consecutive game Tuesday night at Baltimore in a  game in which Randy Milligan hit his 10th home run leading off the 10th inning  to give the Orioles a 4-3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.  </P> <P> The Orioles, who trailed most of the game, tied it, 3-3, on Mickey Tettleton's  home run with two outs in the ninth.  </P> <P> Ripken passed Everett Scott for the No. 2 spot in longevity behind Lou Gehrig.  Ripken is 822 games -- or more than five seasons -- way from Gehrig's record of  2,130.  </P> <P> But many believe Ripken should not even try to break the record.  </P> <P> Baltimore fans claim Ripken has looked lethargic and even weary lately. He was  0 for 4 against the Brewers and is batting only .163 since May 18 (14 for 86).  </P> <P> When asked about it, Ripken said, "The only thing I'm tired about is hearing so  many people asking me if I'm tired. I'm not."  </P> <P> Ripken, who went into a slump late last season, is batting only .213 this  season.  </P> <P> "I'm proud of what I've done," Ripken said, "but there isn't any big special  feeling. I don't mean to downplay it, but it really is just another game.  Maybe, if by some stroke of luck I catch Gehrig, then that will really be  something."  </P> <P> Ripken, who will be 30 in August, would be 35 if he plays every game until he  reaches Gehrig's record.  </P> <P> His streak began after a day off following sitting out the second game of a  doubleheader on May 29, 1982.  </P> <P> "I never had any idea this would happen," he said. "It wasn't something I set  out to do. It's something I never consciously said I was going to continue.  </P> <P> "It's a relief, in a way. But I never did understand the meaning of the streak  and all the attention that has been poured into it."  </P> <P> Ripken may not be impressed, but his peers certainly are.  </P> <P> "It's amazing," the Brewers' Paul Molitor said. "He can take a foul ball off  the foot or get hit by a pitch, but he's still climbing Mt. Everest. He's  something."  </P> <P> Texas 6, Oakland 5 -- Dennis Eckersley failed in relief for the first time in  21 tries.  </P> <P> Eckersley, who has 20 saves, was brought in with the Athletics leading, 5-2, in  the ninth inning at Oakland. An error by shortstop Walter Weiss started the  Rangers' rally, and Eckersley, who issued his first two walks of the season,  gave up three hits.  </P> <P> Of little solace was Rickey Henderson becoming only the second player to reach  900 steals. Henderson stole second and third bases in the first inning to reach  the goal. Jose Canseco was released from the hospital, where he has been  treated for back problems, but he will not accompany the team to Chicago after  today's game.  </P> <P> Toronto 5, Minnesota 4 -- A three-base error by Twin second baseman Fred  Manrique allowed Toronto to score two unearned runs in the seventh inning at  Minneapolis and put the Blue Jays into first place in the American League East.  </P> <P> It was the fifth loss in a row for the Twins after their 21-7 record was the  best May in their history.  </P> <P> The Twins led, 4-3, when Mookie Wilson singled with one out in the seventh  inning. John Candelaria relieved Kevin Tapani and got Junior Felix to hit a  potential double play ball, but the ball rolled through Manrique and gave  Toronto its winning runs.  </P> <P> New York 5, Boston 4 -- Steve Balboni's run scoring, pinch-hit pinch-hit single  snapped an eighth inning tie at New York and the Yankees knocked the Red Sox  out of first place.  </P> <P> Dave Righetti got the last three outs for his 12th save this season and the  200th of his career.  </P> <P> Before the game the Yankees learned that pitcher Pascual Perez, who has made  only three starts since signing a three-year $5.7 million contract, may require  shoulder surgery.  </P> <P> Cleveland 7, Detroit 3 -- Chris James hit a three-run home run and Sandy Alomar  had three hits at Detroit to lead the Indians.  </P> <P> Bud Black (5-3) gave up seven hits and walked three, but pitched his second  complete game.  </P> <P> James capped a four-run third inning with his fourth home run of the season and  the Indians were never headed.  </P> <P> Jim Lindeman, making his first start for the Tigers, homered and drove in all  three runs.  </P> <P> Seattle 5, Chicago 2 -- Randy Johnson helped spoil the White Sox hopes of  moving to within a game of Oakland in this game at Seattle.  </P> <P> Johnson (6-3) won his third in a row, giving up three hits in 6 2/3 innings.  Buhner hit his fifth home run this month.  </P> <P> The White Sox, who had won four in a row, are two games behind Oakland in the  West.  </P> <P> CONSECUTIVE GAMES PLAYED  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.34IN:2.66IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Lou Gehrig  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,130  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Cal Ripken  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,308  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Everett Scott  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,307  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Steve Garvey  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,207  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Billy Williams  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,117  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Joe Sewell  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,103  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Stan Musial  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 895  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ed Yost  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 829  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Gus Suhr  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 822  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nellie Fox  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 798  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P>  DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

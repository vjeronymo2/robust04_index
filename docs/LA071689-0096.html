			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEEDY CLOSE TO HOME  </P> <P> I volunteer at the Share Our Selves (SOS) in Costa Mesa. We help feed and  clothe our poor. As I read in the paper that our President is going to help the  Polish poor, I wondered: If the president of either country came to our  facility, would they be surprised at our own number of poor? Even the City  Council of Costa Mesa is going to vote on whether to renew the lease for us,  with a no vote considered because "there are no poor in Costa Mesa."  </P> <P> We have mothers with children living in cars with no cooking facilities, so  when we give them their bag of groceries, it has to contain food that doesn't  have to be cooked.  </P> <P> Let's wake up and hear the cries of our own poor and help.  </P> <P> EILEEN MURPHY  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

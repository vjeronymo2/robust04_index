			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Government Feels Relieved by UNSC's </F> Statement To Continue To Persuade North Korea"]    [Text] As for the issue of the DPRK's suspected nuclear  weapons development program, the UN Security Council [UNSC]  adopted the chairman's statement to seek the complete carrying  out of nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA). In this regard, the Japanese Government welcomed  the decision, saying that the "international community was able  to express its strong determination to North Korea" (according  to a senior Foreign Ministry official). There was a possibility  that Japan would be forced to make a hard decision if the UNSC  adopted a resolution to impose economic sanctions on the DPRK.  Because of this, the government was relieved by the statement,  which was designed to continue to persuade North Korea.  <H5>  Japan Holds Ministerial Meetings One After Another To </H5> Exchange Views With the United States and South Korea    In positively evaluating the fact that the UNSC member  states, including China, unanimously approved the chairman's  statement which was designed to demand that North Korea accept  the resumption of nuclear inspections, Japan will cooperate with  the United Nations in strengthening pressure on North Korea to  accept inspections. Although the chairman's statement does not  specify a deadline for accepting the IAEA's inspections, the  Foreign Ministry understands that "it will be done in accordance  with a report that the IAEA director general submitted to the  Security Council on 22 March" and that the UNSC indirectly  demanded that North Korea "accept a reinspection within about  six weeks," as the same report states. A Foreign Ministry  source said, "Perhaps North Korea also understands that around  mid-April is the deadline."    China is the key to North Korea's agreement. The Foreign  Ministry analyzes the situation by saying: "Now that China has  agreed with the chairman's statement, we have laid the  groundwork to work on China to make North Korea respond in a  positive manner. In this sense, China was given a heavy task."  South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will come to Japan  on 3 April. U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry and South Korean  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae will visit Japan in late April.  During the series of visits, the three countries will  demonstrate their cooperative ties to indirectly urge North  Korea to accept the inspections.  <H5>  Many Obstacles in Supporting the U.S. Military </H5>   Government officials are studying the measures that Japan  can  take on the supposition that the UNSC approves economic  sanctions against North Korea and the so-called naval blockade.  The reality is that they are still discussing the issue of  revising the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] Act to enable Japan to  send SDF aircraft during emergencies to rescue Japanese living  abroad. It seems that Japan has no choice but to adopt concrete  measures to deal with the situation if the naval blockade  becomes a reality.    The Maritime Safety Agency will respond first if the UNSC  decides to impose a naval blockade on North Korea. It is  possible for SDF vessels to patrol within Japanese territorial  waters if the Defense Agency director general, after obtaining  approval from the prime minister, instructs them to take "action  to patrol the sea" in accordance with Article 82 of the SDF Act.  It is generally believed that Japan cannot take further actions  "because the right of collective self-defense is involved." The  issue of logistical support for military vessels of the United  States and other countries is also a focal point. The Defense  Agency thinks that, under current laws, Japan cannot supply fuel  to U.S. warships, for example. To supply fuel to U.S. warships,  Japan must sign an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement  with the United States and to revise the SDF Act.    As for logistical support, some people think that the "scale  of cooperation that Japan will be able to provide depends on the  wording of a UN resolution regarding sanctions and on the trend  of public opinion." Because of this, it seems that Japan will  choose "the most suitable method" of the following three  choices: 1) to introduce a new law similar to the UN  Peacekeeping Law, which was discarded during the Kaifu  administration; 2) to revise laws such as the SDF Act; and 3)  to interpret the current laws to meet the circumstances.  <H5>  Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Plays Central Role in Forming </H5> Strategies    The government and the ruling parties feel a sense of crisis  over the DPRK issue. However, no prospect is in sight for  starting Diet deliberations on a draft budget for fiscal year  1994. In addition, they have to deal with the issue of Prime  Minister Hosokawa's loan from the Sagawa Kyubin firm. They are  far from working out carefully thought-out arrangements.    Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishihara summoned the  responsible officials of each ministry and agency to the prime  minister's official residence to talk about measures that Japan  can take if the UNSC decides to impose economic sanctions on  North Korea. However, it is said that they are still "sorting  out measures which it is possible to take" (according to a  government source). Some bureaucrats at Kasumigaseki are  beginning to doubt the Hosokawa administration's  crisis-management capabilities, asking, "Will the  administration, which lacks centripetal force, be able to make  political decisions?"</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Critchley 26% ahead at Pounds 3.85m Critchley Group, the electrical cable accessories manufacturer, reported a 26 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.05m to Pounds 3.85m in the year to March 31. The outcome, achieved on turnover ahead 21 per cent to Pounds 28.9m, was struck after a Pounds 750,000 provision to cover moving and other costs. It was in line with forecasts made last month when the group announced plans to buy Idento, a German cable identification products group, for DM27.5m (Pounds 11m). The acquisition was funded in part by a Pounds 10m open offer to shareholders and was completed last week. The Critchley Label Centre business acquired from BT in May last year contributed Pounds 3.23m. Earnings per share grew by 10 per cent to 21.1p (19.1p), held back by a slightly higher tax charge rate and the dilutive effects of the shares issued at the time of the flotation in November 1992. The proposed final dividend is increased by 15 per cent to 5.5p, making a total of 8.1p for the year. The shares closed up 6p at 444p. Mr Ian McCallum, chief executive, said he was pleased with the results. 'Margins improved across the group and we are particularly encouraged by the increase in sales overseas which represent nearly 40 per cent of the total,' he said. Operating profits increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 3.73m (Pounds 3m). Organic growth accounted for about a third of the increase. The core Critchley electrical cable accessories and identification business reported only a modest domestic sales increase, reflecting the discontinuation of some low margin products and the slow down in the implementation of some large projects in the UK. However, accessories sales improved from Pounds 17.4m to Pounds 20.4m, helped by an 11 per cent increase in exports and the Critchley Label Centre acquisition. Divisional profits increased by 6.3 per cent to Pounds 2.7m, including a Pounds 237,000 contribution from Critchley Label Centre. Net interest receipts fell to Pounds 120,000 (Pounds 152,000); the group ended the period with net cash of Pounds 3.7m.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A great vintage rained off - Wine During the summer in the Bordeaux region conditions were perfect if not for yet another 'Vintage of the Century' at least for the production of one of the vintages of the decade. The vine flowering at the end of May was early and swift, although the outcome was on the small side. But it was quality not quantity that was urgently looked for. June was cool, but July with a little rain, and August were relentlessly hot, especially in the first 10 days of August. The last three weeks enjoyed heatwave temperatures of 28-29`C (82-84`F) with occasional storms: perfect for the month that traditionally 'makes the flavour'. The veraison (when the grapes change colour) in the first 10 days was unusually early. The bunches were smaller than last year, but the grapes were bigger. Haut-Brion picked its very special white grapes on August 31 and started its reds on September 10 - one day after the Ban de Vendange that officially permits the red wine picking to begin. A first-growth director said he was going to make 'a superb 1994'. Everything was fine until September 7 when some not very significant rain fell, but fate struck on September 12, and it rained for the next four days, washing away the prospects of a great vintage. The dates for picking varied according to local conditions. This is the largest fine-wine area in the world. It may be raining in Pauillac but sunny in Pomerol. The general starting date this year was September 19, and the finishing date September 29. Among the leaders Chateaux Margaux picked from September 14-28, with Cheval-Blanc in St Emilion from September 16-30, Vieux-Chateau Certan in Pomerol from September 12-24, Pichon-Lalande in Pauillac from September 17-28 but had to speed up as the ripe grapes were falling off the vines while Mouton-Rothschild began on September 19, stopped owing to rain on September 22, and re-started on the 28th with 800 pickers to finish on October 1. So what are the likely results? The dry white Graves picked before the heavy rains in the first week of the month made excellent wines, but very small in quantity. The Sauternes and Barsacs that waited until the end of the month, and completed picking in the first 10 days of October made successful wines, but those that did not delay suffered badly. For the reds, only a provisional assessment is possible before the vats are emptied after the fermentation. However the general view is that the 1994s are better than the 1993s, whose reputation has been steadily rising, and whose prices probably will. Colours are deeper, the grapes are riper and the alcoholic degrees higher. I sampled a variety of wines, mostly Merlot, that had finished their fermentation and was impressed by their colour and sweetness. It is a Merlot year because picking is usually earlier on the right bank of St Emilion and in Pomerol. Professor Ribereau-Gayon, head of the Oenological Institute of Bordeaux University has been quoted as saying that the Merlots are 'homogenous'. The laggards are usually the Cabernet Sauvignons, but owing to the exceptional summer a good many were ripe at the same time as the Merlots. The vintage has been compared with '88 but with softer tannins. What about likely prices? If it had been the predicted great vintage they would have rocketed for the internationally known 'names'. Moreover with fine wines short on the Bordeaux market the chateaux have been very successfully selling their stocks held up by several recession years. Haut-Brion '89, considered the finest first growth of the vintage, currently sells on the Bourse for FFr600 (Pounds 72) (a bottle, duty paid, has a delivered price of about Pounds 110 in the UK). Latour Margaux and Montrose '90 are unobtainable there. The leading seconds are around FFr150. The 1993 firsts opened at FFr155 a bottle, the next rank at FFr60-70, and a general view is that the 1994s will start at 10 per cent higher, but not more if they expect to sell a substantial portion of their crop. The crop is smaller than last year. Meanwhile, what should one look to buy in the near future? The '93s will be in bottle next spring. They have good colour and when carefully selected originally, have a good deal of body and character: much more than the '92s. Nevertheless in two or three years these relatively inexpensive wines from reliable sources may make agreeable introductory or 'luncheon clarets' for moderate meals. I was agreeably surprised with those left-bank '91 wines which had survived that year's terrible April frosts. They have engaging bouquets and fruity bodies; not expensive but must be carefully chosen and bought only from merchants who specialise in fine claret.</p>

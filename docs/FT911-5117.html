			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Mexico seeks benchmark for private sector funding MEXICO'S return to the international capital markets is aimed primarily at establishing a benchmark for private sector entities which are now actively raising overseas finance, Mr Angel Gurria, under-secretary for international finance, said in London. Speaking at the weekend as Nacional Financiera, the Mexican state finance company, raised the size of its latest 10 per cent Eurobond by Dollars 25m to Dollars 125m, Mr Gurria said there was now no public sector deficit to finance. The private sector was well-placed to finance the country's current account deficit, officially projected at some Dollars 6bn this year, but thought likely to be higher by private economists. 'The reason why we went to the market was to set a marker,' he said. Private sector borrowers who have projects to finance 'were all over the place,' he said. The public sector was authorised to borrow up to Dollars 2.7bn this year, but even if it reached this total, Mexico's debt would still decline as a proportion of economic output. Mr Gurria was in London to promote foreign investment in Mexico ahead of the expected flotation this spring of a further tranche of the government's remaining 26 per cent stake in Telmex, the telephone utility. The sale will mark the first time a developing country has sold a public utility through the international capital markets. Mexico's buoyant economy had prompted a return of flight capital estimated at some Dollars 5bn over the past 18 months and a similar amount in direct foreign investment, he said. These flows should continue despite the widening current account deficit and last November's decision to slow the rate of peso devaluation to a level below inflation. The government's ability to deal with the economy was bolstered by its high foreign exchange reserves, estimated by private Mexican economists at some Dollars 13bn. The 5 per cent devaluation rate was sufficient in the light of US inflation and productivity increases in Mexico, he said. Foreign investors were also being attracted by the prospect of a free trade agreement with the US and Canada. 'Domestic interest rates continue to drop. Money continues to come in. So we must be doing something right,' he said. Telmex has reported profits of 3.3bn pesos (Dollars 1.1m) for last year, an increase of 82 per cent in real terms over 1990. Revenues grew by 44 per cent to 11.3bn pesos. The results, which are better than expected, reflect recent increases in telephone tariffs, and a rise in the number of telephones in service. Under the terms of its government contract, Telmex is expected to make an annual real rate of return of 12 per cent on capital employed. In May the Mexican government will sell a 14 per cent stake in Telmex through an international offering. At current prices the issue is worth Dollars 1.7bn. Just under 7 per cent of the shares will be issued in Mexico, 50 per cent in the US and the rest in Europe and Japan. The offering, if successful, will be one of the biggest in the international capital markets. It will reduce the Mexican government's stake to 12 per cent. The issue will be co-ordinated by Goldman Sachs and managed in the UK by S. G. Warburg and in Japan by Nomura. Mr Gurria said it would help bring some liquidity to a stock market still plagued by a shortage of paper.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TROOPS GET LITTLE BITS OF HOME IN ARABIA;  </P> <P> GULF CRISIS: 'OPERATION ORANGE SHIELD' WILL SEND PERSONAL CARE PACKAGES TO  5,000 SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL SPEND THE HOLIDAYS IN SAUDI ARABIA.  </P> <P> Tapes of music and messages from celebrities, along with Knott's Berry Farm  preserves and Los Angeles Rams yearbooks, are among the little bits of home  that a consortium of local businesses plans to send to 5,000 Orange County  Marines spending Christmas in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> The goal of "Operation Orange Shield," as it has been dubbed by organizer  Robert Nelson, a Costa Mesa public relations executive, is to send each of the  local Marines a personal care package, sponsors said.  </P> <P> "I just think, like almost everyone else I talk to, that we want to do  something a little bit special for the young men and women who are over there,"  said Bob Roth, a spokesman for Disneyland, which is donating 5,000 decks of  playing cards.  </P> <P> "I think we're lucky to have the opportunity to do something on a large scale  by joining these other groups."  </P> <P> Organizers of the drive sent telegrams to 1,000 companies and individuals  throughout the county last week asking for donations of $1,000 each; they hope  to raise $50,000 for the purchase of additional gifts, sponsors said.  </P> <P> "We all owe a debt of gratitude to servicemen around the world serving in  military Operation Desert Shield," said Nelson. "I hope others will join us by  sending a message to those soldiers risking their lives for the freedom of  others."  </P> <P> Local rock station KEZY-FM is donating tapes of music and messages from  celebrities to the Marines, which were aired Wednesday.  </P> <P> Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who was listed as one of the drive's  sponsors on the telegrams sent to local businessmen, said he was eager to help  Nelson, a former executive aide in his office.  </P> <P> Riley, a retired Marine Corps brigadier general who saw battle in World War II,  recalled his own loneliness as a young Marine during his first Christmas away  from home in Guadalcanal. Members of his unit gathered for a midnight Mass on  Christmas Eve, hiding candles under empty ration cans, until the distant sound  of Japanese aircraft forced them to flee into the darkness.  </P> <P> "I served at Christmas, so I know it can be a time of loneliness," Riley said.  "That's a time when thoughts return home, thoughts of family and a time of  emotional separation."  </P> <P> "Bringing a little bit of something from home, I think, will improve the  morale," he said.  </P> <P> The gift packages will be assembled Dec. 1 at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station.  Anyone wishing to make monetary donations or volunteer for the project may call  (714) 668-7218.  </P></p>

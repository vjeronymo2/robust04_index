			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Experts estimate that  China will have an initial information sharing market by the  year 2000.    It will enable individuals to exchange a wide range of  information with each other and society at large via computer  terminals and telephones, said Xu Zuzhe, secretary-general of  the Beijing Information Industry Association.    "It signals that China is in a transitional period in  building its information highway," he said at a high-tech  exhibition to celebrate the international telecommunications day  here today.    New services in telecommunications have grown fast these  years, he said, including E-mail systems, which have attracted  their first groups of users in Beijing and Shanghai.    And China is building its first public packet switching data  network, with 36,000 km being completed last year.    "Auto audio services have been adapted to the fields of  securities, bank systems, and wireless paging," said Guan  Xuemei, general manager of the Beijing Shining Star Company, a  main producer of auto audio technology.    In addition, Xu's association is discussing the possibility  of designing an electronic bulletin board for public rentals.  The bulletin board can provide news as well as other  information through a computer network nationwide.    Countless information companies are rushing onto the market,  including foreign firms such as the Dow Jones Company of the U.S.    "The expansion of the public information market goes in line  with the people's improved living standards," said Li Rujiang,  vice general manager of the Shenzhen Oriental Co. Ltd. he added  that in recent years, more Chinese families have gained access  to telephones, personal computers, and fax facilities.    Guan Xuemei said that the government's decision to speed up  the development of the service industry has quickened  information flow.    Statistics show that the posts and telecommunications sector  has remained the fastest growth sector in China -- last year it  was up 59 percent over 1992.</p>

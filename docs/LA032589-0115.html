			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: BICHETTE WORKS HIMSELF HARD FOR ONE-WAY TICKET TO MAJORS  </P> <P> For 26 glorious days last September, outfielder Dante Bichette was an Angel. He  appeared in 21 games, hit .261, scored one run, had eight runs batted in and  struck out seven times. Like any rookie, he remembers each delicious  appearance.  </P> <P> He also remembers Edmonton, his minor league home for the last two seasons. And  Midland and Palm Springs. And Quad City and Salem before that. If nothing else,  five years in the Angel farm system has taught Bichette one thing: He doesn't  want to go back. Ever.  </P> <P> That explains why Bichette took the extra money he earned in September as a  major leaguer and re-invested it in the one commodity he knows best -- himself.  </P> <P> "I'm shooting for the long run," he said.  </P> <P> Bichette bought a pitching machine. Then he went out and purchased a soft toss  machine, a gizmo that lightly tosses baseballs your way. And to record it all,  Bichette splurged and got himself a video camera.  </P> <P> Some players buy Porches; Bichette buys business aids.  </P> <P> "A big car right now wouldn't do me much good," he said.  </P> <P> He started lifting weights, using resident Angel he-man Brian Downing as his  model and mentor. Before, Bichette didn't know a tricep from Trident gum. He  thought a latissimus dorsi was a fish. Now look at him: His shoulders are as  wide as a car hood.  </P> <P> Bichette arrived at spring training tuned and toned. His swing needed some  work, what with all the lunging Bichette does, but Angel hitting instructor  Deron Johnson took care of that.  </P> <P> The results? Along with pitcher Jim Abbott, Bichette has become the people's  choice to earn a place on the team's 24-man roster. Underdogs have a way of  doing that to a crowd. Wally Joyner receives polite, appreciative applause when  he steps to the plate. Bichette and his .345 average and team-leading four home  runs get cheers.  </P> <P> "They want me to be up (in the big leagues)," he said. "They think well of me.  It's really nice to hear that, especially from the fans."  </P> <P> So far, Bichette has done everything except furnish the clubhouse lunch spread  this spring. He has hit for power and average. He has stolen a few bases,  knocked in 14 runs in only 55 at-bats. He has played well in the outfield. In  the process, Bichette has made life difficult for Angel Manager Doug Rader.  </P> <P> The plan was this: Bichette would attend camp, have his swing refined, probably  struggle as he learned the new mechanics of it all, receive an occasional start  in the lineup, then be dispatched to Edmonton.  </P> <P> "They were thinking I probably wasn't ready for the big leagues," he said.  </P> <P> Instead, Bichette understood exactly what Johnson was trying to do, and proved  it with this impressive spring performance. Even his outs -- line drives to  straight center field, towering fly balls to the outer reaches of the warning  tracks -- are fun to watch.  </P> <P> "The last two times I came (to camp), I knew I wasn't going to play a lot,"  Bichette said. "I knew I wasn't even going to be considered for a job. This  year, I wanted to show them I can play."  </P> <P> Bichette can play, all right. But where?  </P> <P> The Angels didn't sign former Yankee outfielder Claudell Washington to that  multiyear, multimillion dollar contract so he could recommend nice restaurants  when the team traveled to New York. Devon White will be the Angel center  fielder for the rest of this decade -- at least. Chili Davis isn't going to be  replaced, not as long as he keeps churning out those 20-plus home runs and  90-plus RBIs.  </P> <P> Which leaves Bichette competing with veteran Tony Armas for the fourth  outfielder spot. You might like Bichette's chances if spring statistics were  the lone factor. Armas hasn't hit Twiggy's weight, much less his own. But Armas  did put up some nice numbers during the 1988 regular season, which explains why  Rader seems convinced that youth, meaning Bichette, would be better served back  in triple A.  </P> <P> "You hate to see a guy have the kind of spring that he did and get sent out,"  Rader said. "But conversely, if he does get sent out, he would certainly be the  first guy we'd recall. The only reason he would be sent out in the first place  is because we couldn't guarantee him enough playing time here. So it's a nice  feeling to know that if you're getting sent out, it won't be long before you  get back."  </P> <P> Bichette wouldn't exactly use the word, "nice," to describe what it might feel  like to be sent to Edmonton again. He prefers "tough" and "very disappointing."  </P> <P> "But I know they're going to try to do what's best for me and the team," he  said.  </P> <P> Bichette said he belongs in the major leagues now. It isn't an ultimatum or a  ploy, just a simple declarative sentence spoken by a 25-year-old player at  peace with himself and his swing. "I don't want to sound like I can do it all,"  he said.  </P> <P> Despite a spring to remember, Bichette's chances aren't good. Rader said  Bichette would have to earn a starting position to make the team, and that's  not going to happen with the company of White, Washington and Davis available.  </P> <P> "I don't think you can place (Bichette) as a right-handed hitter in a platoon  situation because how many at-bats (against left-handed pitchers) are you going  to get?" Rader said. "Not as many as you need.  </P> <P> "As a developing player, you don't want to place him in a platoon mode at this  point in his career. He needs to start."  </P> <P> So barring the improbable, Bichette will become a part-time Canadian again.  It's not Anaheim, but then again, it's not Quad City, either.  </P> <P> "I don't think the Angels or anybody, including myself, knows how good I can  play," Bichette said.  </P> <P> But don't worry, they will. And by the way, see you soon.  </P></p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / World Trade News: US lays ground for new trade talks US trade officials are nearing the end of intricate discussions with Congress that will give the president a six-year authority to negotiate new trade agreements. But Congress looks set to weaken US efforts to bring labour and environmental issues into future pacts. The discussions are, basically, over US legislation needed to implement the global trade liberalisation measures agreed under the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. As a result of many deals cut by Congress and the administration over the last few months, it is hoped this legislation can be introduced next month and passed without amendment. The legislation will also give President Bill Clinton the new 'fast-track' negotiating authority he has requested for future trade negotiations, but in amended form. The fast-track process, in theory, enables the president to submit trade pacts that Congress can only approve or reject, but not amend. This is meant to assure US trading partners that the executive branch has the authority it needs to negotiate in good faith. However, Congress is retaining much of its authority over trade. Under the new fast-track provision, the president will have to notify Congress 60 days before starting formal trade negotiations. During that time either house may disapprove of the proposed negotiation by majority vote. Before signing an agreement, the president must notify Congress. The president has to give 120 days' notice in order to allow private sector advisers 45 days to submit reports evaluating the agreement. After three years, the president must request a three-year extension of the fast-track to December 15, 2000. The advisers must also submit their views. The administration is being forced to eliminate environment and labour concerns from the negotiating objectives proposed in the fast-track. These were contained in the previous fast-track authorisation in 1988, but were played down by the Republican administrations. But Mr Clinton's pursuit of these objectives in side agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement has since alarmed the business community and free trade Republicans. The administration has promised not to negotiate agreements which authorise sanctions against trading partners on environmental or labour practices 'in the absence of bipartisan Congressional support'. Congress is also retaining its right to amend the implementing legislation for a trade pact, if not the trade pact itself. The outcome of the discussions with Congress amounts to a qualified victory for Mr Clinton. It will give his administration the go-ahead to seek trade agreements with Latin American and South-East Asian countries. But it does not apply to any agreements reached in market access disputes, for instance with Japan or the European Union.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (2): Costly surprises possible - The Banking System A big worry overhanging the Japanese economy's capacity to recover is the convalescent state of its banking system. The finance ministry and the banks themselves have only recently admitted the seriousness of the damage inherited from the late 1980s boom in lending, much of which was to property developers or companies using overvalued land as collateral. Now they have stepped up efforts to tackle banks' two main problems - bad debts caused by the collapse in land prices, and a fragmented, hence costly, industry structure. Bad debts pose the most urgent immediate problem for small and large banks alike. Even on Japan's official relaxed definition of a dud loan, banks' declared bad debts are a bigger drag on the economy than were US banks' non performing assets at the depth of the US banking crisis, points out a Bank of Japan official. Japan's top 21 banks admitted to Y13,700bn of bad debts, at the latest count, although most analysts believe the figure would be at least double if tougher western criteria were used. Disclosed bad debts currently total 2.9 per cent of gross national product, as against the 1.8 per cent of US GNP represented by their US counterparts' non-performing loans in mid-1991. 'In the end, the only way to finance this loss on the financial system is through growth,' says the central bank official. The problem is distributed unevenly through the system, challenging the finance ministry's traditional strategy of encouraging banks to perform at the same rate, the so-called 'convoy system,' designed to buttress public confidence. Not surprisingly, most of the 11 large city banks, representing 30 per cent of total lending, are relatively strong, except for Hokkaido Takushoku and Sakura Bank. Breaches are also appearing in the balance sheets of the smaller trust and long-term credit banks - another 14 per cent of lending - and the sometimes weakly capitalised regional and agricultural co-operative institutions, which make up the rest. In an attempt to clean up their balance sheets before the upturn comes, Japan's banks have broken with their previous strategy of delaying loan loss write-offs in the hope of better times. Write-offs by the top 21 doubled to an unprecedented Y1,400bn in the six months to last September and the finance ministry's banking bureau is thinking of Y3,000bn or more for the full-year ending tomorrow. That represents just over 80 per cent of gyomu-juneki, or core profits and is as much as the banks can afford, believes IBCA, a credit rating agency which specialises in banks. However, banks' new eagerness to write off unperforming assets is being blunted by the continued growth in bad loans, up by 55 per cent in the fist half of the fiscal year, according to Salomon Brothers Asia. At this rate, finance ministry officials believe the banking system needs between three and seven years, depending on individual institutions, to write off the Y6,000bn to Y7,000bn which it estimates is needed to bring the problem under control. This indicates that banks' profitability and capacity to lend could continue to be hampered well into the recovery. So far, demand has been weaker than the supply of credit. The public sector has also helped, by doing some of the banks' job on their behalf. New lending by public sector institutions, mainly for housing and small businesses, overtook new private sector lending for the first time in 1992, according to the Bank of Japan, and probably did so again the following year. Yet bank lenders are coming under growing criticism for continuing to be addicted to collateral-backed lending at a time when assets are falling in value, rather than taking a cue from US practice and lending on cash flow forecasts. The decision to get tougher on bad debts was partly helped by the finance ministry, which has to approve every write-off, from a small loan to a corner store to a giant property developer. It has processed applications faster and been less miserly than in the past in permitting banks to write off losses against tax. The ministry also allowed banks last year to establish a mechanism to help them liquidate and realise tax deductible losses on property loans, which account for an estimated 60 per cent of the total bad debt burden. The bank-owned Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, launched last March, buys bad loans at a discount and then tries to sell the collateral, usually Tokyo office space, in the open market. The CCPC's main problem is that the banks are so unwilling to sell property at its real market value - down at least 50 per cent over the past three years - that it has found hardly any buyers. By the end of last month, the CCPC had raised a trifling 1.1 per cent of the Y1,522bn it had paid for loans with a face value of Y2,857bn. In an attempt to help banks better tackle bad debts, the finance ministry now says it will allow them to sell land collateral at auction, so as to define a real sales price on which they can declare a tax write-off. Failing a buyer, banks will be allowed to sell the collateral to an affiliate established for the purpose. Further ahead, the banks are impatiently awaiting the results of a finance ministry panel on the possibility of packaging bad loans into marketable securities, a technique used by US banks to help them liquidate poorly performing assets. A decision is expected by mid-summer, say officials. The finance ministry and Bank of Japan are meanwhile continuing to do their best to avoid letting a crisis develop in the system itself. An estimated 80-100 officials from both institutions are on secondment or transfer to mainly small banks, where they are engineering rescues and ensuring that the long overdue streamlining of Japan's fragmented banking industry gets under way in an orderly manner. A string of mergers between smaller banks and credit associations has occurred. On the whole, the most troubled institutions are assured of rescue by the government, a parent or bigger associate, if only to prevent a rush on similar banks. Toyo Shinkin, Osaka Fumin Shinkin, Taiheiyo Bank and Hyogo Bank are among the small institutions to have been bailed out during the recession. Bank collapses are almost unheard of. There is one exception - the government's decision last May to stage an orderly liquidation of Kamaishi Shinkin Bank, a small credit association in rural northern Japan, and to distribute its assets among three other institutions in the area. In another break with the tradition of containing, rather than facing crises, banks themselves are taking a tougher line on customers they used to think were too big to abandon. One indicator of this new toughness is the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan's decision last July to leave EIE International, a large property developer, to fend for itself. Another came in November when Daiwa Bank allowed Muramoto Construction, a construction group with debts of Y590bn, to file for protection from its creditors, the largest post-war financial collapse. It is a worrying sign that a year previously, Muramoto was not even listed as a bad debt in its creditor banks' accounts - also true of several other large collapses and bail-outs. This means that despite the finance ministry's assurances that the banking system's problems are well under control, other costly surprises might be waiting to burst out.</p>

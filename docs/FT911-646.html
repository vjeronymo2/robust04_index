			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Civil Service move is opposed CIVIL SERVICE unions believe their members could suffer financially following a decision by the government to end service-wide standards on staff appraisals. They fear the initiative, one of three planned by the Treasury as part of a loosening of controls over personnel matters, will lead to fewer civil servants being given performance-pay rises. Ms Jenny Thurston, deputy general secretary of the IPMS civil service union, yesterday described the initiatives as an attack on the employment rights of more than 500,000 civil servants. The Treasury wants to allow departments more freedom in appraising staff, choosing people for redundancies and deciding on promotion procedures. It is withdrawing existing instructions on these issues and replacing them with less prescriptive guidance. The IPMS is the most vociferous of the unions in its opposition to the changes, although others are also concerned of their effect on members. Ms Thurston said the changes would open the way to a plethora of different standards and practices, especially among smaller departments and agencies. The loosening of rules on staff appraisals worries unions because the appraisals are used in determining pay and promotion. Ms Thurston said loosening controls would make it easier for departments to ensure that performance pay standards were much tougher and more difficult to attain. Mr John Ellis, general secretary of the CPSA, the largest Civil Service union, said he believed there was pressure to reduce the number of civil servants winning performance pay awards. Withdrawal of guidance on selecting job losses could presage an end to the 'last-in-first-out' principle.</p>

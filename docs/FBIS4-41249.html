			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 17/6/1994 -- Yesterday, 16  June, the Moldovan Parliament ratified the Agreement on mutual  recognition of rights and settlement of property ownership  within the ClS. Promoting the necessity of ratifying the October  1992 agreement signed in Bishkek by nine states, Andrei Cucu,  privatization vice minister, stated that this agreement pertains  first of all to Russia, where Moldova possesses 11 wine plants,  three construction organizations and numerous branches of joint  ventures founded by Moldovan economic agents. Russia, in its  turn, has several enterprises in Moldova and the largest is the  "Sovtransavto" haulage enterprise. Russia ratified the Bishkek  agreement in November 1993. Cucu told BASA that most important  is that Russia will recognize Moldova's rights over its  properties in Russian territory. Thus, a proper foundation for  their future privatization will be created. "Our enterprises in  Russia employ Russian personnel and, vice versa, Russian  enterprises in Moldova employ Moldovan personnel who will be  allowed to participate in their privatization," said Cucu. The  Ukraine did not sign the mutual property rights agreement. Cucu  mentioned that an accord with the Ukraine will be established  through a bilateral agreement which is now being elaborated. He  pointed out that the agreement mainly concerns the numerous  vacation houses located in the Ukraine. Cucu said that in 1993  Russia and the Ukraine signed an agreement on recognizing the  rights over the properties located outside their borders.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Alain Lamassoure, minister delegate </F> for European affairs, by Annette Ardisson; from the "Questions  From A to B" program -- live]    [Excerpts] [Ardisson] In Bosnia the UN peacekeepers have  become targets and hostages, particularly the French  peacekeepers, first and foremost because they are there in  greater numbers than the others. Is it not very tempting to  pull them out?    [Lamassoure] No one should lay a finger on French soldiers,  no one should lay a finger on the UN peacekeepers, and no one  should lay a finger on French soldiers. Since yesterday we have  observed that some of them have apparently been surrounded,  indeed threatened, by Serbian forces. We will not accept this;  the United Nations does not accept this, and has made a  statement which was read out a short while ago on your newscast.  France is at pains to recall that it absolutely insists that  the UN resolutions be accepted and that UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Force] should have the means necessary to fulfill its mission.  [passage omitted]    Unfortunately, the crux of the problem, which is the war  between the Bosnians and the Serbs, remains.    [Ardisson] If I understand you correctly, this is a  diplomatic error on the part of the Americans.    [Lamassoure] No, it is not a diplomatic error. The two  agreements [between Croats and Muslims, and between Serbs and  Croats] constitute progress, but at the point we have reached at  present we now have to...[pauses] It is time for all the  parties to the conflict and all the international diplomatic  partners --in other words, the European Union, the United  States, and Russia -- to sit down around a table to achieve an  overall political settlement. Thus, in view of this worsening  of the crisis which we have been witnessing for several days  now, we now have to wield both the stick and the carrot: the  stick, which is that no one must lay a finger on UN soldiers,  and the carrot, which is that from the point at which everyone  agrees to return to the negotiating table and discuss the  political future of Bosnia -- because after all this is how it  must end -- we will then be able to see what the international  community can do to help with the reconstruction of Bosnia. An  operation is already being established in Sarajevo, and will be  established shortly in Mostar. We must also take into account  the efforts made by the Serbs to implement the resolutions of  the international community.    [Ardisson] You talk about wielding the stick, but what stick  is that? Apparently the UNPROFOR soldiers are powerless,  because they are being abducted, detained, as if they had no  means of defense, whereas they have the right to retaliate when  their security is threatened.    [Lamassoure] They have the right, and NATO has the means to  do this. It has already done so twice, and if necessary it will  do it again. At the same time we should be confident that all  of this can end in no way other than a political agreement.  [passage omitted]    [Ardisson] You are saying that the Serbs will not push the  French soldiers into committing a misdemeanor, in other words  into war?    [Lamassoure] It is not in anyone's interest and in  particular  it is not in the Serbs' interest for there to be a worsening of  the military escalation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage omitted]</p>

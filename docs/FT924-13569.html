			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Germany wants EC summit to discuss future of European integration Germany wants tomorrow's European Community emergency summit, called to discuss the future of European integration, to consider new international aid for war refugees in former Yugoslavia, Reuter reports. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, concerned about a growing racist backlash against up to 300,000 refugees now in Germany, will urge the EC to earmark more funds to help house and feed Bosnian refugees in Croatia, Bonn officials said. Turkey will send about 20,000 tonnes of fuel oil to Bosnia, to help people face winter conditions under the Serbian siege, the foreign ministry said in Ankara. It will also set up a 50-bed hospital in Bosnia for victims of the war, once security could be assured.</p>

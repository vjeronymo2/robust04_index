			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Management: Esops benefit seniors About one in three of the UK's 100 largest quoted companies have introduced some form of employee share ownership plan in the last five years. But the majority use them to benefit senior executives, rather than the workforce, according to a new report*. 'Those who had hoped Esops would help to widen and deepen employee share ownership in the UK have so far been disappointed,' says the report by New Bridge Street Consultants, which specialises in share schemes. The report predicts that Esops will continue to grow in popularity, as executive pay becomes more closely linked to companies' long-term performance. New Bridge Street Consultants says that one advantage of using Esops to reward executives is that institutional shareholders do not regulate them closely. Although institutional shareholders often oppose the grant of executive options over new shares issued at a discount, they appear to have few objections to executives receiving free shares from an Esop. Public companies have mainly been reluctant to introduce Esops across their workforce because the tax breaks associated with Esops may be compromised if they are operated in tandem with sharesave schemes, in which employees save as they earn. The companies which have set up an Esop to benefit the entire workforce have usually done so because they have exhausted their ability to issue new shares under a sharesave scheme. Companies may only issue 10 per cent of their shares to employees in any 10-year period. Esops were originally given fiscal incentives in the 1978 Budget under the Lib-Lab Pact and received further tax breaks in the 1989 budget. The prevalence of Esops among FT-SE 100 companies has since increased five-fold. *Executive Briefing. New Bridge Street Consultants, Tallis House, 2 Tallis Street, London EC4Y OBJ. Free.</p>

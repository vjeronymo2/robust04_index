			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In its editorial, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH asserts  that Syria, which made great efforts to promote the peace  process, continues to adhere to its national and pan-Arab  principles. It understands peace as meaning the restoration of  both the land and rights and as being a just and comprehensive  peace that ensures strength and dignity and rejects  capitulation, bargaining, and submission.    The paper adds: Syria also cooperates with all international  efforts aimed to promote the peace process and achieve its  objectives according to the bases approved by the international  legitimacy and its resolutions. Syria rejects any attempt to  derail the peace process.    AL-THAWRAH asserts that Syria, which adheres to a just and  comprehensive peace based on the resolutions of international  legitimacy, will not yield to pressures or blackmail, and will  not be dragged into the delusions of separate deals because  Syria has always advocated pan-Arab causes. The paper notes  that Syria has always warned and still warns against partial,  separate deals.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Syria, with the support of the  masses, has become stronger in the national and pan-Arab arenas.  Syria is today more self-confident than ever before while the  masses are adhering to the national and pan-Arab principles on  whose basis Syria joined the peace process. Syria even opened  the way for this process and gave it momentum at several turning  points.</p>

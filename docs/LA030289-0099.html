			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE BAN OUTCOME CALLED UNCLEAR  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said Wednesday that he does not  believe there are now enough votes in the Assembly to pass legislation  outlawing military-style assault weapons, but he said advocates of the ban are  closing in on the needed support.  </P> <P> In a Capitol news conference, Brown said he hopes the Legislature will vote on  the weapons bill before its Easter recess March 16.  </P> <P> The Speaker said he has polled 60 of the 80 members of the Assembly and found  38 "sure" votes for the Assembly's version of the gun bill, only three short of  the 41-vote majority needed. Even so, Brown declared that he is "not absolutely  certain" of having enough votes once the bill actually gets to the Assembly  floor.  </P> <P> Before the bill can go to the full house, it must be approved by the Assembly  Ways and Means Committee, a hurdle Brown said he is confident it will clear.  </P></p>

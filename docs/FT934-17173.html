			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Conservative donations fall 61% THE CONSERVATIVE party's bank overdraft more than doubled to Pounds 15.3m in the year to March 31, according to its first comprehensive set of accounts published yesterday. Donations fell by 61 per cent to Pounds 7.8m and voluntary contributions from constituency parties fell 18 per cent to Pounds 1.1m. The decline reflected unusually high level of contributions in the previous year during the general election, but the party also said it might reflect grass-roots dissatisfaction. The operating deficit for the year however fell from Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 2.2m, and would have been Pounds 1.9m before changes in the accounting policies. Net current liabilities in the balance sheet rose from Pounds 17.3m last year to Pounds 19.2m. The party pays no corporation tax, although other taxes amounted to Pounds 13m during the year. The accounts include a balance sheet for the first time, which includes five subsidiaries not directly owned by the party: Arun Association, Bourne Association, Colne Association, The 1949 Conservative &amp; Unionist Trust and The Conservative Party Association. The figures show that there were interest-free loans and cash deposits - described as 'primarily from constituency associations' - which increased from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 2.7m. They also show that a valuation of properties at the end of March reduced the value of Conservative Central Office in London by Pounds 2m to Pounds 5.25m. Other freehold properties were valued at Pounds 660,000. Redundancy and reorganisation costs during the year were Pounds 507,000. Total expenditure fell from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds 12.5m. The party said the greater disclosure came in response to management changes and the commitment of Mr John Major, the prime minister, to more open government. It said it had only ever had one offshore bank account, based in Jersey, which had been closed in May last year. There was no mention of the controversy over donations from foreign businessmen or from Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive Polly Peck chairman. Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, said the Conservatives aimed to break even this year, but were determined to step up assistance to constituency associations, 'especially in marginal seats facing difficulties retaining an agent'.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: No allowance for inflation Is any allowance made for inflation in the differential between the immediate interest rate and the redemption note in government stock? I ask because I have a quantity of Treasury stock 13.5 per cent 2004-08. I bought it to yield an immmediate 10.5 per cent and a redemption yield of 8.7 per cent. If I hold it until maturity, I am being paid 10.5 per cent in 1994 money. If no allowance is made for inflation, then my capital loss in 2008 will bring my overall yield to 8.7 per cent and will be in 2008 money which, even at today's low inflation rates, will be worth some 35 to 40 per cent less. No allowance is made for inflation in the differential between the immediate interest rate and the redemption rate in government stock. But, as you will know, dealings in government stock are free of capital gains tax. (Answer by Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management).

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: WMC may appeal over Seabright Western Mining Corporation (WMC), the large Australian mining house, said yesterday it was considering an appeal to the Canadian Supreme Court, after the Nova Scotia appeal court decided not to overturn an earlier judgment against WMC over the acquisition of Seabright, a Nova Scotia exploration company. It is the latest of several legal setbacks for WMC. WMC, via a subsidiary, bought Seabright in 1987 for around CDollars 92m (USDollars 70m), as part of push into North America. However, within weeks of completing the acquisition, WMC described Seabright's Beaver Dam deposit, thought to be one of its most promising assets, as hopeless. By 1989, the Australian company had halted Seabright's operations and written off its investment. WMC proceeded to sue Seabright's president, Mr Terence Coughlan, and other directors, for alleged fraud and negligence. They counter-sued WMC, levelling a variety of charges, including abuse of process. Last year, Mr Justice Merlin Nunn, in the Nova Scotia Trial Division, delivered a judgment which was scathing of WMC's behaviour. He duly ordered the it to pay damages and costs, expected to exceed CDollars 10m, to the president and six former directors of Seabright. Yesterday, in the wake of the appeal court's decision, WMC said it still believed that its case had merit, and was 'considering an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada'. The Seabright affair has been only one of several costly legal debacles for WMC, one of Australia's largest mining companies, in recent months. It was forced to hand over the valuable Ernest Henry copper/gold deposit to Savage Resources in an out-of-court settlement after WMC's exploration team trespassed on a lease area, and then failed to advise Savage of its work. And, last November, WMC and Ord Minnett paid ADollars 20m to settle a case in which it was alleged that a report by the Australian stockbroker - stating that WMC's sale of a 50 per cent interest in the Lady Bountiful gold mine was 'fair and reasonable' - was negligent. The payment, to a small exploration company called Consolidated Exploration, which had sold the stake to WMC, was split between the two firms.</p>

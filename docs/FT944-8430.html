			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Christmas Food &amp; Drink: Top food and drink shops for cross-Channel trekkers Calais has a population of only 120,000 - but between the beginning of November and Christmas it will be swelled by some of the 1.5m to 2m Britons who will have crossed the channel to shop there or in the surrounding area of northern France. In Calais the shopping streets are in two groups, around rue Royal and place d'Armes, and along the boulevards Jacquard and La Fayette. Although it is not as attractive as neighbouring Boulogne it still offers top quality small shops of the sort which are all too uncommon in southern England. Boulogne is France's biggest fishing port. More attractive than Calais, I have always had a soft spot for the walled haute ville. However, I think the best food and drink shopping is to be had below the haute ville in the Grande Rue, rue Faidherbe and the little streets that criss-cross them. Here are some of my favourites: Calais AU BEC FIN, 32 Bd La Fayette, Tel: 21 82 63 80. A very good cheese shop which also sells fine wines. LA MAISON DU FROMAGE, 1 rue Andre Gerschell Tel: 21 34 44 72 FRED, 120 Bd Jacquard, Tel: 21 34 89 89. Great bakery and mouth-watering patisserie. LEDUC CHARLES, 195 Bd La Fayette, Tel: 21 34 37 71. Very good delicatessen. LES DELICES DE LA MER, 160 Bd La Fayette, Tel: 21 34 64 57, and HUITRIERE CALAISIENNE, 12 Bd La Fayette, Tel 21 36 50 97. Two good fish shops. BOUCHERIE CHARCUTERIE DAVELU, 87 Bd La Fayette, Tel: 21 34 39 64. The best butcher in town. MARKETS: Thursday and Saturday mornings, place Crevecoeur. Wednesday mornings, place d'Armes. Boulogne PHILIPPE OLIVIER, 43 Rue Thiers, Tel: 21 31 94 74 , Fax: 21 30 76 57. Simply the best cheese shop in the area. DEMARCHEZ, 47 Rue Faidherbe, Tel: 21 31 39 41, Fax: 21 30 95 45. An excellent bakery. COMTESSE DU BARRY, 35 Grande Rue, Tel: 21 87 19 20. Get your confit here. FAUCHON-HEDIARD, 7 Rue Porte Neuve, Tel: 21 31 65 47. Everything from foie gras to glace fruits. POISSONNERIE AUX PECHEURS D'ETAPLES, 31 Grande Rue, Tel: 21 30 29 28. Excellent fish shop with restaurant attached (which I haven't yet tried). BOURGEOIS JEAN 1 Grande Rue, Tel: 21 31 53 57. Excellent butcher. I get my Toulouse sausages here. MARKETS: Wednesday and Saturday morning, place Dalton. DRINK The government has laid down a 90-litre guideline for those bringing drink into the UK from the EC. In fact, there is no legal limit and you can bring in what you want provided it is for your own personal use. Among the plethora of guides to the drinks market the best I have come across is Tom Stevenson's The Cross-Channel Drinks Guide (Absolute Press,Pounds 6.99, 272 pages). The best cross-channel drinks outlet is the Grape Shop in Boulogne. There is now a branch at the SeaCat terminal, Gare Maritime, 62200 Boulogne, (tel: 010 33 21 30 16 17 from the UK), in addition to the shop at 85-87 rue Victor Hugo in the town (010 33 21 30 16 17). Martin Brown, who runs them, is English and extremely helpful. CHANNEL crossings: Check the newspapers for fare bargains - most of the ferry companies offer remarkably good deals for trippers at this time of year. And there is always the Tunnel . . . (see Stuart Marshall, Page III). Jill James travelled with Hoverspeed from Dover to Calais and by SeaCat from Folkestone to Boulogne. Reservations: 0304-240241</p>

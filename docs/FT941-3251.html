			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Codelco defendant testifies The man at the centre of the Codelco futures scandal, Mr Juan Pablo Davila, was yesterday due to testify before a judge appointed to investigate potential criminal aspects of the case. Mr Davila, who is accused of losing Codelco, Chile's state copper company, more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m) in speculative metals trading in London and New York, has spent the past five days in detention giving testimony to the police department, who are investigating allegations of fraud against him. Mr Jose Benquis, the special judge appointed to the case by former president Patricio Aylwin, said on Tuesday that 400 of the 8,000 futures operations conducted by Mr Davila in 1993 were 'strange' and 'unusual'. Mr Benquis, defending the five-day detention of Codelco's former chief futures operator, said: 'He is being interrogated on many technical aspects that have to be cleared up and about which he must give his own explanations.' Mr Davila was being treated as a 'human being as befits any other person'. He had daily visits from his lawyer as well as a medical practitioner and was in good health, Mr Benquis said. The judge did not rule out the possible interrogation of other former Codelco executives, eight of whom resigned after the losses became public.</p>

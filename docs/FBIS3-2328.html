It is learned that the nuclear plant will house six 600,000-  kilowatt nuclear power units, and that upon completion, it will  become a key point for electric networks in central and eastern  China.    At present, the Ministry of Power Industry has officially  confirmed and approved this nuclear power project and  preliminary stage preparatory work is already underway. Upon  completion, the nuclear plant will be able to thoroughly resolve  the electricity shortage of Jiangxi province.    At present, China already has the Qinshan Nuclear Plant in  Zhejiang and the Daya Bay Nuclear Plant in Guangdong.

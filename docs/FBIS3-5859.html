Despite the absence  of these issues on the agenda of the forthcoming spring session  of the parliament, the Standing Committee recognized as  expedient submitting of them to the session for consideration.  As the newspaper notes, the necessity of working out of a  conception of the state policy on protection of the total live-  stock of the country proceeds from reduction of its number as  compared with 1990, although in these years export of meat has  reduced by several times.

In an interview with the newspaper correspondent the State  Great Hural member D. Demberel, who has been recently to Germany  at the invitation of the Finance Committee of Bundestag, noting  that in this country a great importance is attached to  independence of the Bundesbank, he says that Germany understands  Mongolia's peculiarities and her economic difficulties. In D.  Demberet's view, Germany can serve as one of the basic supports  in strengthening of cooperation of Mongolia with Europarliament  and the European Union.    The newspaper informs that the Ministry of Demographic  Policy  and Labour has approved the order of involvement of citizens in  labour activity in the course of part-time work, a week or  according to agreements with an immediate payment. The order is  directed to the growth of labour employment and incomes of the  population, reduction of unemployment.    The newspaper publishes an article by journalist B. Baabar.  He points out to inevitability of economic independence of the  country on the two neighbouring powers.

The newspaper of the Mongolian National Democratic Party  [MNDP] "ERH CHOLOO" informs that the MNDP leader D. Ganbold has  left for the FRG on a visit on the line of the K. Edenauer Fund.  D.

Terguun writes in the newspaper that the  country's vital interests are connected with the use of oil  resources. The author of the article notes that an unexpected  interest of Russia and China in Mongolia's oil resources first  of all is indicative not of economic interest, but of political  accounts. As B. Terguun considers, the President P. Ochirbat  should take into his own hands Mongolia's policy in the sphere  of oil.    Quoting the publication in the Third Volume of Selected  Works  by Deng Xiaoping his talks with the Soviet Leader of that time  M. S.

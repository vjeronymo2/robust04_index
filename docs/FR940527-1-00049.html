Other Wage-Related Costs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A hospital may be able to report an additional wage-related cost that does not appear on the core list if it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meets the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The wage-related cost is provided at a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial cost to the employer. To meet this test the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual wage-related cost must be greater than 1 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of total salaries after the direct excluded salaries are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed (Column 3, line 3 on Worksheet S&hyph;3, Part II).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Any wage-related cost that would be a fringe benefit if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported to the IRS as a fringe benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The wage-related cost has not been furnished for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convenience of the provider.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note that those wage-related costs that are required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be reported to the IRS as salary (for example, loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forgiveness and sick pay accruals) would not be included as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other wage-related costs, since the costs associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these items are considered salaries and would already be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the total salaries reported on line 1.01 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Worksheet S&hyph;3, Part II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Wage-Related Costs (Excluded Area). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wage-related costs associated with employees in areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the hospital that are excluded from the data used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculate the wage index (such as a hospital-based SNF)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be removed from the total wage-related costs. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not a new policy; however, to ensure that hospitals are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removing these costs, we have added a new line on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Worksheet S&hyph;3, Part II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the above changes, we are proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, beginning on or after October 1, 1994, hospitals use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing the wage-related costs contained in the Worksheet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> S&hyph;3, Part II, for purposes of the hospital wage index. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all other purposes, however, Medicare principles will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to apply in determining the allowability of fringe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit costs. The MTAG task force recommended application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of GAAP for purposes of developing wage-related costs used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to construct the hospital wage index. We believe it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to apply GAAP for these purposes because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function of the wage index is to measure  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> relative <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor costs across areas. This function is distinct from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that of cost reimbursement, in which applicable Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles (which may differ from GAAP) measure the actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs incurred by individual hospitals. We believe the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of GAAP for purposes of compiling data on wage-related costs used to construct the wage index will more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accurately reflect relative labor costs, because certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage-related costs (such as pension costs) as recorded under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GAAP tend to be more static from year to year. Application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Medicare principles, on the other hand, could create  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large swings in these costs from year to year, particularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in years when there are large over- or under-funded pension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates; such application might lead to a wage index that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not accurately reflect relative labor costs. Again, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emphasize that under this proposal, GAAP will apply  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> only <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of developing wage-related costs on Worksheet S&hyph;3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part II. Our policy requiring the use of applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare principles for determining fringe benefits for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other purposes remains unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised cost report and the HCFA&hyph;339 forms are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently being evaluated by the Office of Management and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Budget. Once these forms are approved, we propose to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement the form to collect wage data for any cost report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning on or after October 1, 1994. However, we will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue subsequent revisions to the forms and instructions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect any changes incorporated in the final rule based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Revisions to the Wage Index Based on Hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Redesignation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act, hospitals in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain rural counties adjacent to one or more Metropolitan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statistical Areas (MSAs) are considered to be located in one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the adjacent MSAs if certain standards are met. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1886(d)(10) of the Act, the Medicare Geographic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Classification Review Board (MGCRB) considers applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by hospitals for geographic reclassification for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment under the prospective payment system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

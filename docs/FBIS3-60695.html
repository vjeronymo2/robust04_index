He discussed the possibility that over 10 countries have  such  weapons and that there is a danger the number could increase,  creating instability in various regions.    The United States is trying hard to apply this policy in  many  places. The world is currently witnessing an escalation between  the first power in the world and North Korea. This escalation  has reached the level of threats of war or threats to wage  abortive attacks if Pyongyang does not adhere to the agreement  on placing nuclear weapons under international supervision. We  also notice a strict tone when U.S. officials discuss the  nuclear capacities of countries such as Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq  as well as their special abilities to produce weapons of mass  destruction.    Often, U.S. officials shy away from answering questions on  Israeli nuclear power and its effect on stability in the region.  A few days ago, State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry said  he needs preparation to answer such a question.    In a news conference at the U.S. embassy in Cairo, Frank  Wisner, undersecretary of defense for policy, said, concluding  his recent visit to Egypt, that there is a confusion of  positions when North Korea's nuclear power and Israel's nuclear  force are discussed. His only justification for this confusion  was that Israel has not signed the nonproliferation treaty and  that North Korea is threatening its neighbors.    The atmosphere of peace into which the region is moving  badly  needs this nuclear contradiction or policy of double standards  applied in one area and forgotten in another to end.  Washington needs to take effective measures and work together  with countries in the region to rid them of the nightmare of  total annihilation. Egypt, on an initiative by President Husni  Mubarak to rid the region of weapons of mass destruction, was at  the front of this field. The United States needs to adopt such  constructive initiatives for peace to reign in the world of the  new order.</p>

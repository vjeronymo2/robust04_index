			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Stephen Alderman, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary staff] </F>   [Text] Britain is pressing for a "rapid and united"  response from NATO to a request from United Nations Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for more help in Bosnia, the prime  minister told the Commons today.    NATO "should help" the UN to give stronger protection to the  UN-designated safe areas, Mr. Major said at question time.    He insisted that, while keeping the objective of a  negotiated  settlement in view, attacks on UN troops or the safe areas "will  meet with a strong response."    The prime minister was replying to Tory John Ward (Poole),  who pressed him to "condemn unreservedly" continuing Serb  attacks on Gorazde and called for "more effective action by NATO  and the UN" to protect the safe areas.    Mr. Major replied that Mr. Ward spoke for most people in the  UK.    He added: "These attacks have rightly been condemned by  European, Russian and American leaders alike. NATO should help  the UN to give stronger protection to the safe areas and I hope  that the additional troops committed to the UN Protection Force  and the necessary funds will be made available as soon as  possible."    Mr. Major continued: "The UK is pressing for a rapid and  united NATO response to the secretary general's request for  further assistance that must, of course, be based on a thorough  military appraisal."    The Government would also be studying proposals made by  President Clinton last night, said the prime minister.    "But we must keep the objectives of a negotiated settlement  clearly in view while showing that attacks on UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] or safe areas will meet with a strong  response."</p>

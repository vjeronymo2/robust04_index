			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCCER TEAM TAKES A LOSING ATTITUDE  </P> <P> So the U.S. soccer team is 1,500 to 1, huh?  </P> <P> And we couldn't win even if we had Diego Maradona, according to Times writer  Randy Harvey?  </P> <P> And worst of all, the U.S. coach said, "We are dead ducks against Italy."?  </P> <P> Well, I say that people like the coach and reporter are the heart and soul  reason that soccer is where it is in the United States today. That kind of  negative thinking is about losing.  </P> <P> DAVE GONZALEZ, Bellflower  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Farouk Chothia] </F>   [Text] New Minister of Land Affairs Derek Hanekom has said  he favours the implementation of a land tax and will be setting  up a committee in the next two months to investigate its  feasibility. He said that although a land tax would not provide  a source of central state revenue, it would encourage farmers to  use land productively. "If they do well, the percentage of  income which goes to tax would go down. This would encourage  people to either produce more efficiently and increase their  income...or, if they can't do this, it will be an incentive for  them to sell or lease. Such a tax would provide revenue for  local government."    He conceded that although he personally favoured a land tax,  its benefits had to be weighed against administration costs and  resistance to it from farmers.    This weekend, the new minister and his department are to  hold  a workshop to identify key problems facing them and what  restructuring will be necessary to meet the challenges ahead.    An obvious one is managing the land reform process so that,  as Hanekom put is, "we succeed in meeting our objectives without  threatening farmers". The objectives, according to the RDP  [Reconstruction Development Plan], are to address land claims  resulting from apartheid dispossession and dating from 1913, and  to redistribute 30 percent of South Africa's productive land  within five years.    Hanekom has identified the land restitution leg of land  reform as a priority. He said his department already had 90  rural restitution cases which are not being handled by the  Commission on Land Allocation. They are dealing with these, and  others which are with the Commission and which can be resolved  through negotiation. Cases where there is no prospect of a  local solution will have to wait for the Land Claims Court.    He also wanted his department to take responsibility for the  rural development aspects of the RDP and to link this to  restitution cases for the rest of 1994. "The RDP won't  immediately be able to deliver mass basic services to rural  areas. But rural people who get back their land need basic  infrastructure such as water and roads."    Hanekom's department's current budget is R68-million [rand],  but he said he'll be asking for another R250-million to carry  out land reform for the 1994/1995 financial year.    A White Paper on Land Reform would come out early next year,  detailing the government's overall land reform programme.</p>

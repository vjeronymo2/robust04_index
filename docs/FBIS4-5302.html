			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 8 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The  representatives of the Mongolian Democratic Association (MDA)  have demanded a resignation of the government at the meeting  organized by the MDA at one of the central squares of the  capital.    Those speaking at the meeting including the leaders of the  MDA and people delegating the Social Democratic Party, the  Students Union as well as the unemployed and pensioners have  reminded the government all its promises concerning the  stabilization of the national economy within a two-year period  and criticized the policies being pursued by the government in  the spheres of foreign trade, social welfare of the population,  production and finance.    It was said that the abuses of official position are  acquiring a boundless character at any level of management. In  this connection some speakers stressed the significance of the  hearing of the issue on possible involvement of some leaders of  the parliament and government in corruption and abuses of  official position to be carried out as sooner as possible.    The chairman of the parliament and the prime minister  refused  to take part in the meeting though they had been invited to it  by the organizers of the meeting. The leaders of the MDA  explained their suggestion as striving to provide the leaders of  the country with possibilities to express their opinions and to  be associated with the common people.    When the meeting was over, its participants passed to the  main square of the capital named after D. Suhbaatar where those  who wanted could express their views from the "free rostrum"  arranged by the MDA.    The meeting was attended by not less than five-six [as  received] thousand people.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / After the US, the world / Examining the risky global ambitions of British Airways The Conquistadores del Cielo is an exclusive club of aviation industry heavyweights who meet twice a year in a Californian ranch to eat, drink and talk in an informal manner about business. But last week's gathering of the self-styled 'conquerors of the sky' was anything but relaxed. Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, and Mr Stephen Wolf, head of United Airlines, were reported to be lobbying other airline bosses, as well as aircraft and engine manufacturers, to put pressure on the US government to block the proposed Dollars 750m acquisition by British Airways of a 44 per cent stake in USAir, the sixth-largest American carrier. Political infighting has now reached a rare level of intensity on both sides of the Atlantic, as the US government prepares to approve or reject the BA-USAir deal. Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport minister, is flying to Washington next week for consultations with Mr Andrew Card, his American opposite number. Yesterday, Mr Card dashed the airlines' hope of a decision by September 19, and the decision could be delayed because of the political sensitivity of the issue in a US presidential election campaign. The stakes are high. Mr Lawrence Nagin, executive vice-president of United Airlines, describes the proposed BA-USAir deal as 'one of the rare defining moments' in aviation history. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and deputy chairman, says the combination with USAir would set BA 'well on the way to becoming probably the first truly global airline group'. This has long been BA's ambition. After failing during the past three years to link up first with United Airlines, then with Sabena of Belgium and more recently with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, the UK carrier has finally succeeded this year in negotiating a string of alliances and equity investments with other carriers in an effort to secure its longer-term future as one of the world's dominant airline groups. Apart from the USAir investment, BA is establishing a new Moscow-based international airline with Aeroflot, called Air Russia. It has acquired a 49 per cent stake in a small German carrier called Delta, which has since been renamed Deutsche BA to strengthen its position in the German market. It expects to complete next week the acquisition of a large minority stake in Transport Aerien Transregional (TAT), a French regional airline, which will enable BA to challenge Air France in its home market. 'The missing link is still the Far East,' concedes Lord King, BA's chairman. But BA is also hunting for partners in the Asia-Pacific market and has expressed interest in taking a stake in Qantas, the international carrier being privatised by the Australian government. Other airlines have also been scrambling to forge alliances, equity partnerships and close marketing ties with other carriers. The trend towards globalisation is not new. It is simply the strategic response of the industry to increasing deregulation, progressive privatisation of state carriers, the competitive necessity of the stronger airlines to expand, and the need of financially strapped airlines for fresh capital and partnerships to survive. Air France has acquired a large minority stake in Sabena and CSA of Czechoslovakia this year; Swissair, Singapore Airlines and Delta of the US have formed a trilateral alliance involving cross-equity stakes between the three carriers; KLM has a large stake in Northwest Airlines of the US; Air Canada and Canadian Airlines have just merged and are seeking to combine with the bankrupt Continental Airlines of the US, in which Scandinavian Airlines System had earlier bought a costly equity stake; and Lufthansa yesterday joined the fray by announcing it was considering a joint bid for Continetal with Mr Marvin Davis, the US financier. The process is expected to lead to significant concentration in the industry, with a few large airline groups dominating the international market. 'Ultimately, there will be, perhaps, no more than 10 or 12 global airline combines, perhaps fewer: three or four will evolve from the existing European industry, with similar numbers anchored in North America and the Far East-Pacific area,' Sir Colin predicts. But by aggressively challenging the big three US carriers - American, United and Delta - in their own market with the USAir deal, BA has turned the battle, which has been building up all year over the North Atlantic, into all-out war. The three see BA as their biggest threat, not only because of the UK carrier's financial and marketing strength but also because they feel BA continues to enjoy unfair advantages under the existing US-UK bilateral aviation agreement. This bilateral agreement, claims Mr Ron Allen, Delta's chairman, 'is one of the most restrictive in the world'. He says it grants BA more access to the US than any other airline, and severely restricts the rights of US carriers to compete in the UK market. While BA serves 18 destinations in the US, American carriers complain the aviation treaty limits the number of US airlines in the UK market as well as the number of seats they can offer. They argue the BA-USAir deal would worsen the competitive imbalance by creating an integrated airline network with European and US market access that could not be matched by any other US airline because of the restrictive bilateral agreement. In a joint policy document, the big three US passenger airlines and the two specialised American freight carriers, Federal Express and United Parcel Service, have urged their government to negotiate a new 'open skies' agreement with the UK and not place a 'for sale' sign on the US airline industry. 'This is not a question of British Airways acquiring a toehold in the lucrative US market, but a potential stranglehold over access to 55m USAir passengers and 200m freight tonne-kilometres of air cargo a year,' they claim. They further argue that the BA-USAir deal breaches US airline foreign ownership rules because the agreement would give BA 'substantial and effective control over virtually all business aspects of USAir'. BA scoffs at these charges. 'The fact is that the deal, meeting existing regulations, has no implications for the UK-US air services agreement whatsoever: rather, the boot is on the other foot,' Sir Colin says defiantly. Under the terms of the deal, BA would secure a 44 per cent stake and 21 per cent of the voting rights in USAir, complying with current US rules limiting foreign ownership in airlines to 25 per cent of voting rights. Moreover, Sir Colin argues that if US carriers want to table new demands from Britain they should provide commensurate concessions for UK airlines, including the relaxation of restrictive ownership rules. The UK has also complained that US carriers have long enjoyed advantages denied to their international competitors by continuing to dominate their domestic market with large hub and spoke networks. While BA controls 39 per cent of take-off and landing slots at London's Heathrow airport, American controls 65 per cent of slots at Dallas; United 68 per cent at Washington National and 48 per cent at Chicago; and Delta 70 per cent at Atlanta. Two years ago, the UK also scrapped traffic restrictions at Heathrow, allowing American and United to replace the now defunct Pan American and the struggling TWA at London's biggest airport and BA's traditional home base. The North Atlantic has traditionally been a big money earner for BA. Even in a depressed market savaged by a ferocious fares war, America contributed Pounds 119m of BA's Pounds 344m operating profits for the year ended March 1992. By comparison, Europe made only Pounds 20m. But there are also risks. Although the USAir investment, involving Dollars 750m of preferred stock carrying an annual dividend of 7 per cent, gives BA some financial protection, it is still paying Dollars 750m for 44 per cent of a company currently valued at about Dollars 600m. It is also betting on a recovery of the US market in which USAir, revitalised through the BA partnership, would be in a stronger position to compete against the big three US carriers. But so far there is little sign of that recovery. 'The situation has reached the point of absurdity in the US where the fare war is taking on an air of collective suicide,' says Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France, which has marketing links with USAir. American Airlines, the world's largest carrier, sparked off the latest conflict this year by reducing domestic fares by close to 40 per cent. 'Last year, American lost Dollars 240m. . . Small matter, for what counts is killing the others,' adds Mr Attali. A bigger risk for BA is over the north Atlantic itself. A liberalisation of the existing bilateral US-UK aviation treaty could undermine the airline's strong profitability on these routes. The US airlines and their government are pressing European countries to negotiate new 'open skies' agreements similar to the deal negotiated with the Netherlands last week. But large European carriers fear this could turn the North Atlantic market into a free-for-all similar to that which has shaken the deregulated US market in the past 10 years. To secure US approval for the BA-USAir transaction, the UK is expected to make some concessions next week to give US carriers more access to the UK market, but it is unlikely to link directly any concession with the BA deal. The question is whether these concessions will be big enough to satisfy the US carriers' appetite for expansion into the UK and Europe. Mr Crandall of American has already drawn up an extensive shopping list: better access to slots at Heathrow; new US destinations to London; allowing US carriers as many routes out of Heathrow as UK carriers have; unlimited access to secondary UK cities; more liberal capacity and fares controls; rights to fly beyond the UK to other European destinations. Unless the US carriers can secure all or most of these rights, Mr Allen of Delta argues that US government approval of the BA-USAir deal would be 'tantamount to the USA declaring unilateral economic disarmament'. Such a reaction, says Sir Colin, only serves to reassure him that BA's agreement with USAir is 'a good one'. Whatever the outcome of the current US-UK negotiations, BA's move on USAir has already triggered a process likely to lead to fundamental change in the airline business and the way aviation is regulated. 'The transaction holds the prospect of making enormous inroads in the protectionist thinking that still pervades much of the international aviation regime, and could well be the lever with which to open Europe and the US to a free competitive environment,' says Mr Nagin of United. It could turn the Conquistadores del Cielo into an original script for a Spielberg blockbuster.</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (7): Debate continues - Corporate regulation THE entrepreneurial boom which took place in Australia in the 1980s long ago petered out into corporate bankruptcies, recession, and a rash of criminal charges and civil litigation against many of the key businessmen involved. Opinions differ about the long-term effect on the mainstream business sector. Mr Tony Hartnell, the outgoing chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, the corporate watchdog, thinks it was severe. 'The entrepreneurs have had three long-term effects,' he says. 'They have put up the cost of capital for Australian businesses; destroyed some of the pioneering spirit which existed here; and ensured that Australia has fallen further down the list of asset allocation priorities for overseas investors.' Sir Eric Neal, president of the Institute of Company Directors, says the entrepreneurs did less damage than many observers think. 'I used to think. . . that Australia's reputation would be damaged irreparably in the rest of the world,' he says. 'But when I read about the Blue Arrow case in the UK, and about Salomon Brothers and the savings and loan institutions in the US, I realise that there are problems in all western countries. 'Without in any way condoning or expressing anything other than concern about what was happening in Australia, it was not too different from what was happening in the UK and the US.' Nevertheless, Australia has taken seriously the widespread criticism that its corporate regulatory arrangements were unequal to the task of restraining both unethical activity and criminal behaviour. The most obvious breakthrough was the establishment of the ASC last year, after the federal government finally persuaded the states to give up their rights to supervise corporate activity. Not only did the agreement allow the federal government to replace the six state-based regulators with a single federal watchdog, it also provided for an increase in funds from ADollars 7m to ADollars 125m. The commission is carrying out some 1,300 separate investigations and has produced lengthy reports to the Director of Public Prosecutions on 15 leading companies. In addition, criminal charges have been brought or recommended against several well-known businessmen. To some extent, the establishment of the ASC represented a shutting of the corporate stable door after the entrepreneurial horse had bolted. However, the debate over the right corporate framework is far from over, and several key issues remain to be settled: Has the establishment of the ASC filled the gap in corporate law enforcement, or has it merely papered over the cracks? The Business Council of Australia (BCA), which represents most big companies, is one of many lobby groups which believe the ASC's present role as both commercial regulator and criminal investigator is unsustainable in the long term. The BCA has called for the establishment of a separate corporate crime authority, along the lines of Britain's serious fraud office, to allow the ASC to concentrate on corporate regulation. This suggestion is in line with the approach taken by Mr Hartnell during the ASC's first year. However, Mr Michael Duffy, the federal attorney-general, recently directed the commission to give more priority to criminal investigations. The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) has instituted a system of continuous reporting which requires the market to be kept fully informed about issues or proposals affecting listed companies. This continuous disclosure regime is to be given the force of law through federal legislation giving the ASC a formal supervisory role. Both the ASX and a government advisory committee concluded that mandatory quarterly reporting, the disclosure system adopted in the US, was not necessary at this stage except for mining companies, which already report quarterly. But many observers remain convinced that quarterly reporting is the only reliable method of ensuring that markets are fully informed. However, the most serious issue yet to be resolved is whether the corporations law needs to be rewritten. The BCA, the Institute of Company Directors and the Law Council of Australia have all called for a fresh approach to the law to make it simpler and more relevant to modern business conditions. The argument is that the Corporations Act, which draws together more than a century of corporate law-making, is unnecessarily complex, full of loopholes, and fails to address issues such as the role of professional managers and institutional shareholders in a modern company. Corporate law experts say the legislation is one of the most complicated regulatory regimes in the advanced countries. The pressure for a comprehensive revision of corporate law has had some effect on lawmakers, notably on the parliamentary joint committee on corporations and securities, which has pressed the government to consider redrafting and modernising the existing legislation. However, Mr Duffy has indicated that he prefers to revise the law on a piecemeal basis - the approach taken by the government in devising new regulations to govern the relationship between directors and companies, known as the related party transaction amendments. Mr Duffy's office also believes that a total redrafting of all 1,300 sections of the corporations law would open up so many issues that it could take five years or more to complete. This proposition is contested by Professor John Farrar, a Melbourne University expert on corporate regulation who helped design a relatively simple corporate code for New Zealand, which suffered from a similar problem. Professor Farrar says a comprehensive revision of the law could be carried out fairly quickly provided the government had a clear idea of its policy objectives. The simplest approach would be to adopt the New Zealand code, which would also help bring Australian and New Zealand corporate law into line, as required by the agreement on closer economic relations between the two countries. 'The NZ code has a great deal of intrinsic merit,' says Professor Farrar. 'It draws heavily on the North American model, which is the best model around, and it innovates in a very original way. It makes the law comprehensible to the intelligent businessman, and that gives you a head start if you want an effective corporate regulation regime.'</p>

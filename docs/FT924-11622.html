			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / IBM-led group wins Pounds 130m contract A CONSORTIUM led by International Business Machines and including Siemens Plessey Radar and the Logica computing services company has won a Pounds 130m contract to equip the new air traffic control centre being built at Fareham, Hampshire, Alan Cane writes. The Pounds 350m centre will manage traffic passing over England and Wales. It is expected to become operational in 1996. The contract is part of a Pounds 750m capital programme being undertaken by the Civil Aviation Authority to improve and modernise Britain's air traffic control system. The IBM team, which included EDS-Scicon and Frequentis, won the contract against a consortium led by Thomson-CSF of France. British consortia led by GEC and Dowty Command and Control Systems were eliminated late last year, fuelling worries over the ability of UK electronics groups to win large systems projects.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (21): Boxes and pipes are the stuff of a revolution - Telecommunications, computer and media industries Old hands in the communications business have been experiencing a sharp sense of deja vu over the past few months. Telecommunications, computer and media companies have been striking deals and forming alliances suggesting that the long-anticipated phenomenon of convergence may be at hand. Convergence implies the coming together of communications channels and data processing capabilities to provide services ranging from information to entertainment and shopping, to the office and the home. At the heart of the business is the fact that information of every kind  - text, moving pictures, sound and graphics - can be converted to binary digits, transmitted over telecommunications lines and manipulated by computer. These days people are using the term multimedia to describe convergence but some would argue that nothing seems to have changed since the 1970s when online information services for the mass market were pioneered with no great success. Examples include home banking in the US and viewdata in the UK. What is different today? Costs have come down appreciably, technologies have improved and matured and the regulatory environment favours the introduction of innovative services in the US and, increasingly, Europe and the rest of the world. The components of the multimedia revolution are the 'boxes', the computers which process the data, the 'pipes', the telecommunications channels into the home and office, and the 'stuff', the media content. While most attention has so far been focused on expensive deals involving content providers, most leading computer hardware and software companies have been experimenting with elements of multimedia. Oracle Corporation, for example, the world's third largest software company with revenues of Dollars 1.3bn in 1993, announced an alliance with Bell Atlantic, a US regional television company, to offer commercial interactive television services in the US. Oracle is a specialist in database management; this year it announced the Oracle Media Server, a technology that expands Oracle's management of information to audio, video, text and images. The plan is to use this software to manage thousands of films for 'video-on-demand' as well as home shopping and information services. The software can be run on a variety of computers. For the Bell Atlantic collaboration, a supercomputer, a massively parallel system developed by the Californian company nCube will be used. Other companies have taken somewhat similar approaches. International Business Machines, Digital Equipment, and Hewlett Packard have all developed systems which are being used in interactive television trials. IBM, for example, is working with Andersen Consulting and Ameritech, one of the seven US regional Bell telecoms operators, on a trial in Chicago which will offer home shopping, electronic magazines and training. The system is based around one of IBM's largest mainframes. The US computer giant has one of the longest lists of industrial partners in multimedia. It includes Sony for mini-disk titles, PictureTel and British Telcom for desktop videoconferencing systems, Muze for multimedia kiosks and Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation for digital entertainments. Microsoft, the world's largest software company, has a distinctly different approach. It launched in May this year software it calls 'Tiger'. Tiger is the result of collaboration with Compaq, the personal computer maker, and Intel, the semiconductor manufacturer. The essence of Tiger, according to Microsoft, is that it can provide multimedia suppliers with the 'boxes' at a fraction of the cost of systems from other developers. The Tiger software runs on inexpensive microcomputers such as Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium microprocessor. Microsoft has alliances with TCI, the US cable television company, and NTT, the Japanese telecommunications group, for multimedia trials in the US planned for the end of this year. However, it is important to get the pace of convergence in perspective. A brief glance at the telecoms sector shows that most recent corporate activity - and expenditure on alliances and joint ventures - has been expended on promoting or defending against competition in core telecoms services. In the US, most of the successful big alliances of the past year have been of this kind. The Dollars 13bn take-over of McCaw Cellular Communications by AT&amp;T, for instance, amounts to the swallowing-up of one phone company by another. In this case the 'convergence' at stake is within the industry - ie the coming together of fixed-wire and cellular telephony services. By contrast, several large cross-media deals have collapsed in the past year  -once the partners got to know more about each other's business. In April, Southwestern Bell, a Baby Bell, abandoned plans to form a Dollars 4.9bn cable television partnership with Cox Enterprises, the privately-owned media group. That came shortly after the spectacular collapse of the Dollars 22bn proposed merger of Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable company, and Bell Atlantic, the Philadelphia-based Baby Bell. There is a growing belief among analysts that tie-ups between the telecoms and cable/entertainment/computing industries are going to proceed much more slowly than envisaged a year ago. Even successful cross-media alliances are not always all that they seem. The decision by US West, another Baby Bell telecoms company, to take a 25.5 per cent stake in Time Warner Entertainment, for instance, was motivated by its desire to offer telephony services over Time Warner's cable networks. Says Mr Chuck Lillis, US West's chief planning officer: 'The Time Warner deal is essentially about giving us more networks. Of course, they've also got the best studios in the country, and the longer you go out in time, the more it is about having access to their programming and products.' The building of fibre-optic superhighways opens up the market for interactive multimedia services as never before. Analysts debate the timescale, but the destination is now increasingly clear. The key question is whether telecoms companies become providers of services, or simply utility-style managers of networks. The telecoms companies dearly want to be providers, perceiving utility network management to be a low margin, unexciting business. Their problem is that they know little about the new types of services, and have difficulty justifying mega-alliances on present revenue projections. Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of British Telecommunications, frankly confesses that BT has 'serious thinking' to do in this area. BT decided to steer clear of home banking - 'a close call' - and has left banks themselves to provide home telephone banking services, such as First Direct, without itself competing in the market. The next few years are set to pose a series of close calls, the outcome of which will determine whether convergence predominantly involves technologies and services, or comes to herald massive industrial restructuring.</p>

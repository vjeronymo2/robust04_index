			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Shake-up at Royal Mail is completed ROYAL MAIL, the letters arm of the Post Office, yesterday put in place the final pieces of a reorganisation which has cut management and administrative staff by 3,500 and forced a further 9,000 managers to reapply for their jobs. The number of reporting levels between the managing director and the postal worker delivering letters has been cut from nine to six. Headquarters staff have been reduced from about 2,000 to 160. The shake-up will result in annual savings of Pounds 60m to Pounds 70m. Royal Mail says the savings are a 'secondary spin-off', however, and the main purpose of the restructuring is to 'sharpen focus on the customer' by devolving functions and responsibilities to a local level. The UK's 64 former district head postmasters, for example, were replaced yesterday by 88 area managers who are responsible for local customer relations. Nine divisions, each with average turnover of Pounds 300m, have replaced four territories and 64 districts. Each division is responsible - 'without excessive control from headquarters' - for sales, profit-and-loss and local customer relations. The shedding of management jobs has been completed without compulsory redundancies. The top 1,000 managers have been through an assessment programme run by Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy and management consultancy firm. The rest have been assessed at the Post Office's own management college at Rugby. Some have been demoted without loss of pay while others have needed training. Districts under the old structure had operating budgets, but were not expected to generate revenue. Divisional directors and general managers are now 'empowered to create profit', says Royal Mail. That could be done by tailoring new services for local markets and by selling expertise and innovations to the Post Office's other divisions.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE LUTHERAN BEATS CANTWELL, 27-14  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran High School defeated Cantwell, 27-14, in a first-round Division  IX playoff game Friday night at Santa Ana Stadium.  </P> <P> The Lancers advance to a second-round game against Tehachapi.  </P> <P> Cantwell quarterback Jimmy Cortinas passed for 105 yards and two touchdowns in  one quarter before being injured in the second quarter.  </P> <P> At first, Cortinas' passing was a nightmare for Orange Lutheran (9-2). He threw  a 45-yard scoring pass to Danny Alsala for Cantwell's first touchdown.  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran tied the score on Lenny Gavin's quarterback sneak, but the  Cardinals wasted no time coming back.  </P> <P> Cortinas again went to his wide receivers, passing 48 yards to Matt Asato to  help put Cantwell ahead, 14-7.  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran soon turned to a running game. Behind strong blocks, Gavin  scrambled 54 yards for the longest touchdown of the game.  </P> <P> Less than a minute later, the Cardinals fumbled on their own 25, and Lancer  lineman Brad Darling scooped up the ball and ran it in, putting Orange Lutheran  in front, 21-14.  </P> <P> In the third quarter, another Cantwell fumble put the Lancers in position to  score. Running back Brandon Orman, who had 48 yards on eight carries, broke two  tackles and went 25 yards for Orange Lutheran's final touchdown. MARGIE LUCK  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the </F> Bundestag in Bonn -- live]    [Text] Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. Let me first  draw your attention to the fact that we have agreed with the  parliamentary groups that we will have a detailed debate on the  objectives of Germany's European Union [EU] presidency here on  29 June. This means that my government statement today will not  concentrate on that topic.    Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in just over two  weeks, on 12 June, voters in the 12 EU member states will elect  the new European Parliament, which will then be in office from  1994 to 1999. These will be years full of dramatic changes,  years that will bring decisive steps forward for the EU. This  year's European Parliament election is of special importance,  because the European Parliament has been given numerous new  rights and additional powers under the Maastricht Treaty. In my  report following the Maastricht negotiations I pointed out that  we, the Federal Government, would have liked to extend the  rights and strengthened the powers of the European Parliament  even further. But during the negotiations on the Maastricht  Treaty our position did not win a majority. I would, however,  like to point out that we continue to aim at an expansion of the  European Parliament's powers, particularly in view of the 1996  conference. [applause]    I am confident, together with you, that Austria, Sweden,  Finland, and Norway will very soon join the EU as new members,  after the necessary referenda have been held in these countries.  And they will then also be represented in the European  Parliament. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this  opportunity, also in view of the enlargement negotiations, to  thank the foreign minister very much for his enormous efforts  during these talks. [applause] There have been one or two  critical voices abroad, saying that the Germans were trying too  intensely to achieve the admission of these countries. I think  it is in line with our common policy that we wanted enlargement,  and it is right that the foreign minister also made exceptional  efforts on behalf of the Federal Government and myself.  [applause] Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.... I do not  know, you can applaud here, the enlargement is also in your  interest.... I do not think that party politics can go so far  as to obscure everything that is sensible here. [applause] I  think you have a lot to catch up with regarding applause for  colleague Kinkel. You can make up for that today. [applause]    Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; several days ago, on  8 May, we remembered the end of World War II 49 years ago. At  that time, Europe was in ruins, and the situation of the people  in Germany was desperate. For many, it seemed to be hopeless.  Those who experienced that time know how much we have achieved  since then in Germany. Seen this way, the progress we have made  on the road to European unity is a great success. The vision of  the best people in Europe is about to materialize. One cannot  stress clearly enough that the consistent continuation of this  policy of European integration is of crucial importance.  [applause]    There is no responsible alternative to the policy of  European  integration. This insight has decisively marked the policy of  all federal governments under Konrad Adenauer, Ludwig Erhard,  Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Willy Brandt, and Helmut Schmidt. The  goal of firmly anchoring Germany in the process of European  unification has determined the actions of all democratic parties  in Germany since the war, and I am quite sure that this will  remain so. [applause]    Anchoring the Federal Republic of Germany in the European  Community was the decisive basis for the restoration of German  unity in peace and freedom with the consent of all our  neighbors. Without this policy in the decades preceding  1989-90, our European neighbors would never have agreed to  German unity. [applause]    In 1950 Konrad Adenauer said that a reunited Germany would  not have lasting peace, if it were not firmly anchored in a  united Europe.    Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; peace and freedom are  not a foregone conclusion, and we have seen that they must be  ensured anew every day. European unity is the most effective  insurance against the reemergence of nationalism, chauvinism,  and racism, including in our part of the continent. Seen this  way, the success of the process of European integration is in  the final analysis a matter of war and peace. It is the  decisive prerequisite for peace and freedom also of the Germans  in the 21st century.    We have all seen the terrible pictures from the territory of  the former Yugoslavia. In this conflict in the former  Yugoslavia, we have seen that the limits of possible options  regarding the prevention and solution of crises have been  brutally revealed. For two years now, we have seen these  pictures every day. To a high degree, the credibility of  European democracies is at stake, and in many countries,  including Germany, efforts to end the conflict will not be  considered sufficient.    I can only say that, if what we have started in Maastricht  --  which is not nearly completed -- had been possible much earlier,  we would have had much better opportunities to meet European  responsibility in this respect, too. In view of these terrible  pictures in the region, many people, including in Germany, are  asking themselves why the European Union and NATO are not doing  much more to end the conflict. I think we all understand these  questions. However, we should remember how much this civil war  is marked by hatred and irrationality -- hatred that has partly  developed over the centuries.    We must stress here that the international community must  again and again make every effort, even in almost hopeless  situations, to bring about a comprehensive peace solution. Such  efforts have been increased in recent weeks and months. There  are no ready formulas for solving this conflict, but I think  there are the beginnings of better hopes that a solution can be  brought about.    However, ladies and gentlemen, we Germans should be  particularly careful regarding advice to others. We do not have  the moral right to demand that responsible politicians in other  countries should do more than we ourselves can do and are ready  to do. [applause]    Rather, we should make use of every opportunity to show our  respect and sympathy to other nations' young soldiers, who risk  their lives there, and their relatives. [applause]    Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; when I took over as  federal chancellor in October 1982, the slogan of Eurosclerosis  was the most used term in connection with European policy. Who  would have thought at that time, following the unsuccessful  Copenhagen summit in December 1982, that despite all the  difficulties and many imponderables, Europe would make a  decisive step forward 11 years later when the Maastricht Treaty  went into effect.    Let us remember: Since those days, the European Community  has undergone an unprecedented, successful development --  ranging from the solemn declaration of Stuttgart, to European  Union in July 1983, the accession of Spain and Portugal on 1  January 1986, the Single European Act, the single market  program, and the Maastricht Treaty.    It was 11 years in which we gradually came closer to  European unification. Germany and France, France and Germany  have made a decisive contribution to this success story. With  numerous joint initiatives, President Francois Mitterrand and I  tried again and again to move Europe forward. We did not do it  because of the idea we are sometimes accused of having, that is,  that we want to advance others by hegemonic thinking; we did it  because of the special and historical responsibility for the  development of Europe that the French and Germans, of course,  have to point out again and again. [applause]    I think that France and Germany have reason to be proud of  these opportunities that we have made use of. Looking back at  these years, I am pleased to take this opportunity to thank  Hans-Dietrich Genscher for his personal contribution to the  process of European unification. [applause]    Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; Europe is also  essential for the future development of the German economy.  European unification has had a decisive impact on the upswing  of the German economy in these decades. European unification  has made a key contribution to employment, growth, prosperity,  and the inner stability of Germany. I want to cite a few  figures to illustrate this. In 1957 German exports valued at 14  billion German marks [DM] went to the 12 countries of today's  EU. Last year, our exports to Europe were worth about DM300  billion. With more than 370 million people, the future Europe  of the 16 will be one of the most important economic areas of  the world, in addition to NAFTA with 360 millions and the ASEAN  area. One has to realize what this development means for the  future of Germany in detail. Millions of jobs in Germany depend  on our exports to the EU. Economically, we Germans benefit  greatly from the EU. With a view to the present 12, one can say  that we benefit most from the EU. It is clear that we have  reached the upper limit of what we can pay to the EU. It it  right that we, as economically the strongest country, pay most  because we benefit most. However, it is also true that the  future financing concept in the Community has to be oriented far  more on per capita income of the individual countries. It is  our objective that other member states with a comparable per  capita income assume more financial responsibility than in the  past. [applause]    Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; the mark is the most  important currency in Europe. In the past decade, it developed  into an anchor of stability in monetary policies. The stability  of the mark is a great good for the Germans. The experience of  our people in two periods of hyperinflation in this century,  with the loss of capital assets and the profound deformation of  the social structure of our country, has made it clear that a  stable currency is always and above all a guarantee for  political stability. Therefore, our course continues to be  aimed at the stability of the mark. [applause]    I believe we have every reason to be happy today when we  take  note of the information that the rate of inflation has fallen to  2.9 percent, that is below 3 percent. [applause]    In the Maastricht Treaty we succeed in having it accepted  that the future European Central Bank will virtually correspond  to the model of the German Bundesbank. This means that there  will only be a joint European currency if it is as stable and of  the same quality as the mark. We will stick to the criteria  agreed in the Maastricht Treaty for the third stage of Economic  and Monetary Union without any ifs and buts. I would like to  repeat it once more [applause], we by no means want to postpone  dates. Realistically, however, I have to say once again that  the order must be that the stability criteria come first and the  question of the calendar come second. This must be clearly said.  [applause]    The decision in favor of Frankfurt/Main as the seat of the  future European Central Bank is a mark of the confidence of our  partners and friends in Europe, also for our stability policy.  It is a great success, and it is a sign of everyday life in  Germany that this important decision is only taken note of to a  limited extent.    This decision means that in a few years, or decades, in the  next century, Frankfurt will be the third great international  financial center beside New York and Tokyo. Anyone who  considers this can work out what this means for the German  economy. [applause]    Ladies and gentlemen, in domestic and legal policy we can no  longer solve the problems that we are facing on a national level  alone. Although many people still do not want to believe this,  we need even closer cooperation with our European neighbors.  You will know that the Federal Government would have liked to  go beyond what we achieved in these questions at the Maastricht  negotiations. Back then, we did not succeed in this because of  our partners' resistance. I am sure that now that a few years  have passed since the signing of the Maastricht Treaty and that  the signals and problems are emerging everywhere, the chances  are becoming much better for including these problems to a  greater extent. I hope very much -- and this will be our aim --  that 1996 will bring more comprehensive agreements.    What is of very great importance for our domestic security  is  closer European cooperation in fighting the drugs mafia,  organized crime, and illegal arms trading. The Maastricht  Treaty and the Schengen Agreement contain the first solutions,  on which we will have to base our future efforts. Ladies and  gentlemen, a few weeks ago there was a news item going around  the world. It said that the experts expect $250 billion, yes  billion, in dirty money from such dealings to come into Europe  this year. No one should think that we will be able to tackle  this problem with the traditional ways of cooperating in Europe.  This is in no way a criticism of our own police authorities.  It is a completely new challenge to which we will have to find  the right answer. [applause]    The opening of borders, which we are all trying to achieve,  must not lead to giving international crime more room to act.  Let me, therefore, repeat once again that the establishing of a  European police authority, Europol, is long overdue. It could  be similar to an authority such as the Federal Office of  Criminal Investigation in our country. We will do everything  that we can to improve agreement in this respect.    What is also important for us and for everyone else in  Europe  is that we work out a common asylum policy. We want to  distribute the burdens more evenly, as we in Germany are  currently taking on the main influx of refugees and  asylum-seekers. It is in our very own interest that we are  surrounded by stable and sound economies in Central and East  Europe. That is why we will consistently expand the European  Union's relations with the states of Central, East, and  southeastern Europe. At the suggestion of the Federal  Government, we promised them clear prospects of membership at  the European Council in Copenhagen. These will now have to be  realized step by step. Nice words are not enough in this  respect. We must offer these countries opportunities, even if  it may be difficult for some people here to familiarize  themselves with this idea. We have to offer them the  opportunity to sell their products on our markets, our EU  markets, under fair conditions. [applause] This also includes  direct assistance. The FRG has been supporting the young  democracies in Central and East Europe with enormous amounts  both on a bilateral level, and within the European Union and the  G-24. We took on our responsibility at an early stage and have  made by far the greatest contribution of all the G-7 states  toward the Central, East, and southeastern European reform  process. Our bilateral contributions and promises to the  successor states of the former Soviet Union had amounted to just  under DM90 billion by the end of last year. Another DM37  billion has been allocated to the states of Central, East, and  southeastern Europe. And this does not include the enormous  sums that we have paid via international organizations, the EU,  and the G-24. Ladies and gentlemen, let me take this  opportunity to point out once again that we have now reached the  limit of our capacity.    Others who are able to do so should now commit themselves  financially to a larger degree. [applause] We are aware that  what we are doing can only be help for self-help. Economic aid,  credits, advice alone cannot lead to success. No one can take  over responsibility from these countries and successfully  complete the reforms they have started.    In this context, I stress that the Federal Government has  always emphatically pointed out the insufficient safety of  nuclear power plants in some Central and East European  countries. The measures that have been taken are not  sufficient, and I am not satisfied at all with the way this  matter is being dealt with, and at the European Council meeting  in Korfu and at the World Economic Summit in Naples, I will  therefore once again urge a solution to these problems.  [applause]    But, ladies and gentlemen, in view of criticism voiced in  our  country, we must also say that every reasonable help for  self-help is also a chance for a happy future of Germany. If  the reforms in Russia fail -- to mention just an example -- and  if this large country, our most important neighbor in the East,  were to relapse into old structures, no matter whether they are  communist structures or a military dictatorship, the  consequences would cost the West, including Germany, much more.  We do not want to deploy missiles again, we want there to be  peace and freedom everywhere in these regions. [applause]    Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; the European economy,  including in Germany, has passed through a far-reaching  recession and structural crisis. We in Germany are also  suffering from the consequences of this cyclical slow-down.  Fortunately, the orders received and many other indicators show  that we are now getting out of this cyclical crisis -- not only  in the forecasts, but also in real life, where recovery has set  in. [applause] We stand a good chance that the 1.5-percent  growth rate of GNP predicted by the Federal Government in  January will be achieved. Those who mocked us should at least  tacitly admit that development is going in this direction.    But, ladies and gentlemen, there is not the slightest reason  to sound the all-clear. Now that we are possibly better able to  learn from the mistakes that were made over many years in the  past, we must do everything to secure Germany as an industrial  center, safeguard Germany's future, and carry out improvements.  Much has been possible in this connection. I specifically  mention the pay settlements, the larger chance to make the labor  market more flexible, and many considerations to improve the  competitiveness of Germany as an industrial and export nation.    We must continue this course. It is above all important for  our most important goal to combat unemployment and preserve  jobs. We, the Federal Government, have drawn the necessary  conclusions by adopting the program for safeguarding Germany's  future and the action program for more growth and employment,  and things are developing well. However, they are only  developing, and much remains to be done.    In the European framework, the Federal Government has  actively supported the proposals contained in Commission  President Jacques Delors' White Paper, because safeguarding  Germany's future is inseparably linked with safeguarding  Europe's future.    It is our goal to combat unemployment at the national and  European levels. Many suggestions made by Jacques Delors  correspond to our own goals. Let me mention just some of them:  Increasing flexibility on the labor market, reducing ancillary  wage costs, creating new employment opportunities, and taking  special measures against youth and long-term unemployment.  Translated into German conditions, this means concretely that  we must do everything in our power to make sure that youths in  the new laender who want to have an apprenticeship get an  apprenticeship and good training, if they are willing and able.  [applause]    Another example is the construction of trans-European  networks in the field of transport, energy, and  telecommunications. An outstanding example of this is the  expansion of the East-West railroad connection. We want to  build a fast rail connection across the continent as quickly as  possible, from London, via Paris, Frankfurt, Berlin, Warsaw, to  Moscow. This is also an important aim of Russian policy, as  President Yeltsin pointed out during his recent visit to  Germany. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a vision of the  future. What was possible in terms of railroad tracks at the  end of last century must also be possible to achieve with the  means of the late 20th century, if only we want to achieve this  together and see the importance of such a connection. [applause]    Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; open markets and free  world trade are in Germany's, and Europe's, very own interest.  A decisive step in this direction was the successful conclusion  of the GATT Uruguay Round at the end of last year. With this,  we passed the most comprehensive package of the past few decades  liberalizing world trade. We on the German side did everything  we could to help bring this important pact about.    A federal Europe has been and will be the aim of Germany's  European policy. We want unity with diversity. We do not want  a centralized European state that makes regional, national,  cultural traditions, and historic experiences disappear. In a  unified Europe, in the European house that we want to build, we  will remain Germans and French, keeping our identity. The terms  home country, fatherland, and Europe do not mean contrast to us,  but are the threesome of the future for us. Ladies and  gentlemen, anyone wanting a Europe of the citizens must reject  all tendencies toward European centralism. That is why we have  included the principle of subsidiarity in the Maastricht Treaty;  and this means that only those things shall and may be decided  on a European level, in Brussels, that cannot be better decided  on a national or regional level. I would also like to add to  the German debate that by regional level I do not only mean the  laender, but also our cities and municipalities. [applause]  For me, federalism does not only mean the relationship between  Brussels and Bonn, or between Bonn, Dusseldorf, and Munich, but  also between Dusseldorf and Cologne, and between Munich and  Nuremberg, to define this clearly for everyone. [applause] If  we want to take subsidiarity seriously, this also means that we  must be courageous enough to examine regulations and directives  to see whether they are still appropriate. In some cases this  may give rise to the question whether they have ever been  appropriate. [applause] Let me add to your applause, on a  self-critical note.... I know, you have never been spoilt with  too much applause, but I think this morning we want to see a bit  of common ground with regard to Europe, and I hope you agree.  You do not have to applaud when I am saying on a self-critical  note that many of the criticisms of Europe and Brussels have not  been completely free of hypocrisy, because many national  interests, including economic ones, are taken there and then  acted out in politics. And this also needs to be said in this  debate. [applause]    Plainly speaking, we must not try -- and this holds true  for all groups, including in Germany -- to push through in  Brussels what we cannot implement at the national level. That  is not very fair policy. [applause]    Madam President, ladies and gentlemen; it is the goal of  Germany's Europe policy to make 1994 also a year of success for  European integration and continue the successes and experiences  of recent years. As I said earlier, we will have a detailed and  intensive debate. I personally will face the discussions in the  responsible committees and bring in the Federal Government's  proposals. What we can do we will do in the months following 1  July when Germany takes over the presidency.    Let me add that it is my goal to implement or at least try  something that we were unable to carry out in the past. We will  try to reach agreement with our French friends on certain  problems, so that what we start in our presidency can be  continued in the subsequent French presidency, because everyone  knows that the time of six months is tight for making decisions.  We will consistently make use of every opportunity.    Ensuring and continuing European integration is not any  problem, it is the fateful problem of our continent, and for  Germany's future, it is the prerequisite for peace and freedom.  Konrad Adenauer said in 1950 that German unity and European  integration are two sides of the same coin. This statement has  proved to be visionary and right in political life. We, the  Federal Government, will contribute our share to create the  decisive conditions for building a weather-tight European house  and to allow future generations to live in this house in peace  and freedom. [applause]</p>

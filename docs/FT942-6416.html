			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Crimean deadline passes Ukraine's ultimatum to Crimea to rescind its independence-seeking constitutional legislation passed yesterday. Kiev's leaders reconsidered how they should approach both its Russian-dominated region and its Russian neighbour. Urging both sides to 'avoid sharpening the situation', Ukrainian parliamentary chairman, Mr Oleksandr Moroz, said that debate on the Crimean problem would be delayed until Wednesday. Torn between taking a strong stand to control Crimea and avoiding a confrontation, Kiev is also seriously considering a bold reversal in its policy toward Russia. Instead of dividing the Crimean-based Black Sea fleet with Russia, it may tell the Russians to go home.</p>

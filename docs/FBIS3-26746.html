			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Reforms in Foreign Trade System Have Gone One </F> Step Further -- Bidding for Export Quotas Held Twice a Year"]    [Text] As part of the move to reform its foreign trade  system, China will invite bidding for the export quotas on some  commodities. The bidding is opened to both domestic and foreign  firms, as long as they are a member of a related import and  export association or foreign investment society. Bidding  methods for these export quotas will be announced shortly.    Commodities for which these methods provide an export quota  are those announced by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC]. The quotas will be granted to  enterprises that are members of business associations. Firms  that are not members of any business association are not  eligible to apply.    Other provisions of these methods are:    MOFTEC will be responsible for supervising and guiding the  bidding. It determines the commodities to which bidding is  applicable and will set up a special bidding committee to take  charge of bidding for commodity export quotas.    The bidding committee will be comprised of MOFTEC leading  officials and related import and export associations. Specific  work for export quota bidding will be done by related import and  export associations. The bidding committee will set up a  commodity bidding office at the related association to handle  day-to-day affairs.    The number of biddings will depend on each specific  commodity. In principle, bidding will be held twice a year, each  session one quarter ahead of the effective date. The bidding  committee will designate specific news media to announce bidding  notices.    According to the provisions, import and export companies  with  MOFTEC-issued foreign trade licenses and membership in a related  import and export association or a foreign investment society,  manufacturing enterprises (limited to self-manufactured  products), and foreign-invested enterprises (limited to  self-manufactured products) are eligible to apply.    According to the provisions, firms participating in bidding  must fill out a "bidding application form" issued by the bidding  office, and mail it in a sealed envelope or have it delivered to  the bidding office. The day the bidding office receives the  application is counted as the date of receipt.    Names of the enterprises awarded quotas will be announced by  news media appointed by the bidding committee.    Provisions also specify that with the concurrence of the  bidding committee, the bidding office reserves the power to  revoke the bidding right for the following year of any  enterprise that fails to make use of, transfer, or return the  quota awarded it within a specified time. Quota-winning  enterprises will be deprived of their right to bid for export  quotas in the following year if it is found and established as  true that they have transferred the awarded quota to another  party without permission from the bidding office. If the export  price of the commodities of an quota-awarded enterprise is lower  than the coordinated price set by a related business  association, the enterprise will be barred from bidding for that  commodity for three years.    Regarding improving and perfecting voluntary quota  management, quotas for a single market will come under a  regional quota management scheme for individual countries, which  in turn is subordinate to a global quota distribution plan.</p>

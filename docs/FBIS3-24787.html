			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] leader, has proposed the formation of the Social and  Economic Council with the mission of controlling the use of  state funds. He alleged that the Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo] is using government property for its electoral  campaign. Meanwhile, the government says that that matter was  set aside following a meeting between President Joaquim Chissano  and Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama in August of last year.    The Renamo leader, who said that he had already put that  proposal to the Mozambican head of state when they met in Maputo  in August last year, added that President Joaquim Chissano had  rejected it.    Dhlakama says that as of now he intends to start "drawing as  much attention as possible to that matter, so that a commission  can be created that will control the funds. In other words,  that would allow at least the Renamo Party to know what is  happening in the Mozambican banks and how much money is coming  into this country. Let us suppose, for instance, that the United  States gives Frelimo some $8 million to $20 million for national  reconstruction purposes, but who is to know whether Frelimo will  be using it for its own electoral campaign?"    President Joaquim Chissano noted that issue had been  "brushed  aside the moment it was raised by Mr. Dhlakama. We had even  agreed we would not talk about the subject. It appeared to me  that Mr. Dhlakama saw it as an unreasonable point that had not  been properly thought out by those Renamo officials who may have  proposed it."    In turn, Dhlakama says that it is necessary that "people be  certain that Frelimo is not using state funds at this stage for  its own campaign."    The Renamo leader further noted that the proposed Social and  Economic Council could include representatives from other  Mozambican political forces, even though those parties had not  been signatories to the General Peace Accord in Rome.  Nonetheless, he said: "We believe that they are Mozambican  political parties and that they also need to be informed about  this whole transition process, because they will also take part  in the upcoming elections."    We asked the Renamo leader: So, are you proposing a  government of national unity? To which he replied: "No, no,  because a transitional government or a government of national  unity would contravene the General Peace Accord. It would also  be confusing because it would necessitate discussions on  ministerial posts and other such matters."    From his point of view, the Social and Economic Council "has  nothing to do with the General Peace Accord. What happens is  that everyone knows the country is going through a process of  transition and even Frelimo itself is going through a  transition. In other words, the Assembly of the Republic will  no longer be led by one party. It will be a multiparty  organization once elections have been held. Taking into  consideration the fact that Frelimo ruled the country alone and  that even nationalized houses and hotels are today viewed as the  property of the Frelimo Party -- though no one knows where or  who they bought them from; but today they are occupied by UN  guests who pay in dollars and that money is going directly to  the Frelimo Party."    Afonso Dhlakama also noted that the proposal for the  creation  of the aforesaid council will be presented to the government  again quite soon "because in August I had a small plan that was  conveyed to President Chissano and which he flatly rejected. He  went so far as to say that it was a blow against the Frelimo  government." Copies of the plan were distributed among foreign  ambassadors accredited in Mozambique but, as the Renamo leader  himself has said, diplomats have not reacted to that document.    Dhlakama further affirmed that "I shall really continue this  struggle...I shall only rest when I begin to know how much money  is in Frelimo's bank and how it is being used. There are many  cars, motorcycles, bicycles, millions upon millions of radio  sets, spare parts, dresses, pants, and so forth being bought to  be given to the people during the electoral campaign and those  are things that cost millions of dollars."    We noted, though, that perhaps all that is being bought with  the Frelimo Party money, to which the Renamo leader replied:  "That is fine, but let Frelimo then say where it gets its  money." We insisted that Renamo does not disclose the source of  its funds either. "Everybody knows that Renamo is poor", Afonso  Dhlakama responded.    The Renamo leader said: "We are not going to investigate  whether there is a factory, whether a Frelimo member has a  plantation, or whether he sells corn to finance his party's  campaign, but that Social and Economic Council would see how  state money is being used."</p>

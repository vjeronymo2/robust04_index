			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 23 (XINHUA) -- An official of China's  Ministry of Justice said here today that the May 19 report of  bodies like "Human Rights Watch-Asia" alleging that there were  about 500 newly reported detainees from the 1989 anti-government  turmoil was a sheer fabrication with ulterior motives.    The report alleged that there were nearly 500 newly reported  detainees from the "June 4" incident of five years ago being  held in the Beijing No.2 Prison and the Qinghe  Reform-Through-Labor Farm. It claimed that they had been badly  treated.    "This is a sheer fabrication with ulterior motives," the  official said in an interview today.    The official said that in the "June 4" incident which took  place five years ago, a small number of people were charged,  according to the laws of China, with criminal responsibility for  carrying out activities with the aim of sabotaging the  government, or committing crimes, such as beating, smashing,  looting, arson or killing, under cover of the chaotic situation.    The overwhelming majority of them had been released, either  because they had been dealt with leniently, or because they had  finished serving their terms, said the official, adding that  there was no such thing as nearly 500 such detainees.    The so-called "new discovery" of the "Human Rights  Watch-Asia" and other organizations was just their newly  fabricated lies.    As to the allegation that the prisoners of the Beijing No.2  Prison were forced to be quality inspectors for production of  rubber gloves for export to the United States, the official said  that investigations showed that the prison signed a contract in  1991 with a factory in Beijing for inspecting the quality of  rubber gloves on behalf of the manufacturer.    The contract contains a clear stipulation that the inspected  gloves can only be marketed on the domestic market, and this has  been effectively implemented, said the official.    He added that there had been no such exports inspected by  prisoners to the U.S.A., nor had the Beijing No.2 Prison  produced any gloves for export either.    The official said that in China, all prisons, including the  Beijing No.2 Prison, have to treat prisoners humanely, according  to law. The laws of China clearly stipulate that corporal  punishment and violence against prisoners is forbidden, and "we  act strictly according to relevant laws -- we carry out  civilized management over prisoners according to law, and there  are laws guaranteeing it."    China's criminal law stipulates that any acts of using  bodily  punishment or maltreatment of prisoners, as well as actions  which seriously infringe on the legitimate rights of prisoners,  should carry criminal responsibility.    People's procuratorates at various levels have opened  special  offices in prisons and assigned special officers to these  prisons to oversee the implementation of these aspects of the  legal code.    The allegation that the Beijing No.2 Prison had used  beating,  scolding or other bodily punishment to maltreat prisoners was a  "completely groundless fabrication," the official said.    It is not the first time that the "Human Rights Watch-Asia"  and other organizations have made up such sensational rumors  about the conditions in China's prisons and spread them to  mislead the public, the official said.    Lies will be lies, he said. Such malicious slanders by the  "Human Rights Watch-Asia" and similar organizations can only  show their hostility toward the Chinese people.</p>

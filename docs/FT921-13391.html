			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Wales will aid small companies THE Welsh Development Agency is to put increasing emphasis on helping the development of small and medium-sized indigenous companies within the country. Dr Gwyn Jones, agency chairman, said in Cardiff yesterday that the core programme, including the highly successful drive for inward investment, which produced Pounds 860m of new investment last year, would continue. 'The focus now, however, is moving to the established companies,' he said. 'Many of the successful start-ups of the 1980s are facing new and difficult challenges. We shall pay more attention to their needs in future.' In particular, the WDA through its consultancy services intends to help to overcome the skill shortages that many inward investors see as a grave shortcoming in the British economy. Mr Philip Head, chief executive of the WDA, commenting on the decision to reduce the emphasis on start-ups, said: 'Much of the work in this area is now being done by other bodies such as Tecs, local enterprise agencies and private-sector operations. 'If we are to help Welsh businesses be profitable and well run, we can best do it by offering more assistance in helping companies plan their strategy, exploiting technology, improving skills and doing business with Europe.'</p>

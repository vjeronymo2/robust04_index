			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Shipyard directors to be made redundant THE FOUR directors who led a management buy-out of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, are among 143 employees to be made redundant by the receivers today, Chris Tighe writes. Mr Alex Marsh and Mr Roger Vaughan, joint group chief executives, Mr Vaughan's brother Peter, group commercial director, and Mr Ken Chapman, group marketing director, led the Pounds 5m buy-out in 1986 acquiring the company from state-owned British Shipbuilders. Swan Hunter went into receivership in May and Price Waterhouse, the receiver, said yesterday that the four directors would receive the same state minimum redundancy terms as the other 702 employees who will have left by the end of next week. Price Waterhouse said they might be asked to assist on an ad hoc paid consultancy basis but were not being retained on the payroll. They will remain directors of Swan Hunter. The four directors said: 'We are committed to assisting the receivers in selling the business and thereby retain on Tyneside the capability, spirit and team work that has led to Swan Hunter's reputation for the excellence of its product, workmanship and design.' They added: 'We have a great belief in the future of shipbuilding on Tyneside.' The latest redundancies cut the payroll to 1,700 and are understood to include six other directors, leaving only four at the yard.</p>

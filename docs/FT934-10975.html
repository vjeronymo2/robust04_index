			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Major orders review of Sinn Fein broadcasts MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday ordered a review of attempts by television stations to circumvent regulations on broadcasts by Sinn Fein spokesmen. Downing Street said Mr Major called for a review of the broadcasting rules after seeing recent interviews with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Mr Major was said to have been disturbed by the use of actors reading synchronised scripts to get round the 1990 Broadcasting Act, which prevents transmission of Mr Adams' voice except during election campaigns. In the Commons the prime minister told Dame Jill Knight, a vice-chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee, that the use of actors 'stretched the present guidelines to the limit, and perhaps beyond'. The review will be carried out by Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, who has primary responsibility for broadcasting law. Mr Brooke, who is understood to have been given a free hand to recommend any changes he thinks necessary, is expected to consult Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. However, he is not expected to bow to demands from Dame Jill and other Conservatives to follow the lead of the Irish Republic, which bans all broadcast interviews with Sinn Fein. In Belfast, police revealed that a man is to be charged in connection with the massacre of seven people in Greysteel, County Londonderry, on Saturday night. A second is likely to be accused of withholding information. Five men were arrested in connection with the Greysteel massacre yesterday, but two were later released. Detectives are now questioning 11 people in connection with the shootings. A policeman shot in the neck by an IRA sniper died in hospital last night. RUC reservist constable Brian James William Wood had been on traffic duty in the border town of Newry, Co Down, when he was ambushed on Sunday.</p>

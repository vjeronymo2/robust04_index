			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LEUKEMIA VICTIM BEATS ODDS TO FIND DONOR  </P> <P> Tarzana attorney Marc Smith, suffering from a deadly form of leukemia, searched  across the country, hoping to beat odds of 15,000-to-1 against finding a donor  with compatible bone marrow for a transplant that doctors said could be all  that might save him.  </P> <P> But no donor had been found by the end of January, when doctors feared he might  have less than a month to live. So Smith agreed to undergo a riskier procedure,  known as an autologous transplant, using his own marrow.  </P> <P> But just hours before he was scheduled to begin preparatory chemotherapy  treatment, Smith said, his doctors informed him that a potential donor had been  identified.  </P> <P> Smith's doctors at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle were reluctant  to postpone the scheduled transplant. It would take weeks to complete the tests  to confirm that the donor was a perfect match. By that time, it might be too  late to perform the autologous transplant if the donor's marrow was  incompatible.  </P> <P> But Smith opted to take the risk. Wednesday, he learned the gamble had paid  off: the potential donor is indeed a match and Smith is scheduled to have a  transplant next week.  </P> <P> "I talked them into it," Smith said by phone from a sterile, enclosed hospital  room where he awaits the transplant.  </P> <P> "They felt I didn't have the time to wait, but I thought that if there is a  donor out there, after all we have done to find one, I wanted to have the  transplant," he said.  </P> <P> After learning in November that Smith needed a bone marrow transplant, his  relatives in Los Angeles and New York launched major drives to find a donor. He  said they raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay for more than 2,000  people to be tested, and held more than a dozen testing sessions on both  coasts.  </P> <P> On Dec. 18, Smith appeared on a nationally televised talk show and appealed to  viewers to take the test to become bone marrow donors. Thousands responded, and  matches were found for several other leukemia patients.  </P> <P> Smith's family members said they were thrilled Sunday, but Smith said he still  has a hard battle ahead of him.  </P> <P> The donor -- who remains unknown to Smith and his family -- cannot undergo the  30-minute marrow extraction procedure until next week. Smith said that he does  not know the reason for the delay -- and under the rules of the medical  exchange, he is not allowed to contact the donor -- but his condition is  deteriorating.  </P> <P> Smith said his doctors estimate he has about a 75% chance of recovery if he  survives the transplant. The odds of that, he said, are about 50%.  </P> <P> Still, he said, he has beaten the odds once -- finding a donor -- and he is  determined to prevail over the cancer threatening him.  </P> <P> "I have three little boys and I want to make it," he said. The last-minute  match, he said, has bolstered his hopes.  </P> <P> "My chances have been increased tremendously by really what is a miracle," he  said. "If I had come here one day earlier, I would have already started the  chemotherapy for the autologous transplant and that would have been it."  </P> <P> "It is almost like it is meant to be that I pull this one out," he said.  </P> <P> "I am scared to death, but the bottom line is that I am still here and still  fighting."  </P></p>

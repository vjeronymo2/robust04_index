			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A FRESH-AIR APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF SCIENCE  </P> <P> "Shooting stars!"  </P> <P> The excited cries that went up from the group of sixth-grade girls on an  astronomy walk soon gave way to embarrassed giggles as they realized that the  supposed meteorites were really just the beams of their own flashlights,  playing across the power lines overhead.  </P> <P> If the girls, from Swain and King elementary schools in Cypress, didn't seem  quite at home in the great outdoors, they could easily be forgiven. For many of  the sixth-graders who each week make the trek to Orange County's Outdoor  Science School, this is a first experience in the mountains.  </P> <P> This school year, more than 15,000 students -- more than half the sixth-graders  in Orange County, plus many from outside the county -- will travel to five  sites in the San Bernardino Mountains to attend the weeklong school.  </P> <P> There, they learn about geology, wildlife, ecology and astronomy in a series of  hikes and other activities that take a hands-on approach to environmental  education. The Cypress students, who recently spent a week at a site near the  tiny village of Forest Falls, panned for gold in the canyon stream, took night  hikes in search of nocturnal animals, looked for birds with binoculars and saw  Jupiter and four of its moons through a telescope.  </P> <P> While the students also learn camp songs and put together their own skits --  with a nature theme -- the Outdoor Science School is not a summer camp,  insisted Lauren Pollock, acting principal of the Forest Home site.  </P> <P> "The kids get that confused sometimes," Pollock said. "We run a very strict  program."  </P> <P> The school started in 1974 with one site and 1,400 children. The Cypress School  District had started its own outdoor school in 1967, and eventually the two  programs merged. As the school has grown, it has gradually changed focus,  evolving from an experience-based program that taught outdoor skills to one  that emphasizes the natural sciences.  </P> <P> "The curriculum has really tightened up a lot," Pollock said. "I think our  science has gotten better."  </P> <P> Dan Baker, who oversees all five Outdoor Science School sites as principal,  said the program is based on the premise that students can learn science better  in a hands-on situation than in the classroom. "What's best taught in the  outdoors, teach in the outdoors," Baker said. "If you teach about astronomy,  take them outside."  </P> <P> Also, Baker said, the science curriculum at many elementary schools is lacking.  "Some districts don't touch science," he said. "For some kids, this is the  highlight of their science learning."  </P> <P> The buildup to the weeklong mountain trip begins early. In first through third  grades, a traveling naturalist from the county makes a visit to each classroom  with live animals and related exhibits. In the fourth and fifth grades,  students make two full-day field trips to county sites such as Upper Newport  Bay.  </P> <P> Once in the mountains, the students are split into cabin groups of 10 for the  5-day program. One adult cabin leader, also trained as an activity leader, is  responsible for each group. Every week during the school year, each Outdoor  Science School site handles about 100 children, with a staff that includes one  acting principal, one naturalist, one environmental program leader, one nurse,  four unit leaders and 10 cabin leaders. Also, the students' classroom leaders  come along.  </P> <P> "We're real people-oriented," Baker said. "There's a lot of individual  attention."  </P> <P> The decision to participate in the Outdoor Science School is made by the  individual districts. The county pays 10% of the program's cost, while the rest  ($134 to $146 per student, depending on the time of year) is the responsibility  of the districts.  </P> <P> In some districts, the amount is paid entirely by the students' families, while  other districts put up all or part of the fee, sometimes with the help of  fund-raisers or state lottery money. In some districts, students even start a  class bank account as early as first grade that they contribute to with class  fund-raisers.  </P> <P> "It's the big deal of elementary school," Bill Kuehl said. "It's the main  event." Kuehl is a teacher at Swain who has been going to the mountains with  his class for 12 years.  </P> <P> Jerry Konowal of Swain was one of the teachers who started the program for the  Cypress district, and he has been coming up every year since 1967.  </P> <P> One of the things he finds valuable about the program is the opportunity to  spend time with his students outside the school environment.  </P> <P> It is often a shock, he said, for students to eat with the teachers or see them  wearing blue jeans. "We find the kids really look at you more as human beings,"  he said.  </P> <P> "It helps with building the bond between teacher and student," Kuehl said. "You  learn about them as people. They learn more about us also."  </P> <P> For many of the students, it is not only a first real outdoor experience, but  it is also the first time away from home. Along with the lessons in science  come a few life lessons, such as social and cooperative living skills -- "How  to get along in a group," as Pollock explained.  </P> <P> The presence of familiar classmates and classroom teachers helps ease what  could otherwise be a traumatic experience. "It's more of a secure environment  for that first time," Pollock said.  </P> <P> As a teacher, Konowal has seen some students branded as rough or "problem"  children suddenly come out of their shells in the mountains, inspired by the  surroundings or, often, by the role models offered by cabin leaders, who are  usually college-age.  </P> <P> "You feel this is a little flicker of light in that kid's life," Konowal said.  </P> <P> The Cypress district pays half of each student's fee for the Outdoor Science  School, and sometimes more if the student's family can't afford it.  </P> <P> "For a small district like Cypress, that's a major expense," Konowal said, "but  it's worth it."  </P></p>

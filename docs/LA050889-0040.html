			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> More than 70,000 Armenians marched peacefully through the center of Yerevan,  the capital of the Soviet republic, demanding the release of detained  nationalist activists, a Soviet journalist said. A reporter for the Novosti  news agency said between 70,000 and 100,000 marchers filed past Communist Party  and government headquarters. He said he knew of no arrests following the  demonstration, which was staged without official permission. It was the third  demonstration in as many weeks calling for the release of 14 members of the  banned Karabakh Committee, which has spearheaded a campaign demanding that  administration of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh be transferred  from the republic of Azerbaijan to Armenia.  </P></p>

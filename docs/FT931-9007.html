Lord Clark's connections after more than 30 years in parliament are expected to give added weight to Cisco's proposals on smaller company requirements. The group was launched last year, following Stock Exchange proposals to dismantle the Unlisted Securities Market, and aims to protect the interests of smaller companies in the City. Richard Balarkas, Cisco's chief executive, says Lord Clark's involvement will allow the group to 'get directly to the ministers involved'. A former Tory MP with a career stretching back to 1959, Lord Clark, 70, has served variously as deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, front-bench spokesman on trade, finance and economics, and chairman of the Conservative back-bench finance committee. Most recently, Lord Clark was on the committee investigating alleged malpractices at the Lloyds insurance market. He was promoted to the House of Lords last year.</p>

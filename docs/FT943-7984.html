			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Structured FFr1bn deal for Societe Generale The lull in the Eurobond market persisted yesterday, though many syndicate managers are expecting a surge in volume in September, as borrowers with large parts of their 1994 funding programmes to complete try to beat the expected fourth-quarter rush. The only substantial offering yesterday was a FFr1bn three-year structured deal for Societe Generale Acceptance, guaranteed by the French bank. The deal was the first in the French market for almost two months, but does not reflect a return to favour for the French franc sector, since it is a highly structured transaction. However, dealers said that the underlying tone of the market has improved, and some straight bonds in French francs could follow. The Societe Generale deal is aimed at investors who expect interest rates to rise, but to a limited extent. The notes are structured to pay a margin of 50 basis points over the three-month Paris interbank offered rate, with a cap of 9 1/2 per cent (interest does not accumulate when Pibor rises above that level). With three-month Pibor currently at 5 5/8 per cent, and the forward rate for September 1997, the maturity date, currently at around 8 per cent, there is a comfortable cushion for investors, according to lead manager Societe Generale. However, there is no floor, as most investors are not expecting French rates to fall substantially.</p>

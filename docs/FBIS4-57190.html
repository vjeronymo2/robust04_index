			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu's foreign policy  seeks the removal of Brazilian subsidies on milk--subsidies that  harm our interests. He has already lodged the appropriate  diplomatic protest. Negotiations with Argentina over the signing  of an agreement on the dredging of the Martin Garcia channel  have been enhanced. Other very important issues like border  agreements to remove environmental pollution and the pollution  of border rivers like the Cuareim River, the Yaguaron River, and  the Merin Lake will be discussed with the Brazilian foreign  minister and the Rio Grande do Sul governor during a meeting to  be held within the next few days in the city of Canela.    Minister Sergio Abreu and a small group of advisers  yesterday  held a working breakfast with journalists to thoroughly inform  them of the developments of current diplomatic work and  negotiations, not just with the neighboring countries, but  specially with the EU, Mexico, the United States, and Canada.    The meeting served to become better acquainted with the  development of all these important issues and to confirm the new  style implemented by Abreu in his role as the "manager of our  foreign policy," as he described his activities at the Foreign  Ministry. A basic element of his activities involves "developing  our land and river borders" with Brazil and Argentina.    Abreu discussed the recent GATT conference, the results of  which were unsatisfactory for many countries. This was called  the Uruguay Round. It took more than seven years to complete.    He pointed out that even though no concessions were received  directly from the great powers, positive results were achieved  laterally and a trade war which would have had "regrettable  consequences for the entire world" was prevented.    Abreu specifically discussed the developments of a Rio Group  meeting held in Sao Paulo during which the member countries  agreed to enhance their relationship with the EU. In a brief  review, he mentioned the new international political agreements  on security issues, the new OAS policy and the election of the  OAS secretary general, and especially the relationship with the  political blocs of Asia where Uruguay has been enhancing its  presence and its direct relationship policy.    The foreign minister harbors no doubts that all countries  were dissatisfied with the GATT results. Nevertheless, there is  a greater willingness to negotiate--a willingness that did not  exist before--following the inclusion of groups that were not  GATT members. This represents the beginning of a multilateral  approach for a global trade relationship that used to be  governed by group agreements. This involves a new relationship,  even though it does not include the agricultural and  livestock-producing countries. The current protectionist  apparatus will be dismantled within six years, following the  closure date of the Uruguay Round. [passage omitted]    A proposal that is still being studied by the area countries  seeks to link Alaska with Tierra del Fuego. This proposal  aroused great expectations among NAFTA countries and countries  from other existing blocs. It is similar to the new European  Union which has been developing with internal problems that  include an extremely high unemployment rate, growing economic  recession, and the need to increase its area of influence  following the socialist collapse.    The foreign minister emphasized that the EU's firm goal is  to  reach our area through Mercosur [Common Market of the South] to  which it ships a significant quantity of manufactured products  and from which it receives agricultural products and raw  materials.    Another significant point is that 40 percent of the banks  operating in Latin America are European. [passage omitted]    Discussing Argentina's initial contact with NAFTA--which  Argentina intends to join--Abreu emphasized that it is  impossible for Argentina to join NAFTA because the current rules  prevent it and because Argentina would have to grant all the  advantages to the other ALADI [Latin American Integration  Association] and Mercosur countries. Discussing increased trade  in the Mercosur area, Abreu emphasized that trade grew from $3  to $9 billion, which gives an idea of the dynamics among the  four member countries. Brazil was the great beneficiary of this  trade growth.    The foreign minister emphasized that a protest has been  lodged with the Brazilian Foreign Ministry over the attitude on  tariff reductions for milk and milk by-products. This represents  a clearly competitive attitude that is harmful to other Mercosur  partners, as in our case.    A response is expected within a short period of time. The  foreign minister believes it will be favorable to our claims.  Otherwise, other negotiations that are under way may be delayed  and our producers, who have already been warned about all this,  may be harmed. [passage omitted]    Concerning the particular issues Uruguay has pending with  its  two neighbors, Abreu briefly pointed out that a contract for  dredging the Martin Garcia Channel will be signed within a few  days and notes on the advanced payment of the binational Salto  Grande hydroelectric dam project will be exchanged soon. The  issues pending with Brazil include the Cuareim and Yaguaron  Rivers and the Merin Lake, the cleaning up of the cities linking  our two countries, environmental protection, and the joint  development of the Merin Lake and Yaguaron River basins and a  new bridge linking Rio Branco with Yaguaron.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sparks flying over Turkish utility ILLUSTRATING how an outsider can shatter the cosy habits of Turkey's business establishment, Rumeli Holding is watching the dust settle after its bid to buy the proxy voting rights of shareholders in Cukurova Elektrik, the country's best known public company. On Tuesday, Turkey's newest and brashest family-owned industrial group, an 11 per cent minority holder of Cukurova, took the market by surprise. It solicited shareholders' proxies in return for a cash offer equivalent to 20 per cent of par value of any holding - in effect an offer for the company. In a full page newspaper advertisement, Rumeli gave no details of how it proposed to exercise its voting rights at the board meeting on March 30. However, if successful, it could presage a full boardroom takeover of the power utility. Capital Markets Board, the government's watchdog agency, under pressure to force Rumeli to declare its hand, said it was considering legislation to prevent the use of similar tactics. However, this did not stop further advertisements. The stock exchange has offered muted disapproval, while the target company has condemned the ploy as 'immoral and unethical'. It is probably more likely the legislation is not yet in place to prevent such a share assault. Rumeli Holding is owned by the Uzan family, and started Turkey's first private TV station. But the assault on Cukurova, and earlier acquisitions of two government cement companies and Polly Peck's media business purchased from the UK administrators, has revealed a corporate appetite hitherto undetected. Last month, Rumeli paid Dollars 81m for the government's stake in Cukurova, defeating the attempt by Sabanci, Turkey's largest conglomerate. Sabanci, through Akbank, its Istanbul bank, owns an estimated 5 per cent of Cukurova, and is said to be mustering support from other minority shareholders to see off the Uzan threat. Cukurova, which has a market capitalisation of around Dollars 440m, is described by brokers as one of the few 'truly public' companies in Turkey. However, with 70 per cent of its shares floating, it is also uniquely vulnerable to takeover threats. Fearful of just such a boardroom raid, few of the 140 companies which trade on the Istanbul bourse have chosen to float more than 15 per cent of their shares, the legal minimum needed to become a public company. New issues of family-held stock are now likely to dry up. Rumeli paid more than twice the price set by the privatisation agency. However, brokers suspect Rumeli is eyeing Cukurova's asset book which is 'massively undervalued' due to legal restrictions which prevent government owned companies from revaluing assets in line with inflation, a common practice in Turkey.</p>

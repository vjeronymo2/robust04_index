			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: General Mills abandons deal GENERAL Mills, the Minneapolis-based packaged foods group, has called off the proposed purchase of RJR Nabisco's remaining 'cold cereal' business, writes Nikki Tait. It blamed the length of time which would have been involv-ed in the anti-trust regulators' review of the agreement. Following news late on Tuesday that the transaction was being aborted, speculation quickly mounted that another large consumer products company might acquire the operations. Both Philip Morris, the tobacco, food and beer company, and Quaker Oats were touted as buyers yesterday. The deal, first announced on September 1, would have involved General Mills in buying the business for Dollars 450m in cash.</p>

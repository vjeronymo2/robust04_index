			<p>BFN     [Text] Plateau, Feb. (NAN) -- About 28 people have been  confirmed dead by the Langtang north local government in Plateau  following an outbreak of cerebro spinal meningitis (CSM) in the  area, the NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA (NAN) reports.    A statement from the information unit of the local  government  explained that as a means of containing the situation, health  authorities in the state had despatched a team of medical  experts to the area, while the federal government had directed  the release of 10,000 doses of vaccines for the area.    It said that the state's commissioner for health, Alhaji  Usman Abdullahi, had already visited the affected area and had  given assurance that the situation would be brought under  control. The commissioner attributed reason for the spread of  the disease to the absence of an epidemic prevention and  surveillance committee at the local government area.    He, therefore, directed all the local governments in the  state that had not constituted such a committee to do so without  further delay. In the meantime, the traditional ruler of  Langtang, Mr. Edward Zhatau, has called on both the state and  federal governments to come to the aid of his people by  supplying drugs and equipment to the hospitals in the area. The  traditional ruler, who made the call when the state's health  commissioner visited him, however, commended the efforts taken  so far by the state government to check further spread of the  disease.</p>

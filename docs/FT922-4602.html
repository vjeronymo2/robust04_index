			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Gould attacks Tory 'will' over Rio LABOUR YESTERDAY used a hastily arranged debate on the Earth Summit in Brazil to attack the government's environmental record, saying that it lacked the political will to act on a range of issues. In a lively series of exchanges with Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, Labour's Mr Bryan Gould accused the government of being 'fine with the high-sounding phrase' but of having no idea what to do beyond showing awareness of the environmental agenda. Mr Gould, shadow environment secretary, said the government did not accept that anything other than market forces would solve environmental problems. He charged Mr John Major, the prime minister, with backing off very quickly when confronted with 'the politics of interfering with the free market'. Mr Howard immediately retorted that the government had always accepted regulation had a role to play, although market forces contributed 'a tremendous amount' to solving environmental problems. Focusing specifically on the summit, Mr Gould criticised the government for moving to lower expectations, saying the air was 'thick with warnings not to expect too much'. A huge diplomatic effort had been undertaken to make common cause with US recalcitrance and frustrate the world's environmental agenda. There had been an attempt to 'ensure Rio created nothing more than hot air'. Mr Howard said Britain would sign the Rio draft treaty addressing threats to the climate from greenhouse gases, but had concerns regarding the accompanying document on biological diversity. The 'primary' obstacles to signing were the financial conditions, he said. The government was 'exploring urgently' how it could sign without 'signing a blank cheque'.</p>

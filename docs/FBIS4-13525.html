			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Imad al-Ifranji] </F>   [Excerpt] Gaza -- Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, the official in  charge of Fatah in the Gaza Strip, has said that meetings  between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] are  continuing and will not stop. He stressed that the PLO will not  accept Israel's interference in Palestinian internal affairs nor  linking the meetings with the negotiations.    In an exclusive interview with AL-NAHAR, al-Agha said that  the meetings are continuing and will not be halted and that the  two sides are keen on continuing them because they serve the  supreme Palestinian interest.    Al-Agha added that the aim of the meetings is to create a  somewhat good relationship and ongoing coordination in order to  overcome any problems and differences that arise between the two  sides -- as a service to the Palestinian people.    The Palestinian official cautioned the Israeli media, which  are trying to split the Palestinian rank. He denied the  existence of any agreement under which Fatah is to carry out  political action and Hamas military action. Al-Agha stressed  that Fatah's relationship with Hamas is a crucial Palestinian  strategy that concerns every Palestinian. The two sides will  defend this strategy with all their power.    Al-Agha rejected Israeli threats against the PLO's  cooperation with Hamas. He said that the PLO rejects any  dictate from any party. Al-Agha also rejected Israel's attempt  to link the continuation of the negotiations with putting an end  to the meetings with Hamas. He said: This is blackmail that we  reject and do not accept. No Palestinian will accept it.  [passage omitted]</p>

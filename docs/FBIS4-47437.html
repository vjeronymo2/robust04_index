Kochnev, prof. (dec.), S.G. Izmailov and </F> R.V. Fedorov, Chair of General and Emergency Surgery and  Microbiology, Kazan GIDUV [expansion unknown] ]    [Abstract] Zone inhibition studies were conducted on  Micrococcus lysodeicticus to test wound discharges for  antimicrobial activity and to ascertain whether such activity  provides an indication of wound healing. The technical details  involved preparation of 5 mm diameter discs from filter paper  for saturation with the discharge material and assessment of  growth inhibition on solid medium. Studies on 70 male and female  patients, 18 to 70 years old, with postsurgical abdominal  infections demonstrated a positive correlation between the  degree of inhibition and abatement of the infectious process.  Thus, a high degree of antibacterial activity of the discharge  can be used to monitor the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy and  the proper time for application of secondary sutures.

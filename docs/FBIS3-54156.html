The Hezb-e-Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] sources in  Peshawar said that two Scuds were fired by Rabbani forces at  Zakhira (dump), a civilian populated area between Charasyab and  Logar. This place had been used by the Red Army and the  Moscow-installed regimes in Kabul for dumping and storing oil  for military purposes.    Meanwhile,the Hezb-e Eslami chief, Golboddin Hekmatyar told  THE FRONTIER POST on telephone from his strong-hold at Charasyab  that his rivals had not so far been able to target his military  installations in and around Kabul.    He said that the Rabbani-Mas'ud forces were using Shindand  base for serial attacks on his positions. He claimed that the  Friday [21 Jan] serial bombings by the Rabbani forces on his  strong-hold at Charasyab was not affective. He said that the  radio and television being run by his party were operative as  usual.    A newscaster of Hezb radio and television, Ahmed Shah lost  his life when a rocket hit the building, housing the Hekmatyar's  own electronic media system.    Meanwhile, it is learnt that three planes of Gen. Dostam,  who  is commonly known among the Hezb circles as Haji Dostam, landed  at the Charasyab air base on Saturday. It is believed that the  planes brought food and other essentials from Mazar-e Sharif.    The forces of Gen, Dostam are stationed near Shah Shaheed  street and Bala Hisar fort. Both these places are close to the  Charasyab.    The Hezb sources said that the oil supply to Kabul from  Pakistan was continuing. The Afghan planes are seen at Peshawar  airport everyday, the sources added.    According to independent sources the commander Shura met at  Pul-e-Charkhi again on Saturday at the residence of Mullah  Saddiq to bring a peace formula acceptable to the both parties.  Meanwhile, it is learnt that the Hezb-e Eslami has asked all  the Afghan banks in Pakistan and elsewhere not to entertain the  orders of the Rabbani government. "The money in Afghan banks is  not the personal property of Rabbani", said a directive issued  by the Hezb to the Afghan bank managers.    Hezb sources also said that they were giving tough time to  the Rabbani forces in and around Kabul. The sources rejected  the government's claim that it had captured the old Microryan.    The Afghan embassy spokesman in Islamabad said on Saturday  that 22 fighters of Hezb were killed on Friday when the Rabbani  forces attacked Charasyab. The Hezb sources, however, rejected  the claim.    The forces of Gen. Dostam killed 65 fighters of Mas'ud at  Microryan on Friday during hand-to-hand fighting, the Hezb  source said in Peshawar.    Afghan factions fought with rockets and artillery in the  capital Kabul on Saturday, scuppering a ceasefire attempt by a  group of guerrilla commanders, reports Reuter quoting Afghan  sources.    Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami party,  part of a rebel coordination council, blamed forces loyal to  President Borhanoddin Rabbani for the failure of the ceasefire  proposed by a council of Afghan commanders.    "The coordination council was keeping peace on Saturday in  response to the commanders' council appeal before the other side  floured it by rocketing a Hezb-e Eslami base near Charasyab, a  Hezb spokesman said in Peshawar.</p>

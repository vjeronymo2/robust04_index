			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / How To Spend It: Right down to the wire - Peter Knight meets a couple who bend and shape metal any way you want WHAT YOU see in David and Sheba Blunden's shop is definitely not what you get. The place, incongruously planted in the less salubrious side of run-down Acton, in west London,looks like a shambolic fusion of Steptoe's yard and the Sheriff of Nottingham's torture chamber. But what emerges from the shop's dilapidated frontage are the most exquisite and delicate works in wire, such as hanging baskets, conservatory pot-holders-cum-chandeliers, decorative rose arches and Victorian jardinieres. David, Sheba and their five workers make by hand virtually any wire object, from a fire guard to a strawberry crinoline conceived by Joseph Paxton. 'The crinoline was designed because slugs can't jump. You can therefore train the plant up through the middle and the strawberries hang through the gaps without touching the ground,' says David. Garden and interior designers have re-discovered the functional beauty of decorative wire work, and with it James Gilbert &amp; Son, the Blunden's business started by David's ancestors in the early 1800s. It moved from Islington, north London, to its present premises, known as the 'new' shop, in 1881. The green facade must have been painted since then, but with the grime thrown up by the passing traffic and the damage caused by carrying tonnes of wire through the narrow door, it is hard to tell when. 'Look,' says David, whose turnover is around Pounds 1m a year and who is clearly irritated by prissy visitors commenting on the shambles, 'I could spend about Pounds 30,000 on the frontage and I'll bet you I wouldn't sell a penny more wire. If people want to find me they will.' And they do. Hurlingham Club needed new guards for its croquet lawns and they came to David, who discovered that Gilbert's had made the originals. When wire grilles were needed to keep pigeons out of the arrow slits at the Tower of London, the restorers came to Gilbert's who made 48 individual guards out of hand-woven copper wire. The owner of Europe's biggest private conservatory, at a stately home in Nottinghamshire, needed his set of hanging baskets repaired and trucked them to Acton. 'These are really big baskets, about 9 ft across. We made them in the late 19th century and they have been in service ever since,' says David. Wire, as long as it is properly treated, can last a long time, sometimes more than 100 years. This is essential news for those uninitiates who are used to cheap plastic equivalents or mass-produced articles, because the price of decorative wire can seem steep. A simple hanging basket from Gilbert's costs around Pounds 150 - some are cheaper but others are a lot more expensive. A plain rose arch is about Pounds 40 but the more decorative versions range from around Pounds 350 to Pounds 650. VAT must also be added. Gilbert's carries very little stock and most of the merchandise is made to order. If customers don't have a clear idea of what they want, David guides them through the shop's original Victorian catalogue. This can be a somewhat uncomfortable experience because there is minimal light and little space to pore over the fascinating designs on yellowed pages. David's office is just big enough for his chair, coffee cup, collection of books - including such titles as Wire Industry Machinery Guide 1982 and a thin roll of fine mesh woven in prime phosphor-bronze, worth about Pounds 4,000. 'We particularly like one-off commissions. Many of the things we used to make are now available cheaply in plastic so we now concentrate on the more decorative and complicated work that can't be mass produced,' says David. He has kept alive the skills needed to bend wire. He makes some of the pieces in a converted piggery near his East Sussex home, providing training and jobs for villagers. David does not like change. His office might be equipped with a fax and telephone but this is the only evidence of the 1990s. The main tool in the Acton shop is a terrifying machine dating back to 1906. Its job is to take wire and crimp it into shapes that are suitable for making, say, a grill mesh. The steam engine which used to provide the power has been replaced by an electric motor but the rest of the Heath Robinson contraption is unchanged since the turn of the century. David tried a new machine once but sent it back when it failed to do the job as well as the original. This experience has reinforced his winning prejudice of sticking to established methods and traditional tools. 'If I start changing things it will probably all go wrong,' he says.

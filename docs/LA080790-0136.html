			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> OCTD MANAGER PAY BOOSTED TO $93,984  </P> <P> The Orange County Transit District board on Monday unanimously approved an  additional 5% pay raise for district General Manager James P. Reichert,  bringing his annual increase to 10%. His new salary is $93,984 a year.  </P> <P> District spokeswoman Joanne Curran said Reichert's four-year contract, which  ends Nov. 1, 1993, calls for an automatic 5% increase this year and next year,  plus a 6% increase in 1992 and 1993.  </P> <P> The board voted 5 to 0 to approve the pay package and give Reichert an  additional 5% increase.  </P> <P> Last October, the board was split 3 to 2 on the question of whether to give  Reichert a multi-year contract. Members Richard B. Edgar, William Farris and  John Erskine approved the agreement, citing Reichert's job performance. But  another board member, County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, called the contract a  "guaranteed giveaway of raises in advance."  </P> <P> Curran said the OCTD set a ridership record in the last year with 46 million  passengers. The district has 1,500 employees, nearly 600 buses and vans and an  operating budget of $184.3 million.  </P> <P> Reichert has been with OCTD since 1973. He became general manager in March,  1978.

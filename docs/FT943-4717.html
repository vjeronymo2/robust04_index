			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Italy tightens policing of banking rules The Italian Treasury has imposed fines on directors of various Italian banks to remind them of their obligations under the country's banking legislation. The fines are small - the largest is only L18m (Dollars 11,461) - but they indicate the Treasury's determination to enforce the rules on Italy's sprawling banking sector. Directors of the Banca Popolare di Novara, which operates one of Italy's largest branch networks, have each been fined L12m for minor omissions and errors relating to its credit position and accounting situation. The infringements were detected between March and October last year. Fines were also imposed on Cofilp, a financial subsidiary of the Novara bank; Credito Lombardo; Credito Commerciale; and Cassa di Risparmio di Rieti. It is the second time that Mr Lamberto Dini, the Treasury minister and a former number two at the Bank of Italy, has imposed fines on bank directors since he took over as minister in May.</p>

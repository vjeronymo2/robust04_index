			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Better return for taxpayers from in-house consultants Sir, Sir Peter Levene fears I misunderstand both the Efficiency Unit scrutiny report on external consultants and the recent white paper on the civil service (Letters, August 13). His fear is unfounded: I understand them only too well. I am disturbed that Sir Peter, the prime minister's adviser on efficiency, does not recommend that, rather than spend Pounds 508m on external consultants, the government might get a better return for taxpayers' money by developing and supporting an in-house civil service expertise. And I am fairly certain the bill for that would come in at far less than Pounds 508m. Sir Peter seems also to have developed an aversion to the term 'market testing', preferring 'competing for quality', a process that he claims 20 per cent-plus savings for. The government has yet to establish how quality is to be maintained once work goes outside the civil service to a private contractor, but it has yet to take up my union's challenge to substantiate these claimed savings. The simple fact of the matter is that in the past two years 'market testing' has run up consultancy costs alone of Pounds 39m, never mind the costs of setting up MT units in each department and agency and the cost of failed or abandoned market tests. And John Major, his efficiency adviser, Sir Peter Levene, William Waldegrave, until the reshuffle the minister for market testing, et al have yet to produce detailed evidence to back up their claim of Pounds 135m saved by market testing. They avoid being pinned down by pleading either 'commercial in confidence' or that the work in detailing the savings figures would be disproportionate. Sir Peter also omits to mention that his competing for quality programme is rather selective. After lots of pressure from the private sector, which keeps bleating about a non-level playing field, Sir Peter's Efficiency Unit has prevented the in-house civil service teams from playing at all - almost Pounds 770m worth of central government work has been market tested without civil servants being allowed to compete for the contracts] Joy for the private sector but certainly not value for money for the taxpayer.

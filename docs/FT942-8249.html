			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Lending and money growth weak Bank lending and money supply growth were weak in April, providing some tentative evidence that the economy may have been affected by last month's tax increases. But analysts pointed out that the lending figures are erratic in nature and could have been distorted by seasonal factors. M4, the broadest measure of the money supply, rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent between March and April, according to figures from the Bank of England yesterday. During the 12 months to April, M4 increased by a seasonally adjusted 5.7 per cent, down from 5.9 per cent in March and below market expectations of a 6 per cent rise. The government's monitoring range for M4 growth is 3 per cent to 9 per cent. Sterling lending to the M4 private sector (defined as all UK residents other than banks, building societies and the public sector) was just Pounds 500m, compared with market expectations of Pounds 2bn. Meanwhile, the British Bankers' Association reported that sterling lending by leading British banking groups to the private sector fell Pounds 911m in April on a seasonally adjusted basis. This was the first monthly fall since December 1992 and followed an increase in lending of Pounds 3bn in March, the largest monthly increase for four years. Lord Inchyra, director-general of the association, said: 'Such a sharp contrast requires some explanation. The most obvious is the incidence of Easter, which fell at the very beginning of April, and which may have brought forward transactions, and borrowing, into March at the expense of April.' The incidence of Easter may also have affected the sterling M4 lending statistics, of which the association's figures are an important component. Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International (Europe), said this was 'one series of figures where seasonal adjustment has always caused problems'. Two substantial reasons for the decline in the association's figures were a Pounds 1.1bn drop in lending to building societies, and a Pounds 432m fall in lending to securities dealers. But there was also a fall in lending to the corporate sector, and lending to persons, at Pounds 360m, was lower than in previous months. 'There has been weak credit demand across the economy over the last six months but that has been masked by lending to securities houses to finance their positions in the markets,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities. Consumers spent Pounds 35bn on their credit cards last year, a rise of 7 per cent on 1992, according to the Credit Card Research Group. More than half of all credit-card spending takes place away from high-street shops.</p>

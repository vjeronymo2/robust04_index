			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Safety body set to urge more regulation Greater regulation of health and safety in various high-risk occupations is likely to be recommended to the government tomorrow by the Health and Safety Commission. Seven taskforces, with representatives from business, have been examining health and safety regulations, their costs and benefits in areas such as construction. They have reported back to the HSC, which will publish its recommendations to the government shortly after Mr John Major, the prime minister, announces the competitiveness white paper. It is understood that the HSC will say that there are various areas of high risk in which current legislative controls are inadequate and that new goal-setting regulations are needed. Mr Kevin Barron, Labour's health and safety spokesman, said yesterday that in 1992-93, 368 people died as a result of accidents at work in the UK while 143,244 serious accidents were reported to the Health and Safety Executive.</p>

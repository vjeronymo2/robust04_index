			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Qasiyy Salih al-Darwish: "Madani and Belhadj </F> Refuse To Meet With Independent Delegation"]    [Excerpt] Paris -- Contrary to rumors circulating on the  Algerian scene in recent days, reliable sources have confirmed  to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, leaders  of the Islamic Salvation Front, refused to meet with a  delegation of national figures who are independent of the regime  and have for two weeks been engaged in a political initiative to  create a dialogue mechanism to secure a solution to the serious  political crisis, on the basis that resolving the Algerian  crisis concerns not only the regime, but all influential  political forces.    According to the sources, Madani and Belhadj voiced a number  of reservations about this meeting, including the presence of  former President Ahmed Ben Bella, who made strong criticisms of  the Salvation Front at different times, even though he is now  strongly urging the regime to pursue a real and serious dialogue  policy with all political parties, including the Salvation Front  leadership.    The independent national figures delegation comprised six  members: Mohamed Saleh Yahiawi and Taher Zobiri (they represent  the Algeria eastern region; they are two former military  officials), Ahmed Ben Bella and Ben Ella (they represent the  western region; the latter was chairman of the council at the  beginning of independence and governor of one of the states  during the revolution); and Ahmed Mehsas and Mohamed Said  Mazouzi (they represent the center; they were both ministers in  the days of Boumediene, but Mehsas, who is a well-known and  respected national figure, later resigned from the government  and lived in exile, joining opposition ranks, while Mazouzi  remained minister after Boumediene's death, and was considered  representative of the left wing in the regime. He is from the  tribes region).    Instead of the delegation's meeting with Madani and Belhadj,  it met with Shaykhs Ali Djeddi and Abdel Kader Boukhamkham,  members of the Salvation leadership who were released from  prison recently. The meeting atmosphere was positive, even  though it did not produce any tangible results. Further  meetings between the two sides are not ruled out. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rise pared as rate cut hopes are diminished LATE afternoon bargain hunting by institutional investors spurred a rally, but share prices closed only marginally higher after profit-taking had eroded most of the gains, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average finished 17.05 up at 16,509.68 after a day's low of 16,398.21 and high of 16,645.93. The index rose sharply in the last 15 minutes of trading before losing steam in line with a weakening futures market. Volume remained light, totalling 200m shares against 203m previously. Rises led declines by 511 to 401, with 202 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 4.19 at 1,260.10 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.35 to 1,023.51. Hopes of an imminent cut in the discount rate receded on tighter money market operations by the Bank of Japan. However, traders said some investors still expect a rate reduction next month. Meanwhile, some brokers hope that a possible listing by JR East, one of the seven divisions of the former national railway, which will apply for inclusion in April, will activate the market. Shipbuilders were actively traded on reports that the recent spate of oil spills may prompt the government to implement requirements enforcing tankers to be constructed with double hulls. Sasebo Heavy Industries advanced Y34 to Y525, Hitachi Zosen rose Y18 to Y490 and Mitsubishi Heavy gained Y8 at Y508. Sumitomo Bank, which announced that it would write off non-performing loans worth Y100bn to Itoman, the ailing textile trader, for the current fiscal year, firmed Y10 to Y1,720. In Osaka, the OSE average closed 79.57 higher at 17,885.34 in volume of 40.7m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets continued to be mixed. HONG KONG finished moderately higher, with overseas demand for bank issues continuing to provide support. The Hang Seng index gained 16.16 at 5,939.89 in volume that eased to HKDollars 2.03bn from Tuesday's HKDollars 2.09bn. HSBC Holdings, the largest local bank and stock, continued to top the actives list and added 50 cents at HKDollars 62.50. Bank of East Asia, which today will be the first blue chip bank to report results, climbed 75 cents to HKDollars 36. Swire Pacific 'A' picked up 75 cents to HKDollars 31 on signs that the cabin crew strike at its Cathay Pacific Airways unit was crumbling. Cathay improved 5 cents to HKDollars 9.35. SINGAPORE turned mixed after the Straits Times Industrial index briefly touched a new high of 1,607.22 in morning trading. It later turned back to close a net 2.21 off at 1,603.07 in volume of 56.86m shares, against 43.79m on Tuesday. QAF, linked to the Brunei royal family, was the most active issue with 13.58m shares traded on rumours of a Brunei asset injection. The stock rose 5 cents to 91 cents. AUSTRALIA rose, although equities failed to maintain strong early momentum provided by the overnight London and Wall Street markets. The All Ordinaries index ended 5.6 ahead at 1,534.8. Turnover came to a healthy ADollars 251.8m. BTR led industrial volume after a block trade of 1.97m shares at ADollars 2.50. It closed 4 cents up at ADollars 2.53. Among other heavily traded issues, Pioneer shed 3 cents to ADollars 2.24, and Goodman Fielder was 1 cent easier at ADollars 1.72 after the company rejected speculation that it was likely to be the target of a hostile takeover bid. Many investors are turning to Goodman Fielder from Arnotts, which rose 2 cents to ADollars 9.52 on the eve of the close of Campbell Soup's ADollars 9.50 a share takeover offer. Campbell said it had almost 40 per cent of Arnotts by mid-afternoon. TAIWAN stocks were dragged down by political uncertainty and heavy profit-taking from strong gains made before the Chinese new year holidays. The weighted index fell 137.53, or 4 per cent, to 3,283.09 in moderate turnover. MANILA turned higher after a large order for San Miguel shares by a foreign group based in Singapore sent the market up, overcoming early profit-taking. The composite index put on 7.03 at 1,324.34. San Miguel 'A' shares closed 2 pesos firmer at 75 pesos and the 'B' appreciated 5 pesos to 120 pesos. SEOUL was lower, the composite index losing 7.91 at 694.59. KUALA LUMPUR drifted easier in thin trading as many investors stayed on holiday. The composite index slipped 1.45 to 624.89. BANGKOK relinquished further ground amid profit-taking in bank shares. The SET index shed 4.56 to 983.41 in Bt9.05bn turnover. Construction conglomerate Siam Cement, on announcing lower than expected profits, declined Bt10 to Bt508.</p>

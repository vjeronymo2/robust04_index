			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Government Bonds: Dealers on sidelines ahead of Bundesbank meeting EUROPEAN government bond markets went on hold yesterday following the recent exchange rate mechanism battle. Dealers were keeping their powder dry ahead of today's Bundesbank repurchase agreement announcement and, more significantly, the key central Bank council meeting tomorrow. The announcement that the German inflation rate had only risen by 0.1 per cent left markets looking puzzled. Some economists pointed out that with three of the four west German regions announcing an increase of 0.2 per cent in the cost of living and the fourth announcing a 0.1 per cent rise, the overall number was hard to swallow. Bund futures prices, which would normally have risen on the back of a figure that was slightly more deflationary than expected, slipped back to close 10 pfennigs down at 96.18. Meanwhile, the Bundesbank said that today's repo would be variable and the market was looking for a cut of about 10 basis points to 7.05 per cent as a precursor to reductions in the official discount and Lombard rates tomorrow. UK DEBT prices were softer along the yield curve and took no heart from the latest CBI survey which painted a picture that under normal circumstances the gilts market would have warmly welcomed. The Confederation of British Industry's quarterly industrial survey argued that the strength of sterling and low business confidence should make the government think about a cut in interest rates. That would be expected to help short-dated gilts which respond to interest rate cuts. The survey found that the balance of companies showing optimism about the economic outlook fell to 11 per cent from 31 per cent in April and it expected manufacturing jobs to fall by 40,000 in the third quarter. Those views would normally have helped long-dated maturities, which thrive in a climate of low inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, sterling retraced Monday's upward move and traders were holding back ahead of today's Pounds 3.25bn gilts auction, which has generated some nervousness because analysts have said the eight-year maturity is too long-dated to appeal to banks and building societies and too short-dated to attract overseas buyers. FRENCH paper was steady as the market awaited the Bundesbank repo for indications about the prospect and size of an official German rate cut tomorrow and the recent speculative attacks faded away. French call money shot up to an offered rate of 11 per cent by mid-afternoon, although analysts said the rate might be artificially high as call money was mostly traded in the morning. Short-dated maturities were marginally firmer on hopes of further monetary easing. The 10-year OAT futures contract for September eased 4 centimes to 120.20, slightly nervous ahead of key unemployment figures on Friday which are expected to show a rise to about 11.6 per cent from 11.5 per cent. SPANISH government bonds gained slightly as further falls for the peseta against the D-Mark fuelled hopes that the currency would have to be floated, allowing rates to be cut. The peseta was hit by unconfirmed rumours that unemployment in the second quarter was above 22 per cent against 21.7 per cent in the first quarter. Unemployment figures are due this week and some economists expect the rate to have risen to at least 23 per cent. PORTUGUESE bonds rose slightly on hopes that money rates would ease and on expectations that the Bundesbank would cut key rates on Thursday. The Bank of Portugal auctioned Es9bn of eight-day certificates at an average rate of 13.5 per cent to absorb money market liquidity. TRADING was subdued on US Treasury markets yesterday, with prices flat-to-lower across the board after the afternoon auction of new two-year government securities. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was unchanged at 105 25/32 , yielding 6.672 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was slightly weaker, down  1/32 at 99 27/32 , to yield 4.192 per cent. Prices remained in a narrow trading range just below opening values. Attention was firmly focused on the afternoon sale of Dollars 16bn two-year notes, the market's first big auction in more than a month. Although dealers had hoped the auction would go well, demand proved disappointingly weak, with the two-years sold at a yield of 4.26 per cent. This was above expectations. The day's economic news - a small drop in the July Conference Board consumer confidence index and a 2.4 per cent rise in weekly store sales as reported by the Johnson Redbook survey - was mixed for bonds, and had little impact upon sentiment.</p>

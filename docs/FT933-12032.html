			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Spy HQ's cost was hidden, say MPs THE COMMONS foreign affairs committee yesterday rebuked the government for covering up the Pounds 86.7m cost of fitting out a new building for the Secret Intelligence Service. In a report on Foreign Office spending the all-party committee accused ministers of 'burying' the Pounds 45.5m being spent on the offices in the current financial year. It also notes that the total cost of internal equipment and furnishings for the office complex on the south bank of the Thames at Vauxhall Cross is expected to reach Pounds 86.7m. That compares with Pounds 66m spent by Mr Jacques Attali, the former head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Mr Attali's expensive tastes proved his downfall and he resigned earlier this month. The overall cost, including the land, of the concrete and glass headquarters for Britain's spy service - more commonly referred to as MI6 - runs into several hundreds of millions pounds. Designed by Mr Terry Farrell, its construction - coinciding with the ending of the cold war - was vigorously opposed by the Treasury but was approved by Baroness Thatcher, then prime minister. The MPs do not disclose whether Britain's spy chiefs insisted, like Mr Attali, on importing the highest quality marble from Italy or the best interior designers from France. They concede that the government does have arrangements for such expenditure to be monitored by the National Audit Office. But they criticise the way that such substantial amounts of money - equal to the amount that the Overseas Development Agency spent in the same year on all its bilateral emergency and refugee aid - was buried in more general expenditure totals for the Foreign Office. More generally the committee suggests that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office should consider reducing the number of staff it has based in London in order to free additional personnel for overseas postings.

There are in excess of 250 sugarcane producers in Louisiana, and the production of sugar, in the absence of proportionate shares, is estimated to be greater than the quantity needed to enable processors to fill the State's allotment and provide a normal carryover inventory. Accordingly, proportionate shares must be established for sugarcane farms in Louisiana. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to sections 359b(b)(1) and 359b(c) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary of Agriculture has established allotments for the marketing of sugar processed from domestically produced sugar beets or sugarcane and crystalline fructose produced from field corn during fiscal year 1995. In addition, the Secretary has made the following determinations: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The September 1994 estimate of the quantities of sugar consumption, stocks, production, and imports in the United States (including Puerto Rico) for fiscal year 1995 is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,8 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank;  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1TST, raw value <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Consumption  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 9,247 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reasonable ending (carry-over) stocks <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,278 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Production  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 7,890 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beginning (carry-in) stocks  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,386 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Imports  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,249 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The overall allotment quantity for sugar is 7,889 TST. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The percentage factors for the beet sugar and raw cane sugar allotments are 55.2 percent and 44.8 percent, respectively. The Secretary established the percentage factors for the beet sugar and cane sugar allotments on the basis of past marketings of sugar (defined as the average of marketings of sugar from the 1985 through 1989 crops, excluding the highest and lowest years), processing and refining capacity (defined as the highest year's production in the preceding 5 crop years), and the ability of processors to market the sugar covered under the allotments (defined as the crop-year production estimate for the fiscal year in which allotments are implemented). In order to make the percentage factors fair, equitable, and efficient, the three criteria were weighted 25 percent for past marketings, 25 percent for processing and refining capacity, and 50 percent for ability to market. The data used to determine the percentage factors are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

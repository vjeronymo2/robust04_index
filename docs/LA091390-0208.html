			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERE, PRIDE'S THE POINT;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: SOUTH GATE HIGH'S COACH GARY CORDRAY TEACHES CONFIDENCE IN SELF AND  TEAMMATES. HE DOESN'T GRADUATE MAJOR-COLLEGE STARS, BUT HIS RAMS KEEP WINNING.  </P> <P> Desire and pride permeate football at South Gate High School and create an  atmosphere that is all Coach Gary Cordray will ever require.  </P> <P> The South Gate Rams, 25-1-1 the last two seasons, draw home crowds of 3,000 and  enjoy support from the business community. Cordray, a fun-loving man who wears  a Mickey Mouse watch and a whistle that sits on his protruding stomach, would  never think of leaving.  </P> <P> "I'd say this is sort of like the 'Happy Days' TV show," Cordray said last week  as he stood in the center of the concrete campus. "I don't think it could be  any better than right here. It's serene, you don't see a lot of stupidity. It's  the best-kept secret, 'cause if anyone knew how good it was here they'd  probably take my job, . . . 'cause there are a lot more smarter coaches than I  am."  </P> <P> Cordray will take an eight-season 52-30 record into Friday night's opening game  with Wilson of Los Angeles. In 1988, the Rams were 14-0 and CIF city champions.  </P> <P> South Gate's success has resulted mainly from tight defense played by  youngsters whose desire and togetherness overcome lack of size. The repertoire  of offensive plays covers just half of a small chalkboard in an office beneath  the stadium bleachers.  </P> <P> "The majority of the school is Hispanic, so most of us get along," said senior  Steve Martinez, the team's best defensive player. "They always say South Gate  doesn't have any size, but everybody is together. We are a team of unity. It  takes heart to win, and that's what South Gate has."  </P> <P> Cordray, 44, grew up in the Appalachian town of McConnelsville, Ohio, "thinking  that on Friday night, football was the most important thing in town."  </P> <P> He said Ohio State's Woody Hayes was like a god to him, though Cordray ended up  being a punter at Bowling Green.  </P> <P> He knew he wanted to keep that football atmosphere always. Unable to find it at  L.A.'s Washington High, his previous school, Cordray helped create it in South  Gate, where football is so popular that he said the team can get what it needs  from the Optimist, Kiwanis and Rotary clubs.  </P> <P> A weekly Rams football show on the local cable TV station has had up to 25  sponsors.  </P> <P> "The business people here think the high school is outstanding," said Cordray,  who lives in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Auto dealer Pete Ellis is one of the contributors. "Some very influential  people in town are behind (the team), supporting it financially and with their  time," he said. "This is a very proud community with a tremendous amount of  spirit."  </P> <P> A 300-member booster club is headed by Henry Gonzalez, a former city  councilman. "The team pulls the community together," he said. "Everybody's so  proud of the kids."  </P> <P> A water tower looms at the east end of the Rams' campus stadium, but a sign on  the gym near the west end gets the players' attention. It reads: "South Gate  High Ram Pride."  </P> <P> "See those words?" Cordray asked. "That's what I believe in: South Gate Ram  Pride. Our kids see that when they come out here, and we talk about it every  day."  </P> <P> The pride penetrates so deeply that the players also paint the yard lines on  the field and paint off any graffiti that might be on campus buildings.  </P> <P> More than 130 boys tried out for the varsity this summer, Cordray said, twice  the number of candidates his first season. The 80 who won uniforms were doing  jumping jacks, shouting, "One! Two! Three!" with crisp enthusiasm.  </P> <P> That spirit pleased Cordray. "Our bench is alive all the time," he said. "We're  chatterin', cheerin' it up, guys are screamin' and hollerin'. We don't need  cheerleaders, bands and all that kind of stuff. If we can't read that sign up  there, we're in trouble."  </P> <P> Red helmets lay on the grass as the Rams stretched. Cordray walked along the  lines.  </P> <P> "This guy right here is so low off the ground, I swear, if moles could tackle,  he'd be the best ballplayer in the world," Cordray said as he came to senior  Rene Portugal. "How tall are you? Really?"  </P> <P> "5-3."  </P> <P> Cordray smiled. "In your cleats, with your helmet on?"  </P> <P> Not all of the players were small. This season's team is one of the biggest  Cordray has had.  </P> <P> "Here's the guy we call House," Cordray said, pointing out 6-foot-3 lineman  Carlos Nunez. "House started at 316 in 10th grade, now he's gonna be playing  this year at 280. He's trim, lean and mean. He's going to play some hell on  some defensive backs."  </P> <P> Although Cordray was compassionate toward his players at the practice, he could  also be tough, living up to his reputation as a disciplinarian. During the  championship season two years ago, Cordray benched several of his starters in  one game for breaking rules.  </P> <P> South Gate does not produce future stars: Just three players in Cordray's eight  years have gone on to play at four-year colleges.  </P> <P> "What we try to do is get a kid who's not very good and make him as good as  possible, so his expectations of himself go beyond his dreams," Cordray said.  "We don't tell them they're going to be college or professional players. We  tell them, 'This is going to be your last hurrah, but we're going to get you to  play like the pros do or your favorite college team does.' "  </P> <P> When they leave South Gate, the coach said, they still have that dream of  making it somewhere else, but eventually they realize that they are too small  or too slow.  </P> <P> Cordray said a high percentage of his players graduate, which is his main goal:  "If they can come out of here one step ahead of the rest of the general  population when they take that job application, then I think we really have  succeeded in our football program. It's not numbers going to college."  </P> <P> Most of the players return within a few years of graduation to attend practice,  a game or to let the coaches know whether they're in the military, working or  going to school.  </P> <P> Some, such as 300-pound former center Rudy Fortiz, become assistant coaches.  "Rudy's my offensive line coach, equipment manager, first-aid man and also my  eating buddy," Cordray said.  </P> <P> A family atmosphere is evident.  </P> <P> Last Friday night the booster club held a spaghetti dinner for the team at  which the coaches talked to the players' parents about equipment, treating  injuries, academics and the pluses and minuses of football.  </P> <P> Many of the players have brothers who played for South Gate. Among them is Jose  Terrones, a ninth-grader whose brother, Adrian, was on the 1985 team.  </P> <P> "How come you want to play football for South Gate?" Cordray asked Terrones as  they stood on the edge of the practice field.  </P> <P> "I don't know . . . to make my mom and dad happy for me," Terrones answered  shyly.  </P> <P> "Yeah? How about yourself?"  </P> <P> "Me too."  </P> <P> "Yeah? What do you have here?"  </P> <P> "South Gate High School Ram pride."  </P> <P> Cordray hustled back onto the field to supervise a kickoff return drill. He  does not view what he is doing as work.  </P> <P> "I'm country, I don't know anything else, this is it," he said.  </P></p>

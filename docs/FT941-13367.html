			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Company votes on political gifts urged Companies should be required to ballot shareholders before making donations to political parties, the Institute for Public Policy Research said in a report published yesterday. The left of centre think-tank also recommended restrictions on donations from overseas and a requirement for parties to publish the names of donors giving more than Pounds 5,000 a year. The report said the system of funding UK political parties had led to a gap between the resources of the Conservatives and the opposition parties. In the last parliament the Conservatives had an income of Pounds 34m, Labour Pounds 16m and the Liberal Democrats Pounds 3m. According to the institute this disparity has had a significant impact on the way people vote. The proposal to introduce restrictions on political donations follows the disclosure last year that the Conservatives received substantial contributions from overseas businessmen. The party faced further embarrassment when it was revealed that it had received Pounds 440,000 from Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive chairman of the collapsed Polly Peck group. The report said that the UK should follow the rest of western Europe and north America in introducing laws to ensure that parties can compete on a more equal footing. Money and Votes. IPPR, 30 Southampton Street, London WC2E 7RA. Pounds 9.95.</p>

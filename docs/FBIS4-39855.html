			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by TIA correspondent Konstantin Parshin for TASS] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe, 11 Jun -- Indian Minister of State for  External Affairs Salman Khurshid announced today that India will  grant Tajikustan a 10-year loan worth $5 million in accordance  with a program of mutually advantageous coperation and with a  whole range of documents that were signed yesterday evening. Of  this money, 85 percent will go toward implementing joint Tajik-  Indian projects in the areas of enterprise and industrial  installation construction, while the remainder will be used for  acquiring medical equipment.    Tajik Foreign Minister Rashid Olimov said at a press  conference that was devoted to the visit by the Indian minister  and a delegation of Indian entrepreneurs accompanying him, that  relations between the two countries were entering a new stage.  The fact that a plenipotentiary ambassador of India to  Tajikistan would be appointed in Dushanbe in the near future was  yet more proof of this.</p>

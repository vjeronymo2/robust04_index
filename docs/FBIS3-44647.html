It has also decided to abolish some measures concerning tax  reduction and exemption for imported automobiles.    A spokesman with the General Administration of Customs of  the  People's Republic of China said the decision of the State  Council to reduce tariffs on imported automobiles and adjust  relevant measures concerning tax exemption would create  conditions for conducting competition on an equal basis and  preserving fair taxation, as well as promoting the development  of China's auto industry and improving the country's investment  environment.    He explained that too many or loosely designed tax reduction  and exemption measures would not be conducive to exercising  control over imports of automobiles or suit the demands of  building a socialist market economic structure.    He believed that too many such measures would also seriously  weaken macro-control over tariffs and give rise to smuggling and  tariff evasion.    According to him, all those importing automobiles must pay  import duties and other related taxes at the local customs,  except those organizations and personnel who may continue to  enjoy tax reductions and exemptions in accordance with the  international treaties to which China is a party or agreements  signed between the Chinese and foreign governments. Foreign  cars sent by international organizations and foreign governments  as gifts will not be subject to full taxation either.    Estimates from Chinese automobile trading firms show that  about 400,000 foreign-made cars and vans entered the mainland  market in 1993.    In the meantime, the number of cars and vans smuggled into  China last year was about 100,000, compared with 90,000 in 1992.</p>

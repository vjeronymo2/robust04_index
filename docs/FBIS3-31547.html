			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks denote recorded passages] </F>   [Text] A regular weekly meeting between Yasushi Akashi and  [head of the Croatian Office for State Security] Hrvoje Sarinic  was held today at the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]  headquarters in Zagreb. The meeting was also attended by  General Milivoj Petkovic and General Ante Roso. In addition to  the usual topics, their meeting today was an introduction to an  event that is to take place tomorrow: A cease-fire agreement  which is to be signed by General Ante Roso and General Rasim  Delic.    [Petkovic] I hope Delic will come to Zagreb tomorrow so that  we can sign an agreement which, unlike those that I have signed  so far and that have not produced any results, will finally be  an agreement which will yield not only short-term but also  long-term results. The most important objective is that combat  actions between the Croatian Defense Council formations and the  Muslim forces cease.    [Reporter] Tomorrow is a decisive day, as you say. Will it  be successful and are you expecting real results?    [Roso] Many things are changing with the spring. I would not  like to add anything to what General Petkovic said, I think it  is sufficient. Hopefully, this agreement will be final and in  this way the Croatian Defense Council will contribute to the  restoration of peace in the Balkans.    [Reporter] The agreement will be signed on neutral ground.    [Akashi, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian  translation] Today we had a very fruitful meeting. The result  is a possibility to sign an agreement on the cessation of  hostilities between General Roso and General Delic. This will  be an historic moment -- the return of peace to  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Reporter] Another topic discussed at the meeting, of no  less  importance, is also in connection with Bosnia-Herzegovina and  the alleged presence of the Croatian Army there. Generals Roso  and Petkovic put forward a proposal to UNPROFOR to carry out a  thorough inspection of all formations and positions so that  allegations on the presence of regular Croatian Army formations  can be refuted. The important thing is that the allegation on  the presence of Croatian Army in Bosnia-Herzegovina has by this  been relatively neutralized.    [Sarinic] It has absolutely been neutralized, and no way is  that the case [changes thought], we will wait for about a week  until they have collated all the details and verified them, and  only then should the UN Security Council get reliable reports;  it should not make any decisions on the basis of some gossip.  Their conclusions can be, as I have already said, very serious  and fatal for Croatia.    [Reporter] In the next seven days UNPROFOR commissions are  to  examine the situation and send a report to Yasushi Akashi.</p>

Agriculture serves as the pillar of national economic  development and social stability. Its steadfast growth is of  particular importance this year now that the nation is  endeavouring to balance reform, development and stability -- the  theme of the NPC session. Only with a healthy agriculture can  stability last, which in turn facilitates reform and development.    This is a rule the Chinese Government and people have sought  out after repeated success and failure in history. For whenever  agricultural production expands and the peasants see their lives  improved, there is social stability, and reforms are carried  forward smoothly. Stagnant farm production, however, will send  inflation soaring and squeeze the economy out of proportion.    China's sheer population size determines that it has to rely  on itself to secure a solid food supply.    The issue is all the more important now because grain  producing capacity is not much more than the nation's food  consumption. It is not only the traditional cereal producing  bases that ought to strive for an increasing output, but the  relatively developed coastal regions should also set aside a  stable acreage for grain and adequate food storage.    The central government should build its own food reservoir  and set up a special-purpose national fund to regulate grain  production and circulation.    The supply of non-staple food, vegetables in particular, is  the single most important factor that directly affects average  urbanites' lives and is an essential element behind inflation.  The central government's decision to designate city mayors to  take full charge of non-staple food supply and ensure stable  prices is a crucial measure to hold inflation at bay.    As for farmers, the most pressing task is to help them earn  more. The last decade of reform has enabled output to increase  steadily but failed to augment farmers' income correspondingly  in many regions, resulting in a widening gap between urban and  rural residents.    Modernization is impossible if three-quarters of the  population remain poor.    The government needs to increase its agricultural  investment,  raise grain procurement prices, ensure the supply of farm  materials and machinery, provide information and organize  services to farmers, and ensure no levies in addition to State  taxes and the authorized collective charges are imposed on  farmers.    The long-term and fundamental way to increase their income,  however, lies in transferring surplus rural labour to  non-agricultural undertakings. This would leave farm hands with  larger plots to cultivate on the one hand and migrant workers  with more opportunities to show their talents on the other.    New reforms are indispensable. Local governments, in the  light of their conditions, may experiment with transferring the  use rights of idle land to capable farmers, reshape rural  businesses in the form of the share-based co-operative system,  and restructure rural financial and banking networks.    The national and regional legislatures should supervise the  execution of existing laws and formulate new ones to guarantee  that agricultural development goes along a regulated, legal  track.    Tough and protracting as the job is, the country has  actually  no other alternative but to work concertedly to advance rural  development. A robust agriculture in a nation with one-fifth of  the world's population not only underwrites a stable environment  for domestic growth but also contributes greatly to world peace  and development.</p>

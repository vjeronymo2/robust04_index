			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (21): Stockbrokers find better way to update clients IN today's competitive financial market, NCB Group, the Dublin-based stockbrokers - along with similar institutions - is exercising tighter cost-controls across its operating divisions, writes Michael Wiltshire. In common with many financial houses, NCB regularly sends information and newsletters to its clients which include a wide range of Irish multinational companies, private businesses and substantial private investors. NCB is one of the first financial institutions to apply the advanced technology of AT&amp;T's 'EasyLink' services. Every Friday, two newsletters bringing clients up-to-date with key developments are sent to hundreds of companies in the UK, Europe and the US - one deals with equity business and the other with Irish and international bond markets. A typical newsletter would run to about three pages with commentary, prices changes and other data. Before the introduction of Enhanced Fax to the operation, just over a year ago, NCB used a fax card in a PC to communicate the weekly update to its clients. Although adequate, NCB found its original system time-consuming and costly. As Noel Doyle, the telecommunications manager at NCB, points out: 'Using a fax card in a PC was a feasible way of communicating with a small to medium-sized client-base, but as we grew and numbers increased, this method became cumbersome.' NCB has found that the application of AT&amp;T's Enhanced-Fax has brought cost-savings and cut administration time. The company simply keys in the list of its customers into a 'mailbox' node at EasyLink, where it is stored. Since the list is held at EasyLink and not in the PC, time spent on the line sending the fax, is reduced considerably. The Enhanced-Fax 'broadcast' facility uses AT&amp;T's dedicated international fibre-optic network. The digitised transmission has an automatic error-correcting protocol which ensures a higher-than-normal quality of transmission. NCB staff no longer have to undertake a laborious Monday morning routine of manually scanning for transmissions that failed to be sent, if, for example, the receiving fax terminal was not in operation. With E-fax, the days of cross-checking more than 200 fax deliveries are over, since a fully comprehensive report is issued to NCB indicating any faxes that remain undelivered.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- Japan and other Group of  Seven (G-7) major nations are discussing "various measures,"  Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito said Monday [27 June],  suggesting joint intervention alone is ineffective in stemming  the dollar's broad- based plunge.    The G-7 nations are in "close contact to exchange  information  to take various actions but details are not yet decided," Saito  told a regular news conference.    Pressed by reporters if those measures would include joint  credit-policy actions, Saito said the present currency movements  are "not as easy as to cope with just by interest rate  differentials."    He added, "there are various ways such as Japan's ongoing  efforts to reduce its trade surplus."    The dollar fell below 100 yen in Tokyo despite last Friday's  joint G-7 intervention after the U.S. currency plunged below  that level for the first time in the postwar period in New York  last Tuesday.    With the joint intervention failing to prop up the dollar,  global market attention is fixed on whether the G-7 nations will  cooperate in credit policies as they did when the dollar fell  near to sinking below 100 yen in May.    Together with joint market action, the United States raised  its key interest rates, while Germany cut the key rates with  other European nations following suit, with Japan maintaining a  loose stance on the money market.    Higher U.S. rates and lower rates in other nations help the  dollar fall as dollar assets become favorable.    Saito said G-7 nations "are concerned about the rapid,  speculative movements," analyzing the trend as the yen's rise  against the dollar in sympathy with the upswings in the German  mark and other European currencies.    Japan will "continue taking tenacious action through close  contact with other G-7 nations," Saito said, expressing concerns  over the effect on the recovering economy.</p>

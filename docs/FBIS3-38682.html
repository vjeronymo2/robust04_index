			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Josef Joffe: "From Washington a Present With </F> Barbs"]    [Text] If it was ordered in Washington, then it is a  present with barbs. The U.S. Senate warned the FRG, of all  countries, not once, but twice, to finally "fully" participate  in UN military missions. One resolution was even adopted with  96 to 1 -- which the "most exclusive club of the world" does not  do too often. This resolution (which is not binding for anyone)  asks the Germans to take the "necessary constitutional steps"  for combat missions under UN auspices.    This fits in nicely with the concept of the Kohl/Kinkel  government, because it can elegantly pass on the pressure:  first, toward Karlsruhe, where diverse proceedings are still  pending that should clarify once and for all what can legally be  done "out of area"; second, toward the Social Democratic Party  of Germany [SPD], which is in favor of "peacekeeping" but not of  "peacemaking" (that is to say combat) missions. So far, so good.    The barbs become visible if one takes a closer look at the  Senate debate, and they hook up with the ardent desire of  officials in Bonn to finally be awarded the epaulets of a true  major power: a permanent seat in the Security Council. The  Clinton administration has nothing against it, and recently even  advocated Bonn's promotion in this respect. The senators,  however, have explicitly asked for a price. Senator William  Roth put it in the following way: "I do not think that people  in Tokyo and Bonn today see the indissoluble connection between  global power and responsibility." In plain English: Those who  want the epaulets also must accept the burden; one cannot force  one's way into the cockpit if one reaches for the parachute  moments before the battle by referring to other obligations.    Have officials in Bonn sufficiently analyzed the link  between  power and duty? True, they are tired of having to look at the  five permanent members of the Security Council (United States,  Britain, France, Russia, and China) as the eternal winners of  World War II. After all, the united Germany has regained its  status and, moreover, economically and demographically it is one  number larger than England and France. And it worries greatly  (one has said: "I cannot stand it") that "we do not participate  in the discussions between the Five," but "always remain outside  the door."    Only: Reality is different. Those who watched how Clinton  flattered Kohl in Washington earlier this week hardly have to  worry about Germany's importance in international politics. The  Germans are number two in NATO and the G7 group of  industrialized nations -- and, with the French, number one in  the European Union. Wherever Bonn puts forward its interests, it  gets involved. And where Bonn does not get involved -- in the  Balkans, where the stake is military strength -- the UN epaulets  will not be of any use. After all, this is where Bonn does not  want to join in the game -- for the often mentioned historical  reasons.    Strength [macht] is not derived from wanting [moechten], but  from doing [machen]. If the Bonn government really wants to  participate, then it should first clarify whether it is able to  -- in terms of domestic policy -- and really wants to -- in  terms of foreign policy.</p>

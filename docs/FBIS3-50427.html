Major Edith Vargas, spokesman  for the Information and Press Department of the Army (DIDE),  asserted that the Guatemalan Armed Forces obtain their weapons  "legally" and not clandestinely.    Eduardo Linares, former guerrilla and now a political leader  of the FMLN, accused, in statements to the Guatemala City PRENSA  LIBRE newspaper, the Guatemalan military institution of being  primarily responsible for the gunrunning activities. According  to Linares, on one occasion the FMLN had bought an arsenal from  Guatemalan military personnel. However, Major Vargas asserted  that the former guerrilla "is totally misinformed."    The Guatemalan Army has charged the FMLN of gunrunning for  the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG).  Furthermore, Deputy Government Minister Adolfo Reyes accused  the FMLN of being involved in criminal activities in that  Central American country and said "we have evidence" to this  effect. Recently, Guatemalan Interior Minister Arnoldo Ortiz  and Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez said they suspected  former FMLN members were involved in the abductions that are  occurring in Guatemala to collect ransoms.</p>

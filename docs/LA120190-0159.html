			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> BLUE CORN: A FOOD FAD LASTING FOR CENTURIES  </P> <P> Christopher Columbus took maize -- corn -- back to Spain from America in 1493  and American Indians showed early settlers how to grow it.  </P> <P> Corn was important to early Central and South American civilizations for many  years before Europeans arrived, according to Professor Ray Rothenberger,  horticulturist at the University of Missouri.  </P> <P> "The oldest known corn remains were discovered in Mexico and were about 7,000  years old," he related. "The corn cob was enclosed in a husklike casing, which  meant man had a hand in its growth and survival."  </P> <P> There are hundreds of corn varieties in four major categories: sweet corn,  popcorn, dent or field corn, and the decorative multicolored flint or Indian  corn.  </P> <P> "There are corns not in these four categories," says Rothenberger. "These  include dwarf corn with tiny ears, and broom corn with long, feathery sprays of  seed heads. Seeds from broom corn can be used for bird food, and the wiry heads  can be made into brooms or fall decorations."  </P> <P> He relates that Indian corn has the hardest kernels of any corn. "They become  almost impossible to grind by hand when they dry," he said.  </P> <P> Indian corn colors range from mahogany to red, yellow-orange and deep blue.  Combinations of colors often occur on one ear and these are popular as  decorations. Lately, miniature corn suitable for small arrangements has been  developed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Blue Corn  </P> <P> Blue corn occurs naturally. In 1540, the Spanish explorer Coronado found Pueblo  Indians planting it.  </P> <P> The traditional blue corn tortilla is the mainstay of the blue corn market.  Processors have introduced such new products as blue corn chips, muffins,  pancake mixes and corn flakes. One expert notes that blue corn grain has a  coarser, sweeter and nuttier taste than other types of corn.  </P> <P> Arrowhead Mills, in Hereford, Tex., has been processing blue corn for five  years. Its president, Boyd Foster, said: "At first, we thought blue corn would  be a fad, but it has done quite well and we think it is here to stay. Blue corn  makes up 8% to 10% of our sales revenue each year."  </P> <P> Foster, whose firm processes about 1 million pounds of blue corn annually, said  its biggest-selling product is pancake mix. "Blue corn products sell well  because of the unique color and distinctive flavor. We sell products all over  the U.S., but the Los Angeles area is our biggest market."  </P> <P> Farmers like to grow blue corn, Foster related, because it is non-hybrid, which  means that they can carry over seed from one year to the next without having to  buy more.  </P> <P> Blue corn is often grown organically. It is best adapted to deep, well-drained,  sandy loam soils with plenty of organic matter. Plant it as you do other corn.  </P></p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Talbott faces a grilling over his views on Israel - The prospects for a foreign policy hopeful under the congressional spotlight Mr Strobe Talbott may face tough questioning on his attitudes towards Israel, as well as over his policy stance towards Russia, when he appears before the Senate foreign relations committee today to be grilled about his qualifications to be deputy secretary of state. There is no suggestion yet that his nomination is any jeopardy, but Mr Talbott felt the need last week to hold a special meeting with representatives of leading Jewish organisations to assure them of his good intentions. Mr Mike McCurry, State Department spokesman, also addressed the question, noting that, as a journalist with Time magazine, Mr Talbott was 'a provocative and interesting commentator'. The spokesman added, however: 'He now has a responsibility to fulfil policies that represent the policies of this administration', affirming that Mr Talbott would not have been named deputy to Mr Warren Christopher if this were not so. So far only one obscure Republican congressman has called for him to be rejected. Most of the criticism against him has come from conservative and strongly Zionist groups. Yesterday, Mr Yossi Beilin, Israeli deputy foreign minister, said these views did not square with his government's. Mr Talbott is not an expert on the Middle East but two columns, written nine years apart, have excited criticism. In 1981, he wrote that Israel was 'well on its way to becoming not just a dubious asset but a downright liability to American security interests'. In 1990, he wrote that the Likud party's claim to the occupied territories 'does indeed have something in common' with Iraq's claim to Kuwait. This kind of thing can dog anyone in a profession with a long paper trail. The writings of two previous nominees for high office in the present US administration, Ms Lani Guinier and Mr Morton Halperin, proposed for the justice and defence departments respectively, offered their opponents voluminous evidence, often deliberately misconstrued, of alleged extreme or unpatriotic views. Jewish sensitivities are also a constant in Washington. One reason offered, without much substantiation, by Mr Bobby Ray Inman for not taking the defence secretaryship was attacks on him by Mr William Safire, the New York Times columnist, brought about, according to Mr Inman, because of Mr Safire's suspicions he might be anti-Israeli. It had appeared that Mr Talbott, serving as ambassador-at-large to the former Soviet Union, was most vulnerable to criticism on the Russian front. Having first urged maximum reform effort, he interpreted the Russian elections in December as proving a need for 'less shock, more therapy', only to recant this in the light of President Bill Clinton's commitment in Moscow last month to 'more reform and more therapy'. However, Mr Talbott clearly enjoys the confidence of Mr Clinton, whom he has known since their Oxford days 25 years ago, and of Mr Christopher, who has said it is time people of the president's generation rose to the top of foreign policy-making.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN: BALANCING THE UPS, DOWNS  OF MUSICAL COMPETITIONS  </P> <P> The spring season may occasion many things, but musical competitions tend to  sprout as densely as crab grass after a heavy spring rain. One of the area's  more venerable competitions, the La Jolla Civic-University Symphony's Young  Artists Competition, takes place this weekend at UC San Diego. Now in its 34th  year, the annual competition for young musicians who live or study in San Diego  County boasts a number of past winners whose careers have fulfilled the promise  of these early accolades.  </P> <P> The list of past winners includes concert pianist Gregory Allen, San Diego  Symphony assistant concertmaster Nicholas Grant, tenor Jose Medina, who sang  with Joan Sutherland in Pacific Opera's "Norma" last month, and pianist Kenneth  Bookstein.  </P> <P> Allen, who won the La Jolla competition in 1966, went on to win second prize in  Belgium's Queen Elisabeth Competition in 1978 and grand prize in the 1980  Arthur Rubinstein Competition in Tel Aviv. Allen has balanced his subsequent  performing career -- concerts with the Israel Philharmonic and San Francisco  Symphony, as well as recitals at the Kennedy Center and Ambassador Auditorium  -- with teaching at the University of Texas at Austin. Locally, he has  performed with the San Diego Symphony. Last month, he gave a solo recital at  Civic Theatre.  </P> <P> Reached by phone last week at his university music studio, he spoke about  winning the La Jolla competition as an aspiring 17-year-old musician.  </P> <P> "It was my first competition, although I had won some Musical Merit Foundation  scholarships that same year. The winners' concert for the La Jolla competition  was the first professional orchestra that I had ever played a concerto with."  </P> <P> Allen recalled that he played Mendelssohn's G Minor Piano Concerto, a work  which has long since fallen out of his repertory. He continued to beat the  competition trail until his final triumph in the Rubinstein Competition. As a  teacher, Allen encourages his piano students to consider the competition route,  though he does have reservations about the process.  </P> <P> "From my own experience, I felt that entering a competition was like being in  horse race. There was a time when competitions had a negative influence on my  playing."  </P> <P> He described what he calls the competition player's syndrome.  </P> <P> "It's a kind of aggressiveness, an extra musical chip on the shoulder. In terms  of playing, it is a gratuitous emphasis on fast and loud -- something that is  easy to fall into."  </P> <P> Allen was quick to admit, however, that competitions did spur him on to greater  musical accomplishments.  </P> <P> "By the time I won the Rubinstein, I had learned to treat the jury simply as  part of the audience. I coach my own students that they can't second-guess the  jury. The judges will sense if a flashy interpretation is being superimposed on  the performance for their benefit."  </P> <P> Farewell to the Fisch Competition. Three years ago, Gregory Allen returned to  San Diego to serve on the panel of judges for the first Joseph Fisch Piano  Competition, held at San Diego State University. After three competitions,  Fisch, a local arts patron and enthusiast, has decided to discontinue the  competition. According to SDSU music faculty member Karen Follingstad, Fisch  decided instead to underwrite a summer music camp for deserving high-school  pianists.  </P> <P> A dozen young pianists will be chosen for the mid-July music institute, which  will be held at SDSU. Follingstad said she and the other members of the piano  faculty were unsuccessful in their attempts to persuade Fisch to continue  supporting the competition. She admitted, however, that the summer institute  would help the university in recruiting freshman students into the music  department.  </P> <P> They met him in St. Louis. Tom Morgan, the San Diego Symphony's acting  assistant principal viola, returned to his hometown just outside St. Louis,  Mo., as a soloist last month. With violinist Rebecca Boyer, Morgan soloed in  Mozart's "Sinfonia Concertante," K. 364, with the University City Symphony, a  community orchestra that performs at St. Louis' Washington University.  </P> <P> The concert, which included Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony and three of Dvorak's  Slavonic Dances, was a family affair. Morgan's father, Robert, observed his  son's performance from the cello section of the orchestra. An engineer by  profession, the senior Morgan took up the cello about 12 years ago and is a  regular member of the University City Orchestra.  </P> <P> Lighting the Phantom. Gregory Hirsch, San Diego Opera's director of  productions, won a San Francisco Bay Area Critics' Circle award for his  lighting design in Ken Hill's "Phantom of the Opera." This satirical stage  production -- not to be confused with the Andrew Lloyd Webber extravaganza --  opened last September at San Francisco's Theater on the Square and is still  running strong.  </P> <P> More Opera Leaks. When San Diego Opera general director Ian Campbell came home  from his trip to the Soviet Union a few days before Easter, he brought with him  some disappointing news. Noted mezzo-soprano Elana Obraztsova will not be  singing in San Diego's production of Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov." Her  replacement in the local company's grand-opening salvo for the mayor's Soviet  Arts Festival is Irina Bogacheva, a regular of Leningrad's Kirov Opera.  </P></p>

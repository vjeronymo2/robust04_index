			<p>BFN     [Text] The first round of a survey conducted by the Vox  Populi Institute in 10 Brazilian states, which was published  exclusively by JORNAL DO BRASIL, shows that Brazilian voters  have not yet linked their preference for president and governors  in terms of the coalitions formed for this election. In nine  states and in the federal district -- which all told account for  76.31 percent of the total number of voters -- the preference  shown for local gubernatorial candidates has not been translated  into preference for the respective presidential candidate.    The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] is the  front-runner in three states (Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and  Ceara); the Popular Party [PP] is leading in one state (Minas  Gerais) and it is sharing the lead in another (Parana) with PDT  [Democratic Labor Party] candidate Jaime Lerner. The PMDB  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] continues to lead in Rio  Grande do Sul; the PMN [National Mobilization Party] in Bahia  State; the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party] in Pernambuco; and  the PPR [Popular Renewal Party] in Santa Catarina. The survey  shows that Senator Mario Covas, the PSDB candidate for governor  of Sao Paulo State, has the highest voters' preference in the  country -- 59 percent -- but only 14 percent of them are  confirmed votes. Miguel Arraes (PSB) has obtained 40 percent of  the confirmed votes in Pernambuco and emerges as the only  candidate who could win the election in the first round.    In Sao Paulo, Mario Covas [PSDB] leads with 59 percent;    In Santa Catarina, Angela Amin [PPR] leads with 31 percent;    In Rio de Janeiro, Marcelo Alencar [PSDB] leads with 30  percent;    In Rio Grande do Sul, Antonio Britto [PMDB] leads with 52  percent;    In Parana, Alvaro Dias [PP] and Jaime Lerner [PDT] share  the lead with 41 percent;    In Minas Gerais, Helio Costa [PP] leads with 39 percent;    In Ceara, Tasso Jereissati [PSDB] leads with 50 percent;    In Bahia, Joao Durval [PMN] leads with 29 percent;    In Pernambuco, Miguel Arraes [PSB] leads with 56 percent;  and    In the federal district, Valmir Campeao leads with 30  percent.</p>

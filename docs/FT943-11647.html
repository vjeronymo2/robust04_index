			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Companies and City satisfied with outcome It was difficult for at least nine of the 10 water and sewerage companies to hide their satisfaction yesterday at what were widely seen to be better-than-expected average price increases in the regulator's 10-year review. Welsh Water had said it would accept nothing less than a K-factor of 2 to fund capital expenditure obligations of Pounds 1bn - the K-factor is the number of percentage points above inflation by which companies can raise prices. But it said the outcome - a K-factor of 0.5 - was 'absolutely wonderful'. This was in spite of a capital spending allowance only slightly trimmed to Pounds 950m. Mr Paul Twamley, finance director, said: 'Everyone knows this is a negotiation.' It appears that Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat director-general, - who repeatedly insisted the price review process was anything but a negotiation - had been flexible towards the end of the review. In most cases, the draft K-factor issued to companies for comments at the end of May had been revised upwards for the final announcement. One water industry executive said it had been 'touch and go up to the eleventh hour' whether his company would go to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Although the K-factors were substantially less than those companies sought a year ago in their market plans, capital spending obligations had been reined in more sharply than many had expected. This was because companies had been allowed to defer spending and because estimates for costs such as population growth had been squeezed. Anglian Water, where prices will rise annually by 1.5 percentage points above inflation, said Mr Byatt had 'fixed a fair balance between shareholders and customers'. The second five years remained unacceptable, however. 'That has got to be put right at the turn of the century,' said Mr Alan Smith, managing director. Although Southern and Yorkshire refused to make their views known before considering the details, it seems South West will be the only company to appeal Mr Byatt's decisions. Southern, which is particularly vulnerable to the effects of the urban waste water review, is widely seen to be one of the biggest winners from the price review. The biggest loser was obviously South West, where Mr Byatt's decision to reduce the K-factor from 11.5 to 1.5 was greeted with some puzzlement in the industry and by the City of London. 'It looks as though they have been stitched up,' said one industry executive. In the end, the companies and the City were more optimistic than for some time on earnings and dividend prospects. Water shares rose strongly as a result, largely because of what Mr Graeme Moyse of brokers Kleinwort Benson decribed as 'gut relief' on dividend prospects. Analysts, who had been expecting dividend growth for the sector over the next five years of about 3 percentage points above inflation, said 4 percentage points now seemed achievable. Shares in regional electricity companies also moved ahead as the City considered the implications for the power sector of the water review. The electricity regulator is due to announce later this month a review of the regional companies' distribution businesses, which contribute the bulk of their profits.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       PRICING AT THE WATERSHED  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Annual price   Anglian  Northumbrian  North  Severn  Southern        increase limits                           West   Trent    (% above inflation)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                1995-96     1.5         2.5       2.5     0.5     4.0     1996-97 to 1999-00     1.5         2.5       2.5     0.5     4.0     2000-01 to 2004-05     1.5         2.0         0       0     3.0  Average over 10 years     1.5         2.2       1.2     0.2     3.5  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Last pre-tax profits   192.2        57.0     269.0   281.0   127.5       (Pounds Million) Last annual investment   372.0        84.2     423.6   445.0   175.0       (Pounds Million)  Average consumer bill     264         187       183     179     201           now (Pounds)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Annual price    South   Thames    Welsh    Wessex   Yorkshire        increase limits     West    (% above inflation)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                1995-96     1.5      0.5      0.5       1.5       2.5     1996-97 to 1999-00     1.0      0.5      0.5       0.5       2.5     2000-01 to 2004-05       0      0.5      0.5       0.5         0  Average over 10 years     0.5      0.5      0.5       1.0       1.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Last pre-tax profits    93.0    317.0    144.2     103.3     143.5       (Pounds Million) Last annual investment   203.0    367.0    180.5     115.0     220.8       (Pounds Million)  Average consumer bill     304     162       256       233       196           now (Pounds)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

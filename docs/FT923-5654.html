			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / US threatens Iraq with punitive action: Aircraft drop leaflets US military aircraft began dropping leaflets on Iraqi bases and military installations yesterday, threatening punitive action if there was any challenge to the air exclusion zone imposed on Thursday. The US, Britain and France have instructed the Iraqi government not to fly fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters south of the 32nd parallel. The aim is to protect the Shia population of the south from further persecution, although the Pentagon says Baghdad already has more than 60,000 troops together with tanks and artillery in the area. The warning in the leaflets was aimed at Iraqi pilots and ground radar controllers. The radar operators were told that they faced attack from the air if they locked on to allied aircraft, another indication that the US is prepared to engage targets on the ground. The US has also moved additional Awacs radar and control aircraft to Saudi Arabia to monitor southern Iraq. Flights by Iraqi fighter aircraft have continued north of the 32nd parallel but none has come close to the line set by the allies. The Awacs would also play a critical role in tracking any allied pilots who might be forced to eject over Iraqi territory. The US has lost two aircraft over Kuwait this month during continuing manoeuvres with local troops. A further test of Iraq's determination to challenge UN resolutions may come next week when weapons inspectors are scheduled to return to Baghdad. The UN teams, looking for evidence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, have been told by Iraq that they will not be permitted to enter government ministries. The US has warned that this would be a serious breach of UN resolutions and President Bush has made his determination to ensure full Iraqi compliance a much-repeated part of his electoral platform. But he denied reports in the New York Times that he was deliberately seeking a confrontation with Saddam Hussein to improve his election chances. The media in Baghdad and neighbouring Tehran both agreed yesterday with the New York Times assessment. 'The no-fly zone seeks to offset the decline in Bush's popularity on American streets,' claimed Tehran radio.</p>

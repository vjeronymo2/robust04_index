			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 20 (XINHUA) -- The economic gap  between China's east and its central and western regions has  been a hot topic of late in the country, so has it during the  ongoing session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC),  with a different emphasis.    NPC deputies are more interested in discussing the  significance of developing central and western regions for the  future of China and in discussing ways to narrow the gap under a  market economy.    Since the opening of the NPC session on March 10, dozens of  NPC deputies have aired their views on this issue.    Due to geological, historical and cultural causes, the gap  has always existed. Among the 328 poverty-stricken counties,  295 are in the central and western regions.    NPC deputies from the central and western regions said that  it is necessary to adopt a realistic attitude towards the gap  and narrow it through hard, long-term work.    Cheng Kejie, chairman of the people's government of the  Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, said: "The same policies of  reform and openness apply to the central and western regions as  well as to east China. This should be our point of departure  for narrowing the gap."    Yunnan Provincial Governor He Zhiqiang pointed out, "An  economy that depends on state support, on an egalitarian policy,  or on a mandatory division of market has neither vitality nor  future."    A policy researcher from Gansu Province said, the central  and  western regions should develop through market competition and  improvement of efficiency, though state assistance and support  from eastern areas are indispensable for the time being.    In the past 10 days, top Chinese leaders exchanged views  with  NPC deputies of some 20 provincial-level delegations, of which  the overwhelming majority are from central and western provinces  and regions. The leaders have repeatedly underscored the  central authorities' concern for the economically underdeveloped  areas.    A number of motions submitted to the current session demand  that narrowing the gap between the east and the rest of China be  slated for economic legislation and that economic laws include  support for economically underdeveloped areas.    In short, accelerating development of central and western  regions is a consensus reached at the current NPC session.    The central and western regions account for 89 percent of  China's land area, people there take up 64 percent of the  national population, and borderline extends more than 20,000  kilometers.    Some NPC deputies said, the central and western regions have  opportunities and advantages to accelerate development. With  implementation of the new opening up strategy, the vast central  and western regions will play a role of growing importance.    Rich natural resources are another main advantage of the  central and western regions. A guideline for China's economic  development in the next decade is to shift the energy- and raw  material-gobbling industries to areas which have rich energy and  other natural resources.    The industrial shift will bring opportunities for western  areas. For instance, Qinghai Province will have the unique  advantage of developing power, mining, metallurgical and salt  chemical industries.    Many deputies pointed out, the large number of old  enterprises, military industrial firms and strong technological  force in the central and western areas provide a sound basis for  attracting overseas funds.    Some deputies from the western regions have identified their  deficiencies in comparison with eastern areas. Cui Lintao,  mayor of Xian city in Shaanxi Province, said that the eastern  areas have mobilized, organized and made good use of economic  factors such as labor, professionals, technology and funds while  in the rest of China, especially in Shaanxi Province, many  economic factors are lying idle or being wasted. "This should  be solved from the causes of the system and concepts," he said.    The Chinese Government has decided to implement a program  rooting up poverty and helping the 80 million people below the  poverty line have sufficient food and clothing by the turn of  the century. NPC deputies expressed their hearty support for  the program.    They said economic development in the central and western  areas should give priority to agriculture, especially the  construction of water conservancy projects. They also stressed  the development of local resources and rural enterprises. At  present rural enterprises in the central and western regions  accounted for only 35 percent of the national total.    The State Council has decided to earmark loans to support  rural enterprises in central and western regions from 1993 to  2000.    Moreover, the Ministry of Agriculture has worked out a  program to promote cooperation of rural enterprises between the  east and the rest of China, including 100 pilot cooperative  zones and 1,000 pilot projects.    Some economists among the NPC deputies said that such  cooperation will benefit both sides. With the development of  productive forces, new industries, products, technology and  management expertise should shift from the east to other parts  of the country. Otherwise, further development in the east will  be impeded.    Jiangsu Province Governor Chen Huanyou said the coastal  provinces must find the driving force for their economies from  the central and western regions if they want to maintain a  long-term high growth rate. "Without development of the central  and western parts, development of the eastern areas will be  restrained in the long run," he added.    Jiangsu, which has developed processing industries but lacks  natural resources, has established good relations with Xinjiang  Uygur and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regions and Gansu and Shaanxi  Provinces in the northwest. It has provided skilled workers,  equipment, technology and information while setting up a number  of enterprises to develop local resources.    Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju said the cooperation of the eastern  part with the rest of China means integration of advanced  technology, financial resources and management experience in the  east with rich raw materials, energy and labor force in the rest  of the country. The integration will promote development of  rural enterprises in the central and western areas while  expanding new channels for the east to adjust its industrial  structure and update products.    Deputies from Shanghai and coastal provinces such as  Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang and Shandong said they have  established various economic ties with central and western  regions.    Deputies from the central and western regions have also  reported encouraging news of their economic progress during the  current NPC session. Many sleepy, remote border towns have  become busy trade centers.    When talking with deputies from Shaanxi Province, Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji said that the vast central and western  regions have a great potential. The economic takeoff of China's  central and western regions is the country's hope in the 21st  century.</p>

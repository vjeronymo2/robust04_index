			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / OECD lists top three research spenders THE US, Germany and Japan top the league of industrialised countries investing in research and development, a motor of economic growth, according to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development statistics published yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. But while 60 per cent of US money goes into military projects, Bonn and Tokyo are most active in funding civilian science and technology, reaping rich export benefits. Figures released by the 24-nation OECD as science ministers met in Paris showed that research and development accounted for 2.8 per cent of US, German and Japanese gross domestic product. This compared with only 1.3 per cent in Canada and Italy. Private enterprise accounts for most science spending in Japan and Germany but the government finances half of all research and development in the US. Only in France does the government role in funding approach the US level. Defence takes the lion's share of research and development budgets in the US and a sizeable share in Britain and France - but gets less than 11 per cent in Germany and Japan, the figures showed. The US was one of the few OECD countries where the share of research and development carried out in the civilian business sector did not grow in the 1980s. Japan, with the fastest growth rate for private sector science spending, became even more oriented towards industrial research and development. In the European Community, industrial investment in research and development grew through the 1980s while the proportion financed by governments declined significantly.</p>

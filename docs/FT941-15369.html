			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Lloyd's refuses to renegotiate offer to Names Lloyd's of London yesterday refused to reopen negotiations over its Pounds 900m settlement offer, amid increasing indications that a majority of Names  -the individuals who have traditionally supported the insurance market - will vote down the deal next month. Mr Peter Middleton, the chief executive of the insurance market, said Lloyd's had considered a possible suspension of the offer to allow talks to take place, but had rejected the idea because such a move could 'give rise to wrong expectations'. He added: 'People would infer that we can increase the offer when we can't. There isn't going to be another offer. We aren't going to devote any more time to it. 'Names have got to understand that this is it.' Two of the biggest groups of loss-making Names - Gooda Walker and Feltrim - are expected to reject the deal when they meet next week. Some 3,000 Gooda Walker Names are likely to vote to pursue legal claims for Pounds 580m through the courts when they meet on Monday. The committee of the Feltrim Names Association, which in a letter to its members earlier this week called for fresh talks with Lloyd's, has also recommended against acceptance of the offer. Both groups would receive less than 40p in the pound from the offer. Names must decide on the deal by February 14. Success depends on at least 70 per cent of Names, by value of the offer, voting in favour. Mr Middleton conceded that the deal was imperfect but said it offered certainty to loss-making Names. He said errors and omissions insurers, which cover Lloyd's agents against legal awards for negligence, would not increase their contribution - understood to be about Pounds 400m - to the settlement package. The offer document states that between Pounds 820m and Pounds 1.085bn of eroors and omissions cover is available to meet claims of Pounds 2.8bn by Names covered by the deal. Mr Middleton said not all this cover would be triggered by successful legal action. If Names rejected the offer it would be unlikely that Lloyd's could revive the deal, he predicted. 'My concern is that a number of Names will reject the offer and regret it,' he said. Mr Middleton sought to play down the impact of rejection on Lloyd's business prospects. These are now viewed as more positive after increases in insurance rates and a much stronger inflow of capital into the market. 'If they think they'll do better in the courts that's fine by me,' he said.</p>

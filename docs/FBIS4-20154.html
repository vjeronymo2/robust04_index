			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation, a month after the general elections,  is that President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has ended his  consultations [to form a government], and Forza Italia leader  Silvio Berlusconi is one step away from being asked to form the  next government. Fabrizio Ferragni reports from the Quirinale  [president's official office and residence]:    [Ferragni] Behind me you can see President Scalfaro, who has  just emerged. He came here about five minutes ago to say hello  to us -- the journalists who have been following the meetings.    The president made a short statement. There were no  questions. Basically he said that he was the guarantor -- in the  last few days the subject of guarantors has been discussed. I  will be the guarantor of the Constitution, of the principles of  the Constitution, and of the unity of this country, he said.    Scalfaro is expected to ask someone to form a government  tomorrow morning, and it is almost certain that it will be  Silvio Berlusconi.</p>

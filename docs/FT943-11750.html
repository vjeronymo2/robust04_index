			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Animated films edge Disney ahead The continued runaway success of Walt Disney's new and classic animated films helped the US entertainment group shrug off lower theme park attendances to post a slight improvement in third-quarter profits, to Dollars 267.5m, or 49 cents a share. In the same period a year ago, the group earned Dollars 259.1m, or 48 cents. The results, which came in above Wall Street analysts' forecasts, were welcome news for the company, whose fortunes have suffered recently from the death in April of Mr Frank Wells, president, and the sudden incapacitation of Mr Michael Eisner, the chairman, who underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery 10 days ago. These events raised a question over the depth of management at Disney, and revealed differences within the group over who should succeed Mr Eisner when he retires. Yesterday's announcement of third-quarter results, however, helped reassure shareholders that in spite of Disney's travails, its earnings continue to grow. Revenues in the period climbed 22 per cent to Dollars 2.35bn, thanks to record revenues from the film and consumer products divisions, both of which were buoyed by the success of Disney's animated films. Film revenues jumped 53 per cent to Dollars 1bn, powered by the box-office hit The Lion King, an animation feature which was released in June and sold Dollars 186m in tickets during its first six weeks. Heavy demand in the US home video market for The Return of Jafar, a sequel to the top-selling Aladdin animated film, also contributed greatly to revenue growth. The popularity of Disney's new animated films, and classics such as Jungle Book and Bambi, helped boost earnings at the group's consumer products division, where revenues rose 38 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 407.6m. Sales of The Lion King merchandise and records were especially strong. The one disappointment in the quarter was the performance of Disney's theme parks and resorts division, which reported a 4 per cent decline in revenues to Dollars 942.2m. The group blamed the decline in park attendance on a fall in the number of foreign tourists, and on the continued impact on its California attractions of January's Los Angeles earthquake. The other negative influence on Disney's quarterly earnings was EuroDisneyLand, the struggling French theme park 49 per cent-owned by the US group. Disney said it took a charge of Dollars 52.8m in the third quarter to cover the cost of its contribution to an emergency financial restructuring of the Euro Disney group. Disney's shares closed down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 42 1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.</p>

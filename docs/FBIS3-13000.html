The English-language daily TEHRAN TIMES argued: "If  relations  are indeed re-established, the US stands to gain a lot more than  Iran, therefore it should be prepared to make greater  concessions."    Iran and the United States have not had diplomatic ties  since  1980, one year after the Islamic revolution which toppled the  pro-American shah, whose regime was a major US ally in the  Middle East.    But last week President Bill Clinton's adviser Anthony Lake,  and Under Secretary of State for the Middle East Robert  Pelletreau reported that Washington was ready to start talks  with Iran.    The Iranian Government has so far not reacted officially to  the US statements, but has indirectly welcomed the moves via  favourable press reports, while restating its conditions for  opening Iran-US talks.    The TEHRAN TIMES said: "Iran has left open the possibility  of  reconciliation with the US provided that America releases Iran's  assets which are frozen in American banks and refrains from  covert and overt operations aimed at destabilizing the Islamic  Republic."    Iranian officials estimate more than 10 billion dollars are  currently frozen in the United States.    The daily said the United States "is finally trying to come  to terms with the political realities of the Islamic Republic,  after 14 years of efforts to undermine its legitimacy."    It attributed the recent US gesture to a refusal by European  countries to take part in the US bid to isolate Tehran, and also  to the "failure of the US imposed Middle East peace talks."    This has prompted "Washington to consider using Tehran's  spiritual influence in the Islamic world to revive the peace  accord," the TEHRAN TIMES added.    Last week the KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL, a daily close to Islamic  hardliners traditionally opposed to the United States, spoke in  favor of "a negotiated solution" to "bring an end to the  hostility" between the countries.</p>

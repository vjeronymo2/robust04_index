			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Gun crime rises sharply in US Violent crimes committed with handguns set a record in the US in 1992, soaring almost 50 per cent from the annual average during the previous five years, Reuter reports from Washington. The Justice Department said yesterday that handguns had been used in 931,000 murders, rapes, robberies and assaults in 1992. This was up from an annual average of 667,000 from 1987 to 1991. Handgun crimes accounted for an increased percentage - now about 13 per cent  -of all violent crimes, it said. The figures - from the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics - were released as the Clinton administration and Congress are considering new ways to restrict guns to cut down on rampant inner-city violence. President Bill Clinton has already signed into law the so-called Brady Bill requiring a five-day waiting period for the purchase of handguns. He has also vigorously supported legislation banning a number of assault weapons. Ms Janet Reno, the attorney-general, has advocated gun licensing and is considering whether to propose such a system nationwide. The department's report said the number of murders with a handgun totalled 13,200 in 1992, a 24 per cent jump from the five-year average. The murder numbers were based on FBI crime statistics. The other statistics, from a nationwide crime victims' survey, also showed dramatic increases for robberies and assaults involving a handgun. The only crime category to show a decrease was rape, with handguns used in 11,800 cases in 1992, down from the previous annual average of 14,000. The report also found that: Males were twice as likely as females to be victims of handgun crimes, and blacks three times as likely as whites. Young, black males were most vulnerable to handgun crimes. Among males 16-to-19 years old, the most victimised age group, the crime rate for blacks was four times higher than for whites. For rapes, burglaries and assaults, the offenders fired their weapons in 17 per cent of the crimes and missed the victim four out of five times. Only 1 per cent of the violent crime victims used a firearm in an effort to defend themselves. Of those who used a weapon, one out of five suffered an injury in the incident.</p>

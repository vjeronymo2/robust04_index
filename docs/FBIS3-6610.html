			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "Undercurrent" column article: "Danger Signal </F> for Japan-U.S. Aviation Friction"]    [Text] Just before its inauguration, the United States  notified Japan that it would postpone approval for a regular  Sendai-Honolulu flight by Japan Airlines [JAL]. It was also  disclosed that the term approved for several routes operated by  Japanese airlines had been shortened. On 18 March, the Ministry  of Transport [MOT] decided to take countermeasures by shortening  the approved term of operation for U.S. airlines. These are  clear signs that "aviation friction" between Japan and the  United States is intensifying. At the moment these moves seem  to be part of the jockeying for advantage as the prelude to the  next round of aviation talks. However, the MOT has said that  "if the U.S. is not perceived to be acting sincerely in the  measures it takes, further countermeasures will be considered."  There is, therefore, a clear danger that the confrontation will  be intensified.    What underlies the tough attitude being taken by the United  States is the difference in view between Washington and Tokyo  over the issue of beyond rights -- such rights would allow U.S.  airlines to extend their routes beyond Japan to third countries.  Current beyond rights are based on the Aviation Agreement  signed in 1952. Based on this, U.S. airlines have extended  flights beyond Japan to 10 places, including Singapore. For  flights to Kansai International Airport [in Osaka], which is  scheduled to open in September, the United States is demanding  that its airlines be granted unlimited rights to extend flights  beyond the new airport.    In response, the MOT says that "the Aviation Agreement  indicates that efforts be centered on promoting flights between  Japan and the United States," and that "attempts to expand  beyond rights are tantamount to an abuse of such rights."    Japanese airlines have only one beyond-rights flight from  Narita to San Paulo via Los Angeles (operated by JAL). This is  an obvious inequality and the MOT, therefore, will not change  its position on the exercise of beyond rights.    It is very important for American companies to secure beyond  rights that give them advantages on Pacific flights, a market  that is currently growing. United Airlines and other airlines  are strongly dissatisfied that their requests to start new  flights through the exercise of beyond rights have been denied.  And the recent announcement of the shortening of the approved  operating period for certain flights can be taken as "the U.S.  making clear its dissatisfaction over the beyond rights issue."    A Foreign Ministry source said: "Friction in the field of  aviation is one thing, but a deterioration in Japan-U.S.  relations caused by the trade surplus is quite another."    However, Japan now faces another problem in addition to the  dispute over the deadlocked Japan-U.S. economic framework talks.  Bargaining is expected to continued until the resumption of  Japan-U.S. aviation talks.    In the meantime, it has been said that "the point at issue  now is how far can Japan stick to its hardline position while it  is being pressured to improve its relationship with the United  States."    It is highly likely that the MOT will have difficulties  tackling this problem.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US shares slip back on easier dollar Wall Street US blue chips finished modestly higher even though a soft dollar and rising commodity prices sent the bond market into retreat, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average improved 7.37 to 3,766.35 on program-guided buying which erased a 15-point deficit in the final half-hour of the session. But the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.56 lower at 454.92, as declines on the Big Board led advances, 1,131 to 997. The monthly 'double witching' expiration of stock options and future contracts, which was responsible for the Dow's late surge, lifted trading volume to 295m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite pushed in positive territory, closing 1.16 better at 438.20. But the Nasdaq composite, down 0.61 to 726.70, tilted in the opposite direction. Generally stocks traced movements in the bond market, where prices turned lower after six straight days of improvement. Later the benchmark 30-year government bonds were showing a solid loss as traders considered an array of unfavourable developments. Rising commodity prices were troubling, and the market was concerned about an influx of next week's supply influx. Most vexing, however, was the persistent instability of the dollar, which weakened further against the D-mark and failed to make any progress against the yen. But even though the long bond was down, the damage to equities was modest. Stocks were helped by the perception that the pull-back in Treasuries mostly reflected a technical adjustment after the surge that followed Tuesday's move by the Federal Reserve to lift short-term interest rates. The blue chips may have ended the week on a sour note if it were not for a Dollars 2 3/8 improvement by Philip Morris to Dollars 53 3/8 . Some 4.5m shares exchanged hands, though there was no apparent news behind the brisk activity. Sears contributed to the advance with a gain of Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 50 7/8 . JC Penney dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 50 1/2 after forecasting its 1994 revenue growth at 5 to 7 per cent. In the automobile sector, Chrysler climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 48 3/8 a day after announcing a 25 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend. Ford added Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 59 3/4 and GM Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 55 3/8 . Hewlett Packard raised its dividend and was rewarded Dollars  7/8 mark-up in its share price to Dollars 81 3/4 . In energy, Amoco jumped Dollars 2 to Dollars 57 1/4 after Prudential Securities upgraded the stock. Chevron reversed an early loss to finish Dollars 1 up at Dollars 88 3/4 . UAL, parent of United Airlines, dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 119 3/8 . The recent decline in the value of stock has led the carrier's pilots to seek a renegotiation of a Dollars 4.6bn employee buy-out deal. Other airline stocks held steady. On the Nasdaq, technology and software stocks were mixed after a two-day rally. Cyrix gave back Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 22 5/8 , Wellfleet slipped Dollars 1 5/16 to Dollars 28 and Apple Dollars 1 1/16 to Dollars 31 1/8 . But Lotus Development gained Dollars 2 to close at Dollars 60. Canada Toronto prices traded within a narrow range and closed a up in light trading ahead of Canada's Victoria Day holiday weekend. The TSE-300 index gained 12.70 points, or 0.30 per cent, to 4,298.38, for a gain on the week of about 123 points. Advances led declines 400 to 338. Volume of 59.541m was down slightly from yesterday's 59.949m. Trading value was CDollars 644.5m CDollars 648.7m. Gold stocks led today's advance, with an index gain of 3.89 per cent. In that group, Placer Dome was up 1  5/8 to 32  1/4 , American Barrick rose 1 1/2 to 34  1/8 and Echo Bay added  5/8 to 15  5/8 . Brazil Sao Paulo prices advanced for the third day in a row to end up 1.1 per cent in moderate trade, bolstered by continued domestic and foreign buying despite a mild bout of profit-taking in the afternoon session. The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended up 232 at 20,317 points. Turnover was CR423.1bn (Dollars 253.7m).</p>

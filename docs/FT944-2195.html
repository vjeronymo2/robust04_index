			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / US halts trade talks with China The US has suspended talks with China over copyright infringements, risking a serious rupture that could further complicate Beijing's negotiations to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and thereby become a founder member of Gatt's successor, the World Trade Organisation. In Hong Kong yesterday, a US trade official said talks in Beijing on intellectual property rights were 'suspended' on Thursday. 'The Chinese did not make any serious offers. We couldn't continue. There was no point,' the official said. Mr Lee Sands, assistant US trade representative, left Beijing abruptly for Hong Kong, after three days of discussions. The US and China have been haggling for months over the copyright issue. In Washington, trade officials said there was 'no explicit linkage' between the bilateral dispute with China over intellectual property and the question of Chinese membership of the World Trade Organisation. But adherence to trading rules was a precondition of membership in the multinational organisation, officials said. The US earlier this year placed China on a priority list of foreign countries infringing copyright covenants. Beijing was given until the end of the year to put its house in order or risk sanctions under section 301 of the US Trade Act. Even if Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, decides not to extend the negotiating deadline - an option if he determines agreement may yet be reached - sanctions would not be immediately enforced. The US would first publish a list of targeted Chinese products, in effect allowing more time for resolution. The US is urging China to close 29 factories producing pirated laser and compact discs for export. Beijing says it has taken action against these factories, but American officials dispute this. US accusations of Chinese bad faith over what it says are rampant copyright violations could hardly come at a more awkward moment. The Gatt working group on China is due to reconvene in Geneva on Tuesday in an attempt to reconcile wide differences over terms for Chinese entry. Washington has nominated copyright infringements as one of the key areas to be addressed if China is to satisfy requirements for accession to the Gatt. Exasperated US officials said that if anything piracy had worsened in China over the past 18 months. They cited the case of a factory in Shenzhen, the special economic zone adjacent to Hong Kong, offering new release films on laser disc that are not yet available in the US. China, meanwhile, has indicated that it is not in the mood for substantial concessions in its Gatt talks in Geneva. Ms Wu Yi, the foreign trade minister, warned that China would not yield to pressure. China applied to rejoin Gatt in 1986, but negotiations have proved difficult over such issues as the pace of tariff reform and market access to services and farm sectors.</p>

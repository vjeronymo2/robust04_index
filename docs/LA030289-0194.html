			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE:: SANTA ANA HEIGHTS;  </P> <P> FOCUS;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA HEIGHTS HAS A PROBLEM IN THE SKIES  </P> <P> Offer to sell a large Orange County home -- within putting distance of a  country club -- for less than $250,000 and lots of folks would break out the  smiles and the checkbooks, right?  </P> <P> Not quite.  </P> <P> Spacious homes of 2,600 to 3,000 square feet, many with Southern  plantation-style facades and expansive lawns, line streets with names like  Orchard and Cypress and Acacia, but buyers are not lining up. The reason seems  inexplicable unless you happen to be standing outside one of these houses at 7  a.m. as a 135,000-pound Boeing 737 shudders into the early morning air.  </P> <P> The residents of Santa Ana Heights, an unincorporated area wedged between the  Newport and Corona del Mar freeways, have been waking up to the roar of mammoth  metal birds every morning since jet aircraft started flying out of nearby John  Wayne Airport more than 20 years ago. Noise reduction devices fitted to modern  jets have lessened the roar of individual planes, but the increase in traffic  (now about 2,600 departures each month, most of which take off over Santa Ana  Heights) has negated much of the effect.  </P> <P> Everything from telephone conversations to television viewing is blanketed by  the roar of engines. One 26-year resident packed away his outdoor barbecue,  retreating to the relative quiet of his dining room for the meals and  entertaining that he once conducted in his pleasant back yard.  </P> <P> And noise has not been his only problem. Nitrous acid from jet exhaust was  corroding the lanterns and wind chimes that swung around his patio. Now these  adornments have joined the barbecue in storage.  </P> <P> The omnipresent buzz of jet traffic over this otherwise placid neighborhood may  have resulted in life-style changes for some residents. But many more worry  about the effect of the noise problem on real estate values. According to one  homeowner, houses in Santa Ana Heights sell for an average of $199,634, whereas  homes in nearby areas, not within the flight path, sell for between $300,000  and $400,000.  </P> <P> The county has offered to retrofit the homes of interested residents with the  latest sound-proofing gadgetry, or to buy the houses at "fair market value." So  far, though, relatively few homeowners have taken up the offer.  </P> <P> Frustrated by the obvious problems and yet ambivalent about the thought of ever  leaving, one Santa Ana Heights resident quietly reflected: "Our friends, our  churches -- everyone is here. This is home. . . . We've lived with the jet  noise since 1968, and I guess we'll just have to put up with it."  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1988 est.) 2,869  </P> <P> 1980-88 change: +9.9%  </P> <P> Median age: 33.5  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix:  </P> <P> White: (non-Latino) 90%  </P> <P> Latino: 7%  </P> <P> Black: *%  </P> <P> Other: 3%  </P> <P> By sex and age:  </P> <P> MALES  </P> <P> Median age: 33.9 years  </P> <P> FEMALES  </P> <P> Median age: 33.0 years  </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $15,530  </P> <P> Median household: $34,141  </P> <P> Average household: $35,104  </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 34%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 23%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,999: 37%  </P> <P> More than $75,000: 6%  </P></p>

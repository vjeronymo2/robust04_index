			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Country life THAT YESTERDAY'S report on the problems of country life in the UK was produced by the Duke of Westminster will strike some as an irony. Landowners like the duke are among the wealthiest individuals in British society - and far from the image of rural despair and deprivation which the report highlights. However, if the duke's report were to spark off a debate about how best to conserve and develop Britain's countryside, it would have performed a valuable service. The rural economy is coming under great strain, not least as a result of changes in the EC's Common Agricultural Policy, which may take 1.5m acres of farmland out of production. Tourism and leisure activities could replace much of this activity, but at the cost of changes which many will judge undesirable. This decline occurs at a time when better private transport has made most English countryside an economic and social extension of the town. Villages within easy travelling distance of large cities become dormitory suburbs for commuters or weekend retreats for town-dwellers. Shops and banks are no longer viable and jobs are scarce. New arrivals are often more anxious to preserve the countryside as they find it than to see the sort of dynamic economic development which in previous centuries shaped today's rural landscape. Rejuvenating the rural economy means bringing new businesses to the countryside, in the same way as urban policy seeks to encourage private investors to look anew at the inner cities. The duke is right to suggest a review of planning controls, since these often unreasonably impede the development of rural industry and commerce. The report also reminds us that there is real poverty behind the Laura Ashley images of village life. A quarter of rural households are below the poverty line. Many are trapped in villages by the lack of public transport: one rural household in five has no car. Young people who want to work in the country find few employment opportunities; housing is also difficult, with wealthier buyers from the city outbidding locals. The duke is, however, weaker when it comes to solutions, especially his desire for the government to provide extra funds for the countryside. The case for increasing the amount of land under forestry can be made, less so that for tax incentives. Arguments for subsidising forestry are not as good as those for subsidising coal mining. Nor are greater subsidies for rural public transport more defensible: many people living on urban housing estates suffer at least as much from poor bus and train services. And while small rural schools might be supported in an ideal world, keeping them open with unviable rolls absorbs educational resources which could be better used elsewhere. The report commends the subsidies which the government demands of the utilities for their rural customers, who pay the same charges irrespective of any greater costs. This, however, is hardly a model to be recommended. Rural poverty and unacceptably poor basic services are best dealt with by clearly targetted benefits or subsidies.</p>

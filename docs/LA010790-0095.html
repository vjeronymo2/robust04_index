			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCIAL AGENCY EVICTED; CITY TAKES CONTROL;  </P> <P> CUDAHY: COUNCIL, HOWEVER, VOTES TO RETAIN DIRECTOR JAMES GRAHAM. COUNCILMEN  QUESTION ONCE-CRITICAL COLLEAGUE'S VOTE IN FAVOR OF GRAHAM NOT LONG AFTER LIBEL  SUIT IS DROPPED.  </P> <P> A divided City Council voted to evict the controversial Cudahy Social Service  Agency from a city-owned building and take over the agency's food distribution  program for the needy.  </P> <P> But the council, by a 3-2 vote, also decided to leave the program in the charge  of the agency's director, James Graham, who was heading the agency when city  officials, citing inadequate record-keeping, cut off funds in 1988. Graham will  be paid $36,000 a year.  </P> <P> One of the votes to retain Graham was cast by Councilman John Robertson, who  had been highly critical of Graham, and had been named as a defendant by Graham  in a libel suit. Graham announced Tuesday at the council meeting that he had  dropped the suit late last year.  </P> <P> Two agency supporters, Councilmen Bill Colon and Tom Thurman, joined Robertson  in voting to cancel the agency's lease and to take immediate possession of the  city-owned building, which also has been occupied by four other nonprofit  organizations that rented offices from the Cudahy Social Service Agency.  </P> <P> Under the plan, all but one of the agencies will continue to operate in the  building. The agencies provide food, clothing, advice and other help to  disadvantaged people.  </P> <P> "We don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water," Robertson said last  week after the meeting. "We still need these services in Cudahy. Hopefully now  we will function better than before."  </P> <P> Mayor Joseph Graffio and Councilman Joe Fregeau voted against the proposal and  questioned Robertson's motives during a raucous council session. Graffio and  Fregeau pointed out that Robertson's proposal surfaced after Graham decided to  drop the lawsuit.  </P> <P> Robertson later vehemently denied any such connection. "I get tired of  answering all these charges against me . . . wild accusations are not the way  to conduct business," he said. "Mr. Graham and I have had our disagreements,  but he has the background. I didn't have another suggestion. Graham just didn't  have the support before. He's not the real problem here. The real problem is  that the two Joes (Graffio and Fregeau) want to throw the whole thing out. They  don't want social services in Cudahy."  </P> <P> At the meeting, Graham said he dropped the suit because he "got tired of  fighting." He could not be reached for further comment.  </P> <P> The council decision is the latest chapter in the Cudahy Social Service  Agency's controversial history. City officials suspended payments to the agency  from Community Development Block Grant funds in September, 1988, after an  independent audit found that the agency could not adequately document how it  was spending its money. One month later, the city tried to evict the agency for  nonpayment of rent. In August, 1989, the city's Redevelopment Agency, which  leases the building, approved an out-of-court settlement for $40,000 in back  rent.  </P> <P> Eviction efforts were renewed last month after city officials learned that the  state Franchise Tax Board had suspended the agency's nonprofit status for  failure to file income tax returns. At Tuesday's meeting, City Atty. Glenn  Watson informed the council that it could cancel the agency's lease since the  agency was not recognized as a legal nonprofit corporation.  </P> <P> Robertson then presented the council with a plan to take immediate possession  of the building, draw up leases with the four independent social service  agencies renting offices in the building, and retain Graham.  </P> <P> The proposal also prevents any councilman from maintaining an office in the  building, a reference to charges that Colon, who is up for reelection this  year, was using the building as his political headquarters.  </P> <P> Colon had worked as a volunteer at the Cudahy Social Service Agency, and  recently formed Operation Upbeat, a youth agency that had an office in the  building. Colon, who previously denied using the office for political purposes,  said that he has moved the youth program.  </P> <P> After Fregeau denounced the plan during the council meeting, Graham said he was  sick of fighting over the agency. He said angrily that he would get the lease  and "burn it in front of you on the podium, if that will make you happy."  </P> <P> Graffio and Fregeau also questioned plans to reduce tenants' rent to about $60  a month each from about $375 each. The reduced rent would not allow the city to  pay $3,000 a month to retain Graham and pay the building's electricity bills,  which run about $2,000 a month, according to the councilmen.  </P> <P> They also said the city should make arrangements with other agencies to  distribute food and clothing, rather than taking over those programs from the  Social Service Agency.  </P> <P> But it was Robertson's proposal to retain Graham as director that generated  most of the debate.  </P> <P> Robertson once accused Graham of misusing agency funds and demanded a grand  jury investigation. In the fall of 1988, shortly after Robertson's accusations  were published, Graham announced that he was filing a libel suit.  </P> <P> At Tuesday's meeting, Fregeau questioned whether Robertson could introduce a  motion to retain Graham, saying the libel suit created a conflict of interest.  Graham then told the council that he had dropped the suit. He said he did not  remember exactly when he withdrew the suit, but said he believed it was  sometime in November or December.  </P> <P> Graham had announced at a council meeting in mid-December that he had resigned  as the agency's director. He said Tuesday that the board of directors refused  to accept his letter of resignation.  </P> <P> But Georgia Scrivner, one of the board members, said the board had not met, nor  had she had any contact with the other two members.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments relating to the Panamanian elections  scheduled for 8 May.    Ruben Dario Carles, "Change 94" presidential candidate,  travelled to Colombia where he met with Colombian President  Cesar Gaviria to discuss economic issues that will  ``undoubtedly'' benefit the socioeconomic development of Panama.  On this occasion, Carles also met with Argentina's President  Carlos Menem, who was also visiting Colombia. (Panama City EL  SIGLO in Spanish 25 Feb 94 pp 16, 17)    Carles told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that if he is elected  president on 8 May, he will send a delegation to Washington on 9  May to renegotiate the U.S. military presence in exchange for  economic benefits. Carles accused the Democratic Revolutionary  Party, PRD, of "waging a friendly opposition campaign against  the government." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish  28 Feb 94 p A1)    "Change 94" presidential candidate Carles said once he is  elected president, he will organize a commission to promote  investments and the creation of jobs. "This commission will be  placed directly under the president and will be composed of  representatives from business groups, worker associations, and  the government. All investment projects will be presented to  them." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT  1 Mar 94)    Yesterday, Mireya Gruber, Arnulfist Party presidential  candidate, said that just because a party member meets with an  official of a former regime does not mean her party wants to  negotiate with the military. With regard to presidential  candidate Carles' interest in talking to the military, she  limited herself to saying: "I imagine that as a politician he  will want to talk to all sectors." (Panama City LA PRENSA in  Spanish 26 Feb 94 p 5A)    Fernando Manfredo, Papa Egoro vice presidential candidate,  denied rumors of disagreement with the party's presidential  candidate Ruben Blades, as has been rumored in political  circles. Manfredo said: "The voters appear somewhat cynical;  they are not impressed by those demagogic speeches and false  promises. I think this is the current campaign's tendency."  (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 23 Feb  94)    Yesterday, PRD candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares returned  from his trip to the United States, where he met with U.S.  investors. Perez Balladares told the media upon his arrival that  he had met with the board of directors of the NEW YORK TIMES and  THE MIAMI HERALD, and contacted the Latin Chamber of Commerce  and the Miami mayor. Perez Balladares said: "We established ties  to work jointly in possible investments and trade exchanges  starting 1 September." (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in  Spanish 2300 GMT 23 Feb 94)    Perez Balladares said that if he wins the May elections he  will not grant amnesty nor pardon former civilian and military  collaborators of the former regime, if they have been found  guilty of committing a crime and sentenced. (Panama City LA  PRENSA in Spanish 25 Feb 94 p 1A)    Perez Balladres travelled to Mexico City to meet with Luis  Donaldo Colosio, Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate.  Perez Balladares said: "Had I been president, I would have  investigated more thoroughly General Torrijos' death." (Panama  City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 26 Feb 94 p 1)    Perez Balladares thinks candidate Carles' offer to solve the  nation's main problem in 100 days "is an insult to the  Panamanian people's intelligence." In statements to LA ESTRELLA  DE PANAMA, Perez Balladares said it was "very irresponsible" to  request that U.S. military bases remain after 2000. (Panama City  LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 28 Feb 94 p A1)    Presidential candidate Samuel Lewis Galindo of the National  Consensus Alliance called ``irresponsible'' statements by former  Health Minister Guillermo Rolla Pimental, who said money used by  breweries and the PRD in political campaigns are generated by  money laundering and drug trafficking." (Panama City LA ESTRELLA  DE PANAMA in Spanish 26 Feb 94 p 1)    Although the most recent polls do not favor candidate Lewis  Galindo, yesterday he admitted he does believe in this type of  information. In addition, he criticized presidential candidate  Carles for not "adequately managing" the public debt when he was  comptroller general. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in  Spanish 26 Feb 94 p A1)    Lewis Galindo told LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that military bases  must not be offered to the United States if they do not ask for  them because "one must maintain one's dignity. The public must  be consulted" regarding any proposal on this issue, said Lewis.  (Panama City, LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in Spanish 28 Feb 94 p A1)    On 25 February Lewis Galindo presented his state  modernization program. He hopes to improve the nation's public  administration with the program. Lewis Galindo said: "We must  put our house in order. Those who think that because they have  personal contacts and relationships, they can obtain funds and  credits are making a serious error and are mistaken. Until we  have a modern, flexible state that does not hinder local  investors, much less foreign investors, we will not achieve  anything." (Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish  1730 GMT 28 Feb 94)    Four of the seven Panamanian presidential candidates  participated in the inauguration of CADE 94, the Annual  Conference of Business Executives, today in Bambito, Chiriqui  province under the slogan, Concrete Alternatives for Development  of the Western Part of the Nation, that is, Chiriqui and Bocas  del Toro. Ruben Dario Carles, "Change 94" candidate, denied  accusations that he had paid international financial  institutions. Samuel Lewis Galindo, National Consensus Alliance  candidate; Eduardo Vallarino, Christian Democratic Party  candidate; and Ernesto Perez Balladares, PRD candidate, spoke in  the afternoon. Mireya de Gruber, Arnulfist Candidate; Ruben  Blades, Papa Egoro candidate; and Salvador Munoz, Panamenist  Doctrinate Party candidate, sent messages saying they would not  participate in the conference. (Panama City Circuito RPC  Television in Spanish 1730 GMT 26 Feb 94)    Electoral Tribunal President Guillermo Marquez estimates  that  between 350,000 to 375,000 voters will not go to the polls on 8  May. Recent polls indicate that 20 to 25 percent of the voters  will not vote. Marquez indicated that 40 to 50 international  observers will be present at the 8 May elections.

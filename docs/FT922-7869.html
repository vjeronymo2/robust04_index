			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Arts: A deliciously scandalous painter - Fine art IF EVER a painter had the luck of the gods, it was Henri Gervex. Son of a Montmartre piano-maker, Gervex floated up through French society with the effortlessness of Montgolfier's balloon. At his death in 1929 Gervex was wealthy and fabulously well-connected. His daughter had married into the aristocracy, and his paintings graced some of the grandest dining-rooms in Europe. Now, in a modest way, the Gervex balloon is once more on the way up, thanks to an exhibition which has just opened in Bordeaux. (Next year, it travels to Paris and Nice.) There has never been a retrospective of the great arriviste, so tracking his canvasses to the homes of private collectors has meant a good deal of sleuthing for the show's organisers. Not, however, that Gervex is a totally unknown painter - above all, not in Bordeaux. For half a century, 'Rolla', the large, frothy scene of the morning-after in a cheap hotel, has been the most popular painting in the museum's collection  -and star of the postcard sales, far surpassing Titian, Veronese and even Delacroix's 'Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi'. There was a nasty moment when it seemed that the newly created Musee d'Orsay might reclaim the State's deposit, as it had every right to do. But Paris, mindful for once of local sensibilities, stayed its hand. Gervex was 26 in 1878 when he exhibited 'Rolla', unquestionably his masterpiece, in the Salon. Already, he was well and truly launched after winning a medal for the horribly squirming, but academically impeccable, 'Satyr playing with a Bacchante', which showed him to be every inch the faithful pupil of the great Cabanel. But with 'Rolla', Gervex showed himself to be now a true believer in Manet's gospel that artists must paint modern life. His nude, however, is no 'Olympia', the painting which over a decade before had caused such a scandal. There was no risk of Gervex ever reneging on the academic doctrine of ideal beauty of form in the matter of nudes. Throughout his life, as we see in the upstairs rooms of the exhibition, paintings of meltingly boneless nudes - usually redheads - were one of his stand-bys. In old age, Gervex the dinosaur even reverted to Cabanalesque goddesses lolling on the tops of waves. It was with 'Rolla', however, that Gervex showed his uncanny gift for public relations. It was banned as immoral, for reasons well explained by Hollis Clayson in her interesting study of prostitution in French 19th-century painting, 'Painted Vice' (Yale University Press). A prostitute in her corset, like Manet's 'Nana', was tolerable; discarded corsets and petticoats, with Monsieur Rolla's walking stick pointing at a provocative angle, were quite another. Undaunted, Gervex put it on exhibition in the Chaussee d'Antin; le tout Paris was invited to see, and for weeks the street was filled with carriages. Gervex was now a deliciously scandalous painter, in addition to being a perfectly delightful human being. In the 1880s and '90s, Gervex was irrepressible. The older generation of Impressionists loved him for his raffishness. Early success meant he could afford a famous mistress, Madame Valtesse de la Bigne, whom we see in a large and glibly sub-Manet open-air portrait. He thoughtfully introduced her to Zola, researching the background for his immortal prostitute, Nana. Another little scandal, when he exhibited a painting of a nude wearing a velvet mask, helped his reputation. Everyone wanted to know whose wife she was, and a count sueing his sister for her inheritance said she had been the sitter . . . Gervex's industry was prodigious and he would never turn down a prestigious commission, no matter how boring the subject. A brilliant stroke in 1889 was to join up with the Belgian artist, Alfred Stevens, and paint a gigantic 'Panorama of the History of the Century', shown here in a modest copy from Brussels. Gervex had now shown himself as the republican patriot, honouring the Revolution. People flocked to see it, and when a buyer did not come forward, small pieces were given to each of the financial backers. Clearly, here was the right artist to execute vast murals for public commissions, such as still survive in the Hall of Weddings at the mairie of the XIX arrondissement and the ceiling of the buffet of the Gare de Lyons. Onwards and ever upwards, Gervex painted millionaire's salons and ceilings for the Elysees Palace. In the Belle Epoque years, his undoubted talent for painting electric light made him favoured choice for showing high society dining in the Bois de Boulogne. Portraits were bread and butter to Gervex, although he showed no very great talent for them. Singer Sargent's bravura effects always eluded him. But even as his commissions took him into the highest ranks of society - even the Russian Royal Family, he still paid homage to early days. He was still, a 'painter of modern life', follower - at however far a distance - of Degas and Manet. Hence, we still find him painting scenes such as the wistful cocotte, umbrella on the table, who anxiously awaits her companion for the night in a smart restaurant in the Bois de Boulogne. This is a hugely enjoyable exhibition, even though of a painter who rarely rose above third-rate. Only now and then is he better than that, for example, in oil sketches of his wife nursing their daughter or asleep on the deck of the splendiferous yacht of the American tycoon, James Gordon Bennet. The book accompanying the show will delight all who love the Belle Epoque, and is rich above all in the contributions made by Gervex's great-grandson. And do keep your eyes skinned; propped in a cellar, or hanging in some drawingroom, you just might happen to see a nude in a black velvet mask or a Nana look-alike dressing in a theatre loge . . . There are many Gervexes yet to be unearthed; with a vengeance, the arriviste master is coming in from the cold.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Thorsten Widow: "Inconsistent Liking of the </F> German Mark"]    [Text] Anyone relying on traditional indicators to explain  the movements of the currency markets will have a problem at the  moment. Thus, several reasons could be found why the dollar  should gain rather than lose in value, at least against the  German mark. Purchasing power and the upswing of the U.S.  economy are just two of them. But the reality is different.  The dollar is preparing for a downward move. Why do the  relevant economic comparisons at best serve as counterindicators  of the exchange rate forecast? Why is the German mark gaining  against almost all currencies -- except for the Swiss franc and  the yen -- without leaving any corresponding traces on the  German share and bond markets?    Since the spring of 1994 at the latest, a new, technical,  code of conduct has established itself in the foreign exchange  markets. Inspired by the then successful concerted interventions  of the central banks, an increasing number of investors have  betted on this horse. They hope for, and expect, measures  supporting the dollar, also in the future. To make this a  profitable strategy, most of the investment firms use the  charter analysis, which indicates support points visible to  everyone. At these points, whether they are at 1.6250 or 1.60  German marks [DM], the participators in the market enter into  dollar positions, because in anticipation of central bank  interventions they consider themselves to be on the right side.  But if such joint activities fail to take place, the U.S.  currency drops due to profit-reducing stop-loss orders. This  pattern also emerged over the past week and a half, and,  retrospectively, it is very well known from crises in the  European Monetary System.    The psychological aspect cannot be overlooked. What is  particularly surprising is that supposed interventions are  thought to have such a strong effect. There have been several  examples in the past where administrative interventions in the  foreign currency markets failed badly. The volumes moved and  the symbolic value of interventions were too low. But probably  the "softening job" by the central banks is successful, who  "threaten" banks that they are constantly ready for  interventions. In addition, the U.S. currency has dropped to  its October 1993 level. The DM1.60 currently paid against the  dollar is the lower limit of the range in which the dollar has  moved since the beginning of 1993 (upper limit: DM1.76). To  interpret this as willingness to intervene would be wrong only  if one were to ignore that almost everyone thinks that way, and  acts accordingly. In this connection, the question as to who is  interested in a more stable dollar easily becomes less  important. On closer examination, the German Bundesbank should  not have any problems with the current value of the dollar, and  it would certainly only become active out of loyalty to the  Federal Reserve. Exchange rates of around DM1.60 are still  acceptable to the German export industry, and they promote the  stability of prices. The fact is that so far there have not  been any warnings on the part of industry.    The Federal Reserve, however, is torn between fears of  inflation on the one hand and foreign trade considerations on  the other. If it were to call for dollar purchases  internationally, this would mean putting its cards on the table  in a risky manner. Should the interventions fail to achieve a  lasting effect, which is not unlikely in view of the  increasingly pessimistic mood toward the dollar, an increase in  key interest rates would be absolutely necessary to halt the  drop of the dollar. In the current year, this strategy has not  proved successful, although the Bundesbank simultaneously lent a  helping hand with its relaxation tactics.    The fact that the ailing dollar is not reflected by price  increases in German shares is another phenomenon that has a  touch of novelty about it. The loss of a positive correlation  between fixed currencies and rising share indexes makes one  wonder about the suggested market development. Where are the  German marks that have been purchased by international  addresses? As prospects are rated as poor in both shares and  bonds, the funds have found their temporary destiny in the  DM-capital market. The feared exchange rate losses in  traditional shares are not set off by a sufficient compensation  through the desired currency profits. In view of the latest  dynamic downward movement of the Dax and Bund futures, this  scenario is unlikely to change fundamentally in the near future.  Nevertheless, an enormous investment potential of German marks  has formed, which will sooner or later want to achieve higher  yields than those available in the capital market, all the more  so as the German short-term interest rate does not seem to have  reached its lowest point yet. Only then would the world of the  fundamental analysts be in order.</p>

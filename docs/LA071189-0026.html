			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Fall Again: The treasury sold $6.6 billion of new three-month  bills at an average discount rate of 7.76%, down from 7.96% last week. Another  $6.6 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of  7.50% down from 7.63% last week. The rates were the lowest since three-month  bills sold for 7.54% last Nov. 7 and six-month bills averaged 7.48% last Oct.  31. The discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 8.03% for  three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,620.80. The discount rate  reflects the price discount received when government securities are purchased  at less than face value.  </P></p>

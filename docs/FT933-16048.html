			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Arts: Hits and missed on their way to New York - Broadway Theatre You would think that Broadway would take a break after a season as dismal as the one that has just ended - only 33 productions, down from 37 in the fizzier 1991-92 season, and few gems among the dross. But hope springs eternal on the street of dreams. Fifteen Broadway productions have already reserved opening dates between now and December - a high figure this early in the game. Not all these projects will get off the ground but at least 10 are serious contenders. The trend in recent years has been for big productions to defer opening until spring, to stay fresh in the minds of crusty Tony Award voters and gain a box office boost at awards time in June. So why all these autumn 1993 openings? George Wachtel, director of research for the League of American Theaters and Producers, says: 'Shows open when they're ready, spring or fall.' A more cynical answer: seeing sparser autumns as a window of opportunity to draw audiences that, presumably, exist year-round, producers rushed in. This autumn's offerings: Perestroika: Tickets are on sale for the second half of Tony Kushner's Angels in America, which joins the first, Millennium Approaches, in repertory at the Walter Kerr Theatre in October. The Red Shoes: This new musical is based on the 1947 film about a choreographer and the young ballerina who is torn between her desire to dance for him and her love of the composer of the Ballet of the Red Shoes. It reunites the Secret Garden team of Marsha Norman (book and lyrics), Susan H Schulman (director) and Heidi Landesman (settings). Jule Styne is writing the music and Lar Lubovich will choreograph. It is scheduled to open in December at the Gershwin Theatre with Roger Rees in a starring role. Wonderful Tennessee: The new six-character play by Brian Friel, is scheduled to bypass London and transfer straight from the Abbey Theatre in Dublin to Broadway's Plymouth Theatre - where Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa had a successful run - in October. It is being billed 'The Big Chill of Ireland.' Cyrano - The Musical: The season's mystery production is slated to open at the Neil Simon Theater in November. This adaptation of the Edmund Rostand novel is imported from the Netherlands and is being translated into English for New York. It will feature an American cast. The money comes from Dutch television mogul Joop van den Ende, and clearly there is a lot of it: the production took a full-page ad in the New York Times (Dollars 50,000) and has started a television advertising campaign. Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat: Another mega-musical import from Britain. Broadway will finally see the Steven Pimlott-directed Andrew Lloyd Webber revival, the proportions of which are reportedly as biblical as its subject matter. Michael Damian, the US equivalent of Jason Donovan, plays the title role; it is to open at the Minskoff Theater in November. The Kentucky Cycle: Robert Schenkkan's play spanning 200 years of US history won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Like Angels in America, it is a seven-hour epic split into two nights viewing. It comes to New York in November after productions in Seattle, Los Angeles, and a try-out in Washington, all directed by Warner Shook. Stacey Keach leads the 20-strong cast. My Fair Lady: This revival of the Lerner and Lowe musical, starring Richard Chamberlain and directed by Howard Davies, is on a national tour. It is said that Tommy Tune was called in to show-doctor, and Melissa Errico, the newcomer playing Eliza Doolittle, has ruptured her vocal cords twice, but the reviews have been positive. It is scheduled to reach New York in December. Laughter on the 23rd Floor: What would a Broadway season be without a new Neil Simon show? Hopefully this will be better than last season's turkey, The Goodbye Girl, a musical based on Simon's 1977 movie, which is still running on the star power of Bernadette Peters and TV comedian Martin Short. Laughter is a comic play set in the McCarthy era and is drawn from Simon's experiences writing for television. Nathan Lane stars, and Jerry Zaks (Guys and Dolls, Assassins, Six Degrees of Separation) directs. It is due to open at the Richard Rogers Theatre in November after an out-of-town try-out. Paper Moon: This new musical is based on the 1973 movie, which starred Ryan and Tatum O'Neill, about a girl who teams up with a flim-flam man to swindle their way across the 1930's countryside. The musical stars Gregory Harrison, Christine Ebersole, and a soon-to-be-named child actress. Much depends on the try-out at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey. If the word is good: Broadway in late autumn. Timon of Athens: Tony Randall's National Actors' Theatre's brief is admirable: to present classic plays on Broadway. However, two seasons on, it has hardly left the starting block, with production after ill-advised production razed by the critics. But Randall is making a go of it for another season. Shakespeare's late drama, is to open at the Lyceum Theatre in November, directed by Michael Langham who directed the company's lone success last season, Shaw's St Joan. Already several big productions are planned for next spring and beyond. The inaugural project of Walt Disney Theatrical Productions is a stage version of Beauty and the Beast, the animated feature. Beauty's press representative says the budget is Dollars 5m-Dollars 6m, but insiders put the figure anywhere between Dollars 10m-Dollars 14m. The London production of Carousel will open in New York in the spring with an American cast. Lloyd Webber will follow his London opening of Sunset Boulevard with productions in LA in the autumn and New York in the spring, all directed by Trevor Nunn. Patty LuPone, Broadway's original Evita, will Norma Desmond in New York. Fast on the heels of Kiss of the Spider Woman, producer Garth Drabinsky and director Hal Prince are teaming up again for a revival of the 1927 Hammerstein and Kern musical Show Boat. It opens in October in Toronto where it has already drawn protests from groups who find it racially offensive. Its cast of 68 includes Elaine Stritch, Robert Morse, and Lonette McKee.</p>

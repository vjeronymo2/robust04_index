			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Baggeridge drops 28% to Pounds 1.82m BAGGERIDGE Brick reported a 28 per cent plunge in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.82m in the year ended September 30. Turnover fell from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 26.3m, but Mr Martyn Haines, finance director, said the group had not cut production and had maintained market share. Sales were hit by increased pressure on prices, reflecting sluggish demand combined with industry over-capacity. Operating profit fell to Pounds 3.16m (Pounds 4.11m). The decline in the brick-making business was offset partially by a Pounds 1.2m contribution from its landsource operation. Earnings per share fell to 3.03p (4.84p). The proposed final dividend of 2.375p leaves the total for the year at 3.125p.</p>

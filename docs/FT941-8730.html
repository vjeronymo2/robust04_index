			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Labour tabulates Tube's agonies The London Underground suffered 1,500 station closures and more than 2,000 serious delays last year according to government figures collated by Labour yesterday. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said answers to a series of parliamentary questions also showed that an average of 10 per cent of escalators were out of action during the year. Replies from the transport department revealed that 14,000 crimes including 1,000 robberies or crimes of violence occurred on the Underground. The Underground suffered 500 fire and smoke incidents, including 150 which resulted in fire brigade assistance. The east/west District Line called out the fire brigade 33 times. Mr Dobson said the Underground's problems were a result of under-investment by the government, which planned to spend Pounds 1bn less than the Pounds 3.5bn over three years promised in their 1992 election manifesto. 'Tory ministers will not pay the price for that broken promise. They don't use the Underground. The real price will be paid by millions of people who rely on the Underground to get them around London,' Mr Dobson said.</p>

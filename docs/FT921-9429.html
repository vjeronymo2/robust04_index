			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Exchange stakes out fresh index territory - The CME is expanding its list of index-related products in an effort to become the world's top derivatives market THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange, flush with success, is launching a new product this week aimed at institutional investors and has plans to offer a spectrum of index-related products. The exchange, home to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index future, the world's most widely traded stock index contract, last year traded a record 108m contracts, up 5 per cent over 1990, while trading volumes declined at other American futures and options exchanges. The exchange will start trading tomorrow in the S &amp; P MidCap 400, the index composed of 400 middle-capitalisation growth companies. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the contract yesterday. The CME's launch will be co-ordinated with the American Stock Exchange, which will trade the cash market options on the MidCap 400. This will expand its business in foreign stock indices, which began in 1990 with the Nikkei 225. Another possible addition, is a future on Germany's DAX index of 30 leading companies. A memorandum of understanding has yet to be agreed between US and German regulatory authorities. These new products are part of the fresh territory being staked out by the exchange. Mr William Brodsky, the CME president whose background is in the securities industry, said: 'We hope to have a whole panoply of index products.' With the large and medium stock indices in hand, the CME's next goal is to capture the rights to futures on the Russell 2,000 stock index, the most followed index for small companies and one that has become popular with institutional investors during the last year or so. The average market capitalisation of Russell 2,000 companies is Dollars 100m. Mr Brodsky and Mr John 'Jack' Sandner, who has been re-elected CME chairman for the eighth time, believe that indices trading is the direction of the markets, particularly for institutional investors. 'People who three to five years ago wouldn't even consider using stock index futures are now using them,' said Mr Brodsky. Pension funds, university endowments and other institutional investors are increasingly matching their holdings to the indices. Since it was launched in mid-1991, the MidCap 400 has drawn Dollars 3bn in indexed assets. The recent performance of the smaller indices is a big incentive. The MidCap 400 index increased in 1991 by 46.59 per cent, the Russell index by 43.68 per cent. These rates are far ahead of the S &amp; P 500 index, composed of large industrial companies, which rose by 26.31 per cent last year. Besides stock index futures, the CME is looking at the new Goldman Sachs commodity index, which begun last year and includes oil, wheat, metals and soft commodities such as coffee and sugar, as the basis for a possible new contract. All this effervescence has a strategic point. The CME wants to position itself as the world's leading derivatives exchange. To do so, it is doggedly courting the institutional segment of the investing community and it has taken aim in particular at managed futures funds, which Mr Sandner estimates hold some Dollars 30bn. Managed futures 'will go the way of mutual funds', says Mr Sandner. Currently, the net assets of US mutual funds total Dollars 1,350bn. To accommodate institutional investors the CME has taken or proposed several new trading rules. Last year, it put in place a large order execution rule, known as Lox, comparable to the block trade rules at leading US stock exchanges. Under this rule, a CME member wishing to buy or sell 300 or more S &amp; P 500 futures can, in essence, pre-arrange the trade off the trading floor. Mr Sandner wants to expand the rule to the exchange's rapidly expanding currency futures business, where EuroYen and EuroMark contracts are under consideration. To further facilitate large orders, the exchange recently won approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the futures industry regulator, to lift position limits on its EuroDollar and leading currency futures and futures options. It has also proposed an average pricing system for large orders. Under such a system, CME members can provide such big investors an average price for a single order or series of orders executed at different prices. The proposal is awaiting CFTC approval. The exchange plans to bring into use an extra trading floor to cope with the new business. The current floor has become so overcrowded that vertical boxes have been built so that brokers and traders can better see what's happening amid the mass of people in the pits.</p>

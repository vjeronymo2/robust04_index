The two main banking systems -- the State Bank with  its management responsibilities and the commercial banks and  credit organisations which undertake money transactions, credits  and banking services -- have improved significantly. The whole  network has thus become the most versatile and developed in the  whole country.    In 1993 new systems were established -- state-run commercial  banks, joint-stock commercial banks, financial companies,  jewellery companies, foreign-owned and joint venture banks.    Total capital mobilized in the year was estimated at VND  [Vietnamese dong] 6,045 billion (USD [U.S. dollars] 60.45  million), a twofold increase from 1991. Also, a foreign exchange  centre has been founded to solve the problem of supply and  demand in foreign currencies, especially for import and export.  Speaking at the conference, State Bank Governor-General Cao Si  Kiem approved proposals for the improvement of the jewel  business and the strengthening of state management of foreign  banks. He also agreed on the need of improving the efficiency  of joint-stock commercial banks, giving priority to medium and  long-term credit sources, and helping train bank staff to  international levels.</p>

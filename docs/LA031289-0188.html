			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> DEFENDING CITY CHAMPION MONROE PREPARES TO QUIET SKEPTICISM  </P> <P> What do Tim Costic, Sean Henson and the rest of the Monroe High baseball team  have in common with Rodney Dangerfield?  </P> <P> Well, let's just say that recognition from peers for a job well done is slow in  coming.  </P> <P> "We think we have something to prove this year," said Henson, a junior  left-hander. "Last year, no one believed it. We weren't supposed to do  anything."  </P> <P> Yet, the Vikings did everything. Henson (4-4) rebounded from academic  ineligibility to pitch a five-hitter with 10 strikeouts in the City Section 4-A  Division final, a 3-2 victory over San Fernando.  </P> <P> Costic, The Times' Valley Player of the Year, batted .426 with five home runs,  11 doubles and 37 runs batted in.  </P> <P> Both players admit it was an improbable season. Monroe, the only fourth-place  team to win the 4-A title, finished 13-16.  </P> <P> Critics, Costic said, explain the Vikings' ascent from Mid-Valley League  mediocrity to City champions with one word: fluke.  </P> <P> "I'd like to go out there and have a good season and show that it wasn't,"  Costic said.  </P> <P> Said Henson: "I think there wasn't a team we couldn't beat last year. But  people were saying, 'Oh, it was luck.'  </P> <P> "This year, we want to prove that it wasn't a fluke."  </P> <P> Monroe opened the season Thursday with an 8-2 nonleague win over Buckley. One  thing is certain: The victory was no fluke.  </P> <P> Buckley, a Southern Section school of 280 students, was 2-17 last year and 0-10  in the Delphic League. Monroe opens league play Tuesday at Birmingham.  </P> <P> Why worry?: What's all this fuss about Chatsworth losing a couple of ballgames?  </P> <P> "Everybody's saying, 'What's wrong,' and we're 2-2," Coach Bob Lofrano quipped  before Saturday's 12-2 victory over Hueneme in the Westside tournament.  </P> <P> Lofrano, however, is not amused with his team's early performance, especially  Thursday's game against Rio Mesa in which the Chancellors committed six errors.  </P> <P> "Defensively," Lofrano said, "we stunk."  </P> <P> After opening the season with a 19-2 rout of Ventura, Chatsworth lost to Notre  Dame, 6-5, after leading, 4-0, through four innings.  </P> <P> That was followed by a 9-6 loss to Canyon (5-15 last year) before an eight-run,  eighth-inning rally finally felled Rio Mesa, 13-5.  </P> <P> Lofrano considers it "a compliment to the program" that because of shaky play  the Chancellors are under scrutiny. Last year, Chatsworth was 25-2 and ranked  No. 1 nationwide by Collegiate Baseball and USA Today.  </P> <P> The Chancellors lost to San Fernando, 5-2, in the City 4-A semifinals. "But the  way we're playing," junior right-hander Reed McMackin said, "we don't want to  be No. 1."  </P> <P> Said Lofrano: "We're disappointed, but it's not push-the-panic-button time. We  need to play better and everybody knows it, from me all the way down to the  last kid on the team.  </P> <P> "You can't just say, 'Oh, well, it's only a scrimmage,' or 'Oh, well, it's only  a tournament game,' or pretty soon it's gonna be, 'Oh, well, it's only the last  game of the season.' "  </P> <P> Add Chatsworth: Lofrano offered some constructive criticism to the L. A.  Unified School District last week. Construction was scheduled to begin last  week at Chatsworth to erect a screen 20 feet above the existing 15-foot  left-field fence. The purpose is to prevent home runs from rattling apartment  windows across the street.  </P> <P> Yet, there has not been so much as a delivery of a fence post.  </P> <P> "I expressed displeasure about the whole thing," Lofrano said, "and requested  that the job be done during spring break or at the end of the season."  </P> <P> Chatsworth is scheduled to open West Valley League play at home Tuesday against  Canoga Park.  </P> <P> Last add Chatsworth: Lofrano was selected head coach of a U. S. Baseball  Federation high school all-star team that will travel to Seoul for the  Friendship Series, Aug. 28 through Sept. 5.  </P> <P> OK Corrales: Ask San Fernando Coach Steve Marden about the talents of senior  shortstop Bobby Corrales, and Marden develops a bad case of amnesia.  </P> <P> Corrales has made Marden forget all about his shortstop of last year, Albert  Torres, an All-City selection who batted a school-record .514 in Mid-Valley  League play.  </P> <P> "Like I've been saying to anybody who'll listen, 'Albert Torres who?' " Marden  quips.  </P> <P> A few months ago, the same could be said of Corrales, who spent the first half  of last season on the bench. A mid-season batting slump, however, prompted  lineup changes and Corrales delivered as a designated-hitter (.371 average, 13  RBIs).  </P> <P> Corrales had a clutch grand slam against Granada Hills and later helped defeat  Chatsworth in a 4-A semifinal with another home run.  </P> <P> But Corrales' offense -- he was four for five and drove in five runs in the La  Canada tournament championship victory over St. Francis -- is not the only  reason he stands out, Marden insists.  </P> <P> "He's improved so much with his glove that he's better right now than Albert  was at the end of the season last year," Marden said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRIVING IN THE CAR-POOL LANE WITH CHILDREN AS PASSENGERS  </P> <P> In response to letters by R.F. Craig and Andrea Kinney about children as  passengers in car-pool lanes (Dec. 17):  </P> <P> I disagree with their contention that I am not taking another adult driver off  the freeway when I have only children in my car.  </P> <P> I am in fact taking two adult drivers off the freeway by car-pooling my  children and theirs to school.  </P> <P> I hope that the next time they see someone with children in the car-pool lane  they will think that just maybe that person is keeping an adult off the freeway  by taking their children someplace they both might have driven to.  </P> <P> MELINDA DAVIS  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

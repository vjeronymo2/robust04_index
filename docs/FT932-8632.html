			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / BT sticks a foot in the home entertainment door: A foray into dishes masks deeper ambitions BT's bid to enter the satellite dish market announced last week is more unwelcome news for Mr Alan Sugar's Amstrad, the leading UK supplier. But it is a side show in a far larger game: whether, and if so when and how, Britain's telecoms giant is allowed to break into the home entertainment market using its fixed network. BT is straining at the leash. Its government licence forbids it from providing 'entertainment services'. The ban, imposed in the 1991 telecommunications white paper to allow the fledgling cable TV companies to establish themselves, is due to remain until 2001, and may continue even thereafter. 'We cannot understand why the government should go to such enormous lengths to protect some foreign-owned cable companies,' says Mr Alan Rudge, BT's director of development and procurement. 'We are being held back in a dying technology longer than we would like. We see fibre as the technology of the future; copper is the past.' BT condemns the ban as nonsensical and a threat to its long-term competitive position, since the latest optical fibre technology makes it feasible and - in its view - affordable to lay advanced optical fibre taking TV, telephone and data services right into the home. With only about 3.2m homes able to receive satellite TV, there is plenty of room to expand the existing dish market for BSkyB's broadcasts. With a foot in the home entertainment door, BT would be in a stronger position to exploit the market through fibre, whenever it is allowed to do so. It may not have to wait until 2001. Oftel, the industry regulator, is empowered to ask the government to lift the ban in five years' time. Also, the meaning of 'entertainment services' in the 1991 white paper is unclear. BT argues that it does not extend to on-line video services  - which involve two-way communication between the viewer and broadcaster; the cable companies are adamant it does; Oftel says it is a 'grey area'. There is 'a good possibility', says Mr Rudge, that BT will soon approach Oftel about providing an on-line video service. If it gets the green light, it could probably do so through its existing copper wires, but the new market would give the company a spur to extending the fibre network, which is currently restricted to trunk routes and larger companies within the local loop. Within five years BT could have a fibre network covering the whole local loop in most large cities. Although they currently have only about 450,000 broadband subscribers, cable TV companies are relaxed about BT's dish ambitions. Says Mr Nick Caunter, marketing manager of Videotron: 'We are not too concerned about BT entering the dish market, which is is already heavily marketed and more limited.' But they are determined to keep BT out of the fixed-wire entertainment business until 2001, by when analysts expect them to have around 6m subscribers over 128 franchise areas. Far more than pop videos and interactive games is at stake. The cable companies, laying their own fibre-optic networks in the local loop, are offering telephony services hand-in-hand with TV options. The take-up of telephony by domestic subscribers has so far been small, but by 2001 the cable operators hope to have done to BT in the local loop what Mercury is achieving in the business market.</p>

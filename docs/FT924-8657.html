			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: BAA Which property company trades at a mere 5 per cent discount to net assets? Which transport stock yields 2.8 per cent and stands on a forward multiple of 17 times earnings? The answer in both cases is BAA, which raises the further question of why this privatised airport operator commands such a generous UK stock market rating. One reason is the company's ability to appear defensive and cyclical at the same time. Both commercial income and traffic charges, after all, are highly sensitive to economic activity. Another is the benign attitude of the regulator, certainly relative to other privatised monopolies. Perhaps the least well appreciated secret of BAA's success, though - illustrated by yesterday's 46 per cent jump in interim profits - is its close dependence on British Airways. A striking feature of the first-half results was the sharp rise in transfer passengers at Heathrow, an achievement largely attributable to BA's marketing skills in taking away North Atlantic business from the likes of Lufthansa and Air France. BA's success is just as well, given that it accounts for almost half the passengers using Heathrow and a fifth of those passing through Gatwick. BAA's long-term appeal remains undiminished. But the 3.4 per cent fall in income per passenger from retailing in the first half and the cautious forecast of second-half traffic growth may hold back further progress for now. There may also be some concern that earnings will be hit by an additional Pounds 20m of depreciation when BAA finally comes to write up the balance-sheet value of its assets.</p>

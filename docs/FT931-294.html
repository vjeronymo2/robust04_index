			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Italian corruption scandal claims fifth minister THE FATE of the Italian government was increasingly precarious last night following the involvement of a fifth minister in the corruption scandals sweeping the country. Mr Franco Reviglio, finance minister, resigned after being served notice he was under investigation for alleged receipt of illicit funds while chairman of Eni, the state oil concern, in 1983-89. Over the past two months Mr Reviglio has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing during his time at Eni. Earlier President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro called in the heads of the senate and chamber of deputies as well as Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, for four hours of consultations. The discussions centred on two main options - a cabinet shake-up with broader parliamentary support or a new government. This would have to be an administration headed by an institutional figure above party politics, such as Mr Giorgio Napolitano, leader of the chamber of deputies, or Mr Giovanni Spadolini, leader of the senate. Political uncertainty forced the lira to a historic low against the D-Mark. The Italian currency pierced the L1,000 level against the D-Mark in Milan trading and touched L1,004, recovering slightly after the Bank of Italy intervened to support it on foreign exchange markets. Its London close was L990.1. London dealers said that much of the selling of lire was short-term speculation by bank dealers. However, Italian bond prices fell sharply as institutional investors sold Italian-denominated assets. On the Milan stock exchange the Comit index fell 10.56 or 2.1 per cent to 476.91. Since the weekend the position of the four-party coalition government has been jeopardised by news that magistrates in Palermo and Naples were investigating Mr Giulio Andreotti, the veteran Christian Democrat politician and seven times premier, and two other senior party bosses for alleged links with the Mafia. Mr Amato is unlikely to want to proceed without agreement on broader support  -notably from the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and the Republicans. Yesterday Mr Scalfaro also consulted Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader. Mr Occhetto said he was reluctant to back another Amato government, which he said was too closely identified with a discredited political class. The situation was further complicated on Monday, in advance of the April 18 referendums on constitutional reform, by the decision of Mr Mario Segni, leader of the referendum movement, to break away from the Christian Democrat party, one of four in the coalition. The PDS is reluctant to come into any government with the CDs now they have lost Mr Segni, who is identified with reformist policies.

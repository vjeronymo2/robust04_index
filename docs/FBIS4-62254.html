			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Be Careful General! You Are Not at </F> Maneuvers..."]    [Text] On 29 April, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry  Collegium held a meeting. During the meeting, important issues  concerning military life were discussed. According to a  reliable source, after the chairman summed up the meeting and  set objectives, a very excited Major General Vladimir Petenko,  the president's adviser for military issues, appeared in the  room. The supreme commander's envoy made a curious proposal to  the generals present in the room -- to initiate in the military  the emergency collection of signatures supporting the present  head of state as a presidential candidate.    This appeal bewildered the top brass just a little bit. Many  generals surely recalled the old good times when the high staff  would send an instruction suggesting (!) that they ensure active  participation of the personnel in some social or political  event. This was a written document, while an oral "supplement"  specified the exact degree of "support," which the commander had  to provide, no matter what.    Now, everything is handled more elegantly; no one is sending  any dictates. Instead, they provide oral instructions uttered  in a commanding tone. But have those people bothered to think  what a disservice they are doing to the president? How will  those directives be met in the military -- by the 70,000  officers and warrant officers who have been left without a place  to live and spend half of their miserable salary on rent? What  should soldiers -- the main "supporters" -- feel when they  cannot even buy a decent tube of toothpaste with their  allowances?    Yes, organizers of this undertaking should have first  thought  what they think this Army really is -- the defender of the  Homeland or a group of people who can be manipulated at will?</p>

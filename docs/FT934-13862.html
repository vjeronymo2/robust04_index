			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Israel starts to free Palestinians ISRAEL, in a gesture of goodwill, freed its longest-held Palestinian political prisoner yesterday, beginning the process of releasing thousands of Palestinians serving time in Israeli jails. The release of up to 12,000 Palestinian prisoners is considered by Palestinian peace negotiators to be the single most important confidence-building measure between the two sides, who resume talks in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba today. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's premier, has said the numbers, timing and conditions for releasing prisoners must be negotiated properly in the Taba talks. Israeli officials said the release of Mr Salim Zrei, a commander in the Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation held by Israel for 23 years, was intended as a reward to the PLO for renouncing violence under the framework peace accord. His release comes on the eve of the arrival in Israel of Mr Dennis Ross, US co-ordinator for Middle East peace talks, who is touring the region ahead of a visit early next month by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. Palestinian officials have said Israeli negotiators have promised to free 4,500-6,000 prisoners in the coming weeks. Hundreds of prisoners being held on minor charges will be released in the first wave. Israeli officials have rejected PLO demands to release activists of the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas movement, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the Hamas spiritual leader. The PLO, anxious to show quick results, wants Hamas prisoners freed and the remaining deportees to return home, to undercut Hamas opposition to the peace agreement. Mr Uri Savir, director-general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, indicated yesterday that this week's talks in Taba could see more significant releases in the context of mutual security guarantees. The Taba talks will also get down to more detailed negotiation about the size of the Jericho area from which Israeli troops will begin withdrawing by December 13. The Palestinians want an area of 345 sq km, the old Jordanian district of Jericho, while Israel is offering only 27 sq km, the boundaries of the town. Much of the Palestinian negotiation focuses on access to the Dead Sea and a border crossing to Jordan, with inclusion of strategic roads, water sources and religious sites.</p>

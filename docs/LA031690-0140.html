			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> PARENTS' ROLE IN EDUCATION STRESSED  </P> <P> More than 250 people turned out this week for a "Successful Parents" conference  that included seminars on self-esteem, the dangers of steroids and gang  violence in Orange County.  </P> <P> The third annual conference emphasized the need for parental support of  education and gave parents the chance to talk with education experts, said  program chairwoman Jane Wyner.  </P> <P> County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, keynote speaker at the Wednesday night  gathering, said schools are increasingly emphasizing the role of the parent in  education.  </P> <P> "I think it's indicative of the growing knowledge that parents are going to be  a critical component of developing an educational strategy for the United  States," Vasquez said. "They (school districts) realize that they cannot  succeed in the classroom -- they have to go beyond the classroom." While Wyner  was pleased at the turnout for the program at Orange High School, she said such  events don't always reach the parents of the children who need help the most.  </P> <P> "What we figure is that 20% of the parents here are looking for assistance in  some way," Wyner said. "Honestly, 80% are already magnificent parents and  that's why they're here. But there's that 20% we catch that means everything to  us."  </P> <P> The program was sponsored by the Orange Unified School District. LAURA  MICHAELIS  </P></p>

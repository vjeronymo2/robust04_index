			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Books: Peak form - Crime IDEALLY, the body is found in a library; and, in the classic tradition, the library is part of a comfortable vicarage or a spacious country house. But even the great Agatha - or Jane Marple or Poirot - occasionally ventured farther afield: to the Caribbean, to France, and, of course, to the Near East. Combining features of the travel book with the basic ingredients of the murder story often produces fruitful, appetising results. But, mismanaged, the formula can generate one of those tedious examples of instant erudition, cluttered with unfamiliar technical terms, insiders' jargon, with only thin narration. Gwen Moffat's knowledge of mountaineering has been acquired over a lifetime, and her Miss Melinda Pink has climbed in various parts of the world, exploring exotic terrain and solving criminal puzzles with equal amounts of underplayed skill and discreet enthusiasm. In Veronica's Sisters (Macmillan, Pounds 13.99, 189 pp), the indomitable Melinda is in New Mexico; her (and the author's) passion for the area is infectious but never gushing. Moffat conveys tangibly the all-consuming heat, the strange geological features, the menace of rattlesnakes and flash floods, and the isolation of the inhabitants, which on the one hand welds the community together and, on the other, fosters eccentricities and aversions. Far from being an extraneous element, the physical setting virtually creates the criminals and the crimes. This book is irresistible. For many of us, Los Angeles is just as exotic as New Mexico but a good deal less alluring. Fortunately, the Police Department, as represented in Iain Pears's The Bernini Bust (Gollancz, Pounds 13.99, 192 pp), is much more acceptable than the real-life racist bullies seen on a famous amateur video some months ago. Pears's story takes place in the artificial world of ultra-rich philanthropists, ambitious museum directors, scrupulous and less scrupulous art dealers. The English expert, Jonathan Argyll, and his Italian beloved, Flavia di Stefano of Rome's Art Theft Squad - this is their third Pears appearance - deal with the real-unreal California art scene nonchalantly and effectively, then wisely catch the first plane back to Italy. Michael Kenyon works for laughs more obviously, but he gets them and deserves them. In his latest, Peckover Joins The Choir (Macmillan, Pounds 13.99, 224 pp), the poetaster Chief Inspector Henry Peckover and his expensively educated black associate, Detective Constable Jason Twitty, are obliged to join an amateur provincial choir, learn a demanding programme ranging from Anon to Mozart to G&amp;S, and - what's more - catch a crook and deal with a murder in Ghent. There, they have to establish a liaison with the Belgian police, partly represented by a fiercely bigoted sergeant. Kenyon has a lot of fun with his characters, Brit and non; and Peckover and Twitty continue to constitute an engaging and persuasive pair. Perhaps because of the built-in shock created by crime in a church, murders in ecclesiastical ambiences have long flourished, and The Snares of Death by Kate Charles (Headline, Pounds 15.99, 281 pp) is an excellent example of the sub-genre. The author cuts a broad swath, taking a wry, impartial view of Animal Protectors, high Anglo-Catholics and sanctimonious Evangelicals, dubious TV art historians and filthy-rich factory-farmers. Juggling half-a-dozen stories at once (and all of them interest-catching), Kate Charles skimps on the actual murder story itself so, after some leisurely, digressive storytelling, the solution arrives in a rush; but never mind, love conquers all, the book ends with a happy feast, after the wonderful set piece - the National Pilgrimage to Walsingham - which is the novel's climax and great achievement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report: "Plan Put Forth by the State Economics and Trade </F> Commission for Implementing the Adjusted Economic Policy on  Tobacco"]    [Text] In line with the demands of the "State Council  Circular on Further Tightening the Monopoly Control Over  Tobacco" (State Document No 7 [1993]), the State Economics and  Trade Commission conducted a factfinding study in conjunction  with departments, such as the State Planning Commission  (including the former State Pricing Bureau), the Ministry of  Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the State  Technology Supervision Administration, and the State Tobacco  Monopoly Bureau, in the six provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan,  Shandong, Fujian, and Henan on the matters of how to effectively  control the unchecked tobacco-production momentum and adjust  economic policy on tobacco, putting forth a plan for  implementing the adjusted economic policy on tobacco, the  specific substance of which is as follows:  <H5>  I. The Principles of the Adjusted Economic Policy on Tobacco </H5>   The adjusted economic policy on tobacco will be suited to  our  socialist market economy development, by giving consideration to  the interests of the three parties of tobacco farmers, local  governments, and tobacco enterprises, in order to ensure that  the real income of peasants for a normal harvest year does not  drop, and to essentially maintain the existing tobacco-product  tax level, while basically not raising cigarette-enterprise  production costs.  <H5>  II. Strict Control of Tobacco Production </H5>   To control unchecked tobacco production, all provinces and  autonomous regions, when purchasing tobacco, will  conscientiously implement the provisions in the State Council  National Document No 7 (1993) on "all taxes on tobacco exceeding  state planned procurement being paid into Central revenues, and  the purchasing prices of tobacco sold to the state that exceeds  plans or is unplanned floating downward 20 percent," with taxes  on all tobacco that exceeds state-assigned annual procurement  plans being calculated according to the average tax per dan (50  kg) of flue-cured tobacco for the year in the province  (autonomous region), and paid into Central revenues. When  arranging particular procurement plans, we will implement the  principle of supporting excellence, in order to gradually cut  back on the area planted to tobacco that is not suited to  tobacco cultivation.  <H5>  III. Adjusted Tobacco Procurement Prices </H5>   As flue-cured tobacco standards are now in a stage of  transition from 15 to 40 grades and, in line with the principles  of market demand and price based on quality, tobacco procurement  prices are correspondingly adjusted to the two separate  flue-cured tobacco standards of 15 and 40 grades (See  attachments 1 and 2). The former state-set tobacco production  support charge will be incorporated into the tobacco procurement  price.  <H5>  IV. The Adjusted Tobacco Product Tax Rate </H5>   The tobacco-product tax rate is based on the adjusted  tobacco-procurement price, being lowered from 38 percent to 31  percent in line with the principle of essentially maintaining  the current tobacco-tax level. The Ministry of Finance and the  State Administration of Taxation will draw up the particular  regulations on the adjustment of taxpayment links.  <H5>  V. Deregulated Tobacco Allocation Prices </H5>   In line with the needs of establishing a socialist market  economy and based on our current realities, we are deregulating  tobacco-allocation prices. The specific means of application  will be drawn up by the pertinent commercial department of the  State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau.    These regulations will take effect for 1993's new tobacco  listings, with white-rib tobacco, perfume tobacco, and sun-cured  tobacco implementing the adjusted plan for flue-cured tobacco.  As Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Jiangxi province (autonomous  region) tobacco is in the latter stage of procurement, the  respective provincial (autonomous regional) People's Governments  will decide whether these provinces (autonomous region) will  implement in 1993 the new flue-cured tobacco procurement prices  and tobacco product tax rate.  <H5>  Appendix 1 </H5>   1993 Procurement Prices for 40-Grade Flue-Cured Tobacco   Grade        Code       Price        Grade            Code       Price               Name       (Yuan Per                     Name       (Yuan Per                          Dan)                                     Dan)   Medium       CIF        340.00       Top Red 2        B2R        130.00  Orange 1   Medium       C2F        285.00       Top Red 3        B3R        90.00  Orange 2   Medium       C3F        225.00       Full Cured 2     H2F        170.00  Orange 3   Medium       C1L        300.00       Low Light        X2V        110.00  Lemon 1                              Green 2   Medium       C2L        240.00       Medium Light     C3V        170.00  Lemon 2                              Green 3   Top Orange   B1F        280.00       Top Light        B2V        130.00  1                                    Green 2   Top Orange   B2F        220.00       Top Light        B3V        100.00  2                                    Green 3   Top Lemon    B1L        200.00       Smooth 1         S1         100.00  1   Top Red 1    B1R        180.00       Top Lemon 4      B4L        60.00   Full Cured   H1F        230.00       Low Lemon 3      X3L        95.00  1   Low Orange   X1F        200.00       Low Lemon 4      X4L        60.00  1   Medium       C3L        180.00       Low Orange 4     X4F        70.00  Lemon 3   Low Orange   X2F        160.00       Smooth 2         S2         60.00  2   Low Orange   X3F        120.00       Medium-Low       CX1K       80.00  3                                    Mixed 1   Low Lemon    X1L        165.00       Medium-Low       CX2K       50.00  1                                    Mixed 2   Low Lemon    X2L        130.00       Top Mixed 1      B1K        85.00  2   Top Orange   B3F        150.00       Top Mixed 2      B2K        60.00  3   Top Orange   B4F        100.00       Green Yellow 1   GY1        50.00  4   Top Lemon    B2L        130.00       Top Mixed 3      B3K        40.00  2   Top Lemon    B3L        90.00        Green Yellow 2   GY2        20.00  3    <H5>  Appendix 2 </H5>  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1993 Procurement Prices for 15-Grade Flue-Cured Tobacco                    |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Grade             |Price (Yuan Per D-|Grade             |Price (Yuan Per D-|  |                  |an)               |                  |an)               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Medium 1          |310.00            |Top 3             |110.00            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Medium 2          |260.00            |Top 4             |60.00             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Medium 3          |190.00            |Top 5             |20.00             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Medium 4          |130.00            |Green 1           |60.00             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Medium 5          |65.00             |Green 2           |20.00             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Medium 6          |35.00             |Green 3           |8.00              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Top 1             |230.00            |End Grade         |5.00              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Top 2             |165.00            |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

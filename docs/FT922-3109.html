			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Falling glass prices hit Pilkington PILKINGTON, the glass-maker, is still struggling with glass prices 25 per cent lower than two years ago in Europe and the US and 38 per cent in Australia. Even after slashing the second interim dividend to 3.07p (7.57p), the group is taking Pounds 20.1m from reserves (Pounds 62.6m in the previous year) to pay the 6p (10.5p) total. The near halving of pre-tax profits, from Pounds 151.6m to Pounds 77m, was at the bottom end of expectations. The group took Pounds 23.1m exceptional redundancy and reorganisation costs in the year and suffered another Pounds 13.9m charge when a US customer went bankrupt. Group turnover was barely lower at Pounds 2.6bn, and operating profits fell 12 per cent to Pounds 182.5m. These included a Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 9m) profit on the sale of investments and Pounds 41.2m of profits from businesses since sold or closed. Net interest charges rose from Pounds 56.9m to Pounds 68.5m, giving interest cover of 2.7 times. Mr Andrew Robb, finance director, said he was not happy with this cover. The tax rate was high at 54.5 per cent, mainly because of UK advance corporation tax. Minorities took Pounds 25.5m (Pounds 22.9m) and there were extraordinary profits, largely on the sale of businesses, of Pounds 17.7m (costs Pounds 48.5m). Earnings per share before exceptional items were 5.5p (8.6p) and after these costs were 1.2p (8.6p). The group would have suffered a cash outflow but for Pounds 229.5m raised from the sale of businesses. Net debt fell from Pounds 703m to Pounds 659m over the year, 56 per cent (59 per cent) of shareholders' funds. European glass operating profits fell from Pounds 127.8m to Pounds 67.4m, with the UK and Nordic areas particularly badly hit, although German profits were also lower. In North America profits improved slightly to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 9m) thanks to cost cuts. South American profits rose offsetting falls in South Africa and Australia, leaving profits for the rest of the world at Pounds 60.4m (Pounds 60.8m). Poor flat glass profits were to some extent made up by improvements elsewhere. The insulation business returned to profit making Pounds 1m (loss Pounds 4.6m). Visioncare, the US spectacle and contact lens business made Pounds 21.5m (Pounds 9.6m). Other businesses lost Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 10.3m) and licensing income fell from Pounds 26.1m to Pounds 22.6m.

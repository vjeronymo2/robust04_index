			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Gowrie applauds Pounds 5.1m funds rise - Arts The arts have done rather well out of the Budget. The grant for the Arts Council of England in 1995-96 has been raised by Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 191.5m. A year ago, the council had its grant cut for the first time, by Pounds 3.2m, and had been told to expect stand-still funding for next year. But the new heritage secretary, Mr Stephen Dorrell, who has been criticised for apparent indifference to his department, surprised the arts world yesterday and won the plaudits of Lord Gowrie, chairman of the Arts Council. 'While the restitution still falls short in real terms, the secretary of state has made an excellent start and the additional Pounds 5.1m will enable arts organisations to trade their way out of recession,' he said. The council will decide next month how to distribute its grant among its clients, but the unexpected uplift should prevent the collapse of any important arts companies, many of which have deficits. The arts will also benefit from the extra Pounds 750,000 allocated to the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme, bringing it up to Pounds 5.6m a year. There was also good news in the chancellor's announcement that the Foundation for Sport and the Arts would continue for at least the next five years. In total, Mr Dorrell managed to raise the budget of the Department of National Heritage from Pounds 976m to Pounds 1.01bn, an increase roughly in line with inflation. Mr Dorrell has shown great interest in the potential of tourism to increase the revenues of arts companies. From his budget he has allocated an extra Pounds 2m to the British Tourist Authority over the next two years so it can launch a new tourist marketing initiative for London.</p>

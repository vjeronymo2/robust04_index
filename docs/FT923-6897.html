			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Bahamas lawyer unseats Pindling MR Hubert Ingraham, a 45-year-old lawyer, is to be sworn in as prime minister of the Bahamas following victory, in a general election on Wednesday, over Sir Lynden Pindling, the archipelago's premier for the past 25 years. Provisional results give Mr Ingraham's Free National Movement at least 31 of the 49 seats contested, with the remainder going to Sir Lynden's Progressive Liberal party. Mr Ingraham had focused his campaign on attacking Sir Lynden's handling of the economy, which is based on tourism and offshore financial services. He promised to sell off state-owned enterprises, including several hotels. The prime minister-elect was a senior member of Sir Lynden's party until his dismissal in 1984. Mr Ingraham claimed he was fired because he had advocated the sacking of officials who were publicly linked to narcotics trafficking. Mr Ingraham will be faced with a need to restore local and foreign confidence in the economy. He has promised to turn initially to problems in the tourism sector, which has suffered from the international recession. He pledged to 'heal' the nation, encouraging blacks and whites to participate in the economy. 'You removed from office the longest-serving elected leader in the Commonwealth, perhaps anywhere, and you have done it peacefully through the electoral process. And for that I congratulate the Bahamas,' Mr Ingraham told supporters. Sir Lynden, 62, was one of the longest-serving prime ministers in the Commonwealth, and has been a colourful and controversial figure. Advocating increased economic opportunities in the Bahamas for black people, who make up 85 per cent of the population, Sir Lynden has always argued that he was seeking economic justice for all Bahamians. However, his administration had been accused of being corrupt. In 1983, there were allegations in the US that senior officials of the Bahamian government, including Sir Lynden, were involved in drug smuggling. He axed several officials and denied that he was involved. The charges appeared to have had little effect on his popularity, as the PLP won elections in 1987.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOME PRICES DIP A BIT IN JANUARY DOLDRUMS  </P> <P> Home prices took a slight dive last month as the Orange County housing market  went through its annual January slowdown, said TRW Real Estate Market  Information.  </P> <P> The average price for all homes sold in the county during the month was  $218,251, down 0.7% from December's $219,774. The average price a year ago was  $179,895, or about 21% less.  </P> <P> Unlike other studies, the Colton company's market survey includes both new and  used houses and condominiums.  </P> <P> Sales fell 27.6% during the month, from 4,639 units in December to 3,362 in  January, TRW said.  </P> <P> That seems like a lot, but it's about the same drop as last year, when sales  fell 28.2% between December and January.  </P> <P> In fact, January home sales were about the same as a year ago, when 3,498 units  were sold in January, 1988.  </P> <P> The winter months are traditionally a slow period for home sales, which then  pick up in the spring.  </P> <P> Realtors are now watching the market closely to see if last year's extremely  heavy demand for housing will reappear. So many people were in the market for a  house last year -- and so few houses were available -- that local home prices  soared to among the highest in the nation.  </P> <P> Many experts, however, say that while 1989 home sales should remain strong,  they won't be as frenzied as last year. Price increases, they say, should stay  well below 20%.  </P></p>

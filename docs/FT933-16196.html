			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / International Company News: GE to top forecasts in second quarter GENERAL ELECTRIC, the US industrial and services company, has announced that second-quarter earnings are likely to be higher than analysts' expectations, and has unveiled a non-cash, after-tax Dollars 862m first-quarter charge for a change in accounting methods. It expects to announce record second-quarter earnings per share later this month - higher than the Dollars 1.53 average of analysts' expectations. The company will restate its first-quarter figures to include a charge of Dollars 862m because of its adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Statement 112, which must be adopted by all US companies by 1994. GE is one of the first leading companies to adopt the standard, which requires companies to account for the cost of certain post-employment benefits, such as redundancy payments, over the working lives of employees rather than when the payments are made. The standard does not cover post retirement pension, medical and life insurance benefits.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Australia joins the floating-rate club - Government issues Australia's decision to issue floating-rate bonds highlights a growing trend among governments to avoid selling fixed-rate debt at the long end of the yield curve. This year's sharp downturn in world bond markets has pushed long-term yields dramatically higher. As a result, several governments, including the UK, Germany and Portugal, have become increasingly reluctant to issue long-dated bonds at what they consider to be unjustifiably high rates, turning instead to floating-rate debt at much lower money-market rates. Australia will join the club today with its first-ever issue of floating-rate domestic government bonds, or Treasury adjustable-rate bonds. The issue of will consist of ADollars 1.5bn bonds due March 9 1998 with a coupon of 20 basis points below the three-month bank bill rate and a re-offer yield 15 basis points below the bank bill rate. It will be lead-managed by Commonwealth Bank of Australia, with National Australia Bank, Westpac Banking Corporation and Bankers Trust Australia as co-leads. Future TAB issues are likely to be sold via the usual public tender system. According to the Australian Treasury: 'Issuance of this adjustable-rate bond is expected to enhance the Commonwealth's flexibility to raise debt and efficiently manage its debt portfolio. Similarly, the introduction of an adjustable-rate bond will provide investors with greater flexibility in managing their floating-rate exposure while minimising rollover risk and assisting interest-rate hedging.' The shift to floating-rate from fixed-rate debt reflects the Australian government's reluctance to issue bonds at the long end of the yield curve, analysts say. On Friday, the 9 per cent government bond due 2004 was yielding 10.56 per cent, against 6.93 per cent on the three-month bank bill rate.</p>

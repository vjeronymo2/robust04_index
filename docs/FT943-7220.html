			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Hungary considers eurolira issue The National Bank of Hungary, which borrows on behalf of the Hungarian government, is considering launching a eurolira bond offering. Mr Frigyes Harshegyi, the bank's deputy president, said in London yesterday that he had been given the 'green light' by the Bank of Italy's market committee at the end of June A bond offering in eurolira would round off Hungary's recent drive to diversify its international funding sources. This year it has launched bond offerings denominated in yen, D-Marks, Swiss francs, dollars, sterling, Austrian schillings, French francs, pesetas, Luxembourg francs and guilders. Mr Harshegyi said that the bank had raised around Dollars 1.9bn so far this year in the international bond market, which almost completes its Dollars 2bn foreign borrowing programme. 'We are now viewing next year's requirements,' he said. The size of Hungary's borrowing programme next year is likely to be the same as this year's. However, Mr Harshegyi said that foreign borrowing could be less than Dollars 2bn in 1995 if more loans from the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are forthcoming. 'The more the economy borrows on the private side the less we will have to do on the public side,' he said. He was also optimistic that Hungary's stable political situation and the economic transformation would allow it to achieve an investment grade rating in the near future. Its current ratings are Ba1 from Moody's and BB+ from Standard &amp; Poor's, one notch below investment grade. Meanwhile, new-issue activity in the eurobond market was thin, with only one significant offering in the lira sector. Rabobank Nederland issued L225bn of 11.5 per cent three-year bonds. The initial L150bn offering was increased to L225bn soon after launch due to strong investor demand, said lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation. The combination of the bonds' high coupon and short maturity attracted demand not only from the usual retail investors, but also from large institutional accounts, SBC said.</p>

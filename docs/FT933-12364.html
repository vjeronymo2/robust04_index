			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Shaftesbury seeks Pounds 20.8m SHAFTESBURY, a property company focused on London's West End, yesterday announced a Pounds 20.8m placing and open offer to strengthen its balance sheet and make acquisitions. The 24.3m shares are being issued at 88p per share on a 1-for-1 basis. The placing has been underwritten by Kleinwort Benson. The company said it needed the issue to allow it to take advantage of the investment opportunities which are expected to arise as the property market recovers. Shaftesbury said it expected to expand its property interests, chiefly in the West End of London, where it currently owns 32 properties on its Chinatown Estate by Shaftesbury Avenue. It does not intend to undertake speculative developments. The issue will reduce the company's borrowings to Pounds 16.3m and its gearing to 39 per cent, based on its net assets at the end of last September. Some shareholders, with an entitlement of 11.79m new shares, have undertaken not to subscribe and these shares will be placed. The balance of 12.5m new shares will be placed subject to clawback under the open offer. The company is undertaking a capital reorganisation to reduce the nominal value of its shares, to permit the issue to go ahead. It will also seek to eliminate the deficit on its distributable reserves to allow dividend payments to be resumed. Assuming it makes sufficient distributable profits in the year to September 30 1994, the directors intend to pay a dividend for that year following the AGM in 1995.</p>

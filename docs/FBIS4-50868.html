			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- The Republic of China is  considering loaning an additional U.S.$5 million to Vietnam to  help the Indochinese country automate its agricultural industry,  the Ministry of Economic Affairs reported Monday [23 May].    To initiate the plan, Taiwan may establish a holding company  in Vietnam which will provide the Vietnamese agricultural sector  with farm machines, technical consultation, and after-sale  services.    In addition, the Council of Agriculture is also studying the  feasibility of sending agricultural experts to Vietnam to help  out in forestation and forest conservation.    The proposed loan will be offered by the ministry's  International Economic Cooperation and Development Fund (IECDF)  established in 1989 to provide financial aid to needy developing  countries.    During the past two years, IECDF has lent U.S.$30 million to  Vietnam to expand a highway, U.S.$15 million to fund the  development of small and medium-sized Vietnamese companies, and  U.S.$10 million for the development of an industrial park to  house Taiwan-invested factories.    According to Vietnamese Government tallies, Taiwan remains  the top foreign investor in Vietnam, channeling U.S.$1.567  billion into the country for 123 investment projects as of March  28.    In 1993 alone, Taiwan investments in Vietnam totaled  U.S.$388  million, the second highest among foreign investors behind Hong  Kong which sent U.S.$607 million in Vietnam, the tallies showed.  Most Taiwan investments focused on footwear processing, food  processing, textile, wood processing, construction, and  construction material industries.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Motive sought for 'contract' murder POLICE investigating the killing of Mr Donald Urquhart, a London property consultant, were still searching for a motive yesterday. Detectives were making inquiries in the Marylebone area of London's West End where Mr Urquhart, 55, was shot on Saturday night by a man who escaped on a motorcycle. The businessman had property dealings through a company called Bellgap and was part-owner of the Elstree Golf Club at Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. Police are convinced that the shooting was the work of a professional killer. Mr Urquhart was with his Thai-born girlfriend Miss Pat Iamspithone when he was attacked near his penthouse home in Nottingham Street on Saturday night. The gunman, wearing a crash helmet, shot Mr Urquhart in the head with a revolver at close range. Mr Urquhart died three hours later in hospital. Police were also examining files stored in Mr Urquhart's car, a stretched Rover 827, which he used as a mobile office. Mr Urquhart, who told business colleagues he started work as a hod carrier on a building site, built up his fortune during the property boom of the 1970s and 1980s. He had connections abroad with tax havens such as Jersey in the Channel Islands. Detective Superintendent Bill Scholes, heading the investigating, said: 'This murder has all the hallmarks of a professional killing, by which I mean somebody has been paid to do it, and it's been very professionally carried out.' Scotland Yard said: 'We are attempting to unravel Mr Urquhart's finances. There is no evidence to suggest he was involved in anything illegal.'</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHARLES TOWN SUSPENDS RACING AFTER DISPUTE  </P> <P> A disagreement over racing schedules has caused Charles Town Races officials to  suspend their thoroughbred racing program and lay off 1,100 workers effective  Jan. 1.  </P> <P> Track General Manager Donald Hudson on Wednesday blamed the move on a decision  by the West Virginia Racing Commission to restrict the number of races the  track could run daily in 1990 and the size of the purses.  </P> <P> "Horsemen will be notified that all stall spaces must be vacated immediately,"  a race track news release said.  </P> <P> Robert Burke, chairman of the state racing commission, said the dispute between  track owners and the Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Assn. centers on the  number of racing days per week and the size of the purses paid to the members  of the horsemen's association.  </P> <P> Burke said that the association wants 44 races a week and that track owners  want 51 races a week.  </P></p>

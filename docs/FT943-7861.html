			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / International Company News: Saab Auto returns to the black Saab Automobile, the Swedish carmaker, yesterday reported its first quarterly profit for five years. It was also the first profit under the management of General Motors of the US, which became joint owner of the company with Sweden's Saab-Scania in late 1989. Saab said a sharp rise in sales, reduced costs, and the weakness of the Swedish krona were the factors behind a SKr726m (Dollars 93m) turnround to a SKr203m pre-tax profit in the second quarter from a SKr523m loss in the same period last year. The second-quarter surge also produced a first-half pre-tax profit of SKr104m, against a SKr684m loss in the first half of 1993. The company said it was 'on track' to make a modest full-year profit in 1994 after five successive years of losses. The total deficit since GM bought in and took over the management was more than SKr11bn. During that time, GM and Saab-Scania, which is part of the Wallenberg family empire, have pumped more than SKr8bn in new capital into the company to keep it afloat. This year has at last brought an upturn, with unit sales rising 26 per cent to 45,200 in the first half from 35,800 in the same period of 1993. Combined with the fall in value of the krona, this pushed sales in the first half up to SKr8.75bn from SKr7.75bn. With the workforce cut in half, to 7,900, over the past few years, Saab's break-even level is now around 83,000 unit sales a year: it expects to sell 94,000 cars this year, compared with 73,600 last year, a record low. A large part of the turnround is attributable to the Saab 900 model launched last year, which drew heavily on GM components and was billed as the car that would make or break the company. It accounted for 27,500 of the first-half unit sales, while the bigger and older Saab 9000 accounted for 17,700. Saab said sales in the US, its biggest market, rose to 10,837 units in the first half from 9,400 last year. This upward trend should continue in the second half, as sales of the recently-launched 900 cabriolet model take off. Meanwhile, a rebound in the Swedish new car market sent Saab sales at home soaring to 9,268 units in the first half from 4,878 last year.</p>

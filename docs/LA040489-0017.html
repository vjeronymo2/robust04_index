			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: AT $200,000 PER PITCH, BUSH MAY BE OVERPAID  </P> <P> Since President Bush earns $200,000 a year and throws only one pitch a year --  on opening day -- should he be considered one of the highest-paid participants  in the game?  </P> <P> If so, it wouldn't be by much.  </P> <P> Of the 26 opening-day pitchers in major league baseball, 23 are paid more than  Bush, including the two who shared the mound with the President in Baltimore on  Monday.  </P> <P> The Baltimore Orioles' Dave Schmidt will make $625,000 this season, and  Boston's Roger Clemens will make $2.3 million.  </P> <P> Bush's toss Monday, by the way, was high and outside, which probably explains  the salary discrepancy.  </P> <P> Just for openers: Opening day of the baseball season always brings its trove of  statistical treasures, and Jim Shea of the Hartford Courant has gathered some  of them together. A sampling:  </P> <P>  -- Ted Williams hit .449 in 14 openers.  </P> <P>  -- Bob Feller threw a no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox on opening day  in 1940.  </P> <P>  -- Babe Ruth won his first three starts as an opening-day pitcher and went on  to hit .422 in 18 openers.  </P> <P>  -- George Bell last year became the first player to hit three home runs on  opening day.  </P> <P>  -- Don Drysdale is the only pitcher to hit two homers on the first day of the  season.  </P> <P> Trivia: Who started the custom of throwing out the first ball in the  presidential opener?  </P> <P> Numbers game: For only the second time in Sparky Anderson's 10 seasons as  Detroit's manager, a rookie -- first baseman Torey Lovullo -- will start in the  Tigers' opener today.  </P> <P> Lovullo, from UCLA, was drafted as a second baseman-shortstop in the fifth  round of the June, 1987 draft.  </P> <P> The Tigers must expect big things from the former Bruin, who has had only 177  at-bats in competition higher than double A. They gave him jersey No. 23, the  number worn by Kirk Gibson when he played for Detroit.  </P> <P> Going up: Former NBA star George Yardley, speaking at a basketball awards  breakfast in Anaheim on Sunday, had an observation about then and now.  </P> <P> "I was watching some of the films of the old days in the NBA, back in the '50s,  when I was playing," Yardley said. "One thing I noticed right away: We all had  the same vertical jumps that the girls have now."  </P> <P> Extra Yardley: Yardley had another message for the prep all-stars in his  audience: "Get involved with a sport like golf or tennis, sports that you can  use for many years. Basketball is one of the first sports to desert you because  of age."  </P> <P> Aces: Reliever Mark Davis of the San Diego Padres had an enjoyable spring -- up  to a point.  </P> <P> He allowed one earned run in 18 innings and had two holes in one on the golf  course.  </P> <P> He scored the second of those aces in Palm Springs last week. Seeking a third,  Davis went back the next day to try again.  </P> <P> He shot a 16 on the same hole.  </P> <P> Countdowns: Notice anything odd about the Lakers' 138-98 victory over San  Antonio last Thursday?  </P> <P> Magic Johnson had 10 assists, nine rebounds, eight points, seven free throws,  six free throws made, five turnovers, four offensive rebounds, three personal  fouls, two steals and one field goal.  </P> <P> No mention of partridges or pear trees.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: William Howard Taft in 1910.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Said Senior Tour pro and accomplished golf instructor Phil Rodgers,  after spending a week working with Greg Norman: "My wife told me to quit giving  lessons and start taking them."  </P></p>

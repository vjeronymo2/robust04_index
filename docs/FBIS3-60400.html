			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Minister of Health and Child Welfare, Dr Timothy  Stamps, yesterday confirmed recent Press reports that over 20  members of staff had contracted tuberculosis at Chiredzi  District Hospital.    Dr Stamps told reporters in Chiredzi that 20 nurses and six  general hands had contracted TB but neither confirmed nor denied  that four nurses had died of the disease.    "They did not die of TB, we all know what they died of," he  said.    Investigations to establish the cause of the outbreak were  underway while efforts to protect staff from TB were being made,  he said.    Dr Stamps said precautions being taken to prevent the  recurrent of such incidents included proper disposal of TB  positive Sputum, the use of masks by staff, proper changing of  bed linen and thorough cleaning of hospitals.    "TB is a big problem in Chiredzi, you should put in place  extra precautions to reduce the risk of TB spreading," he said.    He, however, said staff also had a duty to protect  themselves  but did not guarantee a "non-risk situation."    Dr Stamps said in 1992 Masvingo recorded 377 deaths  resulting  from TB of which 144 were from Chiredzi. He said at least 200 TB  cases were reported every three months in Chiredzi.</p>

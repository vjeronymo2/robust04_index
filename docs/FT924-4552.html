			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Yeltsin demands new powers to ease reforms PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday confronted the Russian Congress of People's Deputies, the supreme legislative authority, with a catalogue of its failures and a demand that it ceases to interfere with the course of reform. In a barely-applauded speech, laden with foreboding of violence and intimations of the fragility of the new institutions, he offered a compromise immediately derided by his opponents as insufficient and characterised even by his supporters as risky. The compromise, aimed at strengthening the presidency and dividing more exactly the overlapping powers of the various levels of Russian power, consisted of an offer to renounce his extraordinary powers to introduce decrees and to allow the Supreme Soviet, or permanent legislature, to examine his economic legislation within 10 days. In return, he asked the Congress to deal only with the constitutional matters, including deciding on the new constitution itself; for the supreme Soviet to give up most rights in the sphere of economic reform to the government and the president; for a prolongation of his unqualified right to choose the government, except for the premier whom he would allow to be approved by the Congress; and a postponement of adoption of a new law on government until a new constitution is agreed. This demand for fuller powers for a 'stabilisation period' of between 12 and 18 months was necessary, he said, given a society where extremists were forming fronts and even armed groups and deputies thought not of the country, or of fulfilling decisions of the Congress but of how to push through their own will. Furthermore, neither political parties nor a settled division of responsibilities had yet taken root. In Mr Yeltsin's account, the deputies themselves were part of the problem of a society on the brink: quoting Pushkin he said :'God grant you never see a Russian uprising - without sense or mercy.' However, a large part of the hour-long speech was concerned with the less apocalyptic tasks of laying out the basis for an economic programme that he hopes will appeal to the Civic Union group which claims the support of 30-40 per cent of the 1,040-plus deputies and which he needs to avoid a series of defeats at the hands of the shifting alliance of factions and uncommitted deputies which make up the Congress. In this plan, foreshadowed last week by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, industry would be subsidised, 'sensible protectionism' would shield Russian industry, contracts would be awarded to Russian consortia and more assistance to Russian agriculture. Above all, the state would be greatly strengthened to play a guiding, interventionist role in the reform process - a process which the president described as 'treading the golden path between the free market and the state's role as regulator'. In one of the few mildly popular parts of his speech, he proposed that the state do a great deal for its citizens at once - by indexing their savings, now being reduced by inflation. This was much more generous than the offer made on Monday by Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, to pay 60 per cent interest on them while the central bank lending rate stood at 80 per cent. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the subtle speaker of the parliament, appeared in a later speech to call for the resignation of the government when he said that the new economic course demanded new ministers - but then qualified it by saying that 'we (the deputies) are doomed to co-operate with them'. Mr Nikolai Travkin, however, leader of the Democratic Party and one of the leaders of the Civic Union, took Mr Khasbulatov's call as one for resignation, and supported it.</p>

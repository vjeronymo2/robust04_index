			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / People: Strategic move for Sandland The hunt is on for a new chief investment manager for the Norwich Union Insurance group, one of Britain's biggest mutual insurers, following last week's retirement of Mike Sandland (right) after eight years in the post. Sandland, 56, joined Norwich Union in 1961 and has spent all his life on the investment side of one of Britain's biggest institutional investors. In addition to managing Pounds 33bn, Sandland has made a name for himself as one of a growing band of institutional investors who are taking a more aggressive stance towards the managements of underperforming companies. His most famous clash with one such happened three years ago when he was chairman of the Institutional Shareholders Committee and helped oust the board of Tace, a small company making pollution monitoring equipment. He is a member of the Cadbury committee on corporate governance and has been one of the leading institutional opponents of long rolling contracts for directors. After 33 years, Sandland felt it was time to 'get off the executive treadmill' and has retired three years early. His first retirement job is in joining Tom Frost, the former chief executive of National Westminster Bank, on the advisory board of The Strategic Partnership, a small management consultancy set up earlier this year. Despite his criticism of some company boards, Sandland is hoping to pick up a few non-executive directorships. He has plenty of contacts, since his job at Norwich Union meant that he regularly met the chairman and senior management of nearly all of the UK's larger companies. (See Observer)</p>

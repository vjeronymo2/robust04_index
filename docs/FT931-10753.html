			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Hope never dies DESPITE repeated claims by UK officials that there would be no base rate cuts in the near-term, dealers in the sterling markets ended the week looking for 5 per cent rates sooner rather than later, writes James Blitz. The last five days have brought the most volatile trading in the sterling cash and futures markets since the run-up to sterling's devaluation on September 16 last year. As speculation intensified on Monday that Mr John Major would ease monetary policy willy-nilly, the March short sterling contract rocketed to 94.50, a level that would be consistent with 5 per cent rates at budget time. The rate for 1-year cash was also bid as low as 5 5/8 per cent. Since then, the UK authorities have carried out a damage limitation operation. On Thursday, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, said there was little immediate prospect that he would follow the Bundesbank's lead and cut UK rates again. The government's comments have manged to restrain the earlier enthusiasm of the market. Yesterday, the March contract closed at 94.26, a level that prices 3-month money at 5.74 per cent next month. If that price is taken at face value, the market would appear to be only fishing for a 50 basis cut in the next few weeks. But, according to one dealer, the market will be bought again before too long, and futures will go up. 'There is every chance of dealers building up another bout of enthusisasm in the next two weeks,' he said. One discount house dealer argued yesterday that the Bundesbank's decision to cut its discount rate by 0.25 per cent on Thursday made a UK base rate cut at budget time even more likely. If the Bundesbank's cuts were a precursor to more easing in the next two months, then the UK could ease policy without this adversely affecting the value of the pound. However, if the Bundesbank cuts rates too slowly, tensions in the exchange rate mechanism could explode, allowing France and other ERM countries to cut rates freely. This would ease pressure on the pound. Enthusiasm for a cut would be checked altogether if foreign exchange dealers were to ignore the chancellor's words of caution, triggering another run on the pound.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Receivers go into Alpine after order book sale RECEIVERS have been appointed to Alpine (Double Glazing), one of the UK's oldest home improvements companies which ceased trading at the end of May. The announcement follows news that Alpine's directors sold the group's order book to a newly formed company only four days before it ceased trading. Alpine customers yesterday received letters from the new owner, Neonbeam, which now has the same address as Alpine in north London. The sale of the order book leaves little in the way of assets for creditors to recoup. In March 1992, one month after the company was purchased out of administration with backing from Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur with offshore interests, Alpine sold all of its plant, machinery and office equipment to a Guernsey-based company, Finchfleet. A letter dated March 30 1993 from Finchfleet states that Alpine has no title or ownership in such goods. Mr Grant Jones, of City accountants Morison Stoneham, was appointed receiver on Friday by Western Trust and Savings, the West Country bank which holds a charge over Alpine. 'The debenture holder has sought to preserve the position of the creditors with the appointment of a receiver,' Mr Jones said. 'The receiver hopes this process will protect the good name of Alpine, one of the oldest names in home improvements.' Mr Jones said yesterday he would be investigating any sale of assets prior to his appointment. 'The receiver's fixed and floating charge covers any sale of the business in the period prior to his appointment,' he said. Neonbeam was an off-the-shelf company purchased by a Regency Financial Services on May 11. Regency shares offices with Mr Graham Wilson, the accountant who has called a creditors meeting to discuss liquidation of Alpine on June 15. Mr Wilson, who also represents Mr Smith, was arrested last August on suspicion of defrauding creditors in an insolvency procedure, is on police bail. Clive Smith, Page 20</p>

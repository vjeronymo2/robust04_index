			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Observer: Top friends If Friends Provident, Britain's third biggest mutually-owned life office, was quoted on the stock market it would not survive three months, says its deputy managing director, 56-year-old Michael Doerr. There are plenty of continental and US predators who would be prepared to gobble up a quality company like his, for Pounds 1.5bn plus, if they had the chance. So does this mean that the 160-year-old insurer is going to remain forever protected by its cosy mutual status? 'We will not demutualise for the sake of demutualising' says Doerr, but then coyly refuses to dismiss the possibility out of hand. It could happen, for example, if Friends Provident were to become part of a bigger financial services grouping. Doerr, who takes over from Fred Cotton as chief executive in May, is an actuary, and not normally in the speculating business. For the moment he and Cotton are pinning their faith on developing an alliance with continental insurance partners, a strategy which is already being copied by Britain's Royal Insurance, Germany's AMB and Italy's La Fondiaria. However, if the history of such alliances in European banking - EBIC, Abecor, SFE, Inter-Alpha et al - is any guide, then their effectiveness is limited. Even Friends Provident may find that in the long run it needs something more permanent than a few new continental pen-friends.</p>

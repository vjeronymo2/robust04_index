The official at the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry (MITI), speaking on condition of anonymity, said  some Japanese officials do not understand the seriousness of  U.S. discontent over Japan's failure to meet Washington's  demands.    He emphasized Japan should take strong measures to reduce  its  huge trade surplus by stimulating the economy and opening its  auto market.    The official said the yen is staying where it is against the  U.S. dollar on the foreign exchange market, only because of the  Bank of Japan's intervention to support the dollar. He said the  yen could rise sharply if the central bank stopped its selling  of the yen.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: A maverick takes to the golf course - EIE faces collapse as banks get tough When Mr Harunori Takahashi, president of EIE International, the Japanese property developer, heard that five leading banks were planning to halt their lending to his debt-ridden company, he took the news calmly. 'I'm off to play golf,' he is reported as saying. At least Mr Takahashi has a fine range of EIE International-owned golf courses on which to practise while the payments mount on his company's debts, conservatively estimated at Y700bn (Dollars 6.38bn). But there could be cause for nervousness. The tough line being taken by the banks may yet mark a turning point in the treatment of ailing companies in post-bubble era Japan. The action was initiated by the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, EIE International's main bank, which has about Y190bn in loans to the company, about half of which LTCB has categorised as bad. LTCB wants to distance itself from Mr Takahashi and his approach to the property empire's troubles. Mr Takahashi was still confident last night that he would find other banks to fund his company, but with LTCB and other past friends, including Mitsui Trust and Banking and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, not willing to lend directly, it will be difficult for him to raise new funds in Japan. At EIE's peak, Mr Takahashi had a glittering array of trophy properties. He owns a fleet of luxury hotels including the Beverly Wilshire in Beverly Hills, and a floating hotel in Vietnam. He also established a private university in Queensland in tandem with Mr Alan Bond, the failed Australian entrepreneur. The conflict between the aggressive EIE International and its banks is being played out against a background of a rising pile of non-performing property loans. Japanese banks were able to exploit interest rate falls last year to boost profits and write off a small portion of their exposure, but they face increasing difficulties this year. Officially, the country's 11 leading commercial banks have Y8,400bn in non-performing loans, but that figure is unofficially estimated to be about half the actual total. The banks generally do not include 'restructurings', such as the EIE case, where interest rates are shaved to almost zero, or the problem loans of finance company affiliates. Japanese banks, unlike their US counterparts, are generally determined to deal with their problem loans over the longer term, avoiding the embarrassment of short-term losses. This strategy, mildly criticised by the Bank of Japan, restricts the banks' lending ability and encourages them to pass on the charges to more solidly based clients. But, in the case of EIE International, the banks have decided that enough is enough, although LTCB still plans to support some individual projects, including Bond University and the vast Sanctuary Cove resort in Queensland. A statement from the bank issued in Australia said that it 'wishes both projects to carry on without interruption'. The bank has also indicated that it will not necessarily abandon the debt-burdened shipping and resort affiliate, Sea-Com, listed on the second section of the Tokyo exchange, in which EIE International has a 45.7 per cent stake, or the affiliated over-the-counter electronics company, Electronic and Industrial Enterprises. Trading in both stocks was suspended yesterday. The timing of the banks' retreat is linked to unsuccessful attempts to renegotiate a restructuring package negotiated two years ago, when the EIE group's debts were estimated at Y1,000bn. LTCB says that it was interested in putting together a new package, but could not reach agreement with Mr Takahashi and had to stop fresh lending. Apart from cutting interest rates and pumping in enough funds to keep the company afloat, LTCB had provided EIE with five senior managers who were supposed to work in tandem with Mr Takahashi. The five were given new assignments at LTCB yesterday. 'We could not agree with EIE on the restructuring and have decided to end our support. We just could not go on providing funds the way things were going,' LTCB said. 'We are taking this action because we want to show that we are financially sound.' However, an EIE manager said the bank wants to distance itself from the company, but would be unable to abandon it entirely. He said LTCB had become annoyed because creditors were going to the bank before they called on the developer to collect their debts. 'I think we will be okay. Mr Takahashi is still confident. Today he gave us a rundown of the long-term business plans for the companies, so I don't think he is very worried. We are relaxed,' the EIE manager said. It is unclear whether LTCB and the other banks will be as prepared to pull the plug on more mainstream clients who have heavy exposure to the stock and property markets. The decision is easier in the case of EIE since it is not linked to the large Japanese corporate families, and because Mr Takahashi himself is seen as something of a corporate maverick.</p>

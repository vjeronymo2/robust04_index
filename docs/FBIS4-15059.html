			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Iraq Left Without Mustard Gas"] </F>   [Text] R. Ekeus, chairman of the UN Security Council  Special Commission for Disarmament, has confirmed that the bulk  of Iraq's chemical weapons have now been destroyed and the  requisite barriers erected to prevent Baghdad manufacturing  these categories of arms.    In total 28,000 tonnes of chemical shells, warheads, and  bombs and a sizable quantity of components for the production of  mustard gas have been destroyed in Iraq under UN supervision.    By and large, Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian  Foreign Ministry Press Department, believes that this can be  seen as confirmation of Baghdad's readiness to cooperate with  the United Nations. Such actions on Iraq's part should be  encouraged, Russia's permanent representative to the United  Nations said in New York during the latest examination of the  question of sanctions against Iraq.    Among the problems that the UN special commission still has  to resolve, Grigoriy Karasin cited the task of preventing the  restoration of Iraq's military potential in the future. To this  end, diplomats in Moscow believe, a mechanism for long-term  international supervision of disarmament must be launched as  soon as possible and a new "trial period" begun.    If Baghdad passes the test, the sanctions may be lifted.</p>

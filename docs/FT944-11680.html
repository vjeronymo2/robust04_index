			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Horsham lifted by gain from Barrick share deal Third-quarter earnings at Horsham, the Canadian investment holding company, controlled by Mr Peter Munk, were lifted by a large one-time accounting gain stemming from an issue of shares by American Barrick, the gold producer controlled by Horsham, when it acquired Lac Minerals. The third-quarter gain reflects the difference between the price at which Barrick shares were issued to former Lac shareholders, and the lower value at which Horsham carries Barrick on its books. Net earnings, including the USDollars 136m gain, were USDollars 152.2m, or Dollars 1.42 a share, up from Dollars 15.7m, or 15 cents, a year earlier. Earnings were 15 cents a share without the gain. Revenues climbed to Dollars 697.9m from Dollars 552m. Horsham's horizons have broadened with its purchase of a 47 per cent stake in Trizec, the Calgary-based property developer, and American Barrick's acquisition of Lac.</p>

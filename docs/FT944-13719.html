			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Placer Pacific slips to ADollars 63m at nine months Placer Pacific, the Australian listed mining company which is controlled by Canada's Placer Dome, yesterday reported nine-month profits of ADollars 63.7m (USDollars 46.6m) after tax, down from ADollars 72.5m in the corresponding period of 1993. Net profits in the third quarter alone were ADollars 22.4m this year. The lower nine-month result, however, was due to the absence of last time's abnormal tax adjustment. At the pre-tax level and before outside equity interests, Placer Pacific made a profit of ADollars 112.9m in the nine months to end-September, up from ADollars 76.2m in the previous year. Placer, which has interests in Granny Smith and Kidston goldmines in Australia and in the Misima and Porgera goldmines in Papua New Guinea, said the improvement was largely due to lower operating costs and depreciation charges. Its equity share of gold production during the nine months was 576,564 oz, down from 616,886 oz in the first nine months of 1993. The average cash production cost for the period was Dollars 262 per oz. Placer, which manages the large Porgera mine, added that total production there was 742,083 oz during the nine months, down from 865,995 oz in the previous year. This was below expections, and full year production estimates have been revised to 1m oz. The production figure was dented by lower than anticipated ore production from the East Zone slopes, and the fatal explosion at the mine in August. However, Placer said that development of the West Zones was now getting priority, to supplement mining production in the current quarter.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd met Baltic  countries' foreign ministers in Riga. Urmas Loit provides the  details.    [Begin recording] [Loit] Foreign Minister Juri Luik, what  was  most important about this meeting with British Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd and your Baltic counterparts?    [Luik] The most important aspect was evidently the symbolic  side of things. British Prime Minister John Major and Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd met the Russian leadership 15 February  and it was seen as necessary to inform us of these talks. The  fact that we are seen as partners who are to be taken seriously,  that it is necessary to inform us and discuss matters with us --  this is perhaps the most important aspect of the meeting.    We discussed here, behind closed doors, also bilateral  relations between the countries. We discussed integration into  Europe and our membership in the European Union. Britain  promised help with free- trade talks. We have small problems  there with agriculture and textiles. Britain, as one of the  most experienced supporters of free trade, promised to put in a  word for us. You have heard here, Britain will be helping us to  build our army and helping with the setting up of the Baltic  peacekeeping battalion. And so, we have discussed quite a  number of bilateral and multipartite issues.    [Loit] Obviously you also discussed the Baltic countries'  relations with Russia. What is the British attitude to some of  the contradictions here?    [Luik] Well, Douglas Hurd emphasized in a very [word  indistinct] manner that in talking about the Baltic countries we  are talking about sovereign states who have full rights to  decide whom they choose to be friends with and whom not, and  whose army is on their territory and whose is not. Full support  was given to our policy of [Russian] troop withdrawal. Douglas  Hurd promised to keep a higher focus on this issue than hitherto  in Britain, and so we had quite a constructive discussion about  relations with Russia. [end recording]</p>

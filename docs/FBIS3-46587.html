			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By William Mallard] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 3 KYODO -- Even some long-time critics  say Japan's antitrust watchdog seems to be trying out a  new-found set of fangs, spurred by overseas and domestic  pressure. But the jury is still out on whether the Fair Trade  Commission (FTC) has developed a bite to match its bark.    With recent high-profile actions against bid-rigging and  cartels, including last year's first criminal convictions in 17  years, even adversaries acknowledge progress.    "I remember people saying the FTC is a dog that doesn't  bite," says a U.S. official involved with Japan. "They're  certainly biting now." But the official quickly sounds  Washington's undimmed cry -- "the antimonopoly law has to be  enforced in a stronger way."    Indeed, the head of the commission, while highlighting the  FTC's recently beefed-up powers and repeating his vows to crack  down harder, stops short of saying the commission's work will  begin to reduce monopolistic practices in Japan in 1994.    "I'd like to hope so. That's my wish," says a grave-faced  Masami Kogayu, the FTC's chairman. "But I am not optimistic."    Despite the commission's recent attention, "there may be  enterprises or sectors that will not heed the antimonopoly law,  through misunderstanding or overconfidence," he says, the former  vice finance minister choosing his words precisely as he sits  bolt upright in a low-slung chair in his broad, sparse office.    In an interview in Tokyo's Kasumigaseki government district  and briefing Japanese reporters, Kogayu spells out recent FTC  actions, defends antitrust enforcement and asks observers to  stay tuned.    In mid-December, ruling on an indictment sought by the FTC,  the Tokyo high court convicted four major printing companies of  bid-ridding contracts to make peel-off stickers for pension  notification cards. It fined each company 4 million yen.    Seven months earlier, the court found eight makers of  plastic  food wrap guilty of price-fixing, fining them 6 million to 8  million yen each in Japan's first criminal antitrust action  since a mid-1970s oil cartel case.    Although "it's a little bit too early to tell," the two  cases  "are probably an indication of a new trend in antitrust  enforcement by way of criminal enforcement," says trade law  expert Mitsuo Matsushita, a Tokyo University law professor.    Formal actions, including the rare criminal indictments,  rose  from seven in fiscal 1989 to 37 in fiscal 1992. Through  December, the commission took 16 actions in the year starting  last April but with seasonal disparities the fiscal 1993 count  may exceed the previous year's, Kogayu says.    Japan's antitrust policy, more carrot than stick, "heavily  relies on a more informal enforcement, guidance and so forth,"  that can mount to some 800 cases in a year, Matsushita says.  But that's just what irks some foreign companies.    "Lack of vigorous application of the antimonopoly law and  ambiguous explanations by the Fair Trade Commission for pressing  or not pressing certain cases" block foreign would-be  competitors unfairly, the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan  said in its 1993 white paper on trade.    "This selective application of antimonopoly statutes is  often  seen as preventing full access to Japan's complex distribution  system," the report says.    Washington is asking the FTC to study several business  sectors, a senior U.S. trade official says, adding U.S.  proposals in bilateral talks "focus on competition policy and  enforcement of the antimonopoly act."    Kogayu notes that the FTC has vowed to step up indictments.  Its enforcement of the antimonopoly law, enacted in the wake of  World War II, "does not stop at just inflicting an extremely  severe burden on business violators, it is very closely linked  with a deterrent effect," he says.    By far the most common formal action is a warning,  accompanied by what Kogayu calls a uniquely Japanese enforcement  tool -- automatic surcharges on the portion of sales that the  FTC judges to be ill-gotten. In the last two years, the Diet  has raised the surcharge rate and boosted the maximum fine for  criminal antimonopoly law violations by 20 times to 100 million  yen.    Critics say an FTC study group watered down its original  plan  to recommend even stiffer fines and Kogayu acknowledges that the  maximum is about one-tenth that under U.S. antitrust law. But  he stresses the FTC's panoply of fines and surcharges, its  commitment in principle to supply some documents to plaintiffs  in civil suits and the effect of bad publicity on offenders.    "Evaluated in total, the deterrent effect against violators  of Japan's antimonopoly law is absolutely not less than that of  America or Europe," Kogayu says. "I think it is by no means  inferior."    He also points to action on other fronts. Since their 1965  peak of 1,079, the number of cartels exempted from the  antimonopoly law has been squeezed to 71 and the FTC is  requiring the remainder to show proof why they too should not be  eliminated, Kogayu says.    In November, the FTC searched the offices of such leading  electronics makers as Sony Corp. and Toshiba Corp., seeking  evidence of bid-rigging for giant video screens. Commission  investigators also searched Shiseido Co. On suspicion it  illegally forced retailers not to discount its cosmetics.    "Our tools have been strengthened and we have just begun  using them," Kogayu says. "Please watch our actions. The  results are now coming out."</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE 'EAR-MAN' AND HIS MOST AMAZING SKILL;  </P> <P> PRESIDENCY: AMERICA'S FORTUNE, WHEN THE WORLD IS GOING THROUGH AN UPHEAVAL, IS  TO HAVE BUSH AS ITS NEGOTIATOR.  </P> <P> In the antic American presidential selection system, almost nothing tests a  candidate's skills as a negotiator. The emphasis is all on trial by combat --  in the primaries against members of the same party, then in high-stakes debates  against the opposing nominee in the general election. The unstated assumption  seems to be that politics is a form of warfare, in which toughness and  durability, the capacity to sustain blows and inflict injury, are the vital  qualities.  </P> <P> It truly is fortunate, then, to have a President with George Bush's negotiating  skills. The testimony on this point -- from members of Congress and foreign  officials -- is nearly unanimous. They find Bush well-briefed, engaged and  self-confident enough to be flexible. He is described by associates as an  ear-man, rather than an eye-man, one who prefers conversation on a topic to a  set of memos or position papers. He governs by talking to people, face to face  or over the phone. And he likes to deal.  </P> <P> His own ego needs are well under control. He encourages those with whom he  negotiates to advance their own ideas and gives them room to maneuver. Told as  a youth that it is bad form to brag and inconsiderate to make others feel  uncomfortable, Bush prides himself on his ability to build personal  relationships. One difficult NATO leader has been converted into a reasonably  strong supporter of U.S. policy by Bush's repeated acknowledgment of this man's  erudition and intellect.  </P> <P> But Bush is more than an artful flatterer, a convivial locker-room or  cocktail-party pal. His real gift, those who deal with him say, is his capacity  to "see the other guy's needs." He understands and respects the reasons why  others at the table take the positions they do.  </P> <P> By conveying that understanding, he was able to defuse a rather nasty  London-Bonn feud at the NATO summit a year ago, where he made his international  debut as President. At that Brussels meeting, Bush managed to line up both  Great Britain and West Germany behind an American initiative for sweeping  conventional arms cuts in Europe. That NATO offer, as it turned out, gave  Gorbachev the assurance that he needed to let the Warsaw Pact countries break  away late last year without fear of Soviet tanks.  </P> <P> None of this guarantees success for the upcoming negotiations on the budget or  on arms control. The policy problems in both are daunting. Nor is negotiating  skill an adequate substitute for public rhetoric when it comes to leading a  democracy. In a representative government like ours, the voters need to hear  goals and strategies debated, not just bear mute witness to a leader's tactical  skills.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, it is an advantage -- and something of a miracle -- to have a  President who is a skilled negotiator, especially at a time when the government  is divided and the world is going through an enormous upheaval. And Bush does  have that skill.  </P></p>

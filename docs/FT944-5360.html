			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (23): Take a stake in unlisted companies - Venture capital If you don't want to start a business yourself, there are at least four ways to take a stake in a private or unlisted company. The least direct way is to buy shares in an investment trust which invests in unquoted companies. The largest is 3i, the development capital group that floated in June and is now an FT-SE 100 stock and the country's biggest investment trust. Invested in more than 3,400 UK companies, 3i has a portfolio that represents a cross-section of the smaller-company sector. But there are 21 other investment trusts, including Candover, the longest established, although liquidity in these shares is considerably less than in 3i. Venture capital investment trusts. After a year of consultation, the chancellor has just announced details of this new vehicle. The extent of the tax advantages has pleasantly surprised the venture capital industry. The new trusts will be similar to personal equity plans in tax treatment - capital gains and dividends will be free of tax. But the front-end relief is what has excited most intermediaries. Investors will receive a 20 per cent income tax relief on the purchase of the trust shares. But they will also be able to defer capital gains tax liability (a maximum rate of 40 per cent) on the sale of almost any class of assets, bringing the total break to a maximum of 60 per cent. Existing venture capital companies are likely to emerge as the main sponsors of the new VCITs. 3i, which currently has the largest network of regional offices, is considering launching one. The VCITs cannot invest more than Pounds 1m in any one investment, and private investors will be limited to a Pounds 100,000 investment in VCITs in any year. Moving further up the scale of risk is investment through an Enterprise Investment Scheme. Last December, this replaced the discredited Business Expansion Scheme, which had been hijacked by sponsors pushing secure assured-tenancy property-based schemes. The new EIS scheme is much closer to early BES schemes, except that the tax breaks are smaller. Investors receive 20 per cent up-front relief on their investment - compared with marginal relief of 40 per cent in the last days of the BES. And the investments must be in trading - not property-based - companies. Because of the relatively low front-end tax relief, sponsors have brought few schemes to the investing public. Almost none of those they have launched have raised the targeted amount. Private investors who are more interested in the underlying business than in tax breaks are, however, slowly increasing their use of the scheme, intermediaries say. The EIS scheme is unlikely to be widely used by business angels. They will tend to structure their investments with as much redeemable loan stock as possible and as little pure equity. Investors can also avail themselves of the latest changes in capital gains tax roll-over relief, introduced in the November 1993 budget. This allows investors to shelter capital gains made on almost any class of asset if those gains - not the original capital - are invested in private trading companies. Unlike the EIS and VCIT schemes, investors can shelter an unlimited amount of gains in this way, effectively securing an interest-free loan from the Inland Revenue. In the 1994 budget, the Chancellor extended the roll-over relief to investments made in EIS schemes.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Crusade under way to prevent a new pensions scandal: The task facing the Goode committee FOR a sector committed to the long view, the pensions industry left its responses to the government's Pension Law Review committee very late. About 200 replies were sent in the last two days before yesterday's deadline set by the committee, chaired by Professor Roy Goode. The impetus came with the collapse of Robert Maxwell's business empire late last year and the news of the scale of money plundered from the pension schemes of his former employees. It appears that more than Pounds 440m was taken from the pension funds and either liquidated or loaned as collateral through the private Maxwell companies to support escalating debts. In the wake of the scandal, politicians and industry commentators have raised questions over issues of control, ownership, management and scrutiny of pension fund assets. The Commons social security committee began to examine the issue, and the government announced the creation of an independent panel to examine occupational pension schemes. Now the Goode committee has the task of wading through the 1,000 submissions it has received - in response to a list of 81 questions sent out in September - and the opinions expressed in three public meetings held with scheme members. With so many replies, there has been no time to analyse all the views expressed in depth, but Mr Stefan Czerniawski, secretary to the committee, said that three main themes had emerged - regulation, control and compensation. On the first issue, the Commons committee expressed concern yesterday that over-regulation would cause employers to switch out of final-salary schemes to money purchase schemes, where the pension depends on the fund's investment performance. Employers already face difficulties such as reduction of pension fund surpluses, economic difficulties and forthcoming European Court rulings on sex discrimination by funds. Prudential, Britain's biggest life company, has, like others, called in its submission for a single regulator to replace the bodies that oversee the industry. Noble Lowndes, financial advisers, said some of the difficulties 'stem from the number of bodies exercising control over the way pension schemes operate.' It adds: 'Confusion, conflict and we believe, the gaps in control would be avoided by the creation of a single statutory regulatory authority - a pensions commission.' On the second issue, control, many scheme members were worried in the wake of the Maxwell affair over the adequacy of management controls and independent scrutiny to protect pension assets from fraud. Price Waterhouse is among larger accountancy firms calling for greater requirements for auditors to ensure that their concerns are clearly communicated beyond the trustees to pension scheme members. By contrast, Chantrey Vellacott, a smaller accountancy firm, suggests that a more radical structural solution is required to counter potential conflicts of interest. It says the primary duties of pension fund administrators, auditors, actuaries, investment managers and other professionals should be owed to the trustees and members. It argues that while there may be cost savings if pension schemes and companies use the same advisers, they are more than outweighed by the pressure that fees and conflicting demands from the different entities may create. The final report from the Commons committee says a complete ban on self-investment (where funds invest in the shares of the parent company) is not necessary, if pension funds are indepen-dent of the parent company. It calls for a custodian committed to the interests of scheme members rather than the employer, with a written agreement specifying the investment policy of the fund and clear instructions on who has authority to give instructions on payment and delivery. The third issue, compensation, has already led to controversy: the electricity supply pension scheme - the UK's second-largest pension fund - has threatened to resign from the National Association of Pension Funds over it. The association proposed that scheme members should be paid compensation however any shortfall in a scheme might occur, with the cost borne by the industry as a whole. But Mr Mike Cannan, chief executive of the electricity scheme, argued vehemently against compensation being paid, regardless of the reason for the shortfall, and said other bodies than pension schemes should be made to contribute. The electricity scheme, like the Confederation of British Industry, wants any compensation plan to be strictly limited. According to Sir Bryan Corby, deputy president of the CBI: 'If such a scheme is introduced, it should only be in respect of fraud only, and should not cover poor investment or underfunding.' Moreover, some in the industry feel that a compensation scheme should not be the starting point, since the most important factor is to ensure proper regulation. Mr David Willetts, Tory MP for Havant, said yesterday that the select committee would look closely at the City's response to Sir John Cuckney's trust fund, which is trying to raise money to rebuild the Maxwell pension assets, before deciding on the merits of a compensation scheme. In other words, the City may face a choice of paying up now or paying up later. Editorial comment, Page 20</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Short-lived rally in US Treasuries after rate rise US Treasury prices were extremely volatile yesterday afternoon as the market struggled to interpret the implications of the Federal Reserve's announcement that it would increase the target for its Federal funds rate. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 93 23/32 , yielding 8.047 per cent. At the short end of the market the two-year note fell  1/8 to 99 19/32 , to yield 7.081 per cent. The long-bond yield fell below 8 per cent immediately after the announcement that the Fed's open market committee had voted to boost the target rate by 75 basis points to 5 1/2 per cent. Most analysts had expected an increase of at least 50 points and believed the markets had already accounted for a 50-point increase. The news that the Fed had increased the target rate by more than expected was taken as a sign that it was willing to continue a tough stance against inflation. But the rally was short-lived. Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the securities house, said the initial rally was more surprising than its later return to near pre-announcement level. 'A move of this magnitude had certainly been contemplated by most market players,' he said. 'There is ample justification for the market to be somewhat better than pre-announcement levels because the Fed has shown more anti-inflation resolve than previously,' Mr Lipsky said. 'There is little justification for any significant rally at this time because, until economic growth shows clear signs of deceleration, the bond market remains vulnerable to disappointing inflation figures,' he added. The Fed cited the highest capacity utilisation figures since February 1980 as its main reason for the increase. Earlier, it had announced that the economy was using 84.8 per cent of its capital stock for the production of goods, and a 0.7 per cent increase in industrial production. Economists had anticipated a 0.6 per cent increase in industrial production and capacity utilisation of about 84.8 per cent, but the actual figures were considered generally in line with expectations. Bond prices dipped early in the morning following the announcement that retail spending for October had grown by 1.1 per cent - analysts had expected an increase of about 0.6 per cent - but bounced back later in light trading as traders awaited an announcement on interest rate policy. European government bond markets drifted higher yesterday as investors waited for the result of the Federal Reserve meeting in the US. Mr Simon Maggs of IBJ in London said: 'Trading has been very thin ahead of the FOMC meeting, but European markets will be moving on the back of that meeting tomorrow.' Most markets followed German government bonds upwards, although Italy registered a fall as investors took stock of the difficulties the government is having in enacting budgetary reforms. German bunds broke through an important resistance point at 90.50 and the December bund futures contract ended at 90.69, up 0.41 on the day, in light trading. Mr Karl Haeling at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt said: 'Breaking through that point makes it very tempting to get bearish.' However, he pointed out that if there were a rally in bunds, investors were likely to shift into US Treasuries. UK government bonds followed bunds up in thin trading and the December long gilt future closed around 102 1/8 , up  13/32 . The yield spread over bunds was 135 basis points. A Pounds 250m tranche of 8 3/4 per cent Treasury stock due 2017 was exhausted in afternoon trading. The bonds were supplied at 102.28, the Bank of England said. The tranche was one of four tap stocks announced on November 4. Two others, a Pounds 250m tranche of 8 1/2 per cent stock due 2005 and Pounds 100m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock due 2000 have already been exhausted. Another Pounds 100m tranche of 2 1/2 per cent gilts due 2024 has not been sold out. While the sale of the tranche suggested demand for gilts, some analysts believed the bonds had been bought by market-makers and would continue to hang over the market until sold on to investors. A raft of UK data is due out this morning, encompassing figures on government borrowing, inflation, employment and wages, as well as the minutes of the September 26 monetary policy meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. The yield on the 10-year Italian bond rose by 4 basis points to 11.91 per cent. Mr Adrian James at NatWest said this was due to worries over budgetary change. 'Clearly the populace is unhappy about the pension reform,' he said. The yield on the benchmark 11-year Swedish bond fell to 10.84 per cent from 10.88 per cent. Mr Simon Maggs at IBJ said the markets 'believe the honeymoon is over for Swedish bonds'.</p>

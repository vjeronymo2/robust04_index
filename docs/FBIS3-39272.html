			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Subsidies Battle May Continue"] </F>   [Text] The aviation sector is also one of the issues not  covered by the 15 December agreement. Negotiations aimed at  drafting a sectorial code for aviation will continue for a year.  The various subsidy systems are at the heart of the conflict  between the Europeans and the Americans.    For airplanes with a capacity of more than 100 passengers,  the 1992 U.S.-European accord should still apply, at least until  the spring of 1995. It limits direct aid (the Community system)  to 33 percent of development costs and indirect aid (the U.S.  system) to 4 percent of the turnover total. A new accord is  supposed to be signed in April 1994, to take effect one year  later. It will also pertain to small aircraft and engines. If,  after a year, the negotiations have failed, the aviation sector  will be integrated in the General Subsidies Code (as defined by  the GATT), with modifications to take the specific  characteristics of the sector into account. One of the solutions  conceived by the major European construction enterprises with  regard to adapting to GATT calls for nothing less and nothing  more than adopting a subsidies code close to that used by the  Americans. Indirect aid (via NASA or the Department of Defense)  is difficult to quantify, unlike the direct aid provided in  Europe in the form of reimbursable advances. In addition, the  civilian aircraft manufacturers in America benefit greatly from  the research carried out within a military context, which is not  affected by the GATT. This is the case regarding the development  of engines, in particular.    But differences on the position that should be supported  emerged in connection with the manufacturers of small aircraft,  equipment, and engines.    Another controversial subject is the structure of sales.  According to Yves Michot, the director general of Aerospatiale,  orders placed by the American government administration and  agencies account for 70 percent of the turnover totals of the  aviation firms on the other side of the Atlantic, with the  remaining 30 percent representing sales to the private sector,  either on the domestic market or for export. In France, the  proportion is exactly the reverse, so that to achieve the same  result, the budget of the Ministry of Defense alone would have  to be quadrupled.    The only advantage the European industrialists see in the  possibility of an agreement in the aeronautics sector that would  be integrated into the GATT is that the reimbursable support by  the European nations to their industries, which has been the  subject of constant litigation with the Americans, would be  legitimized. These advances could not be demanded in the event  of a failure of the program involved.</p>

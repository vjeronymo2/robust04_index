			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Asim Gruhonjic commentary] </F>   [Text] We should repeat aloud and remember well the brutal  reality expressed in the words of Reis ul ulema Mustafa Ceric  yesterday. He said that the world had legalized the public  crime committed against us, the Bosniak Muslims, and only  because we are preserving our Islamic Bosniak identity and  because we are defending our homeland.    What we must do now can be found only in ourselves and  around  us, and we must finally understand that. Let us repeat: No  United States, no England, no France is going to help us unless  we help ourselves. The brave Gorazde people must know that help  is not forthcoming. The world does not give a damn about our  suffering and our cries. Everything that we have achieved so  far has been achieved with our own strength and the courage of  our fighters. That is the only way in which Gorazde can and must  be defended. Now Gorazde needs iron discipline and  decisiveness. Everything must be subjugated to the defense of  the town, without which there is no life.    Let us remember: We do not face an ordinary enemy. We are  facing a criminal movement that has been launched to destroy us,  to annihilate us. The world is watching that. Our country will  have to be more decisive and more determined in mobilizing all  those who can and must help. We must particularly be decisive  toward the part of the younger people who have managed to avoid  [words indistinct]. Every working place has to be examined  through the effects of the work, and where the effects are not  good, we have to place people where they can and must contribute  the most. We are in a brutal defensive war in which our defeat  means our death. We have to remove decisively all those  incompetent from places of authority. That is why any  broadcasting of the thoughts and statements by prominent world  leaders has also to be subjugated to that aim only, and avoid  everything that sows illusions and feeds idle hope. One of  these is the recent statement by the foreign minister of Russia,  the country that is in essence anti-Bosniak, the country that  has been aiding Milosevic's fascist conquering policy. Can  these people wish us well? Whether this indifference of the  world is the result of the accord reached by the world powers,  there is no point in guessing. We have no use for empty talk.  There is no point in blaming the UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR], since we know that the UNPROFOR headquarters are  somewhere far away, in Washington, New York, or London.    The only correct solution is to mobilize everything we have,  all our forces in the struggle for liberation. All those who  play games with the fate of their people and their state, and  behave [word indistinct] or in a self-centered way, they have to  be removed from their posts. Betrayal and the call on betrayal  must be punished severely. What do you think England did in  World War II? Will we finally come to our senses?    As for Gorazde, let us repeat, it will endure for as long as  it finds the strength to adjust to the imposed brutal situation.  The situation in Gorazde is literally in the hands of the  citizens of Gorazde. The republic will continue to work -- and  work even harder -- on waking at least a bit the  conscientiousness of the world. One however should not have any  illusions here. Everything is in our hands and the hands of the  Lord.</p>

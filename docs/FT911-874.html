			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Brooke hopeful in spite of Ireland talks stalemate MR PETER BROOKE, the Northern Ireland secretary, appeared confident last night about the prospects for 'round table' talks between the province's main political parties. 'We're getting somewhere,' he said as he left the Stormont parliament building. However, morale about Northern Ireland's political future was low as stalemate continued over a logistical detail that has delayed the talks. After a further 6 1/2 hours of bilateral meetings with Mr Brooke, leaders of the main nationalist and unionist parties failed to agree on the venue for the Irish government's entry into the talks process. The dispute underlines the mistrust between the two communities in the province. Neither wants to be seen as giving way first. Discussions are still at the 'talks about talks' stage. Only nine weeks remain before the deadline for the completion of talks, with discussions on the complex subjects of devolution in the province and a new Anglo-Irish Agreement still to start. Ministers believe no side will want the talks to collapse on what seems a trivial issue.</p>

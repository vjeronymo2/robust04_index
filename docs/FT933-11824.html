			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Hedge funds sit on the fence and watch franc FOREIGN currency dealers have spent the past few days pushing the French franc close to its floor against the D-Mark in the exchange rate mechanism and testing the resilience of Europe's monetary system. But surprisingly there has been little or no speculation by the most notorious currency players in the market, the New York-based hedge funds. In the past 12 months, the hedge funds - of which Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund is best known - have been the most active sellers of devaluation-prone currencies, like sterling, the peseta and the punt. But, earlier this week, Mr Soros surprised government officials and currency dealers by saying that he was not selling the French currency. The essence of hedge fund activity is to borrow a vulnerable currency in enormous quantities. The currency is then sold in a minute period of time, often to a central bank anxious to defend the currency's value in the ERM. In the past year, this speculation has alarmed the conservative and long-term participants in the currency market, such as the pension funds, which have the biggest financial muscle and who are anxious to preserve the value of their underlying assets. Their selling pushes a currency to levels at which a devaluation is compulsory. The funds then buy back the currency at a lower rate, making a huge return. In this turmoil, however, the conservative pension fund managers - in particular the holders of French bonds - have been selling the currency without any prompting from speculators. There is a colossal overseas holding of French bonds, and fund managers want to preserve the value of these assets by hedging their currency exposure. But the hedge funds have been on the sidelines. One fund manager in New York said yesterday that he did not see the French franc as 'a great value trade' for him. He said speculators had been reticent in this latest turmoil because, even if France quit the ERM and cut interest rates, the franc could quickly appreciate to much higher levels against the D-Mark. France, he noted, had a stronger current account and trade position than Germany. Even so, the French authorities have two reasons to be concerned: The hedging operations of fund managers and international investors could push the franc out of the ERM if the Bundesbank does not cut rates sufficiently tomorrow. According to a leading manager in London, there were flows of around DM100bn into France and other non-ERM countries after last year's French referendum. Only 15 per cent of that has been reversed in the past three weeks. Some hedge funds threaten to be active sellers of the franc in the autumn. According to one New York based manager, the French currency would be ripe for a depreciation if the country's interest rates remain at high levels in the next few months. 'The longer French rates stay high, the more damage will be done to real estate values and unemployment,' he said. 'An even sharper drop in French interest rates would be needed - and this could lead to the more pronounced depreciation in the currency that is sought.'</p>

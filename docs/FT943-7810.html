			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: A name that spans the world - The Professionals / Joanna Slaughter on investment managers. Today / Rothschild The story of the five sons of Mayer Amschel Rothschild has become merchant banking's answer to the tale of Dick Whittington. Nearly 200 years ago, the entrepreneurial siblings established businesses in the principal cities of Europe. Today, it is little exaggeration to say that nearly everyone has heard the name Rothschild. Peter Sullivan, managing director of Rothschild Asset Management, the group's London-based investment management arm, agrees that instant name recognition is a significant advantage when selling his firm to private clients. But Sullivan describes Rothschild as 'still a family business. It is run by members of the family, who are in here every day. We are managing portfolios for the Rothschilds, and that teaches you the way the family wants its money to be run'. Sullivan says private clients have their money managed in exactly the same way. Thus, it can be assumed that the Rothschilds favour a conservative, low-risk and highly-controlled investment policy with an emphasis on broad diversification. Theirs is not a bank that takes huge risks. Marketing director Peter Rees adds: 'The style flows so much from the organisation and its history. It has all the qualities that are associated with the Rothschild name. It is the traditional approach to running private client money. The approach does not include advisory investment management. All RAM private clients have their portfolios managed on a discretionary basis.' Sullivan has another point. 'Mistakenly, people believe that you need an enormous amount of money to come to Rothschild. But Pounds 50,000 will secure an investor all our skills.' This sum provides a gateway to Rothschild's managed fund service. Those who want a portfolio of direct equity holdings need at least Pounds 500,000 to justify the Pounds 5,000 minimum annual management fee. One of the most rigorous disciplines at RAM is strict adherence to a series of benchmarks and parameters. A benchmark is agreed with each client, on the basis of his investment objectives and risk tolerance, and there are six onshore and six offshore model portfolios, with investment criteria ranging from fixed interest through to 'optimal growth.' The present model growth portfolio for a UK private client has 65 per cent in UK equities; 7 per cent in North America; 12 per cent in Japan; 4.5 per cent in Europe; 4 per cent in the Far East, excluding Japan; 4 per cent in emerging markets, and 3.5 per cent in cash. Sullivan says: 'What is paramount in people's minds is the risk they are taking. Quite often, the client will start with a low risk tolerance but, over time, they may move to another benchmark and model. Clients probably will always look back towards some cash benchmark, but to have a portfolio 100 per cent invested in cash is just as high risk as to have a portfolio invested in equities.' Asset allocation is set by a team of senior specialists from each major investment sector, and implementation is controlled tightly. Sullivan explains: 'The fund manager doesn't have much autonomy and scope on asset allocation. Managers would be questioned if they strayed because senior personnel are constantly looking at the overall balance of the portfolios.' The portfolio managers also have restricted elbow room when it comes to stock-picking. The firm runs 30 core stocks in the major markets and these are represented in all private client portfolios. There is also a list of 130 to 140 UK stocks, from which the portfolio manager is free to choose. The same process occurs in the other major markets. This approved list is reviewed each week and, when stocks are removed from it, they also come out of clients' portfolios. Similarly, a manager cannot buy shares in a company if it is not on the list. RAM looks to the work of the major research houses as far as the core stocks are concerned, but conducts its own research into middle line and smaller stocks. 'We think this is where we can add value,' Sullivan says. The portfolio managers will look at derivatives and hedging mechanisms where appropriate, but these always are used to reduce risk. Portfolios may, for instance, be hedged back into the client's base currency and, late in the 1980s, RAM was one of the first major investment houses to institute a derivatives policy that, effectively, protected its clients in Japan on the downside while giving them 130 per cent of the index on the upside. Collective funds are used for investment in overseas and smaller companies, but the selection is not confined to the house unit trusts. 'We look very carefully at a whole universe of funds,' says Sullivan. None is considered unless it has been in the top quartile of its sector for three years. Recognition that investment services must find more efficient ways to run private client money has prompted a quiet revolution within Rothschild over the past three or four years, according to Sullivan. It has raised its profile significantly, and 65 to 70 per cent of new private client business now comes from solicitors, accountants and other intermediaries. There is a director responsible for every client, while portfolios are run by a fund manager and an administrator. 'We have a very skilled team of managers,' says Sullivan. 'We don't use private clients as a training ground for graduates.' Somewhat surprisingly, given the bank's long history, comparatively few clients represent 'old money'. Typically, they have acquired assets after building up a successful business. Rees suggests that the Rothschild name provides them with 'that little extra bit of security', and adds: 'Our strength is that we will do nothing to damage that name.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Investments managers: Factfile 9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Rothschild Asset Management Established: 1798  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Regulator: IMRO Number of offices in UK: 5 Number of offices worldwide: 32 in more than 20 countries Funds under management: Pounds 16bn (group) Pounds 694m (private clients Number of UK private clients: 300 (1,900 in managed fund service) Number of expatriate/foreign national private clients: 250 Minimum investment for private clients: Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 50,000 for managed fund service) Current asset allocation for private clients: UK growth portfolio, UK equities 65%; overseas equities 32.5%; cash 3.5%.

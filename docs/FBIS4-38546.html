			<p>BFN     [Text] Marat Ospranov, deputy chairman of the Supreme  Kenges, held a news conference today regarding the renowned  statement of the parliament adopted last Friday. He told  journalists how this document which was first elaborated by an  initiating group of deputies, began to reflect -- after  discussion and serious corrections in the committee -- the  opinion of the majority of the parliamentarians, although it was  a narrow majority.    The journalists asked about various aspects of the work of  the new Supreme Kenges, and about deputies' assessment of the  specific measures of the government. Answering these questions,  the deputy speaker said that the parliament is not going to  demand the complete resignation of the government as there are  quite a few lively and knowledgeable people. Nevertheless, in  his opinion, the Cabinet of Ministers lacks accord and  unanimity. People whose stance impedes the progress of economic  reform and the implementation of practical and quite  common-sense alternative proposals are also working in the  government.    Konstantin Kolpakov, personal representative of the  president  in the parliament, spoke at the news conference, stressing that  there is no major discord between the Cabinet of Ministers and  the parliament. The main thing is that they strive to achieve a  dialogue in order to overcome the economic chaos. As far as the  statement of the parliament is concerned, Kolpakov said, it is  not quite correct and contains certain exagerrations, but we  should hope that the statement will be able to promote the  implementation of the market reform.</p>

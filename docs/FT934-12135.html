			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Ministers back down on BR franchise bids THE GOVERNMENT bowed to pressure from Conservative rebels last night and agreed to allow British Rail to bid for franchises to run some services after it is privatised. Lord Caithness, the government's transport spokesman in the Lords, outlined a possible compromise on franchising during his closing speech on the third reading of the bill in the Lords. He said the government had dropped plans to reverse an amendment to the bill which allows BR to compete freely for franchises with private-sector companies. The government had earlier said that the amendment, moved by Lord Peyton, a former transport secretary, would wreck the bill by allowing BR to maintain control over most of its routes. However, the government will table further amendments to restrict BR's rights to bid when the bill returns to the Commons on Monday for its final stages. Lord Caithness said there were 'certain circumstances' in which it might be appropriate for BR to be a franchisee. But the corporation should not be treated in the same way as other potential bidders. The government has not yet decided exactly what restrictions to place on BR. However, the conditions would probably include a ceiling on the number of bids, and transparent accounting to prevent cross-subsidisation of loss-making services from revenues on other routes. Restrictions along these lines would allow the government to argue that it was meeting the spirit of the Lords amendment without allowing BR an unfair advantage in competing against independent bidders. The compromise follows growing unease on the Tory backbenches, especially among MPs from southern constituencies who fear a post-privatisation backlash from commuters. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, has already offered concessions on railcards and pension guarantees in an effort to build support for the bill. However, Lord Caithness said the government would not accept a separate Lords amendment giving the trustees of the railway pensions fund power to veto public spending. The government's willingness to compromise was welcomed by opposition MPs, who have argued strongly that BR should be allowed a free rein in bidding for franchises. But Mr Nick Harvey, the Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, said a compromise would be a 'Pyrrhic victory' which would force BR to 'bid with their hands tied behind their back'. 'The government will place various wrecking amendments in the bill to ensure that BR is an impotent bidder of last resort,' he said. Lord Clinton-Davis, Labour's transport spokesman in the Lords, said the government compromise was 'another piece of Mr MacGregor's sleight of hand'.</p>

The bureau said yesterday that in 35  major cities, prices of consumer goods increased 17.2 percent  and those of major services climbed 38.6 percent. Earlier  estimates of urban inflation for 1993 were 19.5 percent.    Meanwhile, the value of industrial output in December jumped  29.8 percent over the same month last year, further pressuring  prices, the bureau warned. In releasing the monthly figures,  the bureau said: "In December, China's industrial output  increased significantly; retail sales were prosperous but price  rises were serious and inflationary pressure expanded."    "This (29.8 percent) is close to the peak level registered  before (the Government) introduced its macro adjustment  policies," it said.    The bureau also said China's total industrial output value  reached 3,507 billion yuan (HK$3,113 billion) last year, up 23.6  percent. In the same period, stateowned enterprises performed  worse than collectively-run enterprises and township ventures,  the bureau said. Collectively run enterprises reported an  increase of 39.8 percent in output value while stateowned  companies managed an increase of just 8.9 percent.    Township enterprises increased output by 57.6 percent.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> LATINOS PUT OFF CITIZENSHIP EXAM  </P> <P> The overwhelming majority of Latino immigrants -- 98% -- say they intend to  stay in the United States, but many say they've delayed applying for  citizenship because the exam is too difficult, a survey released today said.  </P> <P> "In light of the survey's findings, many of our society's assumptions about  Latino immigrants will need to be re-examined," the National Assn. of Latino  Elected and Appointed Officials group said. "Foremost among these assumptions  is the perception that Latino immigrants are here temporarily and are planning  to return to their homelands upon accumulation of savings or upon retirement."  </P> <P> The average European and Asian immigrant waits seven to eight years before  naturalizing, but Latino immigrants wait an average of 14 to 15 years, the  association said. However, once Latino immigrants take the exam, the survey  said, most pass and don't find it difficult.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by King Husayn in Amman on 11 April -- recorded] </F>   [Text] Your Excellency Mr. President, friends: Peace be  upon you and God's mercy and his blessings. It is with much  pleasure that I extend to you and to your accompanying  delegation a warm word of welcome as valued guests and as  friends whom we hold in deep affection and high regard. I also  wish to welcome you on behalf of the people and government of  the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Let me assure you that we in  Jordan take much pride in the ties that happily exist between  our two countries, founded on trust and cooperation for the  benefit of our two peoples and based on our common faith in the  principles of freedom, justice, democracy, and respect for human  rights. We share with you a sincere desire to contribute in  building a better future in which subsequent generations can  live in peace, security, and prosperity.    Mr. President, we in Jordan have always stood by the  striving  of people for freedom and an independent will. The stand we  take on this issue is deeply rooted in our history. Our  democratic drive, inspired by the Constitution and the National  Charter, which was ratified by a national conference, opting for  pluralism of opinion, belief, and cultural and ideological  reference, is a true embodiment of our firm adherence to the  values of freedom, equality, and regard for human rights. It  stems from our nation's history, from its message of tolerance,  and from its great civilizing role. Not only do we cherish our  democratic march, but we always endeavor with every possible  means to strengthen its foundations and enrich its fabric to  serve as a model emulated and sought by others.    Mr. President, in the last few decades Jordan has played a  pivotal role in maintaining the security and stability of our  region despite the many causes and manifestations of conflict  and despite Jordan's limited capacity and resources. To this  end, we have endured much hardship. When circumstances became  conducive to a convening of the Madrid peace conference, we were  among the first to respond to the call of peace. We took part  in the conference itself as well as in meetings that followed  it. We were diligent in asserting the constant elements of our  unequivocal stand on the whole question of peace. The elements  called for the application of resolutions based on international  legitimacy and for total support for our Palestinian brethren so  as to enable them to participate in the peace process as a  prelude to regaining their rights on their national soil. We  have always been careful to uphold the independence of the  Palestinian decision and to respect the options made by the  Palestinian Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate  representative of the Palestinian people. Our recourse in all  of this has been an abiding faith in the need to achieve a  comprehensive, durable, and just peace in a region torn by  tension and conflict. It is the right of future generations to  enjoy stability and the state of wellbeing enabling them to make  their own contribution to the civilization of the modern age.    We in Jordan recognize and understand the intricate  relationship between a realization of peace on the one hand, and  the achievement of growth and prosperity on the other. Real  peace can neither stand nor flourish in the absence of  development and a decent standard of living. Therefore, the  people of our region look to the international community, and  specially the countries of Europe, to play a role in the  promoting of economic development as a major cornerstone for a  real and lasting peace.    Mr. President, in expressing to Your Excellency our pride in  the distinctive ties between our two countries, based on  confidence and mutual cooperation for the good of our two  peoples, I wish to assure you of our keen desire to foster and  strengthen those bonds in all walks of life and in the various  fields of endeavor.    My friend, I reiterate our pleasure at having you and your  accompanying delegation here as guests of the Hashemite Kingdom  of Jordan and as valued friends. I wish you health and  happiness and a very pleasant stay among us. Ahlan wa sahlan.  [preceding words in Arabic: "you are welcome"] Once again peace  be with you and God's mercy and His blessings.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 28 Mar (VENPRES) -- Division General  Egberto Artuza Delgado, commanding general of the National  Guard, has indicated that there has been a gradual increase in  the past months in activity by Colombian narco-guerrillas  [narcoguerrilla], particularly in the Amazonian area. Artuza  Delgado said this at the end of a meeting with Pompeyo Marquez,  special minister for border affairs, whom he briefed on the  prevailing situation in the border area and the operations being  conducted there by the National Guard.    Artuza Delgado pointed out that the National Guard is aware  that drug traffickers have set up cocaine processing  laboratories and have planted cocaine fields in Colombian  territory near the Venezuelan Amazonian area. He explained that  the existence of these cocaine fields also draws guerrillas  closer since they are in charge of protecting production of the  drug. Artuza Delgado termed this situation "very serious."    Later, referring to the resources the National Guard needs  for border operations, he added that the National Guard is aware  of the country's fiscal situation and that is why it has changed  its conduct. According to Artuza, the National Guard will have  to learn to manage the resources assigned for border operations  more efficiently.</p>

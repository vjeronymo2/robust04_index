			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CRUELTY QUESTION  </P> <P> As the screenwriter of "Project X," I want to thank you for your in-depth  article exploring the trainers' side of the cruelty controversy ("Animals in  Hollywood -- Actors or Victims?" by Vicki Hearne, Dec. 11).  </P> <P> I know Hubert Wells and Mark Hardin, and I find them to be decent,  compassionate and intelligent men. I was on the set for a good part of the  movie, and I never witnessed them or the other trainers abusing any of the  chimpanzees. It's a cruel irony to make an animal rights film and have it  condemned for the very issues that it speaks out against.  </P> <P> In my opinion a fanatical witch hunt was waged against the film and these  trainers. If the people behind this campaign had spent half the time and energy  investigating military animal experimentation and abuses, there would probably  have been no need for a movie like this. Thanks to this article, the public has  at least been able to hear the trainers' side of the story. It's not the  vindication one would have hoped for, but it's justice enough.  </P> <P> STANLEY WEISER  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

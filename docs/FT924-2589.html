			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / International Company News: Philips recruits Ahold president to board PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, has recruited Mr Pierre Everaert, president of the Ahold retailing group and one of the Netherlands' most respected managers, to join its five-member management board and an expanded 13-member group management committee. The surprise appointment is due to take effect on March 1. Mr Everaert will be replaced at Ahold by Mr Cees van der Hoeven, who is currently finance director. After joining the group committee, Mr Everaert, 53, will take over Mr Ype Bouwkamp's position on the management board when the latter retires on May 6. Company officials said that it had not yet been determined what Mr Everaert's specific responsibilities would be, and added that there could be a reshuffle of portfolios. Mr Bouwkamp is responsible for Philips' national organisations outside Europe, among other duties. Mr Everaert's knowledge of retailing and the US will be a welcome addition as Philips continues to grapple with a downturn in its key consumer electronics business. The appointment of Mr Everaert is to be accompanied by the expansion of the 10-member group management committee to include three new members - the heads of the medical systems, domestic appliances and communications product groups. Ahold, whose main business is operating supermarket chains in the US and the Netherlands, said it regretted the departure of Mr Everaert, a Belgian-born, naturalised US citizen who became the first person outside the Heijn family to head the group when he assumed the job in 1989. The Ahold supervisory board expressed confidence in Mr van der Hoeven and his fellow management board members, saying 'their experience in the international retail business will assure the continuation of the strategy and the successful further development of the company'. Under Mr Everaert, whose previous career was spent largely at Goodyear and General Biscuits of the US, Ahold added a fourth US supermarket chain to its business and impressed analysts and the stock market for managing to withstand the increasingly difficult retailing conditions on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

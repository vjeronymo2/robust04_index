Answer: I can't say anything about the programme itself for  I am not NATO's but the UN representative in Azerbaijan. The UN  is in close contact and cooperation with all regional  organizations. Lately, the UN's cooperation with the NATO have  become closer in an attempt to settle the conflict in the former  Yugoslavia. The willingness of sovereign Azerbaijan to  participate in the Partnership For Peace is the matter to be  settled between Azerbaijan and NATO. I'd like to add that the  UN supports any decision which does not contradict its Charter  and contributes to the strengthening of peace and security.    Question: The latest developments in Sarajevo enhance the  possibility of bringing the NATO's peace mission to Europe. May  such mission's coming to Azerbaijan be materialized?    Answer: I don't have a crystal ball. It is the CSCE which  deals with such issues in Azerbaijan. When in New York, I met  with the new Chairman of the Minsk Group Jan Eliasson. Now, he  returned the Swedish Foreign Ministry. He is a very experienced  diplomat. He has a good experience of negotiating and  mediating. Before the last appointment, Jan Eliasson had been  Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs. The new  Chairman is expected to visit the conflict zone shortly.    Question: The mandate of the UNOMIG [United Nations  Organization Mission in Georgia] was extended until March 7,  1994. The UNSC Resolution 896 calls for an immediate  determination of the political status of Abkhazia within the  parameters of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of  Georgia. What do you think the political status is. If similar  developments take place in Nagorno-Karabakh, how would you like  to see the status of Nagorno-Karabakh?    Answer: I attended that very meeting of the Security  Council. Following the report of the SG, Special Representative  for Georgia, it was decided to increase the number of observers.  All UN resolutions on Georgia reiterate the territorial  integrity of Georgia. The resolution requested Georgia to  accelerate the search for political ways of settlement of the  conflict in Abkhazia. If the problem of Abkhazia exists then  political ways should be found to settle it. The same idea  could be applied to Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. If there had  been no conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the Security Council would  have never discussed this problem. All resolutions including  822 and the rest 3 on NK [Nagorno-Karabakh] clearly say that no  conflict can be settled by military means but by political means  within certain parameters.    As for political status, the conflict involving Abkhazia is  one thing but Nagorno-Karabakh is something different. I have  always said that it is very risky to compare different conflicts  and that each conflict has its own reasons and peculiarities.  But the principles are the same. The UN stands for the  territorial integrity and sovereignty of both Georgia and  Azerbaijan and seeks to promote the peaceful settlement of those  conflicts. As far as the status is concerned, it is part of the  negotiation process. I'd like to add that all agreements the  parties arrive at should comply with the basic UN principles.</p>

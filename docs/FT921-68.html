			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Computer trading starts at Lloyd's INSURANCE brokers yes-terday placed risks electronically with underwriters at both Lloyd's of London and London market companies for the first time as the Electronic Placing Support system (EPS) came on stream. Combined with the existing electronic claims payment, accounting and reinsurance systems developed over the past few years, the system is expected to improve efficiency. Mr Steve Abrahams, underwriting manager of Sun Alliance International, who insured one of the first pieces to be offered electronically yesterday, said: 'It will cut out a lot of administrative work and is a major step forward. Sending risks down the line is going to cut out a lot of leg work.' Mr Chris Trickett, managing director of Sedgwick Professional Indemnity, which placed the risk with Sun Alliance, emphasised that the real cost benefits would be reaped 'in the future' when all information is captured electronically, reducing the need for 're-keying' of information. Mr Max Taylor, chairman of London Network Management Committee, which has arranged co-operation between Lloyd's and the associations representing London market companies, said: 'We think this is enormously important and significant.' Both underwriters and brokers stress however that electronic placement will not end the need for face-to-face negotiation of more complex and larger risks. Mr Taylor said that 'the successful implementation of EPS will depend on '(combining) the best of traditional practices with the benefits that modern technology can offer'. Mr Taylor's company, Willis Corroon, is one of four brokers that began placing risks electronically yesterday. CE Heath, Minet and Sedgwick are the others. CT Bowring, Alexander Howden and Greig Fester will join this month and nine other brokers will join later this year. Immediate participation in the system among insurers is much wider. At Lloyd's, more than 100 of the market's 278 syndicates representing more than four fifths of the market's capacity are taking part and more that 100 insurance and reinsurance companies are also involved.</p>

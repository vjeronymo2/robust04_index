			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, April 26 (CTK) -- On the eighth anniversary  of the Chernobyl catastrophe, Austrian Environment Minister  Maria Rauch-Kallat called for the nuclear power station at  Jaslovske Bohunice, West Slovakia, to be converted to a  gas-fired plant as soon as possible.    "The West European nuclear lobby is trying to get into  Slovakia and replace Bohunice with another nuclear power  station. In the West, nuclear power can no longer be put forward  as a solution, and there is thus an attempt here to conquer the  hopeful market in East Europe," Rauch-Kallat said in a press  statement.    The participation of the American firm Westinghouse in the  completion of Temelin nuclear power station in South Bohemia is  clearly considered a green light for further similar activity,  the minister warned. In her contacts with Slovak leaders,  therefore, she had repeatedly emphasized Austrian fears.    "We have also found out that the possibility of changing  Bohunice into a gas-fired power station is becoming more and  more the subject of serious discussion," Rauch-Kallat said,  adding that a significant contribution towards this had been  made by an Austrian-Swiss study showing that such a project was  feasible.    Members of the Austrian environmental movement Global 2000  protested in Vienna today against the participation by the  French company Electricite de France (EdF) in the completion of  the Mochovce nuclear power station in West Slovakia. Activists  abseiled off the roof of the EdF building in Vienna and hung up  a banner saying "EdF -- Hands off Mochovce."    Global 2000 say Mochovce is only a gateway to the East  European nuclear market for EdF, and that the company is mainly  planning to modernize VVER-440/213 reactors. Besides  Westinghouse, EdF is the most significant supporter of nuclear  power in East Europe, they add.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Observer: Oceans apart Watch out for fireworks as one of the world's odder bilateral partnerships comes up for inspection next month. Australia's tough-talking prime minister Paul Keating, fresh from his victory at the polls, is paying his first official visit on Jim Bolger, his New Zealand counterpart. Don't be deceived into thinking that everything is hunky dory just because trade between the two ex-British colonies is booming. There are plenty of tensions behind the scenes. Australians, for example, have never forgiven New Zealanders for refusing to join their fledgling federation in 1900, and many still don't understand why Kiwis don't want to have their affairs run from Canberra, a thousand miles away across the Tasman Sea. Ministers who would not dream of insulting Papua New Guinea or Fiji, find it hard to be polite about their Kiwi cousins. The problem was at its worst in the run-up to last month's Australian election. Not only did Keating's Labor government paint conservative-run NZ as an economic basket case, ignoring growing signs of sustainable recovery, but senior Labor figures also lent weight to dubious claims that Kiwi sheep shearers were cheating on their Australian income tax returns. Whatever next? Bolger, a taciturn North Island beef farmer, is not likely to upbraid Keating in public for his government's insensitivity. But he may feel free to point to another big difference - unlike the staunchly republican Keating, the vast majority of New Zealanders remain firmly attached to the monarchy. He might also have some diplomatic tips. European diplomats say the Kiwis' subtle approach has won them much better trade concessions than those obtained by the rougher Aussies.</p>

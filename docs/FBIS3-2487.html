Commission on the Status of Women, said  today.    Wang Shuxian, the Chinese delegate, said particular  attention  should be given to the situation of women in rural areas around  the world.    "The U.N. platform for action should show special concern  for  them, because they are the most numerous, have bad living and  medical conditions, low social status and heavy household  burdens," she said.    Wang referred to the fact that there are now 650 million  rural women living in poverty, which almost doubles the figure  of 20 years ago. She warned that more women living in rural  areas would join this group if effective measures are not taken  soon.    She also said that young women should also be given special  consideration. "They will shoulder the historic responsibility  of achieving equality between men and women by the 21st  century," she added.    "It is our view that the essence of women's human rights  lies  in the right to equality and the removal of discrimination,  which characterizes the human rights of men," Wang said.    The U.N. Commission on the Status of Women is having a  two-week session which began on March 7.    Most participants are discussing recommendations for a  platform for action to be drafted by the U.N. Secretariat.    The platform is expected to be the major outcome of the  fourth world women's conference to be held next year in Beijing.</p>

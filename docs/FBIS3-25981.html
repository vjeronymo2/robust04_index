Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Feb. 1 (CNA) -- Shih Ming-teh, chairman of  the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Tuesday [1  February] pledged that the party would strengthen cooperation  with Taiwan's business community.    During a breakfast meeting with senior business executives  on  the 1994 economic outlook, Shih said a series of similar  meetings will be held to promote understanding between the DPP  and the domestic business circle.    More than 20 business executives were present at the Tuesday  meeting, while the DPP was represented by Shih, chairman Yang  Huang Mei-hsing of the foreign affairs department, chairman  Chiang Peng-chien of the China Affairs Committee, and  legislators S. P. Chen, P.H. Peng, F. H. Shen, and T.T. Hsu.    Chang Kuo-an, chairman of the Fengchun Group, expressed the  hope that lawmakers of the major opposition party will help  revise outdated rules and regulations to cope with the economic  development vital to Taiwan's future.    The statement was echoed by Chen Sheng-tien, chairman of the  Sampo Group. Chen said lawmakers must monitor the executive  branch with a view to improving executive efficiency.    Two major problems now facing the Taiwan economy are how to  create wealth and the equitable distribution of wealth, Chen  added.    On Taiwan's policy toward investment in Mainland China, Hsu  Hsien-jung, president of Prince Motors Co., Ltd., pointed out  that the government should map out a set of workable measures  for the private sector to follow. "It's a trend that domestic  enterprises will increase investments in Mainland China," he  noted.    Moreover, Hsu stressed, the government should set a  timetable  for further financial liberalization in its ambition to build  Taiwan as an Asia-Pacific business operations center.    Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the China Development Corp.,  however, said he saw nothing in the DPP's industrial policy. "I  don't understand its attitude toward trade ties across the  Taiwan Strait," he added. Liu is concurrently chairman of the  ruling Kuomintang's enterprises management committee.    Shih said after the meeting that the party is not  anti-business and any such impression is a mistake.    To enhance understanding between the party and private  enterprises, similar meetings will also be held in central and  southern Taiwan, he noted.</p>

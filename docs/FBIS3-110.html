When hearings resumed today  before the Kaduna High Court, counsel to Gen. Yar'adua, Mr.  Ademola Ajala, told the court that his client had decided to  withdraw the case in the interest of national peace and unity.  Mr. Ajala stated that the parties had resolved the matter out  of court. Following this submission, the presiding chief judge  of Kaduna State, Justice (Akayeni Biyeye) struck out the case.  It would be recalled that Gen. Shehu Yar'adua had filed a  100-million-naira suit against the Federal Government for  illegal detention and breach of his fundamental rights.</p>

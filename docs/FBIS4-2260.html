			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- China has stepped up  oil exploration of in east China as part of its efforts to  implement the strategy of "stabilizing oil production in the  east and developing the resources in the west" and maintain the  current level of the country's oil production.    The goal is to find more reserves and maintain oil  production  in this part of the country at 124 million tons, according to a  senior official of the China National Petroleum Corporation  (CNPC).    The eastern region covers the vast area east of the Taihang  Mountains and the Three Gorges and north of the Chang Jiang  River. Oil reserves in this area are estimated at 33.5 billion  tons, 54 percent of China's total onshore oil reserves. It  produces 90 percent of the country's oil, which is expected to  reach 140 million tons this year, slightly higher than last.    After more than four decades of exploitation and  development,  most of the production wells have entered the period of decline.  The high content of water makes production difficult. The  amount of reserves verified is less than the amount of oil  tapped.    Oil production in this region is essential to maintain the  current level of production, as oil exploration and development  in the western part of the country has just begun and  transportation problems have hampered development.    According to the CNPC official, a plan has been in place to  increase the recovery rate of the old wells by five percentage  points by drilling more wells and adopting such technologies as  water control and tertiary extraction.    At the same time, efforts will be made to implement rolling  exploration and development in and around the old oil fields in  a bid to find more geological reserves. This will help find 100  million tons of new geological reserves a year and boost the  production capacity by two million tons.    In addition, the region will accelerate the development of  low-filtration, thick oil and shallow sea oil fields.    China's crude oil consumption increases at an annual rate of  six million to seven million tons.</p>

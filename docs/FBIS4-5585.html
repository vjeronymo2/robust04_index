			<p>BFN     [Text] Marrekesh, Morocco, April 12 (YONHAP) -- Foreign and  trade ministers from 125 countries applauded the opening of the  Trade Negotiation Committee (TNC) meeting in the 11th century  Moroccan city of Marrakech Tuesday to officially sign a new  world trade accord.    The general agreement on tariffs and trade's seven-year  multilateral trade round, which set sail in the Uruguayan beach  resort of Punta del Este in 1986, was finalized last December  and will be signed by all member countries on Friday.    Moroccan Prince Sidi Mohamed welcomed participants, TNC  Ministerial Chairman and Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu  Bonilla opened the conference, and GATT Secretary-general Peter  Sutherland looked back on the long and hard journey to the final  ceremony.    South Korean Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim  Chol-su,  the 14th representative to address the floor, voiced the same  enthusiasm as his counterparts and pledged his country's  commitment to implement the agreement fully.    Korea will sign the final act, promising to abide by the  results of the UR [Uruguay Round] negotiations, but will hold  off on inking the mandate for the World Trade Organization  (WTO), GATT's successor, until domestic ratification. It will,  however, initial the new government procurement agreement, an  annex to the WTO package.    There is no deadline to sign the WTO accord although  countries must finish the ratification process within two years  after the treaty takes effect in order to join the new global  organization. "All parties have shown the needed political will  to make the round a considerable achievement. Some may have  gained more than others, and some might be affected more than  others. We know, however, that all parties are winners in both  the economic and the political sense," Kim said.    Asserting that all parties will benefit enormously from the  new agreement in the long run, Kim reminded that Korea has  participated in the round from the beginning. "I would like to  emphasize that my government has made extremely difficult  decisions, particularly with respect to agricultural  liberalization... Korea is now undergoing wide-ranging  structural adjustment in the agricultural sector, which, you can  well imagine, is far from being a simple and easy undertaking,"  he said.    Pointing out that the UR agreement has substantially  strengthened the principle of multilateralism, he urged all  members to complete the necessary domestic procedures soon. Kim  then voiced concern over the non-multilateral approaches taken  by some members, which could undermine the recent multilateral  achievements and jeopardize the viability of the new world  organization, taking a shot at Washington for its  reauthorization of Super 301. All parties should abide by the  new rules, and bring any trade cases to a multilateral forum  instead of handling them bilaterally or resorting to unilateral  action, he said. In the same vein, he expressed concern about  the trend toward exclusive trading blocs.    In approaching the future work of the WTO such as  identifying  the relationship among trade, environmental and labor measures,  Kim advised a balanced view respecting the concerns of  developing countries. Recognizing the sharp differences of  interest between developed and developing countries, he said  that Korea, a newly industrializing country facing the problems  of both, could help to resolve any potential conflicts. "I would  hope that Korea would play a facilitating role in addressing the  content of the agenda and parameters for discussion under the  new WTO regime," he said.</p>

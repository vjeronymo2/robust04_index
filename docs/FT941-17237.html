			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Japanese to allow share buybacks The Japanese government is next month expected to detail new rules allowing companies to buy their own shares. Japanese companies are currently banned from buying back their own outstanding shares, but a plunge in Japanese share values in 1992 prompted the government to consider changes in the commercial code to reduce the extra supply of shares on the Tokyo market. The Tokyo stock market saw the number of shares surge during the asset 'bubble' of the late 1980s, as corporations dipped into the stock market to raise funds through rights issues and equity-linked instruments. Leading businesses, now wary of the stock market slump, have been calling for the government to lift its ban on share buybacks by companies. Advisory bodies to the justice ministry and finance ministry are currently studying the details, and in February are expected to announce their proposals, including detailed disclosure by companies which buy back their shares. The government wants to make legal changes for implementation from next April.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 Mar (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR criticizes the UN  Security Council, which still refuses to issue a clear,  forthright resolution condemning the Israeli Government for the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in which hundreds were killed and  wounded by an armed Jewish extremist. Later, more were killed  and wounded by the Israeli Army during demonstrations to protest  the massacre.    In an editorial today, the newspaper says that if some  states  defend the UN Security Council's slackness regarding  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre using the  excuse that certain powers obstruct any decisive resolution, the  world cannot stand by when it sees this important authority  become too weak to play the role entrusted to it by the UN  Charter.    AL-AKHBAR calls for referring the matter to the UN General  Assembly to take the necessary measures to restore the UN  Security Council's esteem.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION DEBATE: A CLASH OF SIGNS AND CHANTS  </P> <P> Hundreds of angry and emotional activists clashed in an often confrontational  battle waged with signs, chants and slogans on the steps of the Supreme Court  Wednesday, while nine justices inside the building weighed arguments on  abortion in a somber session.  </P> <P> As lawyers meticulously presented their arguments in the marble-lined  courtroom, those on the outside tried to take their cases directly to the  American people via television cameras and reporters.  </P> <P> Police estimated the crowd at between 300 and 400, some of whom had waited all  night for a chance to get one of the scarce 60 seats open to the public in the  courtroom. Others traveled from as far away as California and Texas to express  their views on the controversial issue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Screaming Matches  </P> <P> Signs proclaiming "God Avenges Innocent Blood" and "Keep Abortion Legal"  sparked heated confrontations among protesters, which often turned into  screaming matches with fists and signs waving.  </P> <P> "Abortion tears the heads off of babies," Tennessee activist Dan Martino  bellowed.  </P> <P> "What about the woman?" New York protester Gavrielle Gemma shouted in reply.  </P> <P> The emotional gathering peaked when police arrested 27 students who had pushed  their way through a police barricade and onto the plaza in front of the court,  where they chanted "pro-choice, pro-choice" and danced in a chorus line.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the group, Oppression Under Target, said that they wanted to be  arrested as an act of civil disobedience. Wearing strips of red crepe paper to  symbolize the "red tape" of government bureaucracy, the protesters were dragged  away.  </P> <P> A court spokesman said that the 18 women and 9 men were arrested for crossing  police lines. All of the protesters paid $100 fines and were released.  </P> <P> Over and over again, protesters favoring the right to abortion screamed, "Two,  four, six, eight -- you can't make us procreate" and "Hey, Hey. Ho, Ho.  Anti-choice has got to go." Anti-abortion advocates countered with "Stop the  baby killing" and "Abortion is murder."  </P> <P> The chants grew louder and louder as demonstrators on each side tried to drown  out the other and make their voices heard inside the court.  </P> <P> One woman carrying a sign that proclaimed, "Pro-life, what a lie, you don't  care if women die," said that "nobody can make me carry a baby to term" and  demanded that her body should not be "enslaved to the Catholic church."  </P> <P> Although outnumbered at first, anti-abortion protesters arrived in greater  numbers as the morning went on, waving signs, carrying banners and screaming  into megaphones.  </P> <P> </P> <P> He's Standing Up for Life  </P> <P> Tennessee activist Martino, who said that he was "here with the Lord Jesus  Christ to stand up for life," was carrying a sign plastered with pictures of  aborted fetuses and the slogan "U.S. Supreme Court: Almighty God is Watching  You."  </P> <P> The potentially landmark case centers on a Missouri law that restricts abortion  and declares that life begins at conception. The court is not expected to issue  a decision until the term ends sometime around July 1.  </P> <P> More than 200 people from both sides of the argument came to the court Tuesday  night with chairs, sleeping bags, pillows and food so that they could have a  chance to hear the arguments inside the court.  </P> <P> Supreme Court police gave each early arrival a numbered card. Bleary-eyed and  with aching backs, only a third of the group was let into the courtroom at 9:30  a.m. Wednesday.  </P> <P> Recent UCLA graduates Cheryl Guerin and Sherry Paul arrived at the court at 9  p.m. Tuesday with their blankets and pillows. After hearing the arguments  Wednesday, both said that it was well worth the wait.  </P> <P> "It was disappointing for the pro-choice side," Guerin said. "(Justice  Thurgood) Marshall did not open his mouth. He just sat there. It was also so  male dominated in there. The word 'she' hardly came up."  </P> <P> Dartmouth student Joyce Campbell spent 11 hours at the court waiting in line  and said that she was "overwhelmed by the experience." Campbell, who is working  in the Senate, said that the "pro-choice argument seemed pretty weak."  </P> <P> Travis and Ann Thigpen, who live in nearby Virginia, said that the overnight  wait was worth it, even though they didn't get in to see the arguments. "We  came up here to go to dinner," Thigpen said. "We found out they were letting  people in so we stayed. I really think that Roe vs. Wade will be overturned,"  he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Emotional Level  </P> <P> But while lawyers for both sides debated the finer points of constitutional  law, protesters in front of the court fought on a more emotional level.  </P> <P> Michelle Robinson, a 27-year-old lobbyist from Virginia, said she was concerned  that the court will restrict abortions and vowed to "quit my job and fight for  the rest of my life to save this right."  </P> <P> Terry Wykoff, 35, traveled from New York to participate in a 12-hour prayer  vigil on the steps of the court. Starting at midnight Tuesday, Wykoff and a  dozen other people lit candles and prayed that Roe vs. Wade would be  overturned.  </P> <P> "The Supreme Court will decide on the side of life," she said confidently,  pointing to her Operation Rescue sweatshirt. "The fate of millions of children  are in their hands."  </P></p>

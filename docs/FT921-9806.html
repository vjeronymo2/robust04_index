			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Fiat rail division wins order FIAT Ferroviaria, the rolling stock division of the Turin-based automotive group, has made a breakthrough in overseas sales of its high-speed tilting train by winning a L500bn (Pounds 232m) order from Finland, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The deal was clinched despite stiff European and Japanese competition. The order, for a total of 25 trains to be supplied over the next five years, is Fiat's first foreign sale for this type of locomotive, which will be used on inter-city routes. The electric-powered locomotive was developed in the early 1980s. The FS, Italy's state railways, has 14 in service with a further 10 on order. Export success for Fiat Ferroviaria comes as the state-controlled Efim-Breda group makes important inroads in the US, with sales of rolling stock for urban mass transit systems to three big cities.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Holy Mecca, May 19, IRNA -- The siege of the Iranian  pilgrim headquarters here by the Saudi security forces ended at  22:00 hours Wednesday [18 May].    A very big column of all types of armoured vehicles had  covered the area and al-'Aziz street in order to prevent the  holding of the annual disavowal of polytheists rally by Iranian  and other pilgrims.    Over the past week Saudi police had harrassed the pilgrims  and visitors to the HQ.    The besiege was severely condemned by Iranian and other  pilgrims, and the Saudi measure has given rise to widespread  reaction.    On Monday night, the leader of the Iranian pilgrims, Hojjat  ol-Eslam Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri announced the cancellation  of the rally, in order not to give an excuse to the Saudi police  to once again desecrate the sanctity of the most inviolable  sanctuary the Holy Ka'ba.</p>

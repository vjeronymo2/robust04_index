			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (7): Wide-ranging consequences - Winners and losers The hundreds of hard-fought compromises which form the framework of the North American Free Trade Agreement will have impacts far beyond what negotiators have envisioned. No one expected, for example, that a big beneficiary would be Pilkington Brothers of the UK, the world's leading flat glass producer. Pilkington has a 35 per cent share of Vitro, a Mexico-owned holding company which has secured real gains in the deal. The US flat glass industry is aghast at what it calls 'an enormous disparity between the US and Mexican tariff rates.' With no apparent success thus far, it has been urging the US Trade Representative to force Mexico to renegotiate the flat glass provision of the Nafta. This disparity is by no means a new one. The average US tariff on dutiable imports of Mexican flat glass is 4.8 per cent. Mexican duty rates are 20 per cent on most US flat glass. But the US industry is arguing that the gap between the two will widen after the Nafta goes into effect. Meanwhile, the US market is already oversupplied. 'Vitro's monopoly position in the lucrative Mexican market permits it to use profits both to further expand its capacity, aggressively acquire US firms and US market share and expand its already highly developed distributional structure in the US,' according to Mr John Reichenback Jr., an industry business analyst. 'Unless the present tariff disparity is eliminated the US flat glass industry estimates that the Mexican flat glass monopoly will capture at least 13 per cent of the overall US flat glass market.' Like the US flat glass industry, other Nafta losers are trooping up to Capitol Hill to plead for changes in the pact. The winners, however, are fighting to retain the advantages they have gained. Some sectors have both winners and losers. American agriculture is a loser and a gainer. Vegetable and fruit producers in Florida are convinced their days in business are numbered if they have to compete - even after a 15-year phase-out - with Mexican imports. US exports of barley and maize and expected to soar. American soyabean meal will do well, as will rice, wheat and fats and oils. However, US sugar producers are up in arms about the pact, saying Mexico will re-export to the US large quantities of cheap sugar imports. According to the International Trade Commission, the US automotive parts industry will gain considerably in the long term, but US car production will be ultimately a loser. Upon implementation of the pact, tariffs on US vehicles will be eliminated immediately. The phase-out is longer - 10 years - for automotive parts. Mexican tariffs on US cars and the rest will be phased out over 10 years. Mexico's tariffs on 75 per cent of its imports of US automotive parts will be eliminated over five years with the rest to be eliminated over 10 years. American service industries, clearly advantaged by the pact, will have new opportunities through both cross-border trade or investment in Mexican enterprises. The ITC says US investment in Mexican telecommunication and banking services could increase by 6 to 15 per cent. Investment in Mexican transportation services could rise by even more over the long-term. Removal of Mexico's restrictions on foreign equity ownership in the insurance market may result in expansion of US investment by 16 per cent or more. The US energy sector is a partial winner in the deal. Mexico resisted opening most of its energy market for foreign participation, but where it liberalised it will gain access to high quality foreign expertise and equipment. According to a report to Congress by the Industry Policy Advisory Committee, the Nafta will promote trade in natural gas by establishing the right of all Nafta producers to negotiate supply contracts directly with end-users. The pact enables independent power producers and electric utilities to negotiate power purchase and sales contracts; reduces the number of petrochemicals reserved to the Mexican state to eight and makes the rest available for 100 per cent foreign ownership; and provides for expanding commercial arrangements in the electricity sector. Over the short term, the US is likely to import more Mexican bearings, household glassware and steel mill products. Its exports to Mexico will rise in the following sectors: bearings, machine tools, steel mill products, pharmaceuticals, industrial machinery, chemicals and household appliances. In the long-run both the US and Mexico are expected to increase to each other sales of vehicles, computers, textiles and apparel and ceramic tiles. The pact has spurred hopes and anxieties in Latin America. There is concern that the advantages Mexico will gain in some markets, such as sugar and textiles, means losses for its southern neighbours, and that zero tariff benefits granted to developing countries through the US Generalised System of Preferences will be neutralised by Mexico. Investment which might have gone to the Caribbean and other low-cost producers may be diverted, and in Latin America Mexico will get the first boost towards acquiring the technology of the 21st century. The Clinton administration has been at pains to assure the Latin leaders that it shares the vision of its Republican predecessor of a hemispheric-wide free trade agreement. But it also being urged to look to the Pacific Rim for free trade deals to discourage the formation of an aggressive super-competitive Asian trade bloc. Japan has expressed worry about the Nafta, but no external tariffs will be raised against Japanese products. The rules of origin will make it more difficult for Japanese companies to use Mexico as a springboard into the US market. The biggest losers may be those Asian countries whose cheap labour has been the comparative advantage which draws foreign investment. Many companies might now shift production to Mexico where there is additional gain in lower transportation costs.</p>

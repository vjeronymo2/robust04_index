			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: LVMH lifts holding in Guerlain in share deal LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods group, is expanding its perfume interests by raising its stake in Guerlain, the French fragrance house, in a FFr1.96bn (Dollars 330m) share deal. The Guerlain deal is the first of a number of investments that LVMH is expected to make following yesterday's conclusion of negotiations to unravel a cross-shareholding agreement with Guinness, the UK drinks concern, which will dramatically reduce its debt. Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, has made no secret of his plans to expand its luxury goods interests after the Guinness deal. One of the likeliest areas of expansion is jewellery. LVMH has been mooted as a prospective purchaser for Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, the French jeweller, or Tiffany, the US group. The Guerlain transaction is, typically for Mr Arnault, an intricate deal that involves reshuffling his complex web of cross-shareholdings. Christian Dior, the French fashion house that owns a stake in LVMH, will cede 12 per cent of its shares to the Guerlain family in return for 2 per cent of Guerlain and a 49.9 per cent stake in Djedi, the holding company that owns 85.8 per cent of Guerlain. Dior will then sell the Djedi shares to LVMH, which already owns 14.2 per cent of Guerlain, for FFr1.96bn. The Guerlain family has also given Dior pre-emptive rights over its remaining Djedi shares. The acquisition of Guerlain, one of the oldest names in perfume, is an important move for LVMH, which already owns the Dior and Givenchy fragrances. Guerlain last year made net profits of FFr162m on sales of FFr2bn. The LVMH deal follows the announcement earlier this month that L'Oreal, the French cosmetics and fragrance group, was acquiring full control of Cosmair, its US distribution arm.</p>

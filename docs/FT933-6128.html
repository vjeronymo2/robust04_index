			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Record for nursing union numbers THE ROYAL College of Nursing will announce shortly that its total membership has reached a record level, in spite of a general decline in trade union membership. However, a claim by the college that its membership is increasing at the expense of Unison, the public service union which incorporates Cohse, Nupe and Nalgo, has been disputed by the new union. There are about 641,749 qualified individuals registered with the UK Central Council for Nursing Midwifery and Health Visiting, of which 384,000 are working in the National Health Service. The total nursing workforce in the NHS is about 543,000, which includes 159,000 nursing auxilaries and nursing assistants. The college admits only qualified nurses, while Unison includes nursing auxilaries and assistants in its 235,000 nursing membership. The college is one of the few unions that has grown over the past few years. Between December 1991 and December last year its membership rose from 292,180 to 297,719. Next month it will be a record at over 300,000. Ms Christine Hancock, general secretary of the college, said: 'There is some evidence that we have been recruiting from nurses in other unions, most notably nurses from Cohse who could not see themselves as part of a large generalist trade union.' The RCN has no factual evidence yet to support its contention but Ms Hancock said her claim was based on reports from local branch officials. If it is accurate, the RCN claim would provide the first evidence that the creation of Unison in July is having an adverse effect on membership.</p>

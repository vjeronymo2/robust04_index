			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Noraid defiance fails to move US Justice Department Noraid, an organisation once stigmatised as the Irish Republican Army's main fundraising arm in the US, is openly defying a court order to file regular reports with the US Justice Department in Washington. However, officials at the department said Noraid is no longer of concern - they describe it as 'moribund' - and they are prepared to turn a blind eye to its failure to file. Under the US Foreign Agents Registration Act, Noraid has been required since the mid 1970s to give details of its fundraising activities at least twice a year because it has the IRA as its principal foreign agent. But Noraid has not filed with the department for three years. The last recorded file covers the 12 months ending July 1991 and is incomplete. Mr Martin Galvin, a lawyer and Noraid's spokesman, said the organisation's leadership has no affiliation or relationship with the IRA. Its sole purpose is to contribute funds to families of political prisoners and to lobby in the US in support of a united Ireland. In an interview in New York, Mr Galvin said: 'We don't believe we are required to register under law. We are not agents of the IRA. We are Americans who under the US constitution's First Amendment have the right to express our views on Ireland.' A similar assertion by the previous leadership of Noraid led to a long legal battle in the late 1970s between the organisation and the Justice Department. In 1981, it resulted in a judicial decree confirming Noraid's links with the IRA. Thirteen years later, the Justice Department has no plans to take Noraid to court over its apparent defiance. Officials argue that to do so would risk generating renewed support for the organisation when its finances are dwindling. Justice Department officials said they had not carried out a formal audit on Noraid's accounts since the mid 1970s. But British and Irish officials share the US perception of Noraid's weakness. Their view stems from the continued monitoring of organisations and individuals sympathetic to the Irish republican cause by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, working in co-operation with the British security and intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6. There has also been increasing co-operation between British and Irish diplomats in the US. Within that shared pool of information, present estimates say the fundraising effort has dipped from a high of nearly Dollars 1m a year during the hunger strikes in the early 1980s to between Dollars 100,000 and Dollars 200,000. In the last accounts filed at the Justice Department, Noraid claimed it had raised Dollars 1.8m (Pounds 1.19m) in the 12 months to July 1991. Government officials said the figure was artificially inflated to mask the financial weakness of republican groups in the US. Senior investigators, however, accept that the IRA's US link has not evaporated. They suspect that some money still continues to find its way to the IRA by more elaborate means such as money-laundering. Ballot blarney, Page 13</p>

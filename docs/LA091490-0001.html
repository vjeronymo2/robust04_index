			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4-YEAR-OLD'S LAWSUIT  </P> <P> In response to "Paralyzed Girl Sues to Attend Local School," (Metro, Sept. 5):  </P> <P> Four steps and a Los Angeles Unified School District policy are preventing  Xochitl Soto from attending Bushnell Way School, three blocks from her home.  The 4-year-old preschooler must use a wheelchair for mobility and the school  isn't ramped.  </P> <P> Of the two obstacles, the policy is the larger barrier because it is based on  centuries of people with disabilities being viewed as less than people without  disabilities and, therefore, not entitled to the same treatment.  </P> <P> It is not complicated to build a ramp. It is hard to admit that a policy has  been based on a prejudiced interpretation of a federal law.  </P> <P> The recent passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act says to society that  individuals with disabilities are now guaranteed the same basic civil rights as  everyone else.  </P> <P> MARY ANN ELLEFSON  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government is racking its brains over its deep  concern of the emergence of an argument in Europe and the United  States regarding "Japan's nuclear armament" in connection with  the issue of suspected nuclear development in the DPRK (North  Korea). In some quarters of the government, officials initially  laughed it off, saying: "It is absolutely ridiculous." However,  references to this issue have been made by U.S. Government  authorities. To prevent this issue from arousing any  unnecessary feelings of apprehension among neighboring Asian  countries, growing concerns have been voiced suggesting that  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, himself, for that matter, take  the opportunity to clearly defend Japan's position on this issue  during such occasions as the Japan- U.S. summit meeting  scheduled for 11 February.    Analyzing the issue, one Japanese-U.S. diplomatic source  notes the following points: 1) there is an ulterior motive  behind this; 2) spreading rumors that Japan has nuclear  capabilities could be used as an advantage in breaking the  stalled DPRK nuclear issue; and 3) this signifies the collapse  of the Japanese-U.S. security structure, proving that the U.S.  military has weakened. However, a top Foreign Ministry official  argues: "To use this as a whip against North Korea is a  completely mistaken notion. We are very annoyed." But what  makes the issue so complicated is that "there exists the idea in  Europe and the United States that nuclear weapons should be  countered by nuclear weapons, and it is impossible no matter how  hard Japan, which has experienced a nuclear attack, tries to  make them understand its almost allergic reaction to nuclear  weapons; it is almost like playing a game of "whack-a-mole" [a  game in which the object is to keep hitting mechanical moles  which randomly pop out from their holes]" (as stated by a senior  Foreign Ministry official).    In some quarters of the government, officials hope for an  early settlement of the DPRK nuclear issue which is at the core  of Japan's new problem. However, to wipe out this argument on  Japanese nuclear armament, they plan to work harder to try to  persuade U.S. Congressmen to understand Japan's position before  Hosokawa's U.S. visit.</p>

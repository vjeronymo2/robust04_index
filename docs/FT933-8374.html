			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Dissident shareholder steps up campaign against Hoskins THE LEADER of dissident shareholders at Hoskins Brewery, which last week delayed publication of its full year results, has circulated a letter to the company's investors in his campaign to oust the chairman and another director from the board. The independent brewer of real ales, which is quoted on the USM, said the announcement of its results had been delayed by difficulties in getting required consent for publication from one of the directors who was on holiday in Cornwall. The results were due out on Friday but are now scheduled for publication today. The dissident leader, Mr Richard Holman, who holds a 7.4 per cent stake in Hoskins, is the second shareholder in two years to challenge the current board on grounds of its record. A separate attempt to remove the Hoar brothers from Hoskins' board collapsed last year when the campaign failed to attract sufficient shareholder support. Mr Holman, who claims the support of about 40 per cent of shareholders, has requisitioned a special meeting at which resolutions will call for his own appointment to the board and the removal of Mr Barrie Hoar as chairman, and his brother Mr Robert Hoar, as a direc-tor. Mr Barrie Hoar, whose family holds 30 per cent of the stock, said he and his brother would resign when the company's future is secure: 'I hope shareholders will understand the efforts that we have made in repositioning the company so that its future can be safe and sound.' The two had planned to leave the board on the conclusion of a deal with Mr Adam Page, founder of Midsummer Leisure. The deal, which involved the injection of some of Mr Page's businesses into Hoskins, has formally lapsed.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Plan to tighten curb on beef The European Commission bowed to political pressure from Germany yesterday when it proposed to increase restrictions on export of beef from Britain because of the threat of bovine spongiform encephalitis, or 'mad cow' disease. Mr Rene Steichen, EU agriculture commissioner, proposed to limit exports of British beef in carcase form to herds which have been free of the disease for six years rather than the current two years. This would not affect sales of boneless meat. Mr Steichen said he based his suggestion on scientific advice offered by the Commission's veterinary committee. The commissioner's draft is being referred back to the committee, which must accept his proposal before it can be formally adopted. The BSE problem is due to be discussed at a meeting of European Union agriculture ministers on Monday. Germany has been threatening a unilateral ban on British beef imports if the Commission does not tighten up restrictions. But the British government believes it is time to start easing the curbs placed on the beef trade since the outbreak of BSE six years ago. It cites the sharp decline in the number of cases of BSE - a 23 per cent drop in the number of cases in the first six months of the year - as evidence that the disease is under control.</p>

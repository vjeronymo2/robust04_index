			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOTTERY PREPARES TO GO WITH A WINNER ON AD ACCOUNT  </P> <P> Dailey &amp; Associates seems to have won the lottery -- again.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles ad agency, which has created California Lottery ads for the  past three years, was all but handed the $50-million annual account again on  Wednesday for another four years.  </P> <P> After a competitive review, the lottery staff has recommended the agency to the  Lottery Commission -- a move that virtually assures that the ad firm will  retain the high-profile business. The lottery board will make its final  selection next week.  </P> <P> "The decision to stay with Dailey was based on their understanding of the  lottery's challenges as a corporation and the agency's competitive cost  proposal," said Susan Clark, director of lottery's marketing division.  </P> <P> Dailey may be best known for creating the lottery "Sweet Dreams" campaign that  features the song "Dream a Little Dream of Me." The various ads show snippets  of people ranging from truck drivers to executives who fantasize about winning  the big prize. The agency says it will stick with that familiar campaign  indefinitely.  </P> <P> Retaining the lottery business sent a sigh of relief Wednesday throughout the  agency.  </P> <P> "It means we've won the biggest account of the year," said Phillip Joanou,  chairman and chief executive of Dailey. "And it also means we haven't lost the  biggest account of the year." Joanou said that 30 of his ad firm's employees  work on the account. "If you lose an account like that, you have a lot to deal  with."  </P> <P> The review wasn't prompted by any unhappiness between the lottery and its  agency. Rather, because the lottery is a state-run operation, all of its  suppliers must be reconsidered every few years. Among the Los Angeles agencies  competing for the business were Chiat/Day/Mojo and BBDO. Executives from both  firms declined to comment.  </P> <P> Joanou, whose agency also creates flashy ads featuring Lindsay Wagner for the  Ford Dealers Advertising Assn. of Southern California, said the lottery has  become a much more complex piece of business than it was just a few years ago.  That's because the lottery has added numerous "Scratcher" games in its bid to  increase business.  </P> <P> At the same time, the lottery's most popular game, Lotto, saw somewhat  disappointing sales this year. Sales of Lotto tickets in 1989 were "a little  bit flat," said Carolyn Walker, a spokeswoman in Sacramento for the lottery.  </P> <P> One of Dailey's key challenges is to create ads that will improve those sales.  "There are a lot of new ads in the works," said Joanou. "We're full of joy to  be doing them again -- and full of relief."  </P></p>

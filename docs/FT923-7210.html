			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Dayton Hudson increases slightly DAYTON Hudson, one of the largest US retail groups, yesterday reported a modest improvement in a second-quarter profits, at Dollars 42m after tax. The figure, for the three months to August 1, compares with Dollars 40m a year earlier. Sales in the second quarter of 1992 rose to Dollars 3.97bn (Dollars 3.56bn), and earnings per share totalled 50 cents (47 cents). The company said the economy was still 'restraining sales momentum', and attributed the bulk of the improvement to a lower operating expenses. Comparable store sales rose only 3 per cent in the second quarter. Dayton's profits for the first half stand at Dollars 77m, compared with Dollars 74m a year ago. Sales total Dollars 7.69bn, against Dollars 6.91bn. Kroger, the supermarket chain which took on a large debt load when it conducted a defensive restructuring in 1986, warned it will do little more than break even in the third quarter (ahead of extraordinary charges related to early debt retirement). The company blamed competitive pressures in key markets, plus the aftermath of a strike in Michigan. The overall trend in many major markets was described as favourable but Kroger said profits in Texas and part of the midwest had been hit by tough competition and price-competition.</p>

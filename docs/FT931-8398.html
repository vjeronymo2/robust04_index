			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Letter: Time for a ferry regulator Sir, Last year I wrote to the Office of Fair Trading regarding the huge and unwarranted increase in Dover-Calais tariffs in 1992. For passenger vehicles it was more than 30 per cent when inflation was below 10 per cent. Stena and P&amp;O fares were almost identical. I suggested that this joint increase could only be explained by the ferry companies' intention to raise passage costs progressively so that they would roughly match eventual Channel tunnel fees. The OFT rejected my argument, positing that the ferries could only compete with the tunnel if they offered a substantial discount. This is naive. Nobody knows what the tunnel charge will be but ever-increasing construction costs must be reflected in the opening tariff. If Stena and P&amp;O find they have misjudged tunnel tariffs, they can lower their own without pain and claim virtue. In the meantime, they seek further operational integration to buttress profits. Who is to say that a duopoly does not already exist and that the tunnel authorities do not welcome progressively higher ferry charges to justify and underpin their own? Is it not time for a regulator - Ofship - and to gear up for an Oftun? K D Shilleto, 2 Mulberry Close, Beaufort Street, London SW3</p>

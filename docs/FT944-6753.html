			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Wednesday: The initial estimate of US GDP growth in the third quarter is expected to be revised upwards, from 3.4 per cent to 3.5 per cent. A more substantial upward revision would spark speculation about further interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve. Thursday: The purchasing managers' index is one of the month's earliest economic indicators in both the UK and the US. The UK version should give a further guide to the price pressures on the corporate sector; the Bank of England has expressed concern that output price inflation might be passed through to the High Street. Prices are also a concern in the US; in October, the index's prices component was at its highest level since June 1988. Friday: The increase in non-farm payroll employment has been one of the most closely-watched US indicators. Last month, the figure which provoked inflationary concern was a jump in average hourly earnings. A fall in the unemployment rate from October's 5.8 per cent would also be seen as a sign of future price pressures. UK official reserves are expected to have edged up by Dollars 25m in November.</p>

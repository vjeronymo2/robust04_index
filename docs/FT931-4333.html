			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Everest Foods falls to Pounds 1.18m Everest Foods, the food group, returned profits of Pounds 1.18m pre-tax for the half year ended November 30, a 34 per cent fall on last time's Pounds 1.78m. The directors said the disruption caused by the continuation of the capital expenditure programme to secure substantial growth for the future had 'impacted on the results.' Turnover slipped to Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 17.9m). Nevertheless, the interim dividend is lifted to 1.2p (1.1p), payable from earnings of 3.15p (5.85p) per share.</p>

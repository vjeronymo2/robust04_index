			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- A symposium  commemorating the first anniversary of the publication of  "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for  the reunification of the country" by the great leader President  Kim Il-song was held at the People's Palace of Culture Thursday  with politicians, scholars and pressmen in attendance.    Present at the symposium were Kim Chung-nin, secretary of  the  Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, officials  concerned, officials of political parties and public  organisations and men of science, education and press.    Speakers at the symposium proved that the 10-point programme  is a great program of independent reunification and a great  charter of national unity for putting an end to the history of  division and confrontation covering nearly half a century with  the strength of the nation.    They said the 10-point programme is a banner of powerful  unity for actively breaking the deadlock with the united  strength of the nation in the grim situation in which the  destiny of the nation is at stake and a great charter of unity  and reunification for achieving the reunification of the country  and the prosperity of the nation with the strength of the nation  by uniting all the compatriots.    They said the foundation of a pan-national unified state by  confederacy formula is a most reasonable goal for uniting all  fellow countrymen of different classes and quarters,  transcending the regional and institutional differences between  the North and the South at present.    They branded the "three-phase reunification formula" of the  Kim Yong-sam group as an imitation of the "formula of  unification through Korean national commonwealth" brought  forward by its predesessors, a proposal of division and  confrontation in every aspect, which is no more than formulae of  "unification of systems" and "unification by prevailing over  communism".    They said the 10-point programme of the great unity of the  whole nation is a program of great unity embodying the great  idea of benevolent politics of President Kim Il-song, because it  provides for granting special favours to those who have  performed exploits for the reunification of the country and, if  those who had betrayed the nation in the past, take the  patriotic road, repentant of their past, for dealing with them  leniently to enable them to contribute to the cause of national  reunification.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / How to Spend It: How minimalism changed Patricia's lifestyle PATRICIA IJAZ decided to get professional architectural help when she could not sell her dark and cramped London flat. In despair she decided that if she could not sell it she might as well see what an architect could do to make living there more bearable. She found Jonathan Woolf and her life was transformed. The ground floor, one-bedroom apartment took up just 70 square metres in a Victorian mansion block. The kitchen was too small, the bathroom too large and the corridor long and claustrophobic. Much of the skill of the conversion depends on Jonathan Woolf's skilful use of light which gives the whole flat a warm airiness. All is designed to give the illusion of greater space. Much thought has gone into the small things that contribute to the sum of the whole - the placing of a sofa, how to link the rooms visually, what materials and surfaces to use, which direction to lay the floorboards. There is a suspended gallery which Jonathan Woolf devised to 'liberate the space'. This provides the study area and a steel ladder links it to the ground. Wood floors replace fitted carpets. Where once there were ponderous radiators now the heat source is invisible, hidden under the floorboards. The curtains came down and were replaced with blinds. New and taller door openings encourage Patricia to use the whole apartment as one space. Fiddly, unnecessary details have been removed, liberating not just the space but the eye, so that the whole flat has an air of calm. The space is still small, but the air of depressing darkness and smallness has gone. Patricia Ijaz has embraced minimalism and found she likes it.

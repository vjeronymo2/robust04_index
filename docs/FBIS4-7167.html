			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Koeh"-signed report: "Rexrodt Calls for More Investment </F> in Asia"]    [Text] Bangkok -- Federal Economics Minister Guenther  Rexrodt has called on German industry to increase its  involvement in the Asian Pacific region, above all in the form  of direct investment. At the start of the Fifth German Business  Asia-Pacific Conference, the minister approved "political  support" from the Federal Government. Speaking on behalf of  over 200 participants, Siemens chief Heinrich von Pierer called  for a "change of direction" in how German companies think about  foreign countries and favored an "innovation partnership" with  Asian economies.    Rexrodt considers "company presence in the form of direct  investment, cooperation agreements, and the exchange of  technology and know-how" essential for Germany to meet the  challenge of the Asian Pacific region of rapid economic growth.  The Federal Government also wants to provide more support for  German industry's foreign interests. Rexrodt rejected public  export and investment subsidies, but promised "political  support" from Bonn. "Business can expect politicians to seek to  achieve equal opportunities, that they will help to remove  political restrictions on entry to markets."    In response to complaints from some conference participants  that the Federal Government was doing relatively little for  German business abroad, Rexrodt said: "We can only succeed in  obtaining what we want if companies name specific obstacles."  As far as Rexrodt is concerned, equal competitive opportunities  particularly apply to finance. The minister announced that  Hermes instruments would be reformed to meet new challenges  before parliament's summer recess.    Rexrodt rejected state-subsidized "soft loans," which  governments use to assist companies in obtaining large contracts  for the development of regional infrastructure. "We will not  open the floodgates." On the other hand, the minister considers  the protection of German foreign investment, including capital  guarantees, to belong to the "core of foreign economic policy."  "Advertising Germany" through fairs and technology shows is also  in the state's interest and should be developed in the same way  as foreign trade chambers' information and advisory networks.  Medium-sized businesses should be the main beneficiary and be  encouraged to view Asia as more than just a market for sales  crises, but should nail their colors to the mast there  permanently.    Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak,  who  welcomed the German managers who had gathered in Bangkok, also  pointed to this dilemma in company strategy. He criticized  "declining interest" in investment in his country and the  one-sided concentration on selling finished products. Siemens  President Heinrich von Pierer called for a "change of direction"  in this sense. As the chairman of German business's Asia  Pacific commission, von Pierer complained that the region  accounted for 10 percent of German exports, but only 3 to 4  percent of German investment. Whereas Japan has invested 58  billion German marks [DM] in the southeast Asian ASEAN  countries, Germany has only invested DM2 billion in this boom  region with a growth rate of between 7 and 10 percent.</p>

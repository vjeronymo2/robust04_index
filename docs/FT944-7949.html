			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: AEG sees sales drop in 1994 for Electrocom AEG expects its Electrocom postal sorting machinery businesses in Germany and the US to generate combined sales of DM804m (Dollars 519m) in 1994, down from DM967m last year, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. Sales would stagnate in 1995 before growing by up to 10 per cent in the following years as the US postal service caught up on delayed investment in automation, Mr Eberhard Zur, managing director of the German Electrocom, said yesterday. AEG completed its takeover of Electrocom Automation, the US company and licensee of AEG Electrocom, in September and plans to integrate the two companies under a US-based holding company on January 1 1995. AEG spent DM450m on the purchase.</p>

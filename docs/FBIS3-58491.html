			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in the Bundestag in </F> Bonn -- live]    [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, the Brussels summit confirmed  that NATO will remain the cornerstone of future security for the  whole of undivided Europe. The alliance reconfirmed its  traditional function -- safeguarding the territorial integrity  of all members. The aim, point, and objective of NATO have once  again proven themselves indispensable and irreplaceable.  [applause]    At the same time, the alliance defined clear cut objectives  for the future. In doing so, it is continuing its process of  change and strengthening its ability to act. Who would have  believed the role NATO would be given with the disappearance of  the bipolar world, following its original task as a collective  defense system against the East. Conflict scenarios have been  replaced today by strategies for cooperation, and that is to be  welcomed. [applause]    This means NATO is moving into a new epoch in which security  is having to be considered in a wider sense. Widened in  geographic terms, as the summit decided in principle, widened in  functional terms by early warning and conflict prevention,  widened in conceptual terms by early warning and conflict  prevention, and by means of economic, ecological, social, and  cultural components, because security can only decreasingly be  guaranteed by military means alone. [applause]    The NATO summit decided on the evolutionary concept of a  gradual, organic expansion of the alliance. I have supported  and suggested this concept of a differentiated, multilayered  interlocking with the East from the beginning, and the former  Warsaw Pact countries are pushing powerfully into our alliance.  What greater change can there be in this world than that those,  who just a short while ago were, so to speak, our arch enemies,  now want to meet their security needs by entering our Western  alliance, NATO. [applause]    The summit showed the path toward membership for these  countries. We must now, however, move along it patiently but  with purpose and determination. The alliance is thus  consistently pursuing the course begun in 1991. At that time,  on a German-U.S. initiative, we began with the founding of the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council to open the door to  cooperation with the Eastern neighbors. The Partnership for  Peace supplements the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and  widens the range of concrete cooperation. Without  discrimination, it opens up further opportunities for  differentiated interlocking relations.    The German Government has always taken very seriously the  worries and expectations of our eastern neighbors and partners.  We understand their warnings about a gray zone and their  concern about isolation. However, the answer cannot and must  not be to divide Europe again between black and white. Germany  sees itself, and I adhere to this image, as the advocate of the  interests of our neighbors to the East, and we do not merely say  that, Herr Klose, but we act in accordance with it, in all  areas. [applause]    The reforming countries of Central and Eastern Europe know  they can depend on us in a special way. They also turn to us in  a quite definite way but also Russia, Ukraine, and the other  countries come to us and say: You will take special care that we  do not become isolated, pushed away. We need a balanced  solution, and we found that at the NATO summit in Brussels.  [applause]    [Parliamentary Speaker Rita Suessmuth] Mr. Kinkel, would you  permit a question from Deputy (Seifert)?    [Kinkel] Yes.    [Seifert] Foreign Minister, could you tell me why you are  channeling so much effort into realizing your strategies for  cooperation through a military alliance and not through the  CSCE, which is already in existence and which was set up  expressly as a body for cooperation?    [Kinkel] Who says we are not also trying to do this through  the CSCE? The new European security architecture we have to  build is, of course, linked to NATO, the CSCE, the NATO  Cooperation Council of the WEU [Western European Union], and the  European Union in both political and economic spheres. And it  is precisely this which we are trying to bring about. The CSCE  is playing a decisive role in the interlinking architecture that  we want to and have to find, a point to which I shall return.  So, the CSCE is not being neglected. [applause]    On the other hand, it is the case that no third state has  ever been able to claim a right of veto with respect to alliance  membership, and this is how it has to stay. But we should not  create any new grounds for antagonism or any new rifts.    At the same time, however, it is true that in the end the  best security guarantee for Europe lies in a stable, democratic,  economically efficient, and cooperative Russia. Russia has  taken decisive steps toward this objective, thanks not least to  our massive political and economic support. It is on the  historically unique path from a planned to a market economy,  from Communism toward democracy. And it would be naive, really  naive not to expect setbacks, mistakes, erroneous paths being  taken by extremist, nationalist policies, as well as problems of  economic policy. Nevertheless, we shall not allow Mr.  Zhirinovskiy to talk us into any new hostile images [applause],  quite simply because we want partnership, not hostility. I  remain confident, very confident actually, that the majority of  the Russian population thinks exactly the same way. We cannot  say no to Russia as long as Russia says yes to Europe.    At least it was right, and I adhere to this view, to deny  Mr. Zhirinovskiy an entry visa to Germany for his 18-day  political show, a propaganda tour, the direction of which one  could predict. [applause]    Ladies and gentlemen, it is just as important that countries  such as Ukraine, the Baltic republics, and the countries of  southeastern Europe should not get the impression that the door  to the expansion of Western structures of stability will open  only once, and just for a few, only to close again all the more  firmly afterward. No, our guiding principle is a unified Europe  in which no new chasms are created. [applause]    Ladies and gentlemen, a certain impression arose at the  summit as if NATO expansion, relations with the East, were the  only topics. That was not the case. The great tasks lying ahead  for German security policy in Europe were also discussed at the  NATO summit in Brussels. First, the NATO summit gave an  impressive commitment to the European security and defense  identity. The U.S. President supports the efforts for more  European independence in the fulfillment of our European  security interests. The opportunities for action by the WEU  were considerably broadened, and some NATO resources were placed  at its disposal. The European pillar is being strengthened, but  it must remain placed firmly against the Atlantic pillar. If  the European Union takes on additional competences on issues  relating to politics and security, there must be deepened  transatlantic consultation and coordination mechanisms, and the  Atlantic must not be allowed to widen. [applause]    The United States of America has made a strong avowal of  lasting commitment to Europe. We welcome, in particular, the  declaration by the U.S. President that in future hundreds of  thousands of soldiers will be left in Europe. This is of  extrordinary significance for us and our European allies.    Now I come to what Herr Klose was urging this morning:  Second, the opening of markets, intensification of trade and  economic relations, in addition to cultural exchange are also  elements of security. And the prospects of NATO expansion that  have now opened up must be seen in the context of these other  prospects of interlinking and expansion for the European Union.  Both the prospects are interlinked and interconnected. A  Europe that left its security up to NATO alone will remain  incomplete. But at the same time, a European Union without the  same security for all members is inconceivable. [applause]    Third, my French colleague [Alain] Juppe and I proposed that  those countries with the prospect of joining the European Union  should be brought closer to the WEU now, giving them additional  anchorage and interlinking in terms of security policy, and I  will emphatically press the WEU, as I have already done, to  implement this proposal. [applause]    Fourth, the CSCE has long since made the concept of expanded  security its own. It links military aspects of security with  questions of human rights, democratic checks on power, and  economic cooperation. It is to the CSCE's lasting credit that  the huge political and military change in Europe was able to  take place without the serious threat of military confrontation  between the former blocs. We Germans of all people wish to  retain the idea of the renunciation of violence, understanding,  and the willingness to compromise.    And this applies particularly with regard to former  Yugoslavia. The situation in former Yugoslavia figured largely  at the summit, and in some respects overshadowed the talks a  little. Our ability to help and mediate is not inexhaustible.  The willingness to help is also declining tangibly among those  countries that have contributed troops, with all the  incalculable consequences, by the way, for the supply of  humanitarian aid that would then no longer reach those in need  if there actually were a withdrawal of the soldiers on the  ground.    The signal coming from the summit, that reaffirmed its  willingness to mount possible air strikes, is also an expression  of growing impatience and disappointment. Nevertheless, the  European plan of action, that is still based on the  Franco-German initiative, remains urgently necessary. The  signal from the summit, I have to repeat, was also that a  certain turning point has been reached regarding the situation  in former Yugoslavia. It might be difficult to remain confident  on this issue, but peace is too important for us to give up  hope. However -- and this is something I stressed clearly to  Izetbegovic and Tudjman during the Petersberg talks -- peace  will only be possible if the warring parties want it and work to  make it happen. [applause] We give thanks to all those who are  helping, even to the extent of laying down their lives, to  prevent the dreadful violations of human rights, or at least are  trying to alleviate them.    Fifth, the offer of a peace partnership is aimed beyond the  range of the members of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council,  but also at other CSCE members. I have already advocated the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council opening up in principle to  all CSCE members. This will give the CSCE process greater  substance and effectiveness. The North Atlantic Cooperation  Council and thus, also NATO, are being given new options for  prevention of conflicts, crisis management, and peace missions.  The CSCE summit in Budapest this year must further develop the  scope of action of the CSCE and its interlinking with the United  Nations and NATO.    Sixth, NATO declares its readiness to support peacekeeping  measures and other missions by the CSCE and the United Nations.  In this way the alliance is affirming the unique responsibility  of the United Nations for international peace order. That means  for us that we also must be prepared to take part in these  alliance tasks. If we do not wish to isolate ourselves here,  then we urgently need a clarification of the constitutional  issues. [applause] I will repeat my appeal to you, ladies and  gentlemen of the opposition, to shoulder your share of the  responsibility -- give up your blockade of a constitutional  amendment! [applause] Our country is being damaged. During the  Brussels summit, the chancellor and I were on several occasions  -- and I add this to the appeal -- in a very, very difficult  situation, in a situation that is sometimes beneath the dignity  of a country that is now the largest at the heart of Europe and  that has additional responsibilities. I can only reiterate: In  the interests of this country, we will not put up with this  situation for very much longer. Give up your blockade!    Seven, with great emphasis the heads of government in  Brussels declared the proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction as a danger for international security. The members  of the UN Security Council had already made it clear at their  summit meeting two years ago that a legitimate concern, a very,  very important concern of the community of nations, was to  control and stem weapons of mass destruction and their carrier  systems. Germany is the only country to have voluntarily and  permanently renounced weapons of mass destruction. At the  beginning of December, I already formulated my proposals in a  10-point plan to strengthen the policy of the nonproliferation  of nuclear weapons. We will energetically pursue this  initiative. Our aim is to prevent new nuclear weapons states  from coming into being in the world by means of timely, active  cooperation with the countries in question. [applause]    Nine [as heard], Ladies and Gentlemen, an agreement to  regulate the elimination of the former Soviet nuclear weapons  based in Ukraine is scheduled to be concluded tomorrow. The  Federal Government made a decisive contribution to this  breakthrough by means of intensive dialogue with Kiev on  security and disarmament questions. And we hope that this  agreement finds sufficient internal political support in  Ukraine. For then, the path will be free for Ukraine membership  in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear state.  This will increase the chances for an unlimited and  unconditional extension of this treaty. Then intensive and  comprehensive cooperation with this hugely important state -- a  particularly important country for Europe's security  architecture -- could at last be concluded.    The cooperation agreement between the European Union and  Ukraine must also be concluded. The difficult relationship  between Ukraine and Russia should be eased by means of a treaty  on good-neighborly relations and the renunciation of the use of  force. We are prepared to help in this to the best of our  ability, but as far as Ukraine is concerned, the European  Community has undertaken a lot -- thank God -- because we must  ensure that we carefully observe and watch what is going on in  Ukraine, as we have done with the Central and Eastern European  states, and particularly with Russia.    Ladies and Gentlemen, the result of the NATO summit fits  smoothly into the concept of increased security for the whole of  Europe. This concept arises from our interest in peace and  stability in the whole of Europe. And we will continue to  pursue this with determination. Clarity, conflict prevention,  and confidence-building are the central issues. The last 45  years have produced an exemplary network of stability through  the European Community in Western Europe. Now it is important  finally to connect the security network in the second half, so  to speak, of the European Union process. We will have achieved  our aim when old differences in the east of our continent are  overcome by the strength of the European Union, to the same  extent as this has been achieved in the West. We will have  achieved our goal when the other states bordering on Europe, and  this also includes our partner Russia, do not see this growing  together of Europe as a threat, but as an advantage for their  own security and prosperity. The road there is long but we want  a foreign policy that goes beyond the present day.    Ladies and gentlemen, let me say one more thing in  conclusion  that occurred to me at the NATO summit and which I think is  important for us: Our Bundeswehr enjoys enormous respect within  the framework of NATO and in NATO. I think we should be proud  of that. [applause]    It [the Bundeswehr] is and remains the guarantor of our  security and an effective tool of our peace policy. Our  alliance capacity depends on it, and I say that it needs secure  planning, not only with regard to finance, but even more with  regard to an unambiguous definition of its tasks. It cannot and  must not be right for us to say that we have such-and-such an  amount of money, we can afford such-and-such a size of  Bundeswehr. It should be the other way round: We must say we  need the Bundeswehr for such-and-such tasks, and the money  needed for this must then be available. [applause] And we should  be careful to keep the Bundeswehr, which is a very important  part of our society, out of attempts at party political  posturing -- this is a prime concern for me.</p>

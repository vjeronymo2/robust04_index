			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Depending upon market conditions, GSU may sell one or more series of Preferred having a par value of $100 to underwriters for deposit with a bank or trust company (``Depositary''). The underwriters would then receive from the Depositary and deliver to the repurchasers in the subsequent public offering shares of depositary preferred stock (``Depositary Preferred''), each representing a stated fraction of a share of the Preferred. Depositary Preferred would be evidenced by depositary receipts. Each owner of Depositary Preferred would be entitled proportionally to all the rights and preferences of the series of Preferred (including dividends, redemption and voting). A holder of Depositary Preferred will be entitled to surrender Depositary Preferred to the Depositary and receive the number of whole shares of Preferred represented thereby. A holder of Preferred will be entitled to surrender shares of Preferred to the Depositary and receive a proportional amount of Depositary Preferred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GSU proposes to use the net proceeds derived from the issuance and sale of the Bonds, MTNs and/or Preferred for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of outstanding securities when due and/or the possible redemption, acquisition or refunding of certain outstanding securities prior to their stated maturity or due date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GSU states that it may sell the Bonds, MTNs and Preferred pursuant to the competitive bidding requirements of Rule 50, or, by means of agency arrangements or direct placement with purchasers under an exception from the competitive bidding requirements of Rule 50 pursuant to Rule 50(a)(5), in the event that GSU determines that a negotiated public offering or private placement would be advantageous. GSU requests authorization to undertake negotiations with respect to arrangements for the issuance and sale of the Bonds, MTNs and Preferred. It may do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GSU also proposes to enter into arrangements for the issuance and sale of tax-exempt bonds (``Tax-Exempt Bonds''), and in connection therewith, GSU proposes to enter into one or more equipment lease/sublease arrangements (``Equipment Lease''), pursuant to which one or more governmental authorities (``Issuers'') may issue one or more series of Tax-Exempt Bonds under one or more indentures (``Indenture'') in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $250 million. The net proceeds from the sale of the Tax-Exempt Bonds will be used to finance certain facilities including but not limited to sewage and/or solid waste disposal or pollution control facilities (``Facilities'') that have not heretofore been the subject of such financing, or to refinance outstanding tax-exempt bonds issued for that purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GSU further proposes, under the Equipment Lease, to acquire, construct and install the Facilities, and lease the Facilities to the Issuers and simultaneously sublease such Facilities from the Issuers at subrentals sufficient (together with other monies held by the trustee under the applicable Indenture and available for such purpose) to pay the principal or redemption price of, premium, if any, interest and other amounts owing on the Tax-Exempt Bonds together with related expenses. Under the Equipment Lease, GSU will also be obligated to pay certain fees incurred in connection with the transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Equipment Lease and the Indenture may provide for either a fixed interest rate or an adjustable interest rate for each series of the Tax-Exempt Bonds. No series of Tax-Exempt Bonds would be sold if the fixed interest rate or initial adjustable interest rate thereon would exceed the lower of 13% or rates generally obtained at the time of pricing for sales of tax-exempt bonds having the same maturity, issued for the benefit of companies of comparable credit quality and having similar terms, conditions and features. The Tax-Exempt Bonds will mature not earlier than five years from the first day of the month of issuance nor later than 40 years from the date of issuance. Each series may be subject to redemption and/or sinking fund provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GSU proposes to arrange for one or more irrevocable letters of credit, in an aggregate amount up to $300 million and for a term not to exceed ten years, from a bank, in favor of the trustee for one or more series of Tax-Exempt Bonds. GSU would enter into a letter of credit and reimbursement agreement (``Reimbursement Agreement'') with the bank under which GSU would agree to reimburse the bank for amounts drawn under the letter of credit within 60 months with the interest rate not to exceed the bank's prime commercial loan rate plus 2% and to pay certain fees, including up-front fees not to exceed $100,000 and annual fees not to exceed 11/4% of the face amount of the letter of credit. Provision may be made for extension of the term of such letter of credit or for the replacement thereof, upon its expiration or termination, by another letter of credit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

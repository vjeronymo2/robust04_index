			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Turnround at Renison Gold Renison Gold Fields, the Australian mining group 40 per cent-owned by the Anglo-American Hanson group, made a ADollars 1.8m (USDollars 1.3m) profit after tax and abnormals in the year to end-June, compared with a ADollars 24.4m loss in the previous year, writes Nikki Tait. The turnround was largely due to the absence of abnormal items, which cut ADollars 36.1m off the previous year's figure. Operating profit before tax and abnormals fell from ADollars 25.4m to ADollars 20.3m, although the company said this masked a sharp improvement in the second half of 1993-94, when profits were ADollars 25.4m, after a first-half loss of ADollars 5.1m. Total revenues were 1.8 per cent lower at ADollars 610.9m, and no dividends are being declared.</p>

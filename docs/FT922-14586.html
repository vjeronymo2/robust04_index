			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / People: Engineering change at Trafalgar House Ian Robinson's appointment to the board of Trafalgar House is yet another sign that the embattled conglomerate's future growth lies more in engineering than in its shipping, property and Ritz hotel businesses. Last July, Trafalgar House greatly expanded its engineering interests by taking over Davy Corporation; Robinson's appointment to the main board is part of a reorganisation of the management of a division which now accounts for roughly half of the group's near Pounds 4bn turnover and 40,000 workforce. Robinson, 49, and a chemical engineer, joins Allan Gormly, 54, chairman of Trafalgar House's engineering division, who went onto the main board in 1986 and is regarded as a possible successor to Sir Eric Parker, the group's chief executive. Robinson has spent 28 years in the petrochemical and oil and gas industries. However, he is a relative newcomer to Trafalgar House, joining its John Brown subsidiary in 1986, and has risen quickly through the ranks. He will assume responsibility for the group's process engineering and construction operations, roughly equivalent to a quarter of Trafalgar House's total business. By going on to the board he has leapfrogged Ted Bavister, 58, who continues as deputy managing director of the engineering division. Bavister, the next president of the Institute of Chemical Engineers, is regarded as one of the industry's elder statesmen. Meanwhile, in a bid to improve its battered City image, Trafalgar House has hired a new public relations director. Tim Halford, 45, spent 10 years as the European pr man for Armand Hammer, the late boss of Occidental Petroleum, and was most recently group public affairs director of Grand Metropolitan.</p>

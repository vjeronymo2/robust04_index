			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: The ground rules of a shifting demand - Expansion at Triplex Lloyd and Wagon Industrial UNEVEN market conditions have dented the profits of both Triplex Lloyd and Wagon Industrial, distorting the shape of their respective businesses but not diminishing their appetite for expansion. The pressures which the two medium-sized Midlands engineering groups have faced and their response to them bring into relief both difficulties and strengths in the sector as continental European markets slow down and the domestic economy remains sluggish. Both, like many others in the sector since the early 1980s, have learned to see their future in an international context. Both are diversified. They have, in common, the production of automotive components and precision products. Individually, Wagon is strong on materials handling; Triplex Lloyd on equipment for the power generation industry. If not stock market favourites, the two have been consistently well-regarded. Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham-based broker, has long held a hold sign over Wagon and a buy sign over Triplex Lloyd. However, the share price of Wagon, which during the worst of the domestic recession had been sustained by its international approach, has now found that this counts against it. The stock market likes to know that its recovery stocks will continue to recover. Despite the announcement of a 42 per cent profits increase to Pounds 18.1m pre-tax for 1992-93, Wagon shares last month tumbled to the bottom half of their range after the group reminded the market of what the market knew already. It acknowledged continued difficulties at Forkhardt, the German subsidiary making specialist power chucks, and indicated that 1993-94 would be a flat year. On the other hand, Triplex Lloyd's share price has remained in the middle of its range although earlier this month it announced static 1992-93 pre-tax profits at Pounds 7.1m and a projection which indicated strong growth, not this year, but next. As an indication of how demands on the ground are shifting, the two sets of figures were revealing. The UK markets helped Wagon in its sectors, but those of France and Germany started to slide. The UK pushed Triplex Lloyd down on building products, but continental Europe supported profits - especially because the demand for gas turbine power equipment has so far proved recession-proof. Present nervousness about Wagon apart, the share prices of both companies have benefited from the perception, apparent in the market from last autumn, that engineering companies would respond rapidly to any growth in the UK economy. Furthermore, both companies have been able to feed the institutional demand for new paper with rights issues - Wagon last October and Triplex Lloyd last February. Although they have been consistently expansionist, both have gone about expansion in different financial fashions. With interest rates so low the differences could disappear. Wagon went through the recession holding net cash of about Pounds 14m and used its Pounds 32.3m rights issue proceeds for a specific acquisition. Gearing at Triplex Lloyd increased to 45 per cent in 1991-92 and hit 60 per cent just before the rights issue reduced it to 23 per cent. Wagon is now likely to relax a little. Noting that the return on money is 6 or 7 per cent and that the return on industrial assets is about 20 per cent, Mr John Hudson, chief executive, said: 'As things stand now the UK is recovering - it's weak but it's sustainable. The case for having a strong balance sheet is diminished.' This points to further acquisitions - Wagon made eight in the year to last March. 'The next steps will be in the UK,' he predicted. This is because of the tax implications should too rapid expansion take place in Europe. But this does not imply diversification. Although Triplex Lloyd has also been acquisitive, its main attention has latterly been on technical investment and on plant expansion - particularly in casting operations to satisfy demand in the power industry for turbine blades and in the automotive sector. Growth is becoming a matter of survival and management in both groups has been refined and focused. 'Senior management is much more hands-on with the larger operations,' said Mr John Foley, managing director, who, with Mr Colin Cooke, chairman, has concentrated Triplex Lloyd into three divisions. 'Our customers in both the automotive and power sectors are much bigger than we are and they are looking to deal with a smaller amount of customers,' said Mr Foley. In other words, Triplex Lloyd does not want to be a minnow cast aside. The approach at Wagon is not dissimilar. 'If we're going to hit the earnings we achieved in the late 1980s, we're not going to do it by waiting for volume to come back,' said Mr Hudson. So the way forward is by winning a larger market share, improving productivity and reducing costs.</p>

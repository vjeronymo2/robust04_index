			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MASS. HOTEL WHERE 3 PRESIDENTS SLEPT IS ORDERED CLOSED  </P> <P> A court-appointed bankruptcy trustee has ordered the closing of the  101-year-old Hotel Barre, which catered to three Presidents but has been  operating under Chapter 11 protection since February, 1989.  </P> <P> Trustee David M. Nickless ordered the shutdown Monday, saying he saw little  chance of the stately hotel reopening during the liquidation.  </P> <P> "It sounds like they would continue to lose money and that would put the  creditors further in the hole," Nickless said.  </P> <P> Built in 1899 in a style that suggested a Mississippi River steamboat, the  three-story hotel had 36 guest rooms, 11 fireplaces and an elegant dining room.  Guests included Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Calvin Coolidge.  </P> <P> It was sold in 1985 for $265,000 to new owners who re-created its lavish  Victorian atmosphere.  </P> <P> The hotel has been listed for sale since 1987 for $2.6 million unfurnished, or  $3.6 million furnished.  </P></p>

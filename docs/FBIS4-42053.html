			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Bablumyan: "Armenia Has No Money To </F> Escort Prisoners"]    [Text] Yerevan -- Eight highly dangerous criminals  arrested outside of Armenia are once again at liberty -- without  going through the trial and investigation that would have  awaited them in their native land. They did not even try to  flee or bribe the guards. They were simply released to the four  winds, since the Armenian Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] did  not have the 33 million rubles needed to pay for the prisoners  to be escorted to their place of permanent residence.    IZVESTIYA was told by Gayk Arutyunyan [name as  transliterated], the republic's first deputy minister of  internal affairs, that there were 1,364 criminals being sought  at the start of the year, and, although this figure has fallen  somewhat, the problem of finding them and bringing them back is  still very acute. Everything depends on the financial resources  of the MVD, and these -- according to Colonel Arutyunyan -- are  very limited.    Meanwhile, the republic's Finance Ministry has turned down  the MVD's request to be allocated 3 billion drams, cutting the  sum to 836 million. That kind of money will not make it very  easy to do the job, the police department believes.  Particularly when you consider that an ordinary policeman's  salary in Armenia is equivalent to $1.80, and the extra pay for  being a general is equivalent to just 10 cents. So the  criminals can sleep easy for the time being. What cannot be  cured has to be endured.</p>

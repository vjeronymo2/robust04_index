While 26.1 percent would accept higher prices, only 18.5  percent would want to sacrifice their standard of living. Most  Czechs feel they "cannot do much for the environment."    In the same poll, when asked to name the most important  thing, almost half respondents replied that it was "keeping  order in the country" (47.5 percent).    The next most important issues for the citizens of the Czech  Republic were "having a greater say in the decisions of the  government" (17.9 percent), protection of the freedom of speech  (17.8 percent), and stopping price rises (15.2 percent).    The poll included a question on territorial arrangement and  local government reform. Some 56.1 percent of respondents said  the solution to the problem was important to them, while 43.9  percent said it was not. Twice as many people intending to vote  in the forthcoming local elections found the issue important  than those not intending to vote.    STEM, the Center for Empirical Research, conducted the poll  in the last week of November among 972 respondents.    People's views on the quality of health care in the first  year of the independent Czech Republic were the subject of  another STEM poll whose results were released today.    Thirty-three percent believe health care has improved,  whereas 22 percent think it has worsened.    The biggest problem is felt to be under-funding, while the  choice of doctors and the behavior of health care staff towards  patients were rated the most positively.    Only 40 percent of those asked regarded themselves as  healthy, the others citing minor or major complaints. However,  58 percent felt they were healthier than most of their peers.    The poll also revealed that almost half Czechs use the  services of private practices.    STEM asked 1,400 people in the first week of December.</p>

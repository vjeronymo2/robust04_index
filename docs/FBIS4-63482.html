			<p>BFN     [Text] A statement by the press center of Ukraine's Defense  Ministry:    Certain political forces are continuing to exacerbate the  already tense situation around the Crimea. Confirmation of this  is the attempt by a group of unidentified armed people to seize  a command post of a unit of Ukraine's air defense troops in the  town of Sevastopol. However, the precisely organized guarding  of the facility and the resolute actions by servicemen of  Ukraine's Armed Forces were an obstacle in the criminals' path.    The telephone call by Mr. (Mykhaylov), an aide to the  president of the Republic of Crimea, to Lieutenant General  Mykhaylo Lopatin, commander of Ukraine's air defense troops,  also evokes certain reflections. The former employee of the  Personnel Department [Osobovyy Viddil] of the USSR KGB was  suddenly interested in what the Ukrainian air defense forces  would do in the event of the unsanctioned appearance of aircraft  from foreign states over the Crimea.    The press service of Ukraine's Defense Ministry confirms the  reply by the commander of the air defense forces that in cases  of violations of Ukraine's air space the air defense troops will  act in accordance with the regulations on combat duty, employing  the necessary forces and means.    In this context, the latest resolution by Crimea's Supreme  Council on Crimeans undergoing military service only on the  territory of the peninsula also puts one on one's guard. This  document not only runs counter to Ukraine's current legislation  and the demands of the state's defense capabilities, but also  creates additional tension in society and among the troops.    The press service of Ukraine's Defense Ministry states that  military formations of Ukraine's Armed Forces deployed in the  Crimea are subordinate to the Defense Ministry of Ukraine and  will carry out orders of the supreme commander in chief of the  Armed Forces and the defense minister of Ukraine in the  interests of ensuring our state's territorial integrity, its  defense capabilities, and the inviolability of its borders. Any  provocative actions directed against Ukraine and its Armed  Forces will continue to be resolutely repulsed.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Energy ventures in Kazakhstan and Russia stall again DECISIONS on the two largest oil and gas developments in the former Soviet Union to be undertaken with the participation of foreign oil companies have again been stalled. At the same time, however, Russian legislators are drafting a new Oil and Gas Law which, foreign energy companies hope, will bring order to the confusing system of decision-making which ensures interminable delays. The Kazakhstan government has sent a new set of demands to Chevron Corporation of the US to incorporate into their proposals for the exploitation of the giant Tengiz oilfield between Omsk and the Aral sea in the central Asian country. According to the Interfax news agency, these include cutting the profits share to 13 per cent and increasing the royalties payable to Kazakhstan to Dollars 25bn (Pounds 14.4bn). Quoting Mr Kalyk Abdullayev, the deputy prime minister, the agency said that the republic would also claim increased control over land use and keep all excess profits accruing from any increase in the price of oil. He said that the new claims were based on advice from the US investment bank Goldman Sachs and the UK law company, Slaughter and May. The Tengiz development is reckoned to increase the republic's oil output to 50m tonnes a year within eight years from its current level of 26m tonnes a year. The Russian parliamentary commission reviewing the tender for offshore oil and gas fields in Sakhalin off the Russian east coast is delaying announcing any decision because of a 5:3 split against awarding the tender to the US-Japanese 3M consortium of McDermott, Marathon and Mitsui.</p>

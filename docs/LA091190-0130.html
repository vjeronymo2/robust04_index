			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STUDY TO CONSIDER WIDENING USE OF CAR-POOL LANES;  </P> <P> TRAFFIC: THE IDEA WOULD BE TO ENTICE COMMUTERS TO DRIVE THE FREEWAYS BEFORE AND  AFTER PEAK HOURS, WHEN THE HIGH-OCCUPANCY LANES WOULD BE OPEN TO ALL.  </P> <P> Orange County's car-pool lanes, long a point of controversy among beleaguered  commuters, might be opened to all cars during non-peak hours if a study  commissioned Monday recommends pursuing the idea.  </P> <P> The study, to cost $10,000, was ordered Monday by the Orange County  Transportation Commission. Chuck Fuhs, a nationally recognized expert in  high-occupancy vehicle lane issues, will perform the study, which will look at  how similar lanes across the country are managed. Fuhs is expected to finish  his work in November and present the report to the OCTC before the end of the  year.  </P> <P> "What we're trying to see is whether we can encourage single-occupant vehicles  to use the highways in off-peak hours," said Dana Reed, the commission's  chairman. Reed added that officials want to know if opening the lanes after  rush hour might encourage drivers to avoid the freeway until then.  </P> <P> Currently, Orange County's car-pool lanes bar all vehicles with fewer than two  occupants 24 hours a day.  </P> <P> Changing that restriction could have a spillover effect on other counties and  is not likely to be made in the near future, officials said. But the study  could provide ammunition to one side or the other in the longstanding debate  over high-occupancy lanes, which exist on the Costa Mesa and San Diego  freeways.  </P> <P> Proponents of the lanes argue that they encourage car-pooling, aiding efforts  to curb traffic and air pollution. Opponents, however, view them as an  unnecessary obstacle to commuting and argue that they worsen traffic flow  rather than improve it.  </P> <P> Caught between those vocal constituencies, some officials have searched for a  middle ground, so far without success. County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, who  proposed the study, said Monday that he hoped that it could help "nullify some  of the differences that we have in the community."  </P> <P> California Highway Patrol officials, who have previously expressed their  support for 24-hour car-pool lanes, eyed the study's intentions skeptically.  </P> <P> "People right now are just getting used to the fact that you can't go in those  lanes unless you have two people in the car," CHP Officer Angel Johnson said.  "It would be much more confusing if there were certain hours when you could,  and others when you couldn't."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at Drivers for Highway Safety, an organization vehemently opposed to  the car-pool lanes, co-chairman Bill Ward greeted news of the study with  cautious optimism.  </P> <P> "It's better for those lanes to be open than for them to be closed," Ward said.  "We'd like to see them opened all day long, but most of the day is better than  none at all."  </P> <P> Even if the study were to recommend ending the 24-hour-a-day restricted access,  the county probably could not implement it without the agreement of governments  in neighboring counties and cities, officials said. Otherwise, they noted, open  lanes in one county could funnel directly into restricted ones as they passed  over local borders. Drivers would be forced to switch lanes to avoid breaking  laws in neighboring counties, adding to confusion and possibly increasing  accidents.  </P> <P> "We fit into a regional context," said Tom Fortune, public affairs director for  the Transportation Commission. "Whatever we do is probably going to need to be  part of a regional policy."  </P> <P> While Orange County debates the future of its car-pool lanes, officials  released a report Monday indicating that enforcement of the lane regulations  has dramatically improved in recent months.  </P> <P> Added patrols and new signs on the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways have led  to a sharp reduction in the number of motorists violating car-pool lane  restrictions on those highways, according to the report, prepared by the  California Department of Transportation for the OCTC.  </P> <P> The report found that the number of single-occupant cars illegally using the  high-occupany lanes has dropped by 50% on the southbound San Diego Freeway  since May 1, when additional Highway Patrol officers were added to the route.  Northbound violations during the same period have dropped from 6% of the cars  using the lane to less than 2%.  </P> <P> In addition to the increased number of CHP officers monitoring the San Diego  Freeway, warning signs on the Costa Mesa Freeway also seem to have cut down on  the number of violations.  </P> <P> Signs notifying drivers that they can be fined $246 for a first offense were  posted on April 25 in several places along the Costa Mesa Freeway. Since then,  the violation rate has dropped by more than 50%, according to the Caltrans  numbers.  </P> <P> Opponent Ward, however, said that passenger counts are difficult to verify, as  they require surveyors to gauge the number of people in a car as it crosses  beneath an overpass, often at high speeds.  </P> <P> Ward also questioned the relevance of the numbers, noting that violations drop  off markedly after rush hours, since the highway becomes less congested and  motorists have less incentive to cheat.  </P></p>

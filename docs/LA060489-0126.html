			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INFLATION-WORRIED FED PRESSURED TO STEM DOLLAR'S RISE  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve Board is coming under increased pressure to reduce interest  rates, even though some board members continue to fear that the U.S. economy is  still growing too robustly to abandon concerns about inflation.  </P> <P> The pressure comes from U.S. trading partners and from the Bush Administration.  Both want U.S. interest rates lowered to help stem the rise in the value of the  dollar, which is threatening to stymie further reduction of the big U.S. trade  deficit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trade Date Cited  </P> <P> President Bush and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady both have said they are  concerned about the dollar's rise. Brady told a meeting of the 24-nation  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development here last week that a  continued rise in the value of the greenback will jeopardize the progress in  reducing the trade deficit that the United States has made over the last 2 1/2  years.  </P> <P> The White House is also concerned that, if interest rates remain high for too  long, the economy could be sent into a slump, dealing a blow to White House  efforts to keep the federal budget deficit from increasing.  </P> <P> Top Administration policy-makers believe the economy already has begun to slow  sufficiently to relieve any inflationary pressures from last winter's sudden  price surge. They fear that higher interest rates will exacerbate inflation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fed Split on Interest Rates  </P> <P> But the Fed is not as worried about the dollar's rise, and it still is split  over whether to nudge interest rates down.  </P> <P> Although opposition to reducing interest rates has begun to erode within the  policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, a telephone poll of members of  that panel last week failed to produce a consensus on any new action.  </P> <P> The central bank is expected to consider the issue again on Monday or Tuesday,  before Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan goes to a conference with bankers in Madrid.  </P> <P> There is little question that reducing interest rates in the United States --  while they simultaneously go up in West Germany and Japan -- would blunt the  dollar's rise. Part of the reason the greenback keeps edging up is that  interest rates in the United States are higher than usual in relation to those  in its two major economic allies, prompting currency traders to flock to the  dollar.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Allies Face Inflation  </P> <P> Political uncertainty in West Germany and Japan also is contributing to the  dollar's rise. So is growing inflation in those countries. And political  turmoil in places like Argentina and China is strengthening the dollar's value  as well.  </P> <P> The difficulty is that the Big Three economic powers are split over how to  handle the situation.  </P> <P> West Germany and Japan, alarmed by the resurgence of inflation in their  countries, are moving toward more restrictive economic policies. Japan raised  its discount rate -- the interest charged on short-term loans to commercial  banks -- last Tuesday. West Germany's Bundesbank has not moved yet, but it,  like the Fed, is under increasing pressure every day.  </P> <P> But the Bush Administration wants the Fed to take on most of the burden by  reducing interest rates at home because it fears that interest-rate increases  abroad might create recession in those countries, which could cause foreigners  to buy fewer U.S. imports and hamper further progress in reducing the U.S.  trade deficit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inflation Worries Continue  </P> <P> Administration officials have been making their views plain to Fed governors.  But the Fed itself is divided: Some of the Fed's seven Washington-based  governors are willing to consider a small reduction in interest rates, but the  presidents of the system's regional banks -- who also sit on the Federal Open  Market Committee -- believe inflation pressures in the United States still are  too strong to discount.  </P> <P> So far, the Administration has been relatively restrained in its exhortations.  The view among Treasury officials is that the sooner interest rates are reduced  the better -- for the dollar and for the domestic economy. The Treasury,  convinced that the economy has begun to slow and that inflation pressures will  abate, is far less concerned than the Fed about the threat of spiraling prices.  </P> <P> How long the Fed can hold out is unclear. The dollar edged down slightly on  Friday, but its overall rise has sent traders rushing to bid prices still  higher, overwhelming the so-far sporadic efforts of the Big Three central banks  to intervene in the exchange markets to curb the dollar's rise.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coordination Discounted  </P> <P> Adding to the sense of urgency is the growing view in the foreign exchange  markets that the long-touted policy coordination efforts of the United States  and its economic allies are rapidly unraveling. If the Fed does not act soon,  the dollar could keep rising higher and higher.  </P> <P> In the end, many analysts believe, the Fed will act -- or, just as possibly,  put off any action -- mainly for domestic reasons. There is little concern  within the Federal Open Market Committee about the consequences of the rising  dollar, and unless there is a run on the greenback -- the opposite of the  current problem -- Fed officials are likely to let the markets have their way.  </P> <P> These analysts say that, if the Administration prevails on the central bank to  reduce interest rates for the sake of keeping the dollar's value down, the Fed  will be acting more for public relations reasons than out of genuine concern  about the trade deficit. That means any action that comes soon is likely to be  small.  </P></p>

The ITAR-TASS Russian  official press agency yesterday announced the presidential visit  to Spain, of which the Spanish authorities learned with surprise  25 February.    "I know, I know; do not tell me, because I assure you that I  will soon be going to Spain." With these words Yeltsin began  his meeting with Felipe Gonzalez in Brussels in December. He  thus made clear his bad conscience about having postponed his  first visit to Spain as head of state on several occasions since  August 1992, because of his country's instability.    The Russian leader will spend two days in Madrid -- 11-12  April -- and has expressed his intention to visit Barcelona  immediately after. The length of his stay in the Catalan  capital is not clear, and could be between 24 and 72 hours.  Late yesterday afternoon, the doctors who treated him in  Barcelona received a telephone call from Moscow, announcing,  without specifying the date or reason, an imminent visit by the  Russian president, Milagros Perez Oliva reports.    In Barcelona's medical circles it was taken for granted that  Yeltsin would not confine himself to paying a mere formal visit,  but would take the opportunity to have a checkup. In May 1990,  when he was a mere deputy, Yeltsin underwent an operation for a  slipped disk by the medical team of neurosurgeon Josep Llovet  Tapies.    Since then, Llovet and his colleagues, whom Yeltsin  describes  as "the best doctors in the world," have continued to treat the  Russian president. Llovet last went to Moscow for this reason  last September, aboard an aircraft which the Russian head of  state placed at his disposal. Rumors circulating in the Russian  capital indicate that he is suffering from increasing backache.    At the first preparatory meeting for the visit, the Russians  expressed their interest in concluding with Spain a framework  treaty of friendship and cooperation, like the one that was once  signed with the USSR. They also indicated readiness to sign  several agreements, including a social security agreement which  would partially resolve the situation of the famous "war  children" -- the Spanish children who fled to the Soviet Union  at the height of the [Spanish] Civil War.    Another important reason for hastening the visit to Madrid  is  the desire to become better acquainted with the experience of  the Moncloa Pacts, which facilitated the transition from  Francoism to democracy at the end of the seventies, Pilar Bonet  reports from Moscow. Those pacts, or the idea which people now  have of them in Moscow, were a frequent reference point during  the parliamentary debate which granted an amnesty to Yeltsin's  main opponents, and seem to inspire a new presidential  initiative aimed at achieving a charter of social accord with  all the political forces.</p>

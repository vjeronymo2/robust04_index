			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Observer: Jobs for the girls While Britain's education secretary John Patten still seems to be making heavy going of his first cabinet job, the business career of his well-presented wife, Louise, goes from strength to strength. Yesterday she picked up another nice little earner, an advisory role at Bain &amp; Co, one of the more aggressive management consultants. Over the past year she has moved up from being a partner of PA Consulting to join the big-league head-hunters at Heidrick and Struggles, and has added a non-executive directorship of Ladbroke on the way. And unlike her husband, she has still not turned 40. Caroline Portillo, wife of Britain's chief financial secretary, is also making a name for herself at one of Louise Patten's rivals, Spencer Stuart. So, if, heaven forbid, two of Britain's cabinet ministers ever lost the support of the electorate, they should not have much difficulty finding a new job.</p>

In accordance  with the statistics, the total amount of purchased commodities  in 1993 reached 10.2 billion yuan, a 20-percent increase over  the previous year. The amount of commodities sold in 1993 was  11.6 billion yuan, a 16.5-percent increase over the previous  year.    The commercial system has comprehensively fulfilled its goal  set for 1993. In light of the goal set by this term of the  government to "achieve great economic development in three years  and enter a higher stage of economic development in five years,"  the commercial system has conscientiously carried out its tasks.  In the past year, it has overfulfilled its assigned goals in  four areas: Direct retail sales increased by 16.8 percent;  after subtracting for policy factors, actual profits reached  43.46 million yuan; more than 1,300 small state-owned  enterprises are run by civilians, accounting for 44.2 percent of  the total; and 10 large commercial networks, including the  Shangzhidu and Wuhu commercial buildings which are to be  completed before the end of this term of the government, began  construction.    Reform of the commercial system is deepening. First of all,  more than 600 large and medium-sized commercial enterprises have  consolidated and improved their deregulation reforms and have  changed their management mechanisms, thus accounting for more  than 70 percent of all enterprises. Second, the reform of the  shareholding system has taken an initial step. Eight  enterprises have been approved to implement the shareholding  system (the Hefei and Wuhu Department Stores have been  reorganized into a limited liability stock company). Another 18  companies are now being set up. Third, enterprises are  accelerating their structural reform. The provincial commercial  system has established seven enterprise groups, merged seven  companies, and auctioned off 18 small enterprises. Fourth,  according to the principle of restructuring, changing product  lines, and leasing out, more than 1,300 state-owned small  enterprises are run by civilians, accounting for 44.2 percent of  all enterprises in the same category. Fifth, the reform of  commercial administration has been further deepened, thus paving  the way for the reform of government organizations.    Marked achievements have been made in building commercial  networks. In recent years, localities in the province have  seized opportunities and have accelerated the construction of  commercial networks. They have tried to pool funds through many  channels and in various forms including loans, issuing bonds,  the holding and buying of shares, and joint ventures. In 1993,  the provincial commercial system has built, rebuilt, and  enlarged more than 900 commercial networks, with a total floor  space of more than 900,000 square meters. The total investment  in the project has reached 500 million yuan. Among these  commercial networks, 18 have more than 10,000 square meters of  floor space.    The provincial commercial system has focused on stabilizing  the market and bringing into play its role as the main channel.  In light of the relatively great changes in the market since  last August and particularly during last November, the  provincial commercial department has concentrate its efforts on  commodity supplies for festival seasons. At the beginning of  last December, the department began to arrange commodity  supplies for festival seasons. In mid-December, the department  held a meeting attended by directors of commercial bureaus at  the prefecture and city level and set concrete requirements for  arranging the market supplies for the Spring Festival. On the  eve of the 1994 Spring Festival, the department sent 12 people  to inspect the work in four areas. All localities actively  organized commodity resources to ensure the supply by the  market. They also adopted many price-control measures,  including limiting the prices of important commodities and goods  in great demand, supervising and controlling price fluctuations,  and establishing a reserve system. The situation of market  supplies was rapidly improved, thus bringing into play the  state-owned commercial sector's role as a main channel.</p>

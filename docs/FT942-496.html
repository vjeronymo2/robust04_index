			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / World Trade News: ABB to make transformers in Russia Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, is expanding its presence in Russia through two new joint ventures in power transmission and distribution equipment, writes Andrew Baxter in London. The Zurich-based company has signed an agreement with Moscow-based Electrozavod to form a new company, ABB Electrozavod, to make transformers and other related products. It is majority owned by ABB and will employ about 700 people. ABB said the venture would make best use of its strength as a world market leader in power transformers and of Electrozavod's position in Russia and elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Separately, ABB has formed ABB Electroengineering with the All-Russian Electrotechnical Institute (VEI) to provide the Russian electrical networks with locally engineered sub-stations. ABB will own 60 per cent of the new company, which will be located in Moscow.</p>

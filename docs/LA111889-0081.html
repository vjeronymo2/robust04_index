			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON  </P> <P> El Cajon police arrested a man Wednesday in connection with the assault and  extortion of a small-business owner that apparently involved cutting off the  ears of the store owner's dog.  </P> <P> Riadh Hallaq, 35, was booked into County Jail in downtown San Diego on charges  of assault with a deadly weapon, extortion and felony animal abuse, jail  officials said.  </P> <P> Hallaq reportedly entered a business in the 500 block of Jamacha Road about 10  a.m. and threatened the owner with a handgun, police spokesman Debbie Barker  said. Hallaq then produced a washcloth that contained the ears from a dog that  Hallaq said belonged to the store owner, she said. Hallaq then left the store,  Barker said.  </P> <P> The store is owned by Shalkat Hallak, 55, who police believe is the brother of  Hallaq, Barker said. Hallak told police that Hallaq demanded a 10% interest in  his business and threatened to harm his family if the demand were not met.  Hallak also said his dog had been missing for about a week, Barker said.  </P> <P> Hallaq, a resident of Washington state, was arrested about two hours later by  El Cajon police, who stopped his car on westbound Interstate 8, Barker said.  </P></p>

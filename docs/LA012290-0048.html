			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. CONFRONTS ISRAEL ON ETHIOPIA CLUSTER BOMBS;  </P> <P> MILITARY AID: THE WEAPONS REPORTEDLY HAVE BEEN USED AGAINST REBELS. JERUSALEM'S  RESPONSE HAS BEEN VAGUE.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has told Israel that it opposes secret shipments of  cluster bombs to the Marxist government of Ethiopia for use against rebel  troops and villages, officials said Sunday.  </P> <P> Officials said they have received several credible reports that Ethiopia's air  force has recently begun dropping cluster bombs, which hurl deadly shrapnel  over a wide area, in rebel-held areas.  </P> <P> If the bombs were U.S.-made or based on U.S. technology, their shipment to  Ethiopia would probably be illegal under American law, officials said. But when  the United States asked Israel whether it was providing the bombs to the  Ethiopian regime, the response was "unclear," a U.S. diplomat said.  </P> <P> "They told us, in effect, that they are no longer sending any -- that they  aren't sending any right now," he said. "But they've been vague about what  they've done in the past."  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Israel's embassy in Washington, Ruth Yaron, said: "We don't  sell cluster bombs to Ethiopia, and we don't give them either." Asked whether  Israel had sent the bombs to Ethiopia in the past, Yaron replied, "I wouldn't  be able to answer that, beyond what I've already said."  </P> <P> Administration officials said that the American ambassador in Israel, William  A. Brown, has repeatedly told high Israeli officials that the United States is  concerned about their reported aid to Ethiopia, including cluster bombs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Supply Cut Off  </P> <P> The United States supplied cluster bombs to Israel until 1982, when the Reagan  Administration halted shipments because Israel used them in civilian areas  during its invasion of Lebanon. Cluster bombs were used by the United States in  Vietnam and by the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, often with devastating effect.  </P> <P> An official said Sunday that the Administration believes any cluster bombs  going to Ethiopia "are more than likely of Israeli manufacture." Even so, he  noted, the United States prohibits Israel from selling weapons based on U.S.  designs or technology without approval from Washington.  </P> <P> The issue highlights a strange and little-noticed alliance between democratic  Israel and Ethiopia's Soviet-backed dictatorship, one of the world's most  repressive regimes.  </P> <P> The Jerusalem government has avidly pursued ties with Ethiopia for both  strategic and humanitarian reasons. Strategically, Israel has been working to  establish relationships with many African countries as a counterweight to the  hostility of most Arab nations.  </P> <P> On a humanitarian level, Ethiopia is home to an estimated 18,000 Jews, and  Israel hopes that by cooperating with the Addis Ababa regime, it can win  emigration rights for those who wish to leave.  </P> <P> Israel and Ethiopia established diplomatic relations in October, ending a break  of 16 years.  </P> <P> Even before the formal resumption of relations, U.S. officials said, Israel  provided the Addis Ababa regime with new military hardware, including  communications equipment. However, Israel has not publicly acknowledged any  military aid or sales to Ethiopia, an Israeli official said.  </P> <P> The Ethiopian government has long been seeking military aid to help fight  rebels in Eritrea, the area along the country's northern Red Sea coast. Eritrea  has been in rebellion against the central government for 27 years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aiding Marxist Regime  </P> <P> The United States opposes any military aid to Ethiopia because it believes aid  helps prop up the Marxist regime, officials said. In addition, they said, there  have been many credible reports of attacks by the Ethiopian armed forces,  including the air force, against civilians in Eritrea.  </P> <P> "These are not nice people," one official said.  </P> <P> Charges that Israel has supplied cluster bombs were first suggested by former  President Jimmy Carter, who said last month that Ethiopia had received the  bombs "from one of our Middle East allies." The Bush Administration's concern  about the cluster bombs was first reported by The New York Times on Sunday.  </P> <P> Carter, who did not name Israel as the source of the bombs, said U.S. diplomats  had told him "that the Ethiopian government was quite happy that they had  finally acquired cluster bombs, and they thought they could end the war quickly  because of the devastating effect of those cluster bombs being dropped on the  villages in the north."  </P> <P> Israel has been seeking for several years to arrange emigration for the  Ethiopian Jews, a remote community of black subsistence farmers who have kept  Jewish traditions for centuries. A secret airlift brought thousands of the Jews  out through neighboring Sudan in 1985, but the Sudanese government discovered  the operation and stopped it.  </P></p>

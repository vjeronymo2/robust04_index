			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israeli soldiers conducted house-to-house searches and maintained curfews in  the northwestern West Bank in an effort to find an Israeli who was abducted by  two masked men wielding axes and knives. The military closed off the West Bank  town of Tulkarm and surrounding villages as it searched for Shaul Mishani, 45,  a gold dealer from Bat Yam. Mishani disappeared while collecting debts owed to  him by Tulkarm gold dealers, Army Radio reported. It is not clear whether the  abduction was politically motivated.  </P></p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Pay deal analyses differ on growth Differing analyses of the recent upward trend in pay settlements are published today by two of the most influential pay analysis organisations. Incomes Data Services says that the upward trend looks set to continue with a growing proportion of April settlements giving increases of between 3 per cent and 3.5 per cent. Industrial Relations Services, however, says that the upturn may now be levelling out. It finds that settlements are remaining steady at 2.5 per cent and that upward pressures 'seem unlikely to intensify much further over the months ahead'. Among the April rises monitored by IDS are 3 per cent increases at Toshiba, 3 per cent average merit awards at the Co-operative Bank and 4.5 per cent average merit rises for clerical staff at Lloyds Bank. Overall in the banking sector pay rises in 1994 have ranged between 1.6 per cent and 4.5 per cent, with awards increasing in the course of the year. Retail pay rises are slightly lower, with most between 2 per cent and 3 per cent. An indication that more companies have confidence inflation will remain steady comes from the growth in pay deals covering more than one year. IDS says that two-year agreements have recently been agreed at British Airways, McVitie's, Chivas Brothers, Pilkington Optronics and Cummins Engine's Shotts site. A two-year deal at Massey Ferguson, the tractor maker, has also explicitly recognised the impact of this year's tax increases by giving a higher flat-rate rise of Pounds 12 for this year compared with Pounds 10 for next.

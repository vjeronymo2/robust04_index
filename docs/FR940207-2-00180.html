(``CHX'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved resolution on October 20, 1993, to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the CHX. According to the Company, the decision of the Board followed a study of the matter, and was based on the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The Company's Common Stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') thus a market will continue to be made in the issue; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Company is of the opinion that the volume of trading on the CHX is not substantial enough to warrant the continuation of the dual listing. In the months of June and July 1993, the CHX executed four trades in the issue (4/10 of one percent market share) for a total of 1,000 shares (6/100 of one percent market share). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any interested person may, on or before February 23, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

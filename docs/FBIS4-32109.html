			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A. Pecanac: "Against the Originators of the </F> Conflict"]    [Text] The first convention of the Republican Party was  held in the crowded Congress Hall of the Holiday Inn Hotel in  Sarajevo. Explaining the main program aims of the newly-founded,  civilian-oriented party, its founder Stjepan Kljuic remarked  that the Republican Party would soon join all the patriotic  forces in Bosnia- Herzegovina in mobilization and the  preparations for the final liberation of the homeland. The  engagement of the Republican Party should be viewed in this  context; the party does not intend to oppose the current  authorities, but it will oppose all those who are against  Bosnia-Herzegovina and cooperate with all those who support  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    We hope that the West will go back to international law and  that it will not allow Europe to be Balkanized and the ethnic  occupation rewarded, said Kljuic. The conflict with the Croats,  which was a mistake in Croatian policies toward  Bosnia-Herzegovina, is also to blame for the tragic fate of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, according to Kljuic, the Republicans  will strongly oppose the attempts to appoint some of the people  who participated in the politics that led to the conflict and  the victims of war in the new federal authorities.    The Republican Party sees the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina  in  being oriented toward the West and its fundamental democratic  values, as well as toward the Islamic countries.    Remarking that the establishment of an independent,  sovereign, and integral Bosnia-Herzegovina is the basis of the  future activities of the party, Kljuic said that it is in such  Bosnia- Herzegovina that the Republican Party will support the  establishment of the economic system on the basis of private  ownership, market economy, ethnic and religious freedom, civil  freedom, human rights, independent judiciary, and all other  democratic achievements contained in the UN Charter. Moreover,  Kljuic said that the party would become involved in actualizing  the return of the refugees and displaced persons in the country,  without which there will be no peace on these territories.    Welcoming the founding of another party in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mirsad Ceman, head secretary of the SDA  [Party of Democratic Action] remarked that the success of the  founding of this party would depend on the extent to which the  ideas represented by the Republican Party will extend beyond the  borders that are at present controlled by the Army of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Support for the forming of the Republican Party was  expressed  by Mirsad Ceman on behalf of the SDA, Nijaz Durakovic, president  of the Social Democratic Party, Salih Foco of the LBO [expansion  unknown], Ilija Simic on behalf of the HSS [Croatian Peasants'  Party], Sejfudin Tokic of the Union of Social Democrats of  Bosnia- Herzegovina, and Dragutin Cicak, president of the Croat  Civil Party.    Stjepan Kljuic was elected president of the Republican  Party,  and the members of the Directorate are: Dr. Adnan Dizdar, Dr.  Boris Tihi, Zaim Zeljkovic, Dr. Slobodan Trninic, and Senka  Nozica.    In the following six months, the Republican Party will be  working on bringing the organization to life, and soon they will  promote their program in all the major towns in the Republic.</p>

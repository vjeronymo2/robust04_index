			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / SIB sets deadline for applications to investor watchdog The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, yesterday set a deadline of October 1 for independent financial advisers to decide whether to apply for membership of the new Personal Investment Authority. The move gives fresh impetus to the PIA, which will be the watchdog for Britain's private investors, and came as the SIB gave the go-ahead for the body to begin operation in mid-July. Yesterday's moves bring to a close a long period of debate on the controversial new watchdog. The SIB's decision to set a firm deadline just over three months away will force independent financial advisers to choose between three options. They can apply for membership of the PIA, seek direct regulation by the SIB, or leave the investment business by the end of the year. Fimbra, the existing regulator for independent financial advisers, and Lautro, the existing regulator for the life insurance industry, are intended to disappear in October 1995. Mr Andrew Large, the SIB chairman, yesterday called on financial advisers and life companies which had not yet applied to the PIA to do so immediately. Moreover, the trade associations for independent financial advisers, which had previously urged their members to delay applications, now say they should not wait any longer. They had previously been among the most vocal opponents of the PIA, claiming that new regulatory arrangements reflected a 'hidden agenda' to cut the numbers of independent financial advisers. As it completed the formal process of approving the PIA as a suitable regulator, the SIB emphasised it would exercise close supervision. Explaining its decision to approve the PIA, the SIB said it had put particular importance on the PIA's arrangements for monitoring its members. In answer to some of the widespread criticisms of the PIA, the SIB said: it would keep a particularly close watch on the costs of regulation; the maximum award which could be ordered by the PIA ombudsman - criticised for being too low - would be kept under review; the PIA must behave fairly towards all the different elements of retail financial services which it would regulate. Along with hundreds of individual financial advisers who have not yet applied, some high-profile companies have also not yet committed themselves. They include Allied Dunbar, the life insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, the Lloyds Bank group, and Halifax Building Society, which is to set up a life subsidiary next year.</p>

			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT REVENGE IN TURIN;  </P> <P> SOCCER: FANS REMEMBER 1985 RIOT IN BRUSSELS. MAYOR HAD ASKED TO HAVE  ENGLAND-WEST GERMANY GAME MOVED TO NAPLES.  </P> <P> While attending the 1985 European Cup soccer final in Brussels, Dante Grassi  witnessed one of sport's most tragic incidents.  </P> <P> Thirty-nine persons, all but seven of them Italian supporters of Juventus of  Turin, were killed and hundreds injured in a riot that Belgium's courts ruled  was instigated by England's Liverpool fans.  </P> <P> Five years later, England's national team will play a World Cup semifinal  Wednesday against West Germany in Turin's new Comunale Stadium, Juventus' home.  </P> <P> Grassi, an architect who is the coordinator of Juventus' fan club, was asked  Monday how he believes the members feel about the presence here of the English  and their supporters.  </P> <P> "Completely indifferent," he said.  </P> <P> But not everyone in Turin, a northern Italian city of 1.3 million, is reacting  so complacently. Afraid that English fans again will start trouble in the  stadium, Grassi's two young sons asked him not to attend the game.  </P> <P> Some city government officials, however, are equally fearful of local agitators  who have indicated a desire for revenge against the English for the deaths at  Heyfel Stadium in Brussels.  </P> <P> Warnings have been spray-painted on stone walls in the city: "Hooligans Beware:  We Have Not Forgotten Heyfel," and "Juventus Comrades, We Will Avenge You."  </P> <P> Turin's mayor, Maria Magnani Noya, was concerned enough that she appealed  through the media to FIFA, soccer's world governing body, and the Italia '90  organizing committee to change the tournament draw so that the English would  play their semifinal game against the West Germans in Naples.  </P> <P> That is the site of the semifinal game today between Italy and Argentina. Noya  preferred that game for Turin.  </P> <P> In a television interview, she said: "The events involving hooligans in recent  days show the danger linked to the presence of these characters in Turin . . .  the memory of the tragedy of Heyfel which hit our city could aggravate the  danger of the hooligans and unleash a mass reaction."  </P> <P> La Republica, an Italian newspaper, quoted her as saying: "I am terrified. If  FIFA does not do something, it will be war. Nobody here has forgotten Heyfel."  She has since softened her position, but her concern is clear.  </P> <P> A FIFA spokesman, Guido Tognoni, said Monday that the mayor had not contacted  FIFA or the organizing committee. He said the sites for the semifinal games  would have been switched if a request had been made by the police.  </P> <P> "But the police felt there was no reason to intervene," he said. "Inside the  stadium, we expect no problem whatsoever. Outside, we don't know."  </P> <P> Giuseppe Emilio, an aide to the city's police chief, said Monday that the focus  of those involved in security -- about 6,000 local, state and military  policemen -- has been on areas outside the stadium.  </P> <P> He said he does not anticipate a repeat of the Heyfel Stadium tragedy or even  of a 1980 incident in Turin involving English and Belgian fans. A European  Championship game between their teams was interrupted when police broke up  fighting in the stands with tear gas.  </P> <P> There have been no significant disturbances inside stadiums during the World  Cup.  </P> <P> Emilio said that police were aware of a meeting between some supporters of  Turin's two Italian League teams -- Juventus and Torino -- to plan attacks on  English fans. But he downplayed the possibility of an organized assault, saying  that the meeting was poorly attended.  </P> <P> He said police believe the greatest potential for confrontation is during the  hours immediately after tonight's Italy-Argentina game in Naples.  </P> <P> Italian victories in the World Cup have led to spontaneous, raucous  celebrations in the streets of cities throughout the country. If drunken  Italian and English fans mix during such a celebration in Turin, Emilio said,  violence could result.  </P> <P> That was the case last week in the coastal resort of Rimini, where English and  Italian fans clashed after Italy's 2-0 second-round victory over Uruguay in  Rome. Police arrested 246 English fans, who were deported.  </P> <P> In anticipation of a similar eruption here, government officials here and in  surrounding towns have extended the ban on the sale of alcoholic beverages to  48 hours to cover both days of the semifinals. The ban usually lasts 24 hours  and applies only to the city in which a game is being played.  </P> <P> Emilio said additional security will be employed around the parks that are  serving as campsites for English fans who do not have hotel rooms.  </P> <P> "I believe we have anticipated all the problems," Emilio said. "We will use all  measures at our disposal to guarantee order and security. Personally, I am not  concerned."  </P> <P> Except for the incident at Rimini, the Italian police have been able to control  the small minority of English fans who came to create havoc. There were some  arrests last month on Sardinia, where England played its first-round games, but  the island did not turn into the battleground that was expected.  </P> <P> Tognoni was quoted in a London newspaper as saying that FIFA officials would  meet after the tournament to consider whether England should be banned from the  1994 World Cup in the United States because of its fans' behavior, but he later  said he was misunderstood.  </P> <P> Other FIFA officials said they are not as irritated by the English fans as they  are by the security measures that seem necessary whenever they are present.  </P> <P> With a security force of 5,000, there were no incidents last weekend in Naples,  where the English beat Cameroon Sunday in a quarterfinal game, 3-2.  </P> <P> "All was quiet in Naples," said Kay Coombs, a spokeswoman for the British  embassy. "We expect the same in Turin."  </P> <P> So much attention has been focused on English and Juventus fans that it has  virtually been forgotten that the most damaging incident at the World Cup was  instigated by West German supporters June 10 in Milan.  </P> <P> Police said that an estimated 1,000 drunken West Germans were involved in  rioting as they chased Yugoslav fans through the street near the Gothic  Cathedral and the luxury shopping district. Forty-three West Germans were  deported, including two who were sentenced to a year in jail upon returning  home.  </P> <P> "The organizers here are as much afraid of the Germans as they are the  English," Grassi said. "We are all afraid of what will happen when they meet."  </P></p>

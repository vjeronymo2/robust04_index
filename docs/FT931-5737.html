			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Question over Eurotunnel payments EUROTUNNEL HAS withdrawn its offer to make extra payments of cash and shares to Transmanche Link, the group of British and French contractors building the Channel tunnel, Mr Robin Biggam, BICC chairman, said yesterday. This had again halted negotiations over the contractors' claims for additional payments of more than Pounds 1bn to cover the extra cost of the project. Balfour Beatty, BICC's construction arm, is part of the TML consortium. Mr Biggam said he had received a letter from Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's chief executive, in the past few days saying that the offer was no longer on the table. Sir Alastair declined yesterday to confirm whether or not the offer had lapsed, saying: 'Any correspondence between myself and the owners of TML is private.' He said TML had walked out of negotiations last December. Eurotunnel is understood to have offered to pay Pounds 1.2bn in 1985 prices in a combination of cash and paper - shares, bonds and convertible instruments - to cover the cost of fitting out the rail tunnels. The gap between the two sides earlier this year was said to be less than Pounds 100m, also in 1985 prices. Failure to reach agreement means BICC yesterday announced a provision of Pounds 8m to cover any losses on the contract.</p>

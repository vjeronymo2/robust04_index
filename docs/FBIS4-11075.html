			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patricia Hernandez G.] </F>   [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said during the  75th anniversary of the International Labor Organization (ILO)  that Mexico's entry into international economic arenas will take  place with respect for traditional social politics, which  constitutionally guarantee workers' rights.    "It is not a question of competing just for the sake of  competing, but in order to boost the country's productive  capability, with tangible benefit for Mexican workers," Salinas  added.    The president said that in our country we have the force of  law, the basis that guarantees compliance with social and labor  rights. Much has been accomplished, but we know there is still  much to do because there are still social needs and the  requirements of isolated communities.    Salinas told labor representatives that training the work  force is a strategic necessity. In Mexico, the worker comes  first and is the subject of the change and purpose of the new  arrangements to bolster quality of life and productivity.    In our country, Salinas said, workers are the basic element  at the forefront of change. We inherited a sociopolitical  tradition that cares especially for the rights of workers, and  our Constitution clearly states that respect for their rights is  an overriding and substantive aspect of development.    In a ceremony in the Manuel Avila Camacho room in Los Pinos  Presidential Palace, Salinas de Gortari explained that Mexican  social institutions are meant to guarantee the quality of life  of their workers through access to medical services, dignified  housing, adequate work conditions, participation in business  utilities, and insured retirement savings.    Mexicans, he added, understand productivity as an essential  element to make more effective our labor legislation guarantees.  If our businesses are more competitive, there are more jobs,  better wages, and job stability and viability are guaranteed.    Boosting productivity is fully compatible with the strictest  respect for workers' rights. That is why we want to efficiently  compete in the international market for goods and services, he  said.    In addition, we have contributed to setting a worldwide  precedent with NAFTA. We negotiated a special package of labor  standards, respectful of the environment, always in agreement  with our laws, and taking into account our labor laws, Salinas  said.    Mexico -- Salinas told the union representatives,  businessmen, and workers -- is a country that builds for the  21st century, to come out ahead in democracy and freedom, and  compete efficiently in international markets.    We reaffirm the traditional links of cooperation between  Mexico and the ILO by signing the Inter-Institutional Agreement  for Agreed Actions [Acuerdo Interinstitucional para la  Concertacion de Acciones] between the Labor and Social Welfare  Secretariat and the ILO. The agreement is part of the new  policies of cooperation with the ILO with the creation of more  effective agreement mechanisms to raise the workers' quality of  life and labor.    Labor Secretary Arsenio Farell Cubillas said that the ILO,  which has its own legal basis, is part of the state of law that  keeps tabs on all political organizations in society.    Also present were Emilio Morgado, acting director of the  regional ILO office for Latin America; Fidel Velazquez,  secretary general of the Confederation of Mexican Workers; and  Genaro Borrego, director IMSS [Mexican Social Security  Institute].</p>

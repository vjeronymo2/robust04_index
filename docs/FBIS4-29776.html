			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has decided  to resume accepting Japanese tourists one year after they banned  entry of foreign sight-seers in June last year, it was learned  here Tuesday.    North Korea stopped issuing visas to Japanese tourists one  year ago when international tension began building up over its  nuclear question.    An official of Chukai Travel Co., a Japanese travel agent  specializing in North Korea tours, said Tuesday, "a North Korean  travel firm informed us in mid-May of a plan to accept Japanese  tourists." He said his firm has been advertising for North  Korea visitors.    Japanese tourists are expected to enter North Korea by  chartered plane via Beijing.    "North Korea seems to have decided to resume accepting  foreign tourists as international tension over the nuclear issue  has begun to ease," a Japanese public security official said.</p>

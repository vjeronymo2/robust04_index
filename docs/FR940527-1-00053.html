			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Research on Refinements to Labor Market Areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Almost from the beginning of the prospective payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system, we have received comments from hospitals and ProPAC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objecting to the use of MSA-based labor market areas to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construct the wage index. Common concerns have been that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Statewide rural areas are too large to distinguish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differences in labor market conditions, and that the MSA-based wage index does not reflect the fact that hospitals in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the center cities (the ``urban core'') pay higher wages than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suburban hospitals. Some commenters have argued that rural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor market areas should be subdivided into two smaller  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups based on county populations and that MSA-based labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market areas should be divided into urban core and suburban  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ring labor markets to distinguish the differences in labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of these concerns, we have continued to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examine a variety of options for revising wage index labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market areas. In this proposed rule, we discuss in detail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues raised by commenters concerning ProPAC's ``nearest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neighbor'' recommendation, our research and analysis on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative labor market areas, and the possibility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowing all hospitals in a State to opt out of the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor market system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Discussion of Comments Concerning ProPAC's Nearest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neighbor Recommendation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its March 1, 1993 report, ProPAC recommended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary substantially revise the hospital wage index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the prospective payment system for FY 1994. In its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> March 1, 1994 report, ProPAC made the same recommendation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Recommendation 16). Specifically, ProPAC recommends that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we develop hospital-specific labor market areas based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic proximity, using each hospital's ``nearest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neighbors'' for purposes of a revised wage index. As in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993, ProPAC has also recommended that Congress repeal the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current statutory provisions relating to geographic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassification for the wage index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In ProPAC's 1993 report, the Commission discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing each hospital's labor market area based on its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 nearest neighbors within a 50-mile radius. In its 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report, ProPAC examined defining labor markets for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital by including the nearest 15 hospitals within a 20-mile radius, and extending the radius up to 30 or 35 miles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when needed in order to include a total of at least 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In our May 26, 1993 proposed rule (58 FR 30242), we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that we believed, and ProPAC agreed, that legislation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be required before we could use hospital-specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor market areas in constructing the wage index due to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory requirements regarding hospital reclassifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for wage index purposes. We also stated that in addition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statutory constraints, we did not believe that it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be feasible or advisable to attempt to implement ProPAC's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendation in FY 1994. Although we acknowledged that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC's recommendation might have promise, we indicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that careful analysis of the impact of such a proposal on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals was necessary before proposing to adopt such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant change. In addition, we stated there were also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a number of administrative issues that must be carefully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered before ProPAC's proposal could be implemented,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the possible development of an exceptions or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeals process to resolve disputes concerning the labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market areas. We agreed with ProPAC that if we adopted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital-specific labor market areas using its methodology,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the MGCRB as it is currently constituted might no longer be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary. We also stated that we would not recommend that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress repeal the MGCRB provisions of the Act until we had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzed fully the implications of adopting hospital-specific labor market areas or some other revisions to labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market areas. We noted that after our analysis was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete, we would decide whether to recommend that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mission of the MGCRB be altered to make it responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolving disputes concerning hospital-specific labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To facilitate a thorough analysis of ProPAC's proposal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we published in the FY 1994 proposed rule hospital-specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage index values using ProPAC's data on hospital locations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the new FY 1990 hospital wage data (58 FR 30457). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tables indicated what each hospital's wage index value would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be if the wage index were based on the wage data for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital and its 10 nearest neighbors up to a radius of 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air miles. The tables also showed which hospitals were in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each hospital's labor market area based on ProPAC's data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base. Subsequently, we discovered a technical error in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage index values and republished a revised wage index value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for each hospital in a correction notice (June 29, 1993, 58  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FR 34742).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

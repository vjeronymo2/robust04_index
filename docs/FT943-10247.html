			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Milosevic blocks traffic to Bosnia Lines of lorries sat on the Bosnian-Serbian border yesterday, in the first sign that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic may be serious about cutting political and economic links with the Bosnian Serbs. The northernmost crossing at Sremska Raca, usually busy with traffic from Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Croatia, had all but seized up yesterday morning. Truck drivers on the Serbian side complained of long delays and a lack of information about the new rules. One man, fuming after 18 hours at the border, was carrying a cargo of used school textbooks donated by the Serbian Red Cross. The books were destined for refugees in Serb-held north-western Bosnia. 'The west's goal is to pit Serb against Serb,' he said of the announcement that Belgrade intended to impose its own sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs. 'And Milosevic fell for it.' The Serbian police refused to give details of the new orders and an air of confusion hung over the hot, dusty crossing. Drivers said loaded trucks were being let out of Bosnia but only empty ones were being let back in. Many of the private cars leaving Bosnia had German and Austrian licence plates, suggesting that those Serbs who had other places to go to were leaving while they could. Further south, at Zvornik, Bosnian Serb police reported less traffic crossing the river but expressed some of the same defiance that has typified the recent proceedings of the Bosnian Serb assembly in Pale. The Yugoslav Serbs 'were never our friends anyway,' said one officer. 'But we have our state and we don't need them.' There were other signs of the clampdown yesterday but officials avoided being drawn on the details. In Belgrade, radio and television reports rarely mentioned the border closing or the cut telephone lines. Mr Milosevic seems more eager to convince the west - and less keen to risk his domestic standing by openly isolating Serbs in Bosnia. The Serbian president made similar threats last year, when the Bosnian Serb self-declared parliament flouted the Vance-Owen peace plan. But the UN was not permitted to monitor the 48 border crossings, and aid continued to flow across the historic River Drina. This time, the test will be whether monitors will be allowed on the ground and whether arms and, as important, oil does not get across. 'The key thing is to see how serious Milosevic is in cutting links,' said Dr Mats Berdal of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. But the Serbs, under intense economic pressure, have less room for manoeuvre than last year and, Belgrade analysts note, Mr Milosevic may be eager to force out the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, and bring in the so-far conspicuously quiet army leader, Mr Ratko Mladic.</p>
